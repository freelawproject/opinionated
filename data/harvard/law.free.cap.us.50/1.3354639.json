It was brought up upon the ground that there was drawn in question the validity of a statute and an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision was against the validity of the said statute or authority; also, that there was drawn in question the construction of a clause of a treaty and of a statute of the United States, and the decision was against the title, right, and privilege specially claimed and set up under such clauses of said treaty and statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b9-13\">As the suit was more analogous to an ejectment than to any other remedy known to the common law, it will be best ex-pl\u00e1ined- by showing the title set up by the respective parties. The first step in the proceedings was the filing of -the following petition, on December 28, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b9-14\">\u201c To the Honorable the District Court of the First District of the State of Louisiana.

Don Ramon de Lopez y Angulo, the Intendant of Louisiana, and a. regular chain, of conveyances from the original grantee down to himself. This .grant covered the land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-12\">The defendant claimed title under the following documents:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-13\">1st. A concession to Louis Cezaire Le Breton, in 1752.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-14\">2d. A concession to Alexandre Latil, -in 1764.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-15\">Upon the trial, the District Court decided that neither pf these concessions included the land in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-16\">The defendant then relied upon a plea of prescription which had- been previously filed, being a plea of prescription of ten, twenty, and thirty years. But the. court overruled the plea for each of these periods of time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-17\">The case was carried by appeal to the Supreme Court. of :the State of Louisiana, where the argument involved the following points, viz.: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-18\">1. That the grant to Guardiola was void, because, after the \u2022 1st of October, 1800,'the date of,the treaty of San Ildefonso, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Spain was ho longer the sovereign of Louisiana, and because the 14th section of the act of Congress passed on the 26th March, 1804,-declared all such grants to be null and void. But the court ov\u00e9rruled these objections to the grant, and also decided that the District Court was right in saying that the two concessions set up by the defendant did not cover the land in dispute, and in saying also that the plea of prescription was not well founded. The Supreme Court therefore affirmed the judgment of the District Court; which was, that the injunction served upon the defendant should be made perpetual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-5\">A rehearing was afterwards granted, on the single question whether Guardiola\u2019s grant was protected by the proviso to the 14th section of the act of Congress of the 26th March, 1804. That section declares, that all grants for lands within the territories ceded by the French Republic to the United States by the treaty of the 30th of April, 1803, the titles whereof were,. at the date of the treaty of San Ildefonso, in the crown, government, or nation of Spain, and every act and proceeding Subsequent thereto, of whatsoever nature, towards the obtaining of any grant, title, of claim to such lands, and under whatsoever authority transacted or pretended, be, and the same are hereby declared to be, and to have been from the beginning, null and void, and of no effect in law or equity; provided, nevertheless, that any thing in this section contained shall not be construed to make null and void any <em>bond fide </em>grant, mad\u00e9 agreeable to the laws, usages, and customs of the Spanish government, to an actual settler on the lands so granted for himself, and his wife and family <em>; </em>of to make null and void any <em>bond fide </em>act or proceeding done by an actual settler, agreeably to the laws, usages, and customs of the Spanish government, to obtain a grant for lands actually settled on by. the person or persons claiming title thereto, if such settlement in either case, was actually made prior to the 20th day of December, 1803,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-6\">After the rehearing, the court decided that the grant to' Guardiola was embraced in the proviso which protects actual settlers before . the cession to the United States, and was also protected by the treaty of cession itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-7\">From this judgment, a writ of error brought the case up to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b13-8\">It was argued by <em>Mr. </em>Brown, on the part of Kenton, the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auxd\">no counsel appearing for the plaintiff in error. This argument was an elaborate examination of the act of Congress, and the.other grounds upon which the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Court of Louisiana rested its judgment; but as the decision of this court was confined to a single view of the case, it is not deemed necessary to insert Mr. Brown\u2019s argument.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b14-5\">Mr. Justice CATRON</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-6\">This case is brought before us by writ of error to the Supreme Court of Louisiana. The suit originated in a petition filed the 28th of December, 1836, by Kenton,- in the First District Court of that State, alleging that the defendant, Pontalba, through her agent, Le Breton, had advertised for sale certain lots of ground in the rear of the city of New Orleans, claiming to own the same, which land the petitioner averred belonged to him, and was, at the time of filing the bill, in his possession, and that it had been in the peaceable and uninterrupted possession of himself and those under whom he derived title for upwards of thirty-five years. The petitioner therefore prayed that the defendant might be restrained from selling or intermeddling with the property in question, and that he might be quieted in his title. I) l answer, the defendant averred that she was the legal owner of the premises, and had been in possession of the same for more than fifty-five years. On the trial of the cause in the District Court, the plaintiff introduced, with other testimony ^ \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b14-7\">1. A concession made by Don Ramon de Lopez y Angulo, with the certificates -of survey, records, &amp;c., dated May 20, 1801,-granting the premises in question to Carlos Guardiola.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-8\">2. An act of sale from Guardiola to Fleitas, conveying the property to the latter, dated June 5, 1805.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-9\">3. A sale of the land from the heirs of Fleitas to the plaintiff, dated May 19, 1835.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-10\">4. He also produced testimony to show that he and those under'whom he claimed had been in possession since the date of the grant to Guardiola in 1801.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-11\">The defendant then introduced in evidence an act of sale from L. C. Le Breton to Madame Dauberville for six arpents and fourteen toises front, dated May 30, 1757, reciting that the vender was the owner of the premises sold, as well as of two arpents front adjoining the same, which he reserved from such sale. She also presented acts of sale made in 1757 and 1758, from Le Breton and from the succession of Dauberville, conveying the whole of the above-mentioned lands to Latil, and a grant made to the- latter by the Spanish .government in 1764. She then exhibited a full Cham of title from Latil to herself, and proved possession of the premises covered by her title papers from 1789.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u25a0 \u25a0 <em>A. </em>decree was made by the District Court in favor of the petitioner, Kenton, and a perpetual injunction awarded in accordance Avith his prayer.. The cause was carried to the Supreme Court on appeal, where the. decree of the inferior court was affirmed. Both courts decided that the premises included in the Spanish grant of 1801, to Guardiola, were not the same as those covered by the acts of sale and grant to Latil.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">Now that this court has no jurisdiction, under the 25th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, to reexamine the decision of a State court, which drew in question the mere fact of where a dividing line between two tracts of land Avas, is too plain for discussion. Had the decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana stopped here, then certainly jurisdiction would be wanting. But that court went further in its first opinion ; and then a rehearing was demanded, after the first decree in favor of Kenfon had been <em>pronounced; </em>and a rehearing &gt;vas granted on the single question whether Guardiola\u2019s grant was protected by the proviso to the 14th section of the act of Congress of March 26,1804.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">That section declares, <em>\u201c </em>that all grants for lands within the territories Ceded by the French Republic to the United States by the treaty of the 30th of April, 1803, the titles whereof Avere, at the date of the .treaty of San Ildefonso, in the crown, government, or nation of Spain, and every act and proceeding subsequent thereto, of whatsoever nature, towards the obtaining of any grant, title, or claim to such lands, and under whatsoever Authority transacted or pretended, be, and the same are hereby declared to be, and to have been from the beginning, null and void, and of no effect in law or equity; provided, nevertheless, that any thing in this section contained shall not be construed. to make null and void any' <em>dona fide </em>grant, made agreeably, to the laAvs, usages, and customs of the Spanish government, to an actual settler on the lands so granted for himself, and his wife and family; or to make null and void any <em>bona fide </em>act or proceeding done by an actual settler, agreeably to the laws, usages, and customs of the Spanish government, to obtain a grant for lands actually settled on by the person or. nersons claiming title thereto, if such settlement in either case as actually made prior to the 20th day of December, 1803,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">And on this proviso of the statute, an opinion was expressed by the court below, which is found in the record, and was as follows: -\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b15-8\">\u201c The proviso above recited contemplates two classes of titles: first, those granted according to the ordinances and usages of the Spanish, government, upon the usual condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of settlement upon the lands so granted- to heads of families, provided such condition was complied with before the cession to the United States; and second, such as were applied for after the settlement was made,' commonly called permission to settle with a <em>requite. </em>In both cases we are to look, in our opinion, to the laws and usages of the Spanish government for the definition of an actual settler, rather than to subsequent acts of -Congress, which provide for preemptions in favor of such persons as shall have settled upon, inhabited, and cultivated a part of the public domain. This proviso recognizes the authority of Spain to make certain grants after the date of the treaty of San Ildefonso, and therefore it cannot be said that Congress had treated this as exclusively a political question, and absolutely decided that the sovereignty was changed at that period. The only doubt is, whether Guardiola can be classed in either of the categories expressed in the act of Congress. He exhibits a title in form to a small tract of land, which was appurtenant to another tract already owned and possessed by him. The Intendant of the province, in the preamble of his patent, states him to be a resident of the .city, and owner of a piece of land on the Bayou road, where he has his dwelling; which property is deficient in depth to graze his cattle upon. It is for these reasons that a small additional \u2022grant is made to hirii. This was done in conformity with the existing ordinances relative to the distribution of the public domain; Guardiola was certainly regarded by the Intendant-as actually settled on the land to which his new grant was but an appendage ; and although the expression used in the opinion of the court first pronounced, that the grant was inhabited and improved, was perhaps not strictly accurate, especially with reference to subsequent acts of Congress defining rights of preemptions, yet substantially we consider the grant to Guardiola as embraced in the proviso which protects actual settlers before the cession to the United States; and we cannot suppose Congress intended by the act in question, or by any subsequent legislation, to .declare null and void those small grants made <em>bond fide </em>according to the usages of the Spanish government to inhabitants of the province, to meet the wants, of a growing population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b16-5\">\u201c Looking upon Guardiola\u2019s grant as one made in good faith, according to the usages and ordinances of the Spanish government, and as having become private property according to those laws and usages, and according to the treaties between France and Spain, and the law of nations, we consider it protected, not merely by the proviso of-the act of Congress first recited, but by the treaty of-cession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b17-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u201cIt is therefore ordered, adjudged, qnd decreed, that the judgment first pronounced remain undisturbed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">By section 909 of the Code of Practice governing the Supreme Court of Louisiana, that court is required to state, the re\u00e1sons for its judgments, by citing as exactly as possible the laws on which it founds, its opinions; and by section 912, a party dissatisfied with the judgment may apply for a rehearing in the cause, by petition. From the petition and opinion, it does appear that a construction of the 14th section of the act of 1804 was drawn in question by the State court; but it does not therefore follow that this court has jurisdiction; the fact is found, that no interference exists between the tracts of land respectively claimed, and with this settled fact we have to deal. It concluded the right against Pontalba; she could not go beyond the boundary established as the true one by that decision. And the next inquiry is, whether she can be heard in this court, to call in question a construction of the act <em>of </em>1804, which did not touch her paper title, nor affect her right in any degree. The State court held that Kenton\u2019s title' was valid, and sanctioned by the proviso to the 14th section of the act; the decision, therefore, so far as he was1 concerned, was not opposed, but in conformity, to the right claimed under the statute ; and the defendant below, Pontalba, having no opposing title to .the land in dispute, could not be injured by the opinion expressed on Kenton\u2019s title. The only \u25a0 .plausible ground on which jurisdiction could be claimed arises from the mode of proceeding in the State courts. The action was brought by Kenton for slander of title, and to prevent a public sale of land then in his actual possession, and which had been so for thirty-five years next previous. The defendant, Pontalba, denied that Kenton had any title, and set up title in herself to the land claimed by Kenton in his petition ; and by her answer and petition, in reconvention asked an affirmative decree in her favor for damages ; thus becoming a plaintiff likewise. This is an ordinary mode of trying \u2022 title in Louisiana. Issue being joined, on the right, arid this adjudged to be in Kenton, the court gave a decree in his favor, and awarded a perpetual, injunction against Pontalba, restraining her from selling the land. The injunction was a mere incident to a final adjudication establishing a right to real property; the decree .carried, with it (as against the opposing party) conclusive force, to which nothing could be added by the award of an injunction ; it was intended to prevent any further illegal intermeddling by the other party, arid was rather in execution of the decree than a substantial part of it. The awarding such writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>cannot, therefore, be relied on as a circumstance giving this court jurisdiction; and being of opinion that on no ground presented by the record can this cause be entertained, we accordingly order that it be dismissed;</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana for the Eastern District, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that this cause be, and tho same is hereby, dismissed for the want <em>of </em>jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
