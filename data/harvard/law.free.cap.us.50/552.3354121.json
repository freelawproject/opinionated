Alexander, that he. is well acquainted with the defendant, being connected with him by marriage, and knows the defendant moved from Nottingham in the slimmer of 1839; that he first went to the city of Annapolis, distant about thirty miles from Nottingham, proposing, that he should - remain there .until he had found a place of permanent settlement, and that, having purchased a farm on West River, he took up his residence there towards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the pnd of 1839 ; that said witness had frequently been at the residence of defendant* oh West River, and, from his (witness\u2019s) knowledge of the surrounding country, would have been prepared to affirm that \u201cWest River\u201d post-office was the post-office of defendant <em>;\u25a0 </em>and, moreover, that he has accompanied the defendant to the said' named post-office for his (defendant\u2019s) letters, and has frequently, prior to the making and indorsement of the bill on which this action is founded, been informed by said defendant that\u2019his post-office was \u201c West River \u201d ; that \u201c West River\u201d post-office is within two miles of the residence of the defendant, and\u2019Nottingham is distant from said residence at least twelve miles; and on cross-examination, the said witness stated that defendant had relations residing in and about Nottingham, and witness was satisfied, from statements of defendant and othefs, that defendant had visited said relations frequently since his removal in 1839, and that witness Lad seen him on several occasions with said relations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\">And defendant likewise proved, by John R. Magruder, junior, one of the acceptors, that he is well acquainted with the defendant, being his relation; and that John R. Magruder, senior,, was at one time, the commission agent of defendant; that shortly after the 23d of July, 1846, (he is confident within a fortnight, and he believes that it was within a week, thereafter,) the plaintiff, Lambert, called at the counting-house of John R. Magruder &amp; Son, the acceptors, and then and there inquired of the witness where the defendant\u2019s post-office was; the said witness answered, he believed it was West River, but was not certain, as John R. Magruder &amp; Son were not at that time the agents of the defendant, and that he would go out and inquire of Bat.tee &amp; Sons, the defendant\u2019s agents at that time; that witness- accordingly went out, and being informed by Battee &amp; Sons that West River was defendant\u2019s post-office, he returned' and communicated that fact to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\">The drawer of the bill of exchange, upon which the present suit was. brought, it was in proof, resided near Nottingham, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, and that the drawers and acceptors resided in the city of Baltimore, and the.defendant at West River, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and there was at this time a daily mail between Baltimore and Alexandria.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-7\">Upon the testimony above stated, the question occurred whether due diligence had been used by the plaintiffs, the holders of the bill, to give to the defendant, the indorser thereof, notice of the dishonor of said bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-8\">Upon, which question the opinions of the judges being op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>posed, the point, upon the request of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, is hereby- certified to the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-4\">R. B. Taney,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-5\">U. S. Heath.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-6\">Upon this certificate, the cause came up to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-7\">It was argued by <em>Mr. May, </em>for the .plaintiffs, and <em>Mr. Meredith, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-8\"><em>Mr. May </em>contended, that from the evidence it was apparent that the. plaintiffs used due and reasonable diligence to transmit the notice to the supposed post-office of the defendant, and the following authorities will be relied on, viz. Harris <em>v. </em>Robinson, 4 Howard, 345; Story on Promissory Notes, \u00a7 316; Chitty on Bills, 453; 1 Barn. &amp; Cress. 245.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-9\">Supposing, then, that the plaintiffs used due diligence when they sent the notice, it is immaterial whether it was received. Story on Promissory Notes, \u00a7 328.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-10\">Nor could the evidence in this record; that, some weeks after this notice was sent, the plaintiffs were informed of the\u2019 proper office to which it ought to haye been sent, have any influence on this question, . because the right of action,, once vested by-reason of the transmisson of the notice after due diligence at that time, could not be divested by subsequent laches, nor do the cases require the transmission of a second notice when the first was sent after due diligence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-11\"><em>Mr. Meredith, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A183\">contended, \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-12\">1st. That, upon the evidence, the plaintiffs did not use due diligence to discover the residence of the defendant, at the time the bill was protested, and before they sent notice of the protest addressed to the defendant at Nottingham, Maryland.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-13\">2d. That having, as was.proved, ascertained within a week or a fortnight after .the-said bill fell due. and was protested, that the defendant did noCreside at Nottingham, but that he resided oil West River, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and that West River post-office was the post-office at which, the defendant received his letters, the plaintiffs ought then to have given notice to the defendant of the dishonor of said bill, by sending the same, addressed to him \u00e1t West River post-office, or otherwise ; and there being no evidence that, they gave such notice, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-14\">Upon the. first point the following references were made: Chitty on Bills (10th American from 9th London edition), 452, 453, 454, and notes; Story on Promissory.

The sufficiency of the notice is therefore a question of law. And it is of the first importance to the commercial community, that the rules which regulate the rights and liabilities of parties to negotiable instruments in courts of justice should be plain and certain, and conform to the established usages of trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">\u201e Two objections have been taken to the sufficiency of the notice in this case. 1st. That due diligence was not used by the holder to \u00e1scertain the residence of the indorser before the notice was sent to Nottingham. And 2d. If re\u00e1son\u00e1ble diligence was used at that time, yet the information he afterwards received-in Baltimore imposed on him the obligation of giving a-' further notice to the defendant himself, or of sending itby\\ mail to his nearest and usual post-office.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">As regards the first question, the court is \u00f3f opinion that due diligence was used before the notice was sent to Nottingham. The case shows that there was very little, if any, trade between Alexandria and Nottingham at the time of this transaction, and but- few persons, therefore, in Alexandria would be likely to know whether the defendant did or did not.reside in Nottingham. The bill of exchange was not .dated at any particular place, and the. acceptors resid\u00e9d in Baltimore. The defendant was not engaged in. trade, but was' a physician residing in the country, and it does not appear that he was in the practice pf visr iting Alexandria, or of; having any business transactions there. And the proof is, that Travers, of whom the holder inquired,\u00bb from' the-nature of the trade in which he had been many years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>engaged, \u2014 first to Nottingham and afterwards to Baltimore, \u2014 was as likely as any other person in Alexandria to give the information which the plaintiffs were seeking to obtain, if not more so. The answer he received was direct and positive, both as to the knowledge of Travers and the residence of the indorser, and he had a right to rely upon it. And although Travers was mistaken, and the notice was not sent to the nearest or usual post-office of the defendant, y\u00e9t the plaintiffs used all the diligence which the law requires, and had sufficient reason to believe that the notice would be received. The liability of the indorser was therefore fixed. The case of Harris <em>v. </em>Robinson, 4 Howard, 345, is conclusive on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The second objection taken in the argument has not been so directly settled by judicial decision on the point, but is, we think, equally clear upon established principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We have already said, that the liability of the indorser was fixed by the notice sent to Nottingham. The plaintiffs had acquired \u00e1 right of action against him by this notice, and might have brought their suit the next day. Could that\u2019 right be divested by the information .which was subsequently given to them ? We think not, and that all of the cases in relation to this subject imply the contrary. The books are full of cases where mistakes of this kind have been committed, and suits afterwards brought when the residence of .the party was discovered. Yet it does not seem to have been supposed in any of them that a second notice was necessary, nor are we' aware that such a point has ever been raised. Yet if a notice thus given, after diligent inquiry, is not equivalent to actual notice, knowledge subsequently obtained would be a defence to the,action, even if the holder had brought suit before he learned what was the nearest or usual post-office of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The case of Firth <em>v. </em>Thrush, 8 Barn. &amp; Cress. 387, which was much relied on in the argument, depended, upon different principles. In that case, the holder knew that notice had not been given to- the indorser. He had been engaged in making inquiries for his residence, without being ableito obtain any information upon which he might have acted. Arid the question there was not whether a second notice should be given, but whether due diligence was used' in sending the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The rule contended for by the defendant would produce much uncertainty and difficulty in transactions of this kind. .For if a second notice must be given, is it to be required in all cases where there has been an error in the information as to the defendant\u2019s, post-office ? Certainly the practice of the courts has been otherwise. And if it is not to be required in all cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>it would be impossible to , fix any certain limits as to time or circumstances. The subsequent information might come to him casually, when his mind was occupied with other engagements ; he might not confide in it as much as in that which he had before received; it might come to him in a few days, or months might elapse before he obtained it. The rule would be lo\u00f3se and uncertain in its application, and constantly lead to litigation, where the residence of the indorser was unknown, or an error committed as to his usual post-office; It would also be contrary, the court think, to the usages of commerce, and to the uniform practice-in courts of justice. In the case of Harris <em>v. </em>Robinson, before referred to, no second notice was given; nor did the court intimate that any was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The law does not require actual notice. It requires reasonable diligence only, and reasonable efforts, made in good faith, to give it. And if sufficient inquiries have been molde, and information received upon which the holder has a right to rely, a mistake as to the nearest post-office or usual post-office does' not deprive him of his remedy. He has done all that the law requires ; and the notice thus sent fixes the liability of the indorser as effectually as if he had actually received it. This we think is the true rule, and the only one that can give certainty and security in transactions in commercial paper, .</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We shall therefore certify, that reasonable diligence was used by the plaintiffs to give the defendant notice of the dishonor of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">This cause Came on to be heard on the transcript of the record fro/n the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maryland, and on the- point or question on which the judges of the said Circuit Court were opposed in .opinion, and which was certified to this court for its opinion, agreeably to the act of Congress in such- .case made and provided, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is* the opinion of this court,, that, upon the facts in this case, due diligence had been used by the plaintiffs, the holders of the bill, to give to the defendant, the indorser thereof, notice of the dishonor of said bill. Whereupon, it is now here ordered and adjudged byjhis court, that it. be so certified to the said Circuit Court. ^</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
