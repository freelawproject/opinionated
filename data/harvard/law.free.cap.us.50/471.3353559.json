That shortly afterwards, Curtis Lewis recovered the possession under a forcible entry and detainer proceeding, and remained in .possession for several years, during which he and Forbes &amp; Co. were engaged in a lawsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">The whole matter was terminated by the purchase, in 1829, by Henry. Hitchcock, of the title of Forbes &amp; Co., of Curtis Lewis, and of the Mayor and Aldermen of Mobile. Henry Hitchcock remained in the possession of the property till 1835, when he sold to the defendant for $ 28,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\">The defendant produced the original Spanish grant and the English copy thereof, for the premises in dispute, with the certificate of confirmation, and produced the conveyances aforesaid, showing the title under which he claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-8\"><em>He </em>proved that Panton, Leslie, &amp;\u2022 Co., and Forbes &amp; Co., have had possession of the lot specified in their grant from its date ;\u25a0 that they fulfilled the conditions which are specified therein; that to the east of the present site of Water Street, they'had a canal extending into the river, through which their boats came up; that there was an embankment on both sides of this canal, on which their goods were landed, and from which their shipments were .made. The fillings up done by Lewis were done by sinking flat-boats in this canal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">The particular lots now sued' for lie south of the canal and-embankment aforesaid, and are between the king\u2019s old wharf and Forbes\u2019s canal; they lie to the east of Water Street, and fall within the lines laid down in the patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The particular land in this writ was never improved until Curtis Lewis made the fillings up. It was further in proof, that previous to 1819, then, and until filled up, the lots claimed by plaintiff were at ordinary high tides covered with water, and mainly so at all stages of water; that the ordinary high tide at that time, flowing from the east, reached to about the middle of what is now Water Street. That in the Spanish times the eastern part of the lots to the west of Water Street was subject to be covered by water at ordinary tides by a flow of water from the river. That what is Water Street at this time was a natural ridge, which was not usually overflowed except at high tides ; but there was a'depression to the north of the lot of defendant, across which it flowed around upon the eastern parts of the lots lying to the west of the lots sued for. This ridge was about fifteen feet wide; Water Street was laid out in 1820, and is-sixty feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">That no one had possession of the premises in question before 1826, except as before stated.

This obligation the plaintiff contends is tp be con-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>sidered as a contract with the persons holditig, these <em>grants; </em>and no legislation of the United States, without the consent of such persons, can impair this obligation, or excuse the performance of the duties it clearly imposes. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3P\">\u201c From this .statement of the case, the first question that naturally presents itself is, What was the character of the interest the United States had in the premises in 1836, or had they any interest at that time in the soil ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-6\">\u201c In March, 1819, Congress passed an act to enable the people of Alabama Territory to form a constitution and State government, and . for the admission of such State into the Union on. an equal footing with the original States. That act declares that all navigable waters within the said State shall for ever remain public highways, free to the citizens of said State and the United States. What is the footing on .which the original States stand in regard to the shores of their navigable rivers, and. the soil covered by them ? That footing is certainly the perfect and absolute control of the shores of those rivers in the respective States, except so fat as the United States government may find it necessary to use them in the legitimate exercise of its constitutional rights. For the purpose of enabling itself to do this, so far as Alabama is concerned, it has not thought proper to assert any rights of ownership in the shore, but has rather relinquished the idea of such ownership in itself, and recognized it in the State, by stipulating for a free use of said shores by the citizens of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-7\">\u201c What has been said is based upon the assumption that, by the treaty with Spain, the United States acquired the same property in the shores of navigable rivers that Spain had, and that they had, by the.act of 1819, transferred the rights acquired Udder the treaty to the State of Alabama, reserving only the easement of navigation to the citizens of the United States. The question, then arises, Could the United States, in contravention of the obligation they had incurred under the Spanish treaty, ratify and confirm these Spanish grants?'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-8\">\u201cIf Spain could have granted the shores'of navigable rivers, and the same power that Spain had had been conferred upon the United States by the treaty of 1819, and in pursuance of that treaty, and the pledges therein given; the United States had confirmed this grant prior to the admission of Alabama into the Union, there can be no doubt that the plaintiff\u2019s title would have been valid; but this was not done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-9\">\u201c Before it is done, the United States place themselves in a position where they cannot do it. Whether they ought to have placed themselves in that position, or what are the conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>quences of this act, so far as the Spanish government is concerned, or the inviolability of the treaty between the two nations, it is needless now to inquire. If wrong has been done, the law of nations indicates the remedy. We must look at things as they are, and so viewing, the court is impelled to the conclusion-, that if, at the time of the admission of the State of Alabama into the Union, the land described in plaintiff\u2019s declaration was-below ordinary high-water mark, there was no interest in the same' in the United States in 1836, and that the act of confirmation, and the patent in pursuance thereof, could not aid plaintiff\u2019s title, and thaf the same is invalid and unsound.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-5\">To. which charge the plaintiff excepts, and prays the court to sign, seal, and certify this bill of exceptions, which is done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">Under these instructions, the jury found a verdict for the defendant, and, the case being carried to the Supr.eme Court of Alabama, -that court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-7\">A writ of error then brought the case up to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-8\">It was argued by <em>Mr. Phillips </em>and <em>Mr. Coze, </em>for the plaintiffs' in error, and <em>Mr. Campbell, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-9\">It is not thought necessary to insert those parts of the arguments of counsel relative to the effect of the admission of Alabama into the Union upon the subsequent power of Congress to grant land between high and low water mark upon navigable. rivers. The court, in its opinion, considers that point as settled in the case of Pollard <em>v. </em>Hagan, 3 Howard, 212. The counsel for the plaintiff in error, however, drew a distinction between that case and the present, as follows.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-10\">The case as now presented, however, differs materially from the case of Pollard v.-Hagan, in. 3 Howard. The Spanish concession was not then before the court, and the acts and patent relied upon were all subsequent to the dat\u00e9 of admission..</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-11\">The concession to Pollard, made while Spain -was in the undisturbed possession-of the territory, by every principle, either-of national or municipal law, gave him a claim of title upon this government, which it was bound in good faith to perfect. It is true that, if the political departments refused to .discharge their obligation, the courts of justice could not enforce it; but the want of this sanction in no wise impaired its obligatory force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-12\">Having by the treaty with France, in 1803, acquired, our titled and by the treaty with Spain, in 1819, termed on its face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>a treaty of cession, confirmed our possession to this territory, treaty stipulations and the law. of nations arose to control the action of the government as strongly as if the duties were imposed by constitutional provision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">The annexation of .this acquisition to the Mississippi Territory by the act of 1812 did not obstruct the exercise of those high duties, nor did the' authority given by Congress that the State of Alabama might be carved out of it produce this' consequence. The people of that State would have spurned an advantage, founded upon a violation of national faith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">That Pollard\u2019s title was \u2018the subject of a confirmation by Congress is expressly ruled, when this case was first presented, in 14 Peters, the court there citing the decision of Judge Marsh\u00e1ll in D\u00e9 la Croix <em>v.' </em>Chamberlain, \u201cthat the United States had never, as far as we can discover, distinguished between the concessions of land made by the Spanish authorities within the disputed territory, while Spain was in actual possession, from concessions of a similar character made by Spain within the acknowledged limits.\u201d The court, therefore, concluded that Pollard\u2019s claim was within the exception of the act of 1824, reserving all cases where the Spanish' government had made a \u201c new grant \u201d during the time at which they had the- \u201c power \u201d to grant the same (p. 364).</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">All the circumstances constituting the history of the times justify the declaration that, in the admission of the State, neither of the contracting parties understood that the political obligations resting upon this government, as the successor of Spain, to perfect the titles of individuals acquired in good faith under Spanish dominion, were at \u2022 all. impaired ; the more especially as it is not pretended that their fulfilment would in any manner work an injury to any public or private interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-8\">That the proprietorship of the soil between high and low tide belongs to the public, and may be acquired by individuals either by grant or prescription, is a doctrine of the common law, taught by Sir Matthew Hale in his treatise De Jure Maris (1 Hargrave\u2019s Law Tracts, p. 37), citing Bracton, who, in turn, quotes the Roman civil law from Justinian\u2019s Digest. Constable\u2019s case, 3 Co. 105, 107. There being but this distinctipn between the common and civil law, that the former confines this right to the \u201c sea-shore, arms of the sea, bays, and rivers . where the tide ebbs and flows,\u201d while the. latter extends tlie right to include all \u201c navigable rivers.\u201d Ingraham <em>v. </em>Wilkinson, 4 Pick. 273.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-9\">\u2022The. government, therefore, had the right to grant to Pollard the fee of the soil, subject only to the restraints imposed by the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>public interest and convenience. Blundel <em>v. </em>Collvel, 5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 267; Browne <em>v. </em>Kennedy, 5 Har. &amp; Johns. 195, Hagan <em>v. </em>Campbell, 8 Port. 9; Mayor <em>v. </em>Eslava, 9 Port. 596.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">The counsel for the defendant in error noticed this subject in his third and sixth points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">3. The decisions of this court reported in 3 Howard, 212, and 16 Peters, 367, are directly against the right of the United States to grant the shore after the admission of Alabama into the Union. Such being the law upon this question, the only-inquiry is, whether the production of an incomplete Spanish title (a mere permit to occupy) can change the result. This court has repeatedly decided that such a paper can give the party no standing in the court, no matter when it was executed. 12 Wheaton, 599; 4 Howard, 449.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-7\">This court has also decided, that a complete grant bearing date at the time this does (1809) can give the party no right to be heard in the courts of the United States. Foster <em>v. </em>Neilson, 2 Peters, 253; 12 Peters, 511.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">The party cannot, then, rest upon his Spanish title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-9\">6. The opinion of the Supreme Court, reported in 3 Howard, 212, was very deliberately given. A motion for a rehearing was refused. The opinion comprehends within its principle property to a very large amount, and possessions and contracts have been made with respect to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-10\">In the State of Alabama, the Supreme Court has repeatedly acted in accordance with it, and has regarded it as the settled law of the land.' An opinion so given, entering so far into the law of property of the country, cannot be questioned without producing great confusion. 8 Ala. 909, 930 ; 7 Ala. 883.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-11\">Mr. Chief Justice TANEY</author>\n<p id=\"AmV\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">This is an action of ejectment brought by the plaintiff in error to recover a lot of ground in the town of Mobile, in the State of Alabama. . The plaintiff claimed title under an inchoate Spanish grant, dated, December 12, 1809, and'an act of Congress confirming this title, passed July 2, 1836, and a patent from the United States, dated March 15, 1837, which issued in pursuance of the act of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">The validity of this title was disputed by the defendant, upon the ground that the premises were a part of the shore of a navigable tide-water river, lying below high-water mark, when the State of Alabama, was admitted into the Union in 1819; and that therefore, at the time of the passage of the act of Congress, the sovereignty and dominion over the place in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>tion were in the State, and not in. the United States. And the court instructed the jury, that, if the land described in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration was below ordinary high-water mark at the time Alabama was admitted into the Union,-the confirming act of Congress and the patent conveyed no title to the patentee.</p>\n<p id=\"AJm\">The question decided in the State court cannot be regarded as an open one. The same question upon the same act of Congress and patent was brought before this court in the case of Pollard <em>v. </em>Hagan, at January term, 1845, reported in 3 Howard, 212. That case was fully and deliberately considered, as will appear by the report, and the court then decided that the act of Congress and patent conveyed no title. The decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama, from which this case has been brought .by writ of error, conforms to the opinion of this court in the case of Pollard <em>v. </em>Hagan. And it must be a very strong case indeed, and one where mistake and error had been evidently committed, to justify this court, after the lapse of five years, in reversing its own decision; thereby destroying rights of property which' may have been purchased and paid for in the mean time, upon the faith and confidence reposed in the judgment \u25a0 of this court. But, upon a review of the case, we see no reason for doubting its correctness, and are entirely satisfied with the judgment then pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"AVn\">It has been supposed, in the argument for the plaintiff, that the proceedings in. Congress upon the report of the commissioners in relation to the title claimed under the Spanish authorities, which have now been referred to, distinguish this case from that of Pollard <em>v. </em>Hagan. But this Spanish title wgs acquired in 1809, and it has been repeatedly decided that a Spanish grant in this territory, whether inchoate or complete, made after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, in 1800, did not convey any right in the soil to the grantee. And this subject was again considered and decided, after careful research and examination, at the present term, in the case of Reynes <em>v. </em>United States, arid the former decisions reaffirmed. Undoubtedly, Congress might have granted this land to the patentee, or confirmed his Spanish grant, before Alabama became a State. But. this was not done. And the existence of this imperfect and inoperative Spanish' grant could not enlarge the power of the United States over the place in question after Alabama became a State, nor authorize the general government to grant or confirm a title to land when the Sovereignty and dominion over it had become vested in the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The. judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Supreme Court of the State of Alabama, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Supreme Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
