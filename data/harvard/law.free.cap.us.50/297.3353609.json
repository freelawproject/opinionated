G. Humphreys, personally, on the 14th day of October, 1839,\u201d this is absolutely untrue ; that he can prove that the return was so made,, at the instance of Bland, who wished the fact of the suit to be kept a secret from him, Humphreys; and that he never employed counsel, and never authorized any person to enter an appearance for him. He, therefore, prayed for an injunction to restrain proceedings at law under' the judgment; .and, upon final hearing, that the injunction might be made perpetual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\">On the 8th of July, 1845, Humphreys gave bond in the sum of $&gt; 12,880.12, and the injunction issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-7\">On the 11th of November, 1845, Leggett, Smith, and Lawrence filed a general demurrer to the bill, as exhibiting no case for equitable relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-8\">On the 17th of November, 1846, judgment was given on the. demurrer against the complainant, Humphreys, and a decree entered dismissing his bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-9\">On the same day, the appeal was prayed for, and allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-10\">The cause was argued by <em>Mr. Gilpin, </em>for the appellant, and <em>Mr. Jones, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-11\"><em>Mr. Gilpin, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADM\">contended that this decree was erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-12\">It appears by the foregoing statement of th.e facts, that, on the 16th of July, 1840, Humphreys paid, under executions issued upon judgments obtained against' him. on this bond, the whole penalty thereof. If, therefore, the present appellees are not restrained from proceeding to execution against him, upon the judgment they have subsequently obtained on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>bond, he will be compelled to pay the penalty thereof a second time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-5\">The questions, therefore, to be considered, are, whether he was legally bound to pay under the executions issued against him on the 16th of July, 1840; whether, notwithstanding such \u25a0payment, the appellees can compel him also to pay the amount of the judgment they have obtained ; and whether he is entitled to the protection of a court of equity, against such compulsory payment, in the manner prayed for in his bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">I. The appellant, Humphreys, was compelled by law to pay the whole amount of the penalty of his bond; it was done by the sale, under execution, of his property, real and personal,\u2014 even his household furniture; he could not delay the payment even by giving security. The law of Mississippi, under which his bond was given, and by the provisions of which law his liability as security of the sheriff is regulated, compelled the payment under the judgments obtained by the Planters\u2019 Bank of Mississippi, on the 20th and 25th of May, 1840, and the executions issued thereon, amounting to more than $15,000, the penalty of the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARB\">\u201c If any sheriff, under-sheriff, coroner, or other officer, shall collect, by virtue of an execution or executions, a part or the whole amount of money due by such execution or executions, such sheriff, under-sheriff, coroner, or other officer, shall,' immediately after the Collection of any such sum or sums of money, pay the same over .to the plaintiff in the execution, or his attorney, provided that the plaintiff or his attorney shall demand the same; and on failure to pay the same at the time of demand made, such sheriff, under-sheriff, coroner, or other officer, his and their sureties, shall be liable to pay to the plaintiff in the execution the whole amount of money so collected, together with twenty-five per cent, damages thereon, with interest at the rate of eight per cent, per annum ; to be recovered by motion before the court to which such execution is made returnable, after reasonable notice to such sheriff or other officer of such motion ; and the clerk of the court before which such motion is made shall indorse op-the execution issuing on the.judgment against such sheriff, coroner, .or other officer, and their securities, that \u2018 no security of any kind shall be taken.\u2019 Provided always, that if any sheriff shall have more executions than one in his hands, and shall have failed to make a sufficiency of-money to satisfy the whole amount of the several executions, and shall file an affidavit-of the fact with the clerk of the Circuit Court of the proper County, such sheriff shall hot be liable to the penalties hereby prescribed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201c All sheriffs shall be liable, in the manner above prescribed, for moneys collected by their deputies on executions, whether the same shall have come to the hands of the sheriff or not.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-5\">\u201c If any sheriff, coroner, or other officer, shall fail to return any execution to him or them directed, on the return day thereof, the plaintiff in the execution may recover judgment against such sheriff, coroner, or other officer, and his and their sureties, for the amount of such,executions, with five per cent, damages; by motion before the court to which execution is returnable, with eight per cent, interest on the same until paid ; and the clerk shall indorse on the execution issuing on such judgment, that no security is to be taken. Provided that, after any sheriff, coroner, or other officer shall have paid the amount of money and damages received as aforesaid, then the original execution shall be vested in such sheriff, coroner, or other officer, for his or their benefit; and provided, also, that nothing in this section contained shall be so construed as to affect the remedy already existing against sheriffs, or other officers, for failing to return executions.\u201d Howard &amp; Hutchinson\u2019s Miss.

They are not (even if their judgment in this action werea legal and .perfect judgment, which it is not), because the pen-, alty. of the bond has already been paid, and the obligation of Humphreys is discharged; because the Planters\u2019 Bank, being the first execution creditors, were entitled to be first paid ; and because it was the neglect of the appellees themselves, not to proceed in the same summary manner to recover their debt,.as they were enabled to do by the law of Mississippi.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-5\">1.

It -was-not possible for the appellant, Humphreys, to avoid the payment under the execution of the Planters\u2019 Bank; no security pr stay of any kind was allowed; if th\u00e9 appellees, as plaintiffs and judgment creditors, had acquired rights, they were rights to be enforced against the fund made by the execution, or as a prior lien on the property levied on; if their suit or judgment gave them priority,- it could not prevent the l\u00e9vy and sale, under this execution, but must look for its enforcement to the property sold, the money made, or the officer who wrongfully appropriated it; the obligation of the surety, Humphreys, was not the less discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-10\">By the statutes of Mississippi, a judgment is a lien on all the defendant\u2019s property; personal as well as real, from the time it is entered. \u201c In all cases, the property of the defendant shall be bound and liable to any judgment that may be entered up, from the time of entering such judgment-.\u201d Howard &amp; Hutch.

But if this were not so, \u2014 if the appellant, Humphreys, would be liable to an execution on such a judgment, legally recovered against him as a surety on this bond, \u2014 still, in this case, the appellees, as judgment creditors, are not entitled to it, because the judgment they have entered against Humphreys, if even it be not illegal in form and substance, was without any notice to him, was obtained by fraud practised against him, and is altogether such a proceeding as a court of equity will protect an innocent party from the consequences of, if sought to be carried into operation against him, by the forms of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-6\">1. So far as appears by the record, it is a general judgment entered in the Circuit Court against Humphreys for the sum \u00f3f <em>$ </em>6,355.33, founded on the mandate of the Supreme Court, which merely reversed the previous judgment of the Circuit Court rendered on demurrer, and in favor of the defendant. All for which the appellees, being plaintiffs in that suit, were entitled to judgment, was the amount of damages they had sustained; and that amount should appear to be ascertained in due course of law. This the record nowhere exhibits ; it exhibits merely a <em>ca. sa. </em>against McNider, reciting a judgment-held by the appellees against him for ,f 3,910.78. That such a judgment cannot sustain an execution, is a proposition too well settled to require argument or authority for its support. Besides, it is clearly established by the statutes of Mississippi, under which the liability of the appellant, Humphreys, accrues, and by the provisions of which its extent-is to be ascertained. <em>'</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-7\">If the plaintiff in any suit or action shall demur to the plea of the defendant, and the demurrer be sustained on joinder and argument, the judgment of the court shall be <em>respondeat ouster ; </em>but in such case the defendant shall be compelled to plead to the merits of the suit or action, and the plaintiff shall not thereby be delayed of-his trial.\u201d Howard &amp; Hutch.

Under a judgment so obtained, no execution can legally issue against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-7\">Personal notice to the defendant is indispensable to sustain the validity of \u00e1 judgment, and to authorize subsequent proceedings under it.

Because the appellant, from conclusive evidence of his own showing, appears to have lost the benefit of his defence, if he ever had one that was available at law, by his own fault and negligence, continued down to the time of the rendition of the judgment against him in this court (2 How. 28), and during all the residue of that term, when he might, if he could have shown any ground of defence at once available and just, have moved the court to remand the cause, with instructions to permit him to plead <em>de </em>novo, as was done in Lloyd <em>v. </em>Scott, 4 Peters, 231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-11\">2d.

Because he never had any available defence at law; such as he pretends being inadmissible either at law or equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-13\">This court has gone far to systematize the rules which should limit the interference of equity to restrain parties from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>using and enforcing judgments at law, upon the ground of having failed to avail themselves of some legal defence; a branch of equity jurisprudence about which rather. loose notions had prevailed, and no consistent course of procedure had been, followed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\">The concurrence and the clear proof of the following circumstances are held indispensable: \u2014 1st. That the party seeking such relief really had a defence that was at once just in itself, and available at law. 2d. That he lost the advantage of it by accident, surprise, or fraud, unmixed with any fault or negligence in himself or his agents. 3d. That the circumstances of such accident, surprise, or fraud affected the opposite party so far as to make it obviously against conscience for him .to use and enforce his judgment. Mar. Ins.

That there is' nothing in all this to make it against conscience for the appellees to execute their judgment: if the appellant has been wronged by this misdemeanour in office, and innocent of all privity to it, it was no less a fraud upon the appellees and upon the law; and the appellees, certainly, were no less innocent of all privity. The equities being equal, a court of equity cannot shift the burden from the one to the other; but must leave each undisturbed in his legal rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-9\">2d. But, in truth, the appellant was, in no sort, injured by the alleged collusion and fraud between Bland and the sheriff; every defence that the nature of the case admitted was taken, and urged with all practicable effect. .As to the defence, of the loss of which alone he complains,, it . was no defence to that action ;. but belonged to the other suits on the same bond in the Circuit Court of Claiborne County. So, if the. misdemeanour of the sheriff laid any foundation for relief in equity, it was against the judgments recovered in that court, not against the judgment recovered by the appellees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-10\">3d. That the sheriff\u2019s return is absolutely conclusive.on the parties to the suit; .and, as between them, the truth of it cannot be drawn in question in any form of procedure at law or equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-11\">This is the very first case, we believe, in which it was ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>attempted by bill in equity; but in the courts of law it has been frequently tried in every form admissible in the practice of those courts, \u2014 by way of averment in pleading, \u2014 by way of motion to set aside on affidavits of fraud and falsehood; and the invariable answer of the English courts, from the days of Queen Elizabeth to the days of Queen Victoria, has been, that the return is conclusive between the parties to the suit, neither traversable in pleading, nor liable to contradiction by a motion to set it aside, or in any other form of procedure,.but an action against the sheriff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-5\">All the reasons that, forbid any question of the truth of the return in the courts of law, equally forbid it in the courts of equity. In fact, the equitable discretion exercised by courts of law in the modern practice of motions would be quite competent to administer relief, if the case were relievable on the principles of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">The decisions of the courts of law are therefore conclusive against relief in the courts of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">The sheriff\u2019s return of <em>rescous </em>on mesne process is conclusive against the party charged, \u2014 equivalent to a <em>conviction; </em>he -is not put upon interrogatories, because he cannot traverse the return, and the fine is summarily imposed. Rex <em>v. </em>Elkins, 4 Burr. 2129; Rex <em>v. </em>Pember, Cas. Temp. Hardw. 112. So, on <em>sci. fa. </em>against terre-tenants, the return of <em>sci. feci.- </em>A.

Justice GRIER</author>\n<p id=\"AvY\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The appellant, Humphreys, who was complainant below, filed his bill against the defendants, praying an injunction against the ssuing of an execution on a judgment they had obtained against him at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">His bill sets forth, that he was one of the sureties of Richard Bland., late sheriff of Claiborne County, - in his official- bond. That in March, 1839, the .present defendants instituted a suit on the bond against Bland and his sureties, on which the Circuit Court rendered a judgment in favor of. the defendants. The cause was removed to this court by writ of error, where the judgment of the Circuit Court was reversed, and the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>remanded to the Circuit Court, with directions to enter judgr xnent against Humphreys, the surviving surety. This was in-February, 1845. In the mean while, at May term, 1840, judgments were entered in the State Circuit Court of Claiborne County against the sheriff and his sureties on the same bond, and the whole amount of the penalty, collected, by levy and sale of complainant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The bill, moreover, avers, that complainant had no notice or knowledge whatsoever of the suit and proceedings against him by these defendants, till after the case was remanded by' 'this court; that the sheriff\u2019s return of service of the writ on him was false, and made at the request of Bland, for the purpose of keeping the complainant in ignorance of .the pendency of the suit; that when the cause was remanded to the Circuit Court, he offered to plead his payment of the bond <em>puis darrein continuance ; </em>but the court refused to receive the plea, on the ground, that the mandate of the Supreme Court was imperative on them to enter a judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The defendants demurred to this bill for want of equity, and the court below sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill, and the complainant has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Do the facts set forth in the bill, and admitted by the demurrer, entitle the complainant to the injunction prayed for?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">According to the view entertained by the court of the true merits of this case, it will- be unnecessary to examine the question so much mooted on the argument, as to .the conclusiveness of the sheriff\u2019s return, or whether equity would interfere, where a false return, has been made by the sheriff in collusion with a co-defendant, Without any fraud or fault of the plaintiff. We shall, therefore, consider the case as if the complainant had full notice of the suit at law, and the summons had been duly served on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">The laws of Mississippi limit the liability of the sureties in the official bond of the sheriff to the amount of the penalty. Any person injured by a default of the sheriff in paying over money collected by him may have a judgment entered on the bond for the amount due to him, on motion, without service of process, , or stay of execution. This judgment is a lien on all the personal and real property of the defendants, and has a priority over all judgments subsequently obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">As the officer is liable to the extent of his defaults, and the surety only to the extent of the bond, difficulties will, no doubt, often occur as to the mode in which sureties may defend themselves, when judgments are demanded exceeding the aruount of the penalty. If the prior judgments should be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>out ..of the-property of the sheriff, the sureties might wrongfully escape, if the amount of prior judgments might be pleaded against subsequent 4emands. On the contrary, if it could not, the -surety might be compelled to pay more than the amount of -his bond, unless the court should protect him in some way.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In some .States, where a similar law prevails as to suits on sheriffs\u2019 bonds, each suitor is permitted to take a judgment on the bond. for the amount of his claim, and when the. sureties have paid in the whole amount of the penalty, all further executions are.stayed by the court, and the money apportioned to the claimants according to their respective priorities. But, whatever may be the practice of the courts of Mississippi in such cases, it is clear, that, when the surety has paid the whole penalty of his bond, he should, at some stage of the proceedings, be suffered to plead this defence to further exactions. If he has had no such opportunity before judgment, the court, on motion, should permit it to be done after judgment, and order a stay of execution. - Formerly, courts of law gave a remedy in such cases, by a writ of <em>audita </em>querela, \u2014 \u201ca writ,\u201d it is said, <em>\u201c </em>of a-most remedial nature, and invented lest in any case there should be an oppressive defect of justice, where a party who has a good defence is too late in making.it in the ordinary' forms of law \u201d ; and although it is said to be in its nature a. bill in equity, yet, in modem practice, courts of law usually afford the same remedy on motion in a summary way. The. practice-in Mississippi seems to prefer a bill in equity for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">And courts of equity usually grant a remedy by injunction against a judgment at law, upon the same principles. In Truly <em>v. </em>Wanzer, 5 Howard, 142, this court say, \u2014 \u201c It may be stated as a general principle with regard to injunctions after a judgment at law, that any fact which proves it to be against conscience to execute such judgment, and of which the party. could not have avaded himself in a court of law, or of which\" he might have availed himself at law, but was prevented by fraud or accident, unmixed- .with any fault or negligence in himself or his agents, will authorize a court of equity to interfere by injunction to restrain the adverse party from availing himself of such judgment.\u201d (See also -Story, Bq. Jur. \u00a7 887.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In the case before us, the surety had been compelled to pay the whole amount of his bond by process from the State courts, before the present defendants obtained their judgment against him, but after the institution of their suit. This would have been a good defenc.e to the action if pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance. </em>The complainant tendered this plea, at the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>time, and was refused the benefit of it, not because it was adjudged insufficient as a defence, but because the court considered they had no discretion to allow it. The mandate from this court was, probably, made without reference to the possible Consequences that might flow from it. At all events, it operated unjustly, by precluding the complainant from an opportunity of making a just and legal defence to the action. The payment was made while the cause was pending here. The party was guilty of no laches, but lost the benefit of his defence, by an accident over which he had no control.
