The first case, in point of date, that I have met with, is that of Konig <em>v. </em>Bayard, October term, 1829, 2 Paine\u2019s Rep., decided in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>that case, it was held that the judgment created a lien upon the lands of the defendant; from the time it was docketed, according to the rule in the State courts; and that the lands of a debtor were liable to be taken in execution after they had passed into the hands of a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser, by a conveyance subsequent to the judgment, and prior to the issuing of the execution ; and the principles upon which the judge founded his opinion may have weight in the present case. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">\u201c It was held, \u2018 that the liability of lands to execution in the courts of the United States does not arise from any act of Congress expressly making them sp liable, but from the operation of the process acts of 1789 and 1792 ; the State law upon the \u2022subject, being thereby adopted, should be considered as also adopting the effect and operation of the judgment as a lien. The repeated decisions in the courts of the United States, although they have not directly decidetfthe point, had proceeded upon the presumption, that the lien created by a judgment in the United States courts upon land, and the mode of proceed-: ing to obtain satisfaction of the judgments, are regulated entirely by the State laws. That Congress, by the process act, adopted both the form and effect of executions as established by the State laws in 1789. That their form and effect in this State [New York] depended upon the State act of 1787, which requires the sheriff to take the goods and chattels of the defendant, and, if sufficient cannot be found, then to make the debt. and damages out of the land, &amp;c., whereof the defendant was seized on the day on which such lands become liable to. such debt. That the execution thereupon extends to, and operates upon, the lands of which the defendant was seized on that day; and that this was its effect, which had been adopted by the process act.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">\u201c The next case, in point of time, that I have met with, is that \u00f3f Tayloe <em>v. </em>Thompson, in the Supreme Court of the United States, 5 Peters, 35, decided in a case taken up under the' laws of Maryland. It was contended for the plaintiff in error, that no statute of Maryland authorized the sale of lands for debt, and that the statute of 5 George II., antecedent to the Revolution, was the only legislation upon the subject. That that statute rendered lands in the Colonies subject to execution as chattels, and this only in favor of British merchants ; and no execution having issued upon the lands in question before the title to them passed to the plaintiffs, consequently, as in the case of chattels, no lien attached upon the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">\u201c The court, in delivering their opinion, said, <em>\u20141 </em>This statute (5 Geo. II.) has been adopted and in use in Maryland, ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>since its passage, as the only one under which lands have been, taken in execution and sold. It has long received an equitable construction, applying it to all judgment creditors. As Congress has made no law on this subject, the Circuit Court were bound to' decide the case according to the law of Maryland; which does not consist merely in .enactments of their own, or the statutes of England in force or adopted by their legislation. The adjudication of their courts, the settled, uniform practice and usage of the State,,in the practical operation of its provisions, evidencing the judicial construction of its terms, are to be considered as part of the statute, and as such furnishing a rule for the decision of the Federal courts. The statute, and its interpretations, form together a rule of title and property, which must be the same in all courts. It is enough for this court to know that, by established usage, the statute (5 Geo. II.) has been, acted on and considered as applying to all judgments in favor of any person ; and that sales made under them have been held valid as titles. Though the statute does not provide that the judgment shall be a lien from the time of its rendition, yet there is abundant evidence that it has always been so considered, and so acted on.\u2019 And the judge concludes by saying, that there was \u2018 no doubt that the courts of Maryland had decided it as a rule of property from th\u00e9 earliest period, that a judgment is a lien <em>per se </em>on the lands of the defendant.\u2019 And, therefore, the lien of the judgment in the Circuit Court was sustained from the date of its rendition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">\u201c In the case of the Manhattan Company <em>v. </em>Evertson, 6 Paige, 465, the question that bore upon the doctrine of lien depended upon the question, whether a judgment in the United States Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York vas a lien upon lands lying within the Northern District of the same State ; and in delivering his opinion the Chancellor says, \u2014 <em>\u2018 </em>There is no act of Congress 'making a judgment in a court of the United States a lien\u2019on lands, either within the general territorial jurisdiction of the court, or elsewhere. The existence of such a lien must therefore depend upon the local law of the State wher\u00e9 the land is situated upon which such a lien is claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\">\u201c <em>1 </em>By the common law, a freehold could not be reached by a judgment, except in the case of an heir, upon a judgment bond, or other specialty. The statute of .13 Edward I., which gave the writ of elegit, by which one half of the land of the judgfhent debtor might be taken in extent, did not, in terms, create a lien, so as to prevent a sale by the debtor before execution <em>; </em>but the uniform construction of the statute has been, to give such a lien, from the entry of the judgment, upon the lands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>which could be reached by the process of the court. And when the British statute of 5 George II., ch. 7, subjected lands in the Coionies to sale on execution, the same principle was adopted in the Colony of New York, and in most of the Colonies, as to the lien of the judgment upon real estate which might be thus sold; and this lien was held to extend to all freehold lands which could be reached' by ,an execution out of the court in which the judgment was entered. And when a judgment was removed from an inferior into the Supreme Court, and there affirmed, such judgment became a lien upon all lands of the debtor throughout the State, from the time of the docketing of the judgment in the Supreme Court. . Such was the state of the law here [New York] at the time of the Revolution. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">\u201c \u2018 The act of 1787, which was substituted .in the place of the British statute subjecting lands to execution, recognizes the existence of such lien in the form of the execution which is directed'by the statute to be issued against the lands of the debtor, as the sheriff is directed, in case the personal estate is insufficient to pay the judgment and costs, to levy the same on the lands-and tenements whereof the judgment debtor was seized on the day the lands become liable, or at any time after-wards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">\u201c \u2018And that a judgment of a court of the United States is a lien upon the real estate of the debtor, in accordance with the local law of the place where the land lies, is settled by the Supreme Court. 5 Peters, 358.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-7\">\u201c \u2018 Upon the principle, which has been adopted by Congress, and by the Supreme Court of the United States, the legal effect of a judgment as a lien upon the real estate of a defendant, whether such judgment is rendered in a court of the State or in a Federal court, where no direction on the subject has been given by the sectional legisl\u00e1ture, must necessarily be governed by the local law, although the mode of proceeding to enforce such lien, where it exists, may not be the same in the courts of the State and Federal courts. I have no doubt, therefore, that, the lien of a judgment recovered in one of the Circuit or District Courts of the United States, within the limits of this State, is a lien upon the lands of debtor lying within. the territorial jurisdiction of such court, for the term of ten years from the docketing of such judgment, in the same manner that a judgment of a court of record in one of the State courts is a lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\">\u201c \u2018 And the only difficulty is in determining whether the lien, according to the true principle of the local law, extends to all lands which may be reached by the execution-of the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>or only to such as are within the territorial jurisdiction to which the original process of such court extends.\u2019 And the Chancellor concluded by saying, \u2018but with some hesitation, that a judgment recovered in the Circuit Court, in either of the districts,-'is a lien upon real property lying in any part of the State within which the Circuit Court is held.\u2019 And he added, that, if a county court were authorized to issue execution throughout the State, the principle of the local law would extend .the liens of the judgments thereafter recovered throughout the State; \u2022 that such was the construction of Yirginia, permitting execution upon a judgment in a local court to be issued to other counties; and Cited 2 McCall, 186.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-4\">\u201c In the case of Konig <em>v. </em>Bayard, heretofore referred to, the same doctrine is held, that the lien of a judgment upon the lands of a defendant existed by virtue of the right to take it in execution and sell it in satisfaction of the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">\u201c The case of the United States <em>v. </em>Morrison, 4 Peters, 124, was taken up to the Supreme Court of the United States by appeal from the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Yirginia. The Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion, says, \u2014 ,\u2018 In Yirginia there is no statute which, in express terms, creates a lien upon the lands of the debtor. As in England, the lien is a consequence of the right to take out an elegit. Different opinions seem to have been entertained of the effect of any suspension of the right. By the construction .of the Circuit Court, the party who sued out a <em>fi. fa. </em>could not resort to an elegit until the remedy on the <em>fi. fa. </em>was shown by the return to be exhausted <em>\u2019; </em>that is, that the lien was suspended until the return of the <em>fi. fa., </em>and the adverse right, having attached in the mean time, was preferred to that claimed under the judgment-..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">\u201c But soon after the judgment in the Circuit Court, and before the cage came up to be heard in the Supreme Court,' the Court of Appeals of the State decided that the right to take out an elegit was not suspended by suing out a <em>fi. fa., </em>and consequently, that the lien of the judgment was continued pending the proceedings on that writ. And upon the ground of this decision of the Court of Appeals, establishing- the law of the State, the judgment of the Circuit Court was reversed, and the cause remanded ; the Chief Justice observing, that \u2018 this court, according to its uniform course, adopts that construction \u00f3f the act which is made by the highest \u00bfourt of the State.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-7\">\u201c The above case recognizes the position, that where a lien is. dependent upon the right to issue execution, and that right is suspended, the lien is suspended also ; and is remarkable for the strong expressions used, by the Chief Justice, in reference. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>to the deference paid by the courts of the United States to State laws.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-5\">\u201c The Supreme Court, in the case of Tayloe <em>v. </em>Thompson, rather assign the local law of the State, recognised in its highest tribunals, establishing the lien of judgments, without special regard to the reasons by which it became established, as the ground of their decisions; and in that case the judgment is held to be a lien <em>per se.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-6\">\u201c And in 4 Peters, 366, the Supreme Court have held, that in Kentucky a judgment does not bind land ; that the lien attaches only from the delivery of the execution to the sheriff; and in that State, therefore, the right to issue execution does not carry with it a lien upon lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-7\">\u201c In Ohio, the lien of a judgment is lost, if execution is not sued out and levied within a year from its rendition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-8\">\u201c In Tennessee, a judgment of a county court is a lien, for one year after its rendition, on defendant\u2019s lands throughout the State, and prior judgments take precedence of executions.

Sellers <em>v. </em>Cor Ivin, <em>5 </em>Ham. ,398.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-10\">\u201c Here are presented a variety of local laws of different States on the subject of the lien of judgments, some derived from one principle and some from another; and it may be remarked, that the statute of George II., the construction of which by the State courts of New York is the ground of the Chancellor\u2019s opinion above quoted, could have'no application to any State formed since the Revolution, and' after the States were colonies of Great Britain,. ,to whom in that relation alone it applied. But hence the strong propriety of a broader ground .of .decision, on the part \u00f3f the Federal courts, to adapt their proceedings to the local laws; and this is comprehended in the view of the Supreme Court, taking the established la&gt;v of the State as the basis of their judgments in matters of local character. And this ground of decision embraces all States, whatever may be the date of their creation or the peculiarity of their laws; and this, I conedive, is the ground taken in the case of Tayloe <em>v. </em>Thompson, before referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-11\">\u201cIt is not, however, deemed material in this case whether one principle or the other be adopted, as either will lead, it is believed, to the same conclusion, in accordance with the .local laws of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201cAntecedent to the act of the.Pennsylvania Legislature of 1799, a judgment in the Supreme Court of the State was held to bind the lands of the defendant throughout the State ; and tfie powers of the Supreme Court were held to be the same as those of the Court of King\u2019s Bench in England; and that, the liens of judgments in the latter court being only bounded by its territorial jurisdiction, those of the former had equal extent. That act, however, provided that no judgment of the Supreme, or Circuit Court of the State should be a lien on real estate, excepting in the county in which such judgment should be rendered. Purd.

The act of 1798, however, limiting the lien of judgments to five years, unless revived by <em>scire f\u00e1das, </em>having been considered in this court, and the general argument having, as it is deemed, a bearing upon the question, under discussion, will be presently noticed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQNx\">\u201cThe general doctrine of the lien of judgments.has, however, been considered in the case of Krause\u2019s Appeal, 3 Whart. 403, in the Supreme Court .of this State. In that case the court say, that \u2018neither the act of Parliament, which1 subjected lands, <em>sub modo, </em>to the payment of debts, nor our acts'of 1700 and 1705, which made them liable to be. sold absolutely, expressly provided that a judgment should be a lien on land. In both countries, however, it was held to bind land. Both there and here, it is expressly assumed by the legislatures of the different countries, and the time when the lien is to commence, and how long it is to continue, and by what proceeding prolonged, are expressly provided by different laws,\u2019 &amp;c. We may content ourselves with saying, that a judgment is in Pennsylvania a lien on real estate, by acts of Assembly, and the nature and extent of the lien are according to the provisions of these enactments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-7\">\u201c In the case of Thompson <em>v. </em>Phillips, 1 Baldwin, 373, one of the questions considered by the Circuit Court was,, whether the State law of 1798, limiting the lien of judgments on real estate to five years, was obligatory upon the Federal courts, and it was held that it was, for a variety of reasons. \u2018 The terms of the act,\u2019 it was said, \u2018extend to all judgments,\u2019 in any court of record, \u2018 within this State, and are broad enough to take in those of this court. Its object is declared to be'to pre- \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>vent the risk and inconvenience to purchasers of real.estate, by suffering judgments to remain a lien for an indifferent time, without any process to continue or revive (he sqme, which applies in whatever courts such judgments are rendered. We can-, not consider it as a mere process act; it is a part of a great system of jurisprudence, for the safety ,and protection of purchasers, &amp;c. The questions arising under it \u00e1re those of property, title, and the rights of purchasers for. a valuable consideration. It cannot be doubted that this law should be the rule of decision in a State court, and it is difficult to perceive a reason why a different rule, should be adopted .in this court, merely because the plaintiff, being ar-citizen of another State, may bring his suit here or in the State courts, at his option. Both the courts administer the laws and jurisprudence of the State ; the rules of property and title are the same, as well as the modes of transmission by judicial process; .all regulated by State. laws, there ought to be one uniform course of adjudication upon them.\u2019 <em>\u2018 </em>That over the subject-matter Congress possesses no constitutional jurisdiction, nor has, in any manner, assumed its exercise. These are subjects of internal police and State regulation, over which the States have delegated no power to the general government; on which the States can legislate to any extent, and in any manner not prohibited by the constitution of the State or the Union.\u2019 And the judge affirmed that the case came strictly within the thirty-fourth section of the Judiciary Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">\u201c Although the argument of the court in the above case is applied to a question of limitation as to time, yet it is apprehended that its general doctrines are as applicable to a limitation in reference to territory as to that of time;' A restriction imposed upon the lien of a judgment as to territory would enter , as fully into questions of property, title, and the rights of purchasers, as that of a restriction as to the period of its dura- \u25a0 tion; and therefore, if the local law is the rule of decision in the one case in the Federal courts, no reason is perceived why it should not be in the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">.\u201cBut a State legislature can impose no rule upon a Federal court, directly or indirectly, that cannot be sustained by the' Constitution of the United States. Such legislatures have full power over their own tribunals, where it. is not controlled by the State constitution, and they may enact what rules they please for their government within this limit; and if they were to abolish liens on real estate altogether, obtained through the medium of judgments, I apprehend the United States courts, in accordance with the doctrines of the cases quoted, would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>bound <em>by </em>it. But if a State were to restrict the liens of all judgments, obtained in courts of record to the counties in which they were recovered, it might well .be doubted if the Federal courts would be bound by such enactment, literally construed; for, in that Case, the lien of a judgment in these courts would be excluded from every county composing the .district except that in which the court might be located. This, therefore, .Would form a different rule for the Federal courts from that which would operat\u00e9 upon the. State courts. The rule in the supposed case, it may be observed, can have no reference to locality,as distinct from the jurisdiction intended to be acted upon, and the term <em>county, </em>used in this connection, would be deemed merely a word used to designate the <em>known </em>limits of a given jurisdiction, and would, by applying the rule, instead of a particular word to the Federal courts, embrace the district. If such would not be the construction, there would be no uniformity of decision between the Federal courts and those of the State, and the evils pointed. out in the case in 1 Baldwin, 273, as likely to arise out of a collision between the State and Federal tribunals would be without remedy. The State laws cannot bp made to have any special and direct bearing upon the United States tribunals. The latter merely administer the laws of the State as they find them, and because they are the laws of the Statebut a law that would operate upon a Federal, court ex-, clusively, so as to restrain its action or the efficacy of its judgxnents beyond the restraints imposed upon the State courts, could scarcely be called a State law; and it might well be doubted if there would be any obligation upon the Fed\u00e9r\u00e1l courts, either under the thirty-fourth section of the Judiciary Act; or any acknowledged principle, to observe its provisions. This is, however,' supposing a difficulty that does not exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">\u201cBut it appears that Congress has legislated upon the subject of liens, so far as to designate the period when liens on judgments shall cease.- By the act of July, 1840, c. 20, $ 4, it is provided, \u2018 That judgments- and decrees thereafter rendered in the Circuit and District Courts of the United States, within any State,'Shall cease to be liens op real estate, or chattels real, in the same manner and at like periods as judgments and decrees of the courts of such State now cease by law to be liens thereon.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-7\">\u201c These words may be broad enough to comprehend liens in either relation, as regards territory or duration, but the word \u2018now? used in the act, according to the construction given to the Process Act in the Federal courts, would confine its -action to the state of things in the several .States to which it refers as existing at the time of its passage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u201c However this may be, the. act clearly recognizes the existence of liens on judgments in the Federal courts, and as it requires that they shall cease in conformity to the State laws, it is just to infer that, in the contemplation of Congress, they exist in conformity to the same laws, and in this recognizing the doctrine held by the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-4\">\u201c The foregoing decisions have a bearing on the case under consideration too obvious to call for any remark; and what remains to be said may therefore be said very briefly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACR\">\u201c As regards Pennsylvania, the statute of 5 George II. was. never in force that I can ascertain. The act of 1705, passed by the local legislature, was in existence, and had been for several years before the passage of the former act, and superseded it. No local laws existing in the Colonies of New York, Virginia, Maryland, and others, the, British statute became the law, and the construction it received varied more or less in the several jurisdictions. How far the doctrine of lien, as it. grew up in Pennsylvania, was dependent upon the construction given in England to the statute of 1 Edward I., which gkve the writ of elegit, I am not able to trace. But that a judgment in Pennsylvania has been uniformly held to be a lien <em>per se, </em>liable to no suspension or interruption from any cause short of satisfac-' tion, or its equivalent in law, for a very long time, admits, I think, of no doubt. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">' \u201c We therefore find, that the judgments of courts of record' of the several States have liens attached to them binding real estate, but having their origin in different sources, and therefore varying in their effects; and that' the local law is universally adopted in the Federal courts in the decision of local questions, and especially those having connection with real estate; and that the grounds upon which the local.laws have been adopted have varied. In Ohio, judgments of the. Federal courts are held to be liens, because these courts have adopted the execution laws of .the State., In New. York, Virginia, and other States, because of the operation of the Process Act; and in Maryland, because a judgment is a lien <em>per se.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-7\">\u201cIs Pennsylvania an exception to this otherwise universal rule? The only statutory limitation of the liens of judgments in Pennsylvania, as regards territory, is the act of 1799, which has been heretofore referred to, and that act is confined in its operation expressly to the Supreme and Circuit Courts of the State, and cannot be extended, by any construction, so as to affect-such liens on the judgments of any other courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-8\">The. case of White <em>v. </em>Hamilton held the doctrine, that the lien of judgments in the-Supreme Court extended throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the State, because the jurisdiction of the court was thus extensive. The same rule has been .adopted with regard to all other courts of record of the State, without any special legislation in reference to the subject of liens, but as ap incident to the jurisdiction. In all the county courts, there is no other reason perceived why judgments obtained in them are liens throughout the county, but the fact that their jurisdiction extends throughput the county. The mere act of creating a court of record, and specifying the limits of its jurisdiction by State authority, extends the liens of judgments throughout these limits; and the application of the same rule to the Circuit Courts \u00f3f Pennsylvania must, in1 accordance with received principles, be attended with like results.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">\u201c If this is not the rule in the case under consideration, what is the limit as to territory of the lien of a judgment in the Federal courts of this State ? That a lien of some extent attaches upon such judgment has been shown by the authority of decided cases, and by fair inference from acts of Congress. What, then, is its territorial extent ? Philadelphia County, where this court holds its- sessions, is no more specially within its jurisdiction than Lancaster County, or Berks, or Northampton, or any other county of the district.' They are all alike, and equally within the territory assigned to the jurisdiction of the court, and to every intent and purpose are equally within its judicial action; and the same cause of argument that would go. to exclude the lien of a judgment of this court from Lancaster County, would exclude it from every .county of the district, or, in other words, would extinguish it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Nor is it readily perceived how a lien on land can be obtained in Pennsylvania through judicial action, unless it attach upon a judgment. - In I Baldwin, 268, the judge, in distinguishing between the effect of an execution, in its operating as a lien on real or personal estate, says, \u2014 \u2018 As to land, the lien attaches by the judgment, and remains, though no levy be made. The sheriff has no right to take possession, or to enter upon it to make a levy; and after levy, he has neither the right of possession, of property, or power to sell-an estate of freehold in defendant, if the property be improved,\u2019 &amp;c. So in 1 Peters, 386, it is held, that \u2018 the lien by a general judgment on land gives the right to levy on the same, to the exclusion of adverse interests; and such levy, when' made, relates-back to the .time of the judgment.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\"><em>\u201c </em>If land can only be levied by virtue of the lien obtained, through the judgment, then the existence of the lien is necessary to sustain the levy; and if the doctrine be true, that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>lien attaches upon a judgment of this court, or that such lien does not extend to Lancaster County, then was there nothing to sustain the execution on which the land was sold, and the money raised, which is now the subject of controversy, and the whole proceedings in that connection are void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-5\">\u201c And it may be added, that all the reasons alleged for adopting the local law of lien ..by the Federal courts apply to judgments in this case. For, 1st, the courts have adopted the exe-. cution laws of this State, as fully as in Ohio, where this is the ground alleged for adopting the lien law of. that State; 2d, the Process Act applies as entirely to Pennsylvania as to New.York and Virginia; and, 3d, a. judgment in Pennsylvania is as much a lien <em>per se, </em>and forms a rule of title and property in this State, as in Maryland, and. is therefore within the provisions of the thirty-fourth section of the Process Act, which is the reason assigned for adopting the lien law of the latter State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The auditor, therefore, is of opinion, that the authorities quoted sustain the position, that a judgment of this court is a lien upon the lands of the defendant in Lancaster <em>County; </em>and therefore, that the judgment creditors having prior; liens are entitled to the fund in court, after payment of the costs and expenses upon the judgments as far as they may be covered by the fund, and the expenses of this reference.

A brief statement of the history of the case, and of the peculiar practice of the courts of Pennsylvania on this subject, will make it apparent that the decision of the court below involving this question is not properly before us, either by the appeal or the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"AAC\">The record shows, that Lombard and. Whitmore obtained a judgment against Bayard, the nominal plaintiff in error in this case, on a bond for $ 62,420, conditioned for the payment of '$31,210. An execution on . this judgment was issued, returnable to April term, 1846, on which the marshal returned a levy on certain lands of the defendant situate in Lancaster County, and within the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. An inquisition was held, and the property condemned, according to the practice and laws of that State. A <em>venditioni exponas </em>was afterwards issued, on which the marshal returned, that he had sold the property levied on for the sum of $ 61,200. These proceedings are admitted to be all regular, and according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In Pennsylvania, a judicial sale discharges the land sold from all liens, except (now) prior mortgages. When, therefore, land is once sold on execution, and converted into money, all persons who claim to have liens upon- it by judgment or otherwise (with a few exceptions) are compelled to follow the money or lose their security. Hence it, often happens that, when money is made by sale of land on a junior judgment, the plaintiff does not obtain satisfaction, and is sometimes involved in a fresh-litigation with creditors- claiming to have prior liens. In these contests the defendant is Usually an indifferent spectator. For many years there was no settled practice, as to the mode in which\u2019 these new disputes should be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In .some districts the sheriff paid the money in his h\u00e1nds to such parties as he thought best entitled to it, and took an indemnity against other claimants, who were thus, compelled to seek their remedy by suit on his.bond.. In other districts, th\u00e9. sheriff avoided responsibility by paying the money into- court, and leaving the claimants to settle their controversies in such manner as the court might order, or the parties elect. In such cases, the court usually disposed of the money on the motion of the parties interested, by ordering the liens to-be paid in the order of their priority, as certified by the clerk. But as it not unfrequently happened that the junior judgment creditors contested the validity of the lien of the older judgment, because it was not regularly revived, or for other <em>reasons; </em>or challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>it for fraud and collusion; or insisted that it had been .paid in whole or in part, it became necessary that the court should in some way try and decide these questions thus raised by new parties before any proper disposition could be made of the money. Im such cases, where the counsel expected, questions to arise which they might desire to have reviewed by writ of error, they took care,- by the form of an amicable action, or by case stated in the nature of a special verdict, tp shape the proceedings in such form and with such parties that a writ of error would lie in favor of those who felt aggrieved by the decision of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">But it was conceded by all, that, if the money was distributed by the court on motion, a writ of error could not reach the proceeding, and the decision of the court was conclusive on all parties. (See Gratz <em>v. </em>Lancaster Bank, 17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Such was the practice in the courts of Pennsylvania, till the year-1827, when an act of Assembly was passed, requiring the court to direct aft issue in such cases, at the request of any claimant, and to give notice to all persons interested ; and allowing a writ of error where the issue was tried by a jury, and an appeal when the question was submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In the case before us, the marshal paid the money into court, and motions were made by the Bank of Middletown and others for leave to take it out of court, which were resisted by Lombard and Whitmore, the plaintiffs in the judgment. The court appointed an auditor to make report as to the parties entitled to the money, with directions to give notice to all parties concerned. The auditor made a report, giving, a preference to the judgments according to their priority in time. The Bank of Middletown, and others who had junior judgments in the State courts of Lancaster County, excepted to the report, alleging that judgments in the Circuit Court of the United States were not liens on the lands of defend\u00e1nt in Lancaiter County, or out of the County of Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">This exception was. overruled by the court, and the report of the auditor confirmed. From this decision of the court the Bank of Middletown appealed,.'and on suggestion of a doubt by the court whether an appeal would lie, a' writ of error was also sued out by counsel professing to act <em>\u201c </em>as attorneys for plaintiff in-error, and for the. Bank, of Middletown and the Farmers\u2019 Bank of Delaware.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">But no errors have-been assigned in this court, to the judgment or execution, on b.ehalf of the\" plaintiff in, error. As against him, all the proceedings are admitted to be regular and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>legal, It is a matter of indifference to him whether the money raised by the sale of his lands on the execution is awarded to defendants in error or to the banks. The assignment of errors in this case is on behalf of persons who are not parties.to the record, and of a matter arising after execution executed, on a motion by strangers to the judgment and proceedings, and an order of the court disposing of certain funds in their possession accidentally connected with this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">It is a well settled maxim of the law, that <em>\u201c </em>no person can bring a writ of error to reverse a judgment who is not a party or privy to the record.\u201d \u201c A writ of error lies when a man is griev.ed by an error in the foundation, proceeding, judgment, or execution \u201d in a suit. Co. Lit. 288, <em>b ; </em>see also Boyle <em>v. </em>Zacharie, 6 Peters, 655, and cases cited. The judgment or order of the court on a summary motion, or a collateral question arising like the present on the suggestion \u00f3f a third party, is not reexaminable on a writ of error issued on the judgment with which it may happen to be connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The Circuit Court of the United States has adopted the forms of process in execution of the State courts, and the laws and practice of Pennsylvania, for taking lands on execution and disposing of their proceeds. But it is not a consequence of their adoption of them that the modes of reviewing the decisions of the Circuit Court by this court should be conformed to the laws or practice of the State. For it cannot be pretended that acts of Assembly of Pennsylvania can give jurisdiction to this court not to be found in the Constitution and acts of Congress of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The absence of courts of equity in Pennsylvania has compelled them to adopt modes of practice in their courts of common law anomalous in their character, and unnecessary in a court possessing the full powers of a court of chancery. . An appeal to this court is given in chancery cases alone. And the writ of error given by the Judiciary Act is governed by the provisions of that act and the principles of the common law, as regards the judgments and questions which may be reviewed under it. . The persons complaining in this case should have filed their bill in equity, or stated an issue in due legal form, with proper parties, setting forth the merits of .their respective claims, if they intended to prosecute an appeal or writ of error to this court. This coirld have been done with less expense and trouble, and in less time, than in the mode pursued. But having submitted the question on which their claim depended to the court below, on a motion collateral to the record, the decision of that court .is final and conclusive, and cannot be reviewed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Therefore, as no error appears on the record, the judgment of the Circuit Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjiidged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
