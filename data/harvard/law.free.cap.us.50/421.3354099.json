This the plaintiff objected to, because not sufficiently authenticated, and for the reasons stated in the objections to the survey. The defendant then offered a report from the land office favorable to his claim, marked No. 7.

The defendant then referred to the original Spanish document s\u00e9t forth under the fifth head of his defence. It was the document signed by Orsono; and in the connection was the proof that Fontauell'a had been in possession, and had inclosed the lot; that he had sold it to Orsono, who built a house upon the lot; th\u201eat Eslava, the father of defendant, had been in the receipt of rent, during the Spanish times, from about the time the deed bears date ; that he had clainied, and the property had been esteemed as his; that the government of the United States had paid rent to him, for the use made of it by General Wilkinson after the change of flag ; that he rented it to other persons, and the property was in his possession until he was interrupted by De Vobiscey in 1819; that in the latter part of 1819 De-Vobiscey entered, and Eslava brought a writ of forcible entry, and recovered possession and retained it till 1821, when the judgment was revoked and a writ of restitution awarded; that afterwards another writ of forcible entry was brought by Eslava against De Vobiscey, and in 1822 a recovery was had and possession recovered; that this possession was retained till the year 1826, when this judgment was revoked, and \u00e1 writ of restitution awarded ; and Hallett, claiming to hold De Vobiscey\u2019s title, entered, and the proceedings in an action to try titles on the same day were commenced, and a recovery had, with damages ; and a writ of restitution was executed under the judgment of the Supreme Court, referred to in the reports of that' case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">The documents five and six were offered together, and the genuineness of the signatures was proved, and the fact that the officers held the appointments specified at the time they bear date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">The report of this claim, and the confirmation of the govern- . ment, was also read to the jury.- The evidence shows that the heirs of Robert Farmer left this country ; and that, during the Spanish times, and until the return of De Vobiscey vnone were known or heard of in the Province of West Florida as claimants of this lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-8\">It was in evidence that Orsono, at the time of the deed to' him, and from him to Eslava, was the Spanish commandant at Mobile.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-9\">Before the jury retired from the bar to consider of their verdict, the court charged them as follows: \u2014 That, in considering this case, they were not to regard the title from the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>States to either party, as both were confirmed equally, and the confirmations balanced each other, and, to decide the controversy, the jury must look to the other evidences of title. The court further instructed the jury, that, if th\u00e9y believed the defendant, Eslava, and those under whom he claimed, had been in possession more than twenty years before the suit was brought under claim of title, it would be sufficient fqr his defence ; and that the conveyances produced would be sufficient to connect the different possessions together. The court further instructed the jury, that, the conveyance to Mrs. Fonnerette being shown, if no adverse or other possession appeared, and no reason to the contrary was shown in evidence, and'the possession was found in her vendee, they, would be authorized to presume, if they thought proper, that she was in possession under the concession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\">The court further charged, that, if they believed that the plaintiff had. been out of possession since the.death of Farmer, and until the year 1819, though De Vobiscey had then entered, yet, if he was dispossessed by Eslava by recovering at law with damages, having been out of possession such length of time, his entry was that of a trespasser, and his possession would not prevent the statute of limitations from continuing to run on,account of Eslava, he having been restored by competent tribunals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">Before the jury retired to consult on their verdict, the counsel for the plaintiff requested the court to charge the jury as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-7\">That in this State the jury would not be authorized to presume a grant in favor of a direct adverse possession short of thirty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-8\">That, the title of defendant, before confirmation, was a mere equity, and this is not of that character, of color of title, which would/ support an adverse possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-9\">That, in order to sustain the defence under the statute of limitations, there -must be twenty years\u2019 actual, uninterrupted, adverse possession, and this possession must be clearly defined; which the court charged, but added, that the jury might infer the possession, if-they pleased, from the transmission of title from Fonnerette to Fontanella, and from Fontanella to Orsono, and to this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-10\">That the proper concession to Mrs. Fonnerette, her deed to Fontanella, and his deed to Orsono, cannot be received by the jury as evidence of title, so as to connect the defendant\u2019s title under- his confirmation with them, nor can they look to them as evidence of sales, nor as proof of the consideration, nor as proof of the boundaries claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>That if the jury find that De Vobiscey entered upon the premises in 1818 or 1819, with intent to claim, and did claim, in right of his wife, as one of the heirs of Farmer, and held possession under said title during those portions of time he was successful in litigation, this interrupted the possession; and in order to sustain a title under the statute there must be proof of. a clear adverse possession of twenty years prior to the time of the interruption ; which the court refused, and the court charged that De Vobiscey was a trespasser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-4\">That' neither under the claim of Mrs. Fonnerette, nor under the act of Congress, can the defendant claim more than sixty feet front, and that the survey produced by the defendant cannot control this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-5\">That if defendant has put in a plea for eighty-four feet, and shows title' for but sixty feet, without designating the precise location of the sixty, the plaintiff must recover. That the paper title produced by the plaintiff is better than the paper title of the defendant;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">That the act of 1822, confirming defendant\u2019s title, relates \u2022only to the title as presented to the commissioners, to wit, the deed from Orsono in 1802, while the same act confirms the title of plaintiff, which relates back to the patent of 1757.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">That the legal construction of the bill of sale from Orsono to Eslava gives to Eslava no right to the land in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">That if the defendant claims under the title of Mrs. Fonnerette, he cannot acquire by the statute of limitations more than the title calls for, which is sixty feet front.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-9\">To all of which charges and refusals to charge by the court, the plaintiff by his counsel excepts, and prays that his bill of exceptions may be signed and sealed by the court, which is done accordingly in term time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-10\">The jury, under these instructions, found a verdict for the defendant, and the case was carried to the Supreme Court of Alabama.

The plaintiff sued out a writ of error, and brought the case up to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-10\">It was argued by <em>Mr. Phillips </em>and <em>Mr.- Coxe, </em>for the plaintiff in error, and <em>Mr. </em>Campbell, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-11\"><em>Mr. Phillips, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIx\">made the following points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-12\">The Supreme Court of Alabama has declared that the plaintiffs chain of title <em>\u201c </em>gives no legal right to the premises, and that the lessor is not entitled to recover, although no opposing evidence had been offered by defendant.\u201d 11 Ala. Rep. 1049.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-13\">This extraordinary conclusion is predicated upon the position that the title of Farmer was forfeited by the conquest, as well as by the'stipulation of the fifth section of the treaty between Great Britain and Spain. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-14\">That the estate of- individuals is not the subject of forfeiture by act of conquest, is a well-established principle in the law of nations, and one repeatedly recognized by this court. Vattel\u2019s Law. of Nations, 388; Wheaton\u2019s Law of Nations, 63; 8 Wheat. 589; 7 Pet. 86; 10 ib. 326; 12 ib. 412.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-15\">Nor does the fifth section of the treaty work this'consequence. If, by the law of nations, Farmer\u2019s possession would have been secure, would the British government have introduced a treaty stipulation narrowing the right of their own subjects ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-16\">\u201c Her Catholic Majesty agrees that the British inhabitants or subjects may retire in full security and liberty when they shall think proper, and may sell their estates, and remove all their effects, as well as their persons, without being restrained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>their emigration, under any pretence whatever, except on account of debts dr criminal prosecutions; the term limited for this emigration being fixed to the space of eighteen months,\u201d &amp;c. But if from the value of their possessions they should not be able to dispose of them, a longer time to be granted, &amp;c. Land Laws, 977. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-5\">The just construction of this section would seem to be, to stipulate for emigration and removal of property, and that it is introduced out of abundant caution. But if the party did not choose to emigrate, was there to be a forfeiture of his property upon the expiration of the eighteen months ? Or suppose he emigrated within that period, but did not sell, did the lapse of time deprive him of the right to do so ? The treaty nowhere expressly declares a forfeiture, and to imply it in opposition to the principles of the laws of nations could only be justified by imperious necessity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-6\">Whatever may be the power of the sovereign to regulate the ownership of real estate, and to confine it to citizens alone, it would seem that some special action of the Spanish government was necessary, and that neither the conquest nor the treaty, <em>proprio vigore, </em>worked a forfeiture of this estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-7\">But supposing they did, was it not competent for Spain to have relinquished this forfeiture, and may not this government, the successor of Spain, do the same thing ? The admission of the premises of the decision does not at all justify its conclusion, <em>\u201c </em>that the lessor had no right to recover, although no opposing evidence had been offered by defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-8\">But it may be said that the act of. Congress and the patent which affirm' the plaintiff\u2019s title expressly reserve the rightful claims of all other persons, \u2022 and that the defendant\u2019s title is within that reservation, and consequently stands unaffected by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-9\">In 1788, Elizabeth Fonnerette applied to the Spanish Com- . mandant Meiro for the lot belonging to Farmer, <em>\u201c </em>which has not'until the present time been claimed by the proprietor or by any agent in his behalf\u201d; upon which an order issued to put the petitioner into possession provided the lot was \u201cvacant, and it caused no injury to any one,\u201d and with the further direction, that \u201ca survey should be made by the surveyor of the' Province, to be transmitted to me in order to provide the petitioner with the corresponding title in form.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-10\">This was the Whole transaction under the Spanish rgovernment. There is no evidence to show that the party was ever put into possession by the' officer to whom the- order was directed, nor that she had ever obtained the possession in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>other manner; \u2014 no proof, therefore, that the inquiry was ever made that the lot was \u25a0\u201c vacant,\u201d and that'the concession would not operate an \u201cinjury\u201d to some other person, nor was there ever any \u201c survey \u201d upon which the titles were to be predicated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-5\">It may be remarked, also, that, although this application was made but a few years after the treaty, the lot of Farmer is not spoken of as forfeited, but as unclaimed.. T\u00d3e concession to Mrs. Fonnerette gave her ho legal title. This is shown, \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-6\">1st. By the terms of the concession itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\">2d. By the eighteenth section of the Regulations of Morales, which declares, \u201c that no one of those who have obtained the first decree by which the surveyor is ordered to measure it, and by virtue of which they have been put in possession, can be regarded as owners of the land until - their real titles are delivered, completed with all the formalities before recited.\u201d Land Laws, 984.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-8\">3d. By the repeated adjudications of this court, commencing with the case of De la Croix <em>v. </em>Chamberlain, in 12 Wheaton, that such claims did not sever the land from the public domain, and that upon the change of government a political obligation alone existed, which the court could not enforce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-9\">The claim of Eslava, however, was not presented to the board as founded upon this concession, but upon a bill of sale from Ofsono in 1802; and this was the only paper filed in the land office. The report of the commissioners shows Orsono to be -the original claimant, Eslava the present claimant, and states the quantity claimed as unknown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-10\">It is contended by defendant, that the act of 1822 confirmed this claim, and upon the trial a survey was introduced, made by a deputy surveyor of the United States,' to show its extent. This evidence was objected to, because by the acts of Congress the register and receiver were to direct the manner in which the locations were to be made, and the survey was made without their authority. The survey contained 25,312 superficial feet, while' the act of Congress under which the claim is set up expressly provides that, where the quantity claimed is not ascertained, it shall be for 7,200 square feet, or 60 by 120. This survey, then, was not only made without due warrant, but in face of the act, and has never been recognized by this government. The survey should, therefore, have been rejected by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-11\">The defendant also offered in evidence the concession and certain mesne conveyances to Orsono. The original petition upon which the concession is founded is for a lot -ten toises (60 feet) in front\u2019; but the conveyances all differ as to the dimensions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The question now is, What standing has this claim acquired from the action of this government ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-5\">As it has been shown that the defendant had only an equity upon the political department, he must be content to take his title with the conditions and under the restrictions which that department has imposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-6\">The plaintiff having shown a perfect title from the government, the defendant was not at liberty to use in evidence against that title the concession, or the mesne conveyances to Orsono, as they had never been presented to the board of. commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-7\">The act declares they shall never be \u201c considered or admitted as evidence in any .court of the United States against any grant which may hereafter be derived from the United States.\u201d Land Laws, 607; Henderson <em>v. </em>Poindexter, 12 Wheat. 543; De la Croix <em>v. </em>Chamberlain, 12 Wheat. 599; <em>Strother v. </em>Lucas, 12 Peters, 448; Barry <em>v. </em>Gamble, 3 How. 32.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-8\">These words are too emphatic and too general to justify the distinction which Was taken; for, whether the deeds were introduced, as constituting of themselves title, or for the purpose of uniting them to some other matter to this end, they equally fall within the words of the statute and the mischief it was intended to guard against.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-9\">But supposing all these documents properly before the court, it is still insisted the defendant is without a legal title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-10\">The act of 1822 does not purport a conveyance of title. While its first section in reference to complete grapts recognizes them as valid, its other sections, which affect the defendant\u2019s claim, look to future action, -\u2014 \u201c they shall be confirmed.\u201d The final title is reserved to the government until the patent issues. The scope of its provisions, providing for locations by its own tribunals, which are also empowered to decide in cases of conflict, is utterly inconsistent with the idea that the act itself severed the connection of the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-11\">While, therefore, it is not denied that a complete title to lands may be vested by act of Congress, it is insisted that, under the act of 1822, the title of the government is not divested until the issuing of the patent. Bagnell <em>v. </em>Broderick, 13 Pet. 436; Wilcox <em>v. </em>Jackson, 13 Pet. 498; Boatner <em>v. </em>Ventriss, 4 Cond. L. R. 653.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-12\">Stating the case, therefore, most favorably for defendant, it shows that Farmer and Eslava both held claims to the lot in controversy derived from former governments ; but these claims gave no title. They have both urged their suits before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>new forum, and Farmer\u2019s title has been perfected, while Es-lava\u2019s remains incomplete.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\">From 1822 to 1837, when the patent issued which divested the government of its title, there was a special tribunal organized by the act of Congress for the adjudication of this conflict. The defendant has appealed, to that tribunal and been defeated, or he has abstained for fifteen years from prosecuting his suit where by law he was directed to do it. 'The record does not authorize us to say upon which horn he is suspended, but his dilemma is the same in either'event.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-6\">That this court has jurisdiction of this cause under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, reference is made to Matthews <em>v. </em>Zane, 4 Cranch, 382; Ross <em>v. </em>Barland, 1 Pet. 662; Pollard\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Kibbe, 14 Pet. 354.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-7\"><em>Mr. Campbell, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWt\">contended, \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">1. That these two claims fell within different sections of the confirmatory act of 1822; that of Farmer being provided for in the fourth section, which merely conferred donations, whilst that of Eslava was comprehended within the third section, which recognized preexisting rights; and that claims founded upon donations must give way to rights already established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">2. (After showing that the Supreme Court of .Alabama considered that both parties were protected by the act -:of Congress, and that, in order to decide between them, the antecedent conditions of the title had necessarily to.be considered, <em>Mr. Campbell </em>proceeded,) In this posture of the case, the Supreme Court were led to the inquiries, first, whether the title of the lessors of the plaintiff was not forfeited before the action of Congress upon it; and secondly, whether the possession of the defendant had not perfected his title under the Spanish laws of prescription and the Alabama act of limitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\">We contend that the settlement of the contest-between these parties is within the competency of the local tribunals, and that a writ of error does not lie to the Supreme Court of the United States upon their judgments. A solution of this question must be found in the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, and the interpretation given to it by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-11\">\u25a0 The title qf the lessors of the plaintiff rests upon the authority of no clause in the Constitution, nor is it protected by any treaty. The title was forfeited by the l\u00e1ws of' Spain, when it had unquestioned sovereignty over the country, and was not restored by the act of cession of Spain to the French govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ment, nor by any act of the French government. The title of the defendant was valid and operative at the date of the cession to the United States, and is within its protection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-5\">The title of the plaintiff is not held under a statute of the United States. The United States, in the act of 8th May, 1822, disavow in favor of the defendant all title to the lot, and if the plaintiff is to be held as comprehended within the third section of the same act, this disavowal operates in favor of the plaintiff. The question, then, is controlled by the decision of this court in 9 Peters, 224. The court there says, \u2014 \u201c The controversy in the State court was between two titles; the one originating under the French, the other under the Spanish government. It is true, the successful party had obtained a patent from the United States acknowledging the validity of his previous incomplete title under the king of Spain. But this patent did not profess to destroy any previous existing title, nor could it so operate, nor was it understood so to operate by the State court.\u201d The court proceeds to show, that the confirmation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim could not operate upon a preexisting title; that the solution of the controversy between the parties depended upon the opinion that the State court held as to the rights tender the titles derived from the crowns of France and Spain respectively; and that the Supreme Court was not entitled to review the opinions of the State court on such a title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">The parallelism between the two cases is perfect. The controversy in the present case is between titles having complete evidences of authenticity. The land in dispute had been severed from the national domain for more than half a century ber fore the occupancy of Mobile under the title produced by the lessors of the plaintiff. The measures of a public character by which it had reverted, and the acts under which it had subsequently become private property, were all antecedent to the American acquisition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">The United States had interfered between the parties only so far as to disclaim all estate in the property, and to furnish the highest evidence of that in an act of Congress. The settlement of the controversies under the preexisting claim could be of no interest to the United States, nor can the mode of settlement of the question call for the interposition of the national tribunals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-8\">The State court gave to the act of Congress of 1822 all the effect that could be derived from it in favor of the lessors of the plaintiff. It Aid not pretend that the United States could not waive the forfeiture in so far as it affected its own interests, but that it had not attempted to impair any other title..</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>, The decision was, that the disavowal or relinquishment of the United States, in 1822, did not destroy the rights that had. vested after the forfeiture of the British grant, and before the passage of the subsequent act of the United <em>States </em>in 1822. This opinion receives full confirmation from the plain declaration in the act of 1822. .Congress expressly declares that it is not to be construed so as to affect any other title, but simply to amount to a relinquishment of the title of the United States. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held, that a confirmation in such terms had no relation so as to affect the vested rights of other persons. Les Bois <em>v. </em>Bramell, 4 Howard, <em>459; </em>Barry <em>v. </em>Gamble, 3 Howard, 32.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-5\">The decision-of the State court upon the effect of the act of limitations is clearly not revisable by the Supreme Court of the United States. The State court held that the laws of prescription ran in favor of the defendants, from the time they entered into possession, claiming title. The Supreme Court has acknowledged in several instances the. effect of the statutes of limitation upon French titles, and that those - acts are not obstructed by the statutes of the United States proposing inquiries into the character and validity of titles. That court held that a party, whose claim had not been forfeited by neglect to present it, was entitled to the benefit of the possession held under the Spanish- laws of prescription before the cession, and to the benefit of the local laws of prescription. Strother <em>v. </em>Lucas, 12 Peters, 456, 461; Judge Catron\u2019s Opinion, 468, 469, 470.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">Had the United States set up a claim to this land as its own, and it had been held under that title, we concede that no local act of limitations could interfere with its supreme power of control. This has been fully recognized by .the Supreme Court. 4 Howard, 169.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-7\">The United States made no claim. The claim of the defendant' was recognized, because he had adduced proof of title. The United States withdrew all claim to the land, and simply reserved a power to survey it to ascertain its location. This statement of the case shows that the opinions of- the State court upon the.statute of limitations do not-operate to deny a title held under the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-8\">The remaining question upon the bill of exceptions, relating to the construction of the act of Congress, arises upon the admissibility of the Spanish title papers of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">The defendant, at the time (1814) the commissioner appointed-under the,act of 1812 (1 Clarke\u2019s Land Laws, 606) called, for evidences of claim, had in .his possession only the deed to himself from 'Orsono. This deed was exhibited, and a fourteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>years\u2019 occupancy under it was established. The original grant, and the intermediate conveyances, were not produced. The confirmation of the United States was procured upon this statement of the title of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">It is a public fact; that, at the time the Spaniards left the country, many of the title papers were carried away. The archives were left in great confusion. In the State of Alabama no order was made respecting the Spanish records until 1821. The act of the General Assembly of that year indicates the disorder which prevailed. Toulmin\u2019s Digest, 699.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">In the translation of the records, those papers which Eslava had supposed to be lost were found. They show a connected title to Orsono, from whom Eslava claims. The question then arises, Has the act of Congress prohibited the use of these papers in the maintenance of his right ? The Object of the act was to compel- the production of title-papers to the commissioner for the examination of claims. The failure to produce such muniments of title was visited by a prohibition against their introduction, subsequently as\u00bb'evidence in the courts of the United States.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">This section could not have been designed to apply to the case of a claimant whose claim was substantiated to the government, independently of a paper title, and whose claim had been afterwards recognized by the government. The object of' the statute was to protect <em>bona, fide </em>purchasers, or claimants under the government, who had no notice of the dormant Spanish titles. When the-Spanish claimant had adduced his claim, supported it by competent evidence, and it had been confirmed, there was no motive for applying a penalty to him, and his case is clearly not within the purview of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-8\">This view of the statute, reasonable as it appears, was not adopted by the State court. The court allowed the Spanish documents of title as evidence-of the clairq of the defendant, and those under whom he derived title, and of the date of the claim. The admissibility of the evidence was confined in its operation to its effect in establishing a prescription under the statutes of limitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"181\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-9\">The same question arises here which has been discussed in another branch of this cause. Has the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the questions of evidence decided in this case ? The act in question prescribes a rule of evidence for the courts of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"182\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-10\">Granting the .act of Congress to be operative as enacting a barrier against the introduction of any title paper as evidence which has not been registered according to the act, does it ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ply t\u00f3 \u00e1 State court? Can Congress undertake to decide what evidence shall be admitted to support a plea of the statute of limitations in a State court ? Can Congress undertake to determine what deeds shall be evidence of title in controversies similar to that now offered to the court ? Congress has abandoned all claim to the land, and has conceded that both of the claimants have a superior right to theirs. Is it competent for' Congress to dictate the form of evidence by which the title of these parties shall be established in the State courts ? The language of the act requires the sanction of no such pretension on the part of ihe government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">We contend that, when Congress established the title of the defendant, as founded on a grant lost by time or accident, it could never afterwards have designed to contest, or. to furnish its citizens with the means of contesting, the existence of their tide. The Objects set forth in the adjudications of the Supreme Court, as the landmarks of the national policy, forbid such a conclusion. Such a course would have produced confusion, embarrassment, and litigation, when the policy of the government was to promote peace, order, and security.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-6\"><em>Mr. Coxe, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agi\">in conclusion, made the following additional points. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-7\">1. That the patent from the United States to the plaintiff must prevail against defendant, who exhibits none.</p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-8\">2. That the report of the commissioners, January 1, 1823, being prior to the patent certificate of defendant, September 3, 1824, confers a prior title of confirmation by the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-9\">3. That under said act of May 8, 1822, and other acts of. Congress, the lines and boundaries established by the register ' and receiver, and embodied in the patent, are conclusive as to title as well as to boundary.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-10\">4. That, according to defendant\u2019s showing, the register and receiver never did authoritatively fix (the lines of his lot, and the conveyance annexed to the warrant, and to which the surveyor refers in his.plat of survey, had calls which could not be complied with without coming into conflict with other claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-11\">5. The petitiori, the foundation of defendant\u2019s title, calls for a.lot 10 toises (60 feet) in breadth, 26 toises (156 feet) in length. The deed, purporting to be from Elizabeth Fonnerette, appears to be signed by Isabella Fonnerette, and this calls for 60 feet front, 126 feet deep. Francisco Fontanella, not Francis, the previous grantee, conveys to Orsono 1.14 feet in front and 126 feet in depth; and Orsono, in his conveyance to- Eslava, without indicating boundaries, sells the lot which he had purchased from Don Francis Fontanella.</p>\n<p data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>6. Elizabeth or Isabella Fonnerette\u2019s deed calls for John Joyce\u2019s lot as the northeastern boundary; and Dinsmore, the surveyor, in his return, says the front of 114 feet could not be found without interfering with Joyce\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\">7. The original petition of Elizabeth Fonnerette recognizes the claim of Farmer as a prior one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-6\"><em>8. </em>The return of the surveyor gives the lines as surveyed 226 feet by 112; adding one hundred feet to the call of Fontanella\u2019s deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">9. The superficial contents, according to the petition, 10 toises (60 feet) by 26 (156), would be 9,360 square feet; according to Fonnerette\u2019s deed to Fontanella, 68 feet by 126, 7,560 square feet; by Fontanella\u2019s deed to De Orsono, 114 by 126, 14,364 square feet; by Dinsmore\u2019s survey, 226 by 112, 25,312; by the register of location, 7,200 square feet. . These various documents of title are thus incongruous and inconsistent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">10. The deed from De Orsono to. Eslava does not purport to convey the entire property which he had purchased from Fontanella, but uses this language as describing the property conveyed : \u2014 \u201c the house pertaining to me, wherein I dwell, upon the lot .of ground that I bought of Don Francis Fontanella, &lt;fcc., I yield the right of action and ownership in the house I had and held,\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-9\">11. It will be observed that the register says that Eslava\u2019s claim is allowed to the extent of. 7,200 feet. By the fourth' section of the act of May.8, 1822 (Land Laws, 349), it is provided, \u201c that in all such claims where the quantity claimed is not ascertained, no one claim shall be confirmed for a quantity exceeding 7,200 square feet. It is contended that this is an adjudication by the register and receiver, that this was such a claim as was thus restricted as to quantity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-10\">12. That therefore the court erred in refusing, as it appears was done, all the prayers for instructions on the part of plaintiff.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b451-11\">Mr. Justice WOODBURY</author>\n<p id=\"A02B\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">This was a writ of error on a judgment rendered in the Supreme Court of Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">Our jurisdiction <em>to </em>revise such a judgment is very strictly limited to cases where .some right or title was set up by a party under the general government, \u2014 its constitution, treaties, or laws, \u2014 and was overruled. It is this Federal character of the claim decided against which furnishes some justification for a .revision of -a State judgment in a Federal court; and unless it be clearly of that character, the foundation as well as the policy for our interference entirely fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>So we are confined in our inquiries in a writ of error like this, under the twenty-fifth section, to what appears on the record in some way or other, not only to have been set up under the United States, but decided against by the court. Montgomery <em>v. </em>Hernandez, 12 Wheat. 129; Crowell <em>v. </em>Randell, 10 Peters, 392; McKinney <em>v. </em>Carroll, 12 Peters, 66; Pollard\u2019s Heirs <em>v. </em>Kibbe, 14 Peters, 353, 360 ; Coons <em>v. </em>Gallaher, 15 Peters, 18; 16 Peters, 281; 7 Howard, 743. It must, too, be overrul\u00e9d improperly; otherwise there is no grievance to be redressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">As the plaintiff asserts, that such a right or title has in this case been overruled, and that improperly, the burden to show it devolves on him (Garnett et al. <em>v. </em>Jenkins et al., 8 Peters, 86) ; and as the State tribunals are presumed to do their duty, we should not disturb their decisions, even on matters connected with the general government, unless very manifestly improper or erroneous. Carroll <em>v. </em>Peake, 1 Peters, 23; 13 Peters, 447; United States <em>v. </em>Arredondo, 6 Peters, 727; 12 Peters, 435, 436, From the record in this case, it appears that both parties claimed the land in controversy, by titles confirmed by the United States, as Well as by long possession at different periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The possession by those under whom the plaintiff claims had continued from 1757 to 1787; while that of the defendant and his grantors had remained from the last date to the present time, with no interruption except by some legal proceedings between 1819 and 1826, which in the end terminated favorably to the defendant, and left him in the actual occupation of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The British power, under which Farmer was an officer, ceased a- short time before Farmer\u2019s heirs left the country, in 1787, and the Spanish power ceased just before their return, in 1819, and for this or some other cause there seems to have been an entire abandonment of the country and of this lot by Farmer\u2019s heirs during that period of over thirty years; and a new license by the Spanish government was, therefore, soon given to those under whom Eslava claims, to enter upon it as a vacant.lot; and an exclusive occupation and building on it, as if their own, followed by them and Eslava during the ^ame period of thirty years, as well as most of the time since.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The principles of law applicable to these possessions, as existing in Alabama, and as to land held under ancient French and Spanish permits and grants, we do not propose to consider; nor to revise the correctness of the rulings of the State courts concerning them, because they are matters clearly within their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>sole jurisdiction. But with the other branch, of the case, <em>so </em>far as title was attempted to be proved by the .plaintiff from or through the United States, and Was decided against, the course should be otherwise, and our jurisdiction must be good to ascertain whether the decision made was a correct one;</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Under this consideration, it is doubtful in the outset.whether the claim of the plaintiff ought not, on the evidence now produced, to be regarded as a perfect or complet\u00e9 title, derived from the French patent or grant of 1757, to Grondel, and not to be regarded as a title derived from the United States, and to be revised here if overruled in the State courts. Such a title is not to be affected or regulated by the political authorities to whom a counfry is afterwards ceded, any more or otherwise, than any private rights and property of the inhabitants of such a country. United States v. Arredondo, 6 Peters, 691; United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters, 51, 97; Mitchel et al. v. United States, 1 Peters, 734, 744: 12 Peters, 437, 438; 14 Peters, 349, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">And when a p\u00e1rty, holding such complete title, is encroached upon, he should find protection in the judicial tribunals, as he can get nothing by a resorff-to confirmations, or releases, or patents by the political power which acquired the sovereignty over the territory, but not the property itself, \u201cbelonging to its inhabitants.\u201d Chief Justice Marshall says, in 7 Peters, 87, \u201c The king cedes that only which belonged to him. Lands he had previously granted were not his to cede.\u201d And the complete title to them before obtained is strengthened by no confirmation'from the United States, who have acquired no interest in them. Garcia v. Lee, 12 Peters, 519; 6 Peters, 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">It is questionable, then, wfiether the confirmation and qualified patent sought and obtained in this instance from the United States conferred any title, or are to be deemed the true source of the title of the plaintiffs. In this view, it would be a title or right derived from France,' and to overrule it is to \u25a0 overrule what is derived from France, and not the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The language of the acts of Congress on this subject (4 Staiv at Large, 700 and 708) seems decisive on this point; as by it the complete grants or titles are \u201c merely recognized as valid,\u201d while the incomplete ones of a certain character are \u201cconfirmed.\u201d In .the former, the title has already passed to the possessor before the cession, and no confirmation is needed nor rights required from the United States, they having nothing to grant, whether by a statute, or, as here, by a mere quitclaim patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The exceptions or defe'ets in the chain of this title to Farmer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>seem by the present proof to. have been all overcome by entry, building, and legal presumptions ; though when before the lo.cal officers, both parties appear to have been very unsuccessful in collecting many of the facts and! papers since obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">But if, as reported by the commissioners, this is to be treated as an incomplete and confirmed claim, the State court do not appear to have overruled the title set up by the plaintiff, so far as derived from the United States; -They instructed the jury, as to \u201c the title from th\u00e9 United States to either party,\u201d that \u201c both were confirmed equally, and the confirmations balanced each other; and, to decide the controversy, the jury must look to the other evidences of title.\u201d They accordingly did so look; and as the defendant\u2019s grantors, after .Farmer\u2019s death, aiid after his family left, entered under a license from the public authorities, given on the ground that the lot had been abandoned and. was vacant; and as they and Eslava had occupied it since till 1819 undisturbed, and had. been quieted in it again in 1826, ahd' continued there till' this time, the jury appears to have found they w\u00e9re not to be disturbed now by any possession or title of Farmer and his heirs' before 1787. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Beside this general instruction concerning the confirmations of each title being of equal validity, the court refused to instruct the juryj though requested by the plaintiff, \u201cthat the paper title produced by \u201d him \u201c was better than the paper title of .the defendant.\u201d This is like wise excepted .to;</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">But neither of these instructions, .whether the- general or .special one, seems to have overruled any title derived from the United States; which was merely a confirmation. On the contrary, they consider it. as sustained, but the defendant\u2019s title thus gotten sustained also, as well as the plaintiff\u2019s. It is true, they do not regard the former as- better than the latter, and in this view we see no manifest error.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The title of the plaintiff, so far as connected with the United States, consisted of a-confirmation of-the French grant, and a quitclaim patent. The title of the defendant thus .connected consisted of a confirmation of a1 supposed Spanish concession, and a' certificate of this fact, entitling him to a patent, if he wished. Both were!confirmed at the. same time by Congress. The former, then, is n\u00f3 better as to title than the 1 ter. A patent like the subsequent one in this case, merely quitclaiming or releasing any right of the United States, gives no title to the patentee superior to. what a confirmation had given. Thus, in Grignon <em>v. </em>Astor, 2 Howard, 344, the court remarks, \u2014 \u201c It has' been contended by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, that the sale in the present case is not valid, because Peter Grignon had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>such an estate in the premises as could be sold under the \u00bf&gt;rder of the County Court, it being only an equitable one before the patent issued in 1829; but the title became a legal one by. its confirmation by the act of Congress of February, 1823, which was equivalent to a patent. It was a higher evidence of title, as it was the direct grant of the fee which had been in the United States by the government itself, whereas the patent was only the act of its ministerial officers.\u201d See also Les Bois <em>v. </em>Bramell, 4 Howard, 463; Strother <em>v. </em>Lucas, 12 Peters, 411; 8 Cranch, 244- 249; and 1 Howard, 319, 324. After such a confirmation, no patent is necessary to confer a perfect legal title. Sims v. Irvine, 3 Dallas, 456, 457. The case of Bagnell <em>v. </em>Broderick, 13 Peters, 436, relied on against this conclusion, does not militate against it, but merely holds that, a patent of the fee having once issued on a certificate of purchase, it is not permissible to go back of it and to issue another oh the same certificate. See also Boardman et al. <em>v. </em>Read et al., 6 Peters, 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">But it is well settled, that a prior claim, independent of any patent, may for some purposes be considered, and be, valid, and for other purposes may be considered as confirmed by the patent. Carroll <em>v. </em>Safford, 3 Howard, 461; 4 Howard, 462; Brush <em>v. </em>Ware et al., 15 Peters, 106, 107; 7 Wheat. 149. A certificate of confirmation, such as Eslava had, is very different from, a certificate of purchase, as the former shows that the legal title has already passed,, while the latter is merely evidence that it ought to1 be passed. A patent is necessary to complete the legal title in the last case, but not' in the first; though an equitable title for many purposes exists, even under a certificate of purchase, without a patent. 3 Howard, 400; 15 Peters, 93; 5 Cranch, 93; 13 Peters, 498. Again, as both of the titles here relate chiefly to the same, land, the junior title might, but for other objections, be allowed under the act of 1836 to be located elsewhere, and then in some sense be deemed inferior. Les Bois <em>v. </em>Bramell, 4 Howard, 449, 464. But Eslava\u2019s claim covers more than that by Farmer\u2019s heirs. Beside this, it did not originate independent of Farmer\u2019s, but on the hypothesis that Farmer\u2019s had been abandoned and become vacant, and a title\" to the lot is set up also under long possession since, by Eslava and his grantors. The superior right is then to be settled under these facts, and not as if double patents had been issued for a title, existing at the same time to the same lot, and from like sources. There are no other questions raised on the record by the bill of exceptions, as to overruling the validity or superiority <em>of </em>either title, in connection with the United States. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Though in the argument, on the side of the plaintiff, the title is contended to be superior, because commencing earlier, notwithstanding it is broken by an absent deed, and because certified earlier for confirmation. On the other side, the defendant\u2019s is insisted to possess a higher equity, because accompanied by a. longer possession, an earlier survey, the erection of valuable buildings, and the claimant being both a Spaniard and resident when the country was ceded to the United States. But the State court does not appear to have given instructions on any of these particulars, or to have been specially requested to do it, and it is questionable whether the legal effect of any of them, if considered, would have been very material to the title, when both titles were treated by the government and the public officers as imperfect grants, and both confirmed at the same time by the same act of Congress. All the right or title really obtained in either from the United States is a. confirmation of a grant and permit made before the cession, and deemed by the local officers incomplete and imperfect. Yet, so far as derived or held under the United States, each title was of the same rank or dignity and duration with the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Some questions arose at the trial concerning the construction of deeds and other conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In both lines of title, - buildings only are in some instances, nominally conveyed, and not in terms the lots on which they were situated ; in both, too, some, of the boundaries are unsettled, and the quantity of land in dispute by the papers is viewed differently. But such questions as these are subordinate to the question of title, and proper for the consideration of the State court in exercising its appropriate jurisdiction over local questions, and hence not subject to our revision. 13 Peters, 439; United States <em>v. </em>King, 3 Howard, 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Various other objections connected with the paper title on both sides appear, and almost every year some new difficulty is started in respect to Spanish and French grants, which is perplexing, and which at times seems to bring into doubt parts of former decisions.'</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">But the chief trouble in disposing of this class of cases is in ascertaining the facts, happening under a foreign-government, and after such a long lapse of time, and especially when new papers and some new witnesses are frequently discovered ; and the aspect of particular claims is often thus materially changed. Where, however, rights of property have been adjudged, and litigation in some degree quieted, it is much better to regard them as binding, than to disturb or change them, and the actual possession, for slight or doubtful .reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The errors in the law of a case, on the facts at any time presented, are not likely to be material, where the Civil Code is the basis of it under Spain and France, and when that and its enlightened equities are well understood, and, with the plain provisions in treaties and acts of Congress, will lead usually to correct conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Only one other source of title, set up under the United States, remains to be examined. .It is a provision in the fifth section of the act of May 8th, 1822, giving to the registers and receivers in this part of Alabama \u201c the same powers to direct the manner in which all lands confirmed by this act shall be located and surveyed, and also to decide between the parties in all conflicting and interfering claims, as given in \u2019\u2019 another act mentioned, 3 Statutes at Large, 700. It is contended that in 1837 they decided such claims, concerning titles between these parties, and decided them in favor of the plaintiff, and therefore that the State court should have instructed the jury that his title was the better one.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">But we do not consider that the act of May 8th, 1822, and that of the same date which is connected with it and referred to as <em>in pari materia </em>for a guide (p. 708), meant to cotif\u00e9r the adjudication of titles of land on registers and receivers (7 Peters, 94). Those officers are not usually lawyers, and their functions are in general ministerial rather than judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Sometimes, as in the case of preemptioners, they are authorized to decide on the fact of cultivation or not; and here, from the words used, no less than their character, they must be considered as empowered to decide on th\u00e9 true location of grants or confirmations, but not on the legal and often complicated question of title, involving also, the whole interests of the'parties, and yet allowing no appeal or revision elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The power given to them, as before quoted, is to decide only how \u201c the lands confirmed shall be located'and surveyed \u201d (p. 700). The further power \u201c to decide on conflicting and interfering claims <em>\u201d </em>should apply only to the location and survey of such claims, which are the subject-matter of their cognizance ; and on resorting to the reference made to the second- act of Congress, that act appears-to relate also to decisions on intrusions upon possessions and kindred matters (p. 708).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The language concerning this is, if conflicts arise, these officers, in settling them, shall <em>\u201c </em>be. governed by such conditional lines or boundaries as may have been agreed on \u201d before the act passed, <em>\u00f3cc. </em>(p. 70S). So <em>far from professing </em>themselves to act on titles, in cases of conflict, they usually take evidence or settle boundaries alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The map from the surveyor\u2019s office in Alabama, of 22d April, 1837, confirms this. It is a mere location and survey of the different tracts ; and the register of the warrant is entitled by them, \u201c Register of Locations issued for Confirmed Claims,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">So, in cases of commissions to settle land claims, Congress seldom intrusts the final adjudication of titles to them, but requires them to report their opinions; and the titles are rejected or confirmed by Congress, as seems most proper under all the evidence on a revision of it. 7 Peters, 95; 12 Peters, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The language changes in the acts of Congress when the local land officers are to act in any way on titles, and the expression is distinct, \u201c titles and claims,\u201d as when asking them for evidence to be reported, aais some \u00a1mes done in respect to titles. See act of March 3d, 1827 (4 Stat. at Large, 240). Or it.is \u201ctitles to be referred to and confirmed by Congress\u201d (1 Land-Laws, 437). Or it is expressed that this decision shall not \u201c be construed to prevent or bar the. judicial decision between persons claiming titles to the lands confirmed.\u201d Under these considerations, we do not. feel justified in changing the judgment rendered in the State court. Beside the cases already referred to in support of this conclusion, we would quote, as in several respects directly in point, McDonogh <em>v. </em>Millaudon, 3 Howard, 706, 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">This cause came on to tp heard on the transcript of the record from the Supreme Cofirt of the State .of Alabama, and, was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Supreme Court in this , cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
