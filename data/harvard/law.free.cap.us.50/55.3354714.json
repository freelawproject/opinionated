It is true that the income settled upon' him by his uncle was sufficient, with proper economy, to afford, him a comfortable and' independent subsistence. But he found it difficult, naj\u00bb-, impracticable, to divest himself entirely of those expensive habits which he had formed while he was presumptive heir and expectant of great wealth; for Mr. Bennett\u2019s wealth, as is usual in such cases, was considerably overrated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-16\">\u201c Whatever was the cause of his embarrassments, however, the fact was as he has stated, aqd is susceptible of the most ample proof. Whether the fact of his necessitous condition had come to the knowledge of his uncle\u2019s executors, through Mr. James R. Riddle, of Alexandria, with whom your orator kept up a Correspondence, he does not know. He thinks it more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>probable; and he charges such knowledge, so far as it is necessary to make such charge, in order to let in evidence of the fact. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">\u201c Such was his situation when, about the end of April, 1839, he received a letter from'Mr. Riddle, written at the instance of the executors, informing him that his uncle had died on the 24th of that mdnth, that his will would be offered for probate in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Alexandria on the 4th of May, and that the presence- of your orator on, that occasion, as next of kin and heir at law of the decedent, was desirable, or was necessary. He received by the same mail the Alexandria Gazette, in which it was stated that Mr. Bennett, having made provision for his immediate relations in his lifetime, had left a will, by which, after giving a number of legacies to his friends, &amp;c., he had devised the residue of his property to the town of Alexandria. The letter of Mr. Riddle is lost or destroyed, and your orator cannot recollect its precise date, or the precise day on which it was received; but he well recollects that the notice given to him was very short, and that \u25a0 the difficulty of reaching Alexandria, on so short a notice, was enhanced .by his moneyless condition, and the necessity of borrowing $ 50 to defray the expenses of the journey. With all the exertion he could make, it was. noon on the 2d of May before he. arrived at Alexandria.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">\u201c He quickly communicated to Mr. Riddle, who handed to him on his arrival a copy of his uncle\u2019s will, his determination to contest the validity of the residuary devise. In an interview which he had, on the same afternoon, with Hugh Smith', Esq., one of the executors, that determination, which had been communicated to Mr. Smith by Mr. Riddle, was the subject of conversation. At that interview Mr. Smith manifested a kindly feeling towards j-our orator, and appeared to be almost nervously anxious that a lawsuit should be avoided. He did not, hoAvever, express any fears about the result. On the contrary, he stated that the executors had consulted counsel, Avhose opinion was in favor of the validity\u2019 of the Avhole will, and seemed to have entire confidence in the. correctness of the opinion. But he intimated, delicately, that the executors entertained a friendly feeling for your orator, and Avere disposed to act liberally with him; and admitted that they greatly deprecated the delay Avhieh Avould attend a litigation. He spoke much and earnestly about' the inevitable delay and vexation of a suit. He said that a smart and ingenious lawyer could pick a hole in almost any instrument of writing. That no doubt such an one could be found who would undertake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>your orator\u2019s case, and then the will would be thrown into chancery, where it would remain for years. Your orator remarked that, at that time, he was not able to fee a lawyer, but that he could obtain assistance from his friends. Mr. Smith proceeded to say, that he thought a Course might be taken by which expense and delay might both be avoided. He suggested, in short, that the executors were willing to phy a sum of money to your orator for a release of all claims on the estate, and proposed a conference between your orator and all three of the executors on. the forenoon of Friday, the 3d of May, at the late residence of Mr- Bennett, which was accordingly appointed to take place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACM\">' \u201c The amount which the executors were disposed to give for a rel\u00e9ase was not specified at the preliminary interview; but your orator learned, from\" a credibl\u00e9. source, after the release had been executed, and the will had been admitted to probate, that the executors had at that time, and before the arrival of your orator, determined to offer him ten thousand dollars, and no more. He also learned from the same source, and at the same time'j that the executors (or some one or more of them, your orator cannot recollect which) had called upon him (your orator\u2019s informant) before your orator\u2019s arrival, to learn his character; and that (he or) they seemed to be impressed ' with the belief that your orator was of an easy disposition, and not over smart or intelligent, and that he would gladly accept their offers at once. Your orator\u2019s informant added, that to undeceive them he jread to them parts of your orator\u2019s correspondence with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\"><em>\u201c </em>At the conference of May 3d, at which were present the three executors, Mr. Riddle, aud your orator, and no other person, your orator very briefly stated, in \\ substance, that his opinion or impression was that the residuary devise in the will was void, and that he had determined to test its validity by legal proceedings. On the part of the executors, Mr. Taylor Was the principal and almost the only spokesman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">\u201c He insisted much on sundry written opinions of counseKn favor of the legal validity of the residuary devise, which he offered to show to your orator. He conveyed to your orator\u2019s mind (but by what language or phrases he cannot recollect) the clear and distinct impression, that there was but one opinion among the lawyers consulted on this question, or, in other words, that they were unanimous in favor of the legal validity of the residuary devise. But as Mr. Taylor had not stated that he concurred in opinion with the counsel whom the executors had consulted, and' as your orator regarded him as counsel of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the highest legal ability, he (your Orator) asked him, without ceremony, what his opinion was on the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">\u201cHis reply was, that your orator might not to have asked, his opinion; but as he had been asked, he would give it. The substance and effect of his opinion was, that the devise in question was a legal and valid disposition of the residue Of the estate. When your orator, now greatly disheartened, intimated deferentially that he had taken up a contrary opinion, Mr. Taylor said that he admitted that in Pennsylvania such a devise would not be good; but-that it was good under the old law of Virginia,'as it existed at the time of the cession of the Co'Uhty of Alexandria by Virginia, which law; was the law of the County of Alexandria up to the time of Mr. Bennett\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">\u201c But while an undoubting confidence Was expressed by the executors, through Mr. Taylor, in the ultimate result of any litigation about - the validity of the residuary devise, they admitted, and accounted for their anxiety to obtain an imm\u00e9diat\u00e9 release of your orator\u2019s claim, by insisting oh the great importance to the town of Alexandria of an <em>immediate </em>application of the residuary fund to the completion of the canal, more especially, and to other useful and important objects. To avpid the delay of a lawsuit, they were willing to pay for a release of your orator\u2019s claim, however untenable and desperate. Your orator does not mean here to quote the language of Mr. Taylor, but to state the impression made on his mind by the language used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">\u201c It were tedious to tell much inore that was said at this conference. Suffice it to say, that Mr. Taylor Was a man of commanding intellect; and that, under the most favorable circumstances, your orator would have been wholly unequal. to the intellectual conflict in which he found himself involved with one so gifted, and for whom he entertained an habitual and profound respect. But having no distinct or settled views of the legal question thus suddenly forced upon him, or titne to form any, fevered by a rapid journey, his spirits depressed by the recent death of his last kinsman, to whom he had heen tenderly attached, and flurried afid confused by the magnitude of the question he was called on to decide, and the necessity of. deciding it at once, your orator felt himself wholly overpowered, and strongly inclined to succumb to the views so forcibly presented to him. And these views were moreover recommended to his favorable consideration by the offer, so tempting to a man in his situation, of a large sum of money, without, delay or further trouble.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">\u201c In this state of ment\u00e1l ferment, your Orator, scarcely know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ing what to do or say next, asked the executors what sum they proposed to give him for a release. They answered that it was for him. to say what he would he willing to take; and the conference closed with a request on the part of the executors, that your orator would consider the matter, and let them know his decision in the course of the day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">\u201c But how could he, in the time allowed him, give to the subject the, consideration its importance deserved, or any consideration ? His personal incompetency to decide the question, or even to consider the subject in so short a time, he has already stated truly, and without exaggeration. He was so much flurried that his mind could not act. Why not, then, resort to learned and able counsel, having no personal interest in the question, for advice and direction? The answer is, that the executors, by the shortness of the notice which they had given him, or, in other yrords, by appointing so early a day for the probate, had effectually precluded him from pursuing this obvious and only rational course. A brief reference to the facts of the case will show conclusively the correctness of this assertion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">\u201c It was now past noon on the 3d of May, and your orator was given to understand that on the next day the will would and must be offered for probate. Counsel was, in the mean time, to be sought for in Alexandria, where the whole population *was interested in sustaining the will, and where, without .derogating from the professional merit of the rest of the bar, it may be said that the first jurist of the town was committed against him. And ifit .be conceded that. good , counsel could have been had in Alexandria, it is still perfectly obvious that he. could not have had time to examine and give an advised opinion on a question involving above one hundred thousand dollars; and, if not. one of great difficulty, still one requiring a verji great \u00e1nd deliberate consideration. No counsel would havp taken on himself the responsibility of giving a final, opinion on\u2019such a question in the time that was allowed to your orator for his decision. He was therefore compelled to decide, without the aid of counsel, whether he would make the legal validity or the legal invalidity of the devise the basis of his action; and being entirely in the dark, he concluded that the only safe course was to consider the devise Valid, and take what he could get for a release. , But he was required to name a sum, and <em>what </em>sum he should name and demand was the remaining question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">\u201c And here, again, such was the precipitation with which this, important business was conducted, that he had no certain pfem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ises on which to act; for he had neglected to ask the executors, and they had not informed him, what would probably be the amount, after deducting legacies and expenses of administration, of the residuary interest which he was asked to surrender ; so that, while he was apparently offered an election whether to go for the whole, or to take some definite amount in lieu of his chance of getting the whole, it was an election between a known quantity and an unknown quantity. That is to say, it was no election at all, but a mere proposition -that he should guess what sum. he would be content to receive, or at what point he ought to take his stand\", and refuse to fall lower in his demands. Under this duress of circumstances he made a guess, and informed the executors in the course of the day that he would release his' claim for $ 30,000. Their reply was an offer of $\"20,000, an answer to which was required on the following morning, the day of probate. In the morning of the following day, your orator- called on Mr. Smith, and told him that \u2018 he would be better satisfied with 0 25,000.\u2019 The executors agreed to give that surta, and so the matter ended. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\">\u201c The agreement between\u2019your orator and the executors was forthwith committed to writing and. executed, that is to say, signed and sealed by the parties. A certified copy is herewith presented, as a part of this bill.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">' The bill then proceeded to account for the d\u00e9lay in bringing the suit, and concluded in the usual form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">\u2022 The bill was filed in May, 1844.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">In January, 1845, the. defendants demurred to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">In October, 1846, the complainant filed an amended bill, making the Common Couftcil of Alexandria a defendant. The Circuit Court, upon argument, sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the bill, from which defcree ajn appeal brought the case up to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-9\">It- was argued by <em>Mr. James M. Mason </em>and <em>Mr. Cooke, </em>for the appellant, and <em>Mr. Davis </em>and <em>Mr. Coxe, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-10\"><em>Mr. Mason </em>contended, \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-11\">1st. That the codicil which has been' inserted in the statement was designed t.o revoke the 20th clause of the will, which clause mentioned the town and trade of Alexandria, whereas the codicil left it entirely discretionary with the trustees to apply the fund in any rnanner which promised to \u201cyield the-greatest good \u201d ; in which case no lawyer, who values his reputation, would -venture to express the opinion that such a devise could be enforced by a court of chancery, either on the general principles of trusts, or under , the law of charities, supposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>that \u2019 law to have been in force in the County of Alexandria when the will took effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-5\">Conceding, however, hypothetically, that the codicil was but a .senseless reiteration of the devise in the will, let us pro* ceed to inquire into the validity of that devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">And on this point, the appellant submits, in the first place, that the devise in the will (and <em>a multo fortiori, </em>the devise in the codicil) creates, or attempts to create, a trust which is void for uncertainty, and. one which a court of chancery will not. and cannot enforce, on the general or ordinary principles of trusts..</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-7\">In- support of this proposition, the following authorities are relied on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-8\">2 Story\u2019s Equity, title <em>Trusts, </em>\u00a7 979, a; Ibid. \u00a7 979, <em>b; </em>Stubbs v.

Ca. 134.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-9\">But it is supposed that the appellees have little confidence in their first point, namely, that the devise in the will is sufficiently certain to be carried into effect by a court of equity acting on the general principles of trusts, and that, driven from that point, they will fall b.ack. on the position that the devise is valid under the doctrine of charities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-10\">The appellant, on the other hand, will insist on the counter proposition, that neither of the devises (that in the will, or that in the codicil) is a charitable devise at all, according to the law of charities as it exists in England, and in some' of the American States, and therefore cannot be aided as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-11\">Conceding (on the authority of Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Executors, 2 How. 127,) that the Court of Chancery in England, before the statute of 43d Elizabeth, and consequently on comr mon law principles, exercised the power of aiding vague and defective grants and devises, when made for charitable. purposes, it will be shown by authority too strong to be shaken, that the Court of Chancery will not aid any vague or imperfect devise or grant, as a charity, unless it be one of those-enumerated in the statute 43d Elizabeth, to the exclusion of all objects and purposes which are not enumerated, or come within the purview of the enumerated charities, or Some one of them, or be for \u201c charitable purposes <em>eo </em>nomine.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>These adjudications rest on the assumption that the enumeration of charities in the statute recites and comprehends all the charities that existed, or were recognized, at common law. This is tantamount to the proposition, that no defective or vague devise will be aided, under the doctrine of charities, unless the property or fund granted or devised be exclusively limited and devoted to purposes charitable within the statute. That, if any other purpose be mentioned, or deducible by inference along with the charitable purpose, or if the devise be in such terms that the property or fund may be applied to any purpose not within the statute, the court will not aid it. And it will be seen that these doctrines are fatal to the devise made by Charles Bennett\u2019s will; because it does not appropriate the trust fund exclusively to the purposes enumerated in the statute, or to purposes within the purview of those enumerated, but is broad and comprehensive enough to authorize the trustees to employ the fund in many ways without the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-5\">The authorities which are relied on to sustain this position are as follows.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-6\">2 Story\u2019s Equity, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 1160, containing an enumeration of the charitable uses recognized by the statute ; Ibid. \u00a7 1155; 2 Roper on Legacies, by White, c. 19, \u00a7 1, pp. 111, 112; Morice <em>v. </em>Bishop of Durham, 9 Vesey, 399; S.

This is utterly and confidently \"denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-5\">When the County of Alexandria was separated from Virginia, An act of Congress was passed (February 27, .1801), entitled, \u201c An act concerning the District of Columbia,\u201d by the first section of which it was enacted, \u201c that the laws of the State of Virginia, as they now exist, shall be and continue in force in that part of the District of Columbia which was ceded by the said State to the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-6\">The question, then, is, What was the law of Virginia on this subject, on the 27th of February,'-1801 ? The answer is: \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-7\">1. That the statute of 43d Elizabeth was repealed on the 27th December, 179-2. 1 Revised Code, 136.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-9\">2. That the Court of Appeals of Virginia, has decided, that, according to the true intent and meaning, force and effect, of the repealing statute, it repealed not only the statute of 43d Elizabeth, but the whole doctrine of charities, the common law having been merged in the statute. In Gallego\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>The Attorney-General, 3 Leigh, 450, it was well said by the president of the court, speaking for the whole court, \u201c that' a due Sense of the infinite difficulty and embarrassment which must attend the search after the common law doctrines anterior to the statute of Elizabeth, and a just view of the danger of reviving those obsolete doctrines, must determine us to leave the subiect to the wisdom of the legislature itself.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-10\">By this decision, whether founded on good or bad reasons, it is established that, since the 27th December, 1792, it is. the law of Virginia, and consequently the.law of the County of Alexandria, that the courts of chancery cannot aid vague and defective grants or devises, even though they be for charitable purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-11\">Vidal <em>v. </em>Girard\u2019s Executors, 2 How. 127, does not touch the question before this court, which is, What was the law of Virginia on the 27th of February, 1801 ? That was a question as to what tvas the law of Pennsylvania. And it was decided that, in Pennsylvania, a corporation capable of taking and having .corporate powers over the subject of education could lawfully take and apply a bequest for the erection of a great free school) the pupils to be white males, between six and ten years old, &amp;c., &amp;-C-. In page 192, Judge Story says,\u2014 \u201cThere are two circumstances which materially distinguish that case [Baptist Assoc. <em>v. </em>Hart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs] from the one now before the court. The first is, that it <em>arose </em>under the law of Virginia, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the. statute of 43d Elizabeth has been expressly and entirely abolished by the legislature,\u201d &amp;c. And in the same page (192) he says, that it has been decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, \u201c that the conservative principles of the statute of Elizabeth have ever been in force in Pennsylvania, by common usage and constitutional recognition.\u201d And again he says (p. 197), \u2014 \u201cThe case, then, according to our judgment, is completely closed in by the principles and authorities already mentioned, and is that of a valid charity in Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-5\"><em>Mr. Mason </em>then referred to the following acts and cases: \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-6\">An act for establishing religious freedom.

The consequence of law is, that the bishop takes the property upon trust, to dispose of it as the law will dispose of ,it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-15\">Why not make such a decree in favor, of Wheeler ? The answer given, by the appellees is, that on the 4th of May, 1839, in consideration of $ 25,000, he executed a release of' all his interest in the trust fund, and that the release was legal, equitable, and binding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-16\">And so the question is, Was the <em>res gesta </em>of May 2d, 3d, and' 4th, terminating in the execution of an instrument of writing called a release, a <em>bon\u00e1 fid\u00e9, </em>legal, and valid transaction, on the one hand, or was it, on the other, an illegal, inequitable, and void transaction ? It will be contended that it was an illegal, inequitable, and void transaction, because of the partiality and misconduct of the trustees, as set forth in the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-17\">\u2022 But the release, executed under the circumstances detailed in the bill, is supposed to be invalid on other grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-18\">1. Wheeler was misinformed in matter of law, however innocently,, by Mr. Taylor, an old and trusted friend of his uncle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>executor of his will, and one for whom he, Wheeler, entertained \u201c an habitual and profound respect.\u201d He confided in Mr. Taylor\u2019s statement of the law, and was misled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-5\">2. Wheeler was left in ignorance of the amount of the residue, which he was called on to release. He signed the release in ignorance. Here, then, was surprise in matters of fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-6\">This view is sustained by Pusey <em>v. </em>Desbouvrie, 3 P. Wms. 315, and Story\u2019s comments on it. 1 Story\u2019s Equity, \u00a7\u00a7 117, 118. See also Evans <em>v. </em>Llewellin, 1 Cox, 333; 1 Story\u2019s Equity, \u00a7 191. See 1 Story\u2019s Equity, \u00a7 119; see also 1 Story\u2019s Eq. 133, note to \u00a7 120.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-7\">It is submitted that, on the principles settled by these authorities, the release was void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-8\">But there is still another view of this part of the case, which ought to be conclusive against the validity of the release. The question of the validity of the release cannot arise, or be considered by the court, unless and until the court shall have first decided that the devise was void and of no effect, and the pretensions of the Common Council of Alexandria to take under it altogether baseless. The question, then, of the validity of the release, when it comes under the consideration of the court, is virtually a question whether the executors of Charles Bennett, or his heir at law and next of kin, shall take his estate. The only other claimant, the Common Council of Alexandria, has been already adjudged to have no rightful claim; and the only parties left on the field to contend for the estate are the executors, who hold it in possession, but have not a color of right to it, and the heir at law, who, according to the opinion already formed by the court, is the rightful owner, but for the release.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-9\">To sustain the release, then, is to decide that executors have a right to deal with a needy heir or devisee, to practise on his necessities, and to tempt him, by the present payment of a part of what is due to him, to transfer to them all the rest, for their own private and personal use and benefit. No evil intentions are imputed to the executors in this case; but in asking the court to sustain the release, they virtually ask it to give them, clear of all trust and burden, the bulk of their testator\u2019s estate. Nothing can be more clear than that an instrument of writing, or contract, whose recognition and validity would lead to such results, is void in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-10\">To show that the decision of the Court of Appeals of Virginia in the case of Gallegq\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>The Attorney-General ought to .be regarded by the Supreme Court of the United States as the law of this case, the following authorities are relied on.

The complainant has failed to aver his readiness to pay to the defendant the price of the release, and has also failed to. bring that money into court; without which a court of equity will not entertain a bill to vacate the instrument.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-11\"><em>Mr. Cooke, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWB\">in reply and conclusion, contended, that the \u201c town of Alexandria \u201d did not mean the \u201c.Common Council of Alexandria.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-12\">It is worthy of remark, that in this important devise, which disposes of the great bulk of the testator\u2019s property, real and personal, not a word is said about \u201c the Common Council of Alexandria,\u201d the body politic created by an act of Congress to administer the affairs of the town. And yet it can scarcely be doubted, that the name, powers, and functions of that body were as familiar to the testator as household words. It is difficult to account for this significant silence, but by supposing that the testator had determined that the corporate authorities of the town should have no agency whatever in carrying \u25a0 out the beneficent purposes vaguely suggested by his will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>In what character, indeed, could the corporation act, without deranging the scheme set forth in the devising clause above quoted ? Not in the character of trustees ; for the testator had selected as trustees, to carry out his purposes, three highly esteemed personal friends, including an eminent lawyer; three men of whom he had emphatically said, that they had \u201c all the confidence which he could repose in man \u201d !</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\">If that part, in the drama was filled, what other part could the corporation perform ? The part of beneficiaries, \u2014 of persons to receive and enjoy the bounty of the testator ? That were absurd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">The testator\u2019s motive or reason for excluding the corporation from all participation in the trust was probably his. want of confidence in the wisdom of a fluctuating popular body; or, in other words, his conviction of their incapacity to manage so difficult a trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN\">That it was a difficult trust, a single glance at the testator\u2019s crude and undigested plan will clearly show. When the testator described the select )d objects of his bounty as \u201c the town and trade of Alexandria,\u201d he meant neither the ground included within the territorial limits of the town, nor the Common Council of the town. He meant the people of the town, and especially the traders', having been a trader himself during the greater part of an active life. He wished a scheme or detailed plan to be devised and executed, by which a fund of about $ 120,000 should be so used as to confer on the objects of his bounty the greatest degree of benefit which , such a fund could confer on beneficiaries so numerous. Nothing could be more difficult than the conception and execution of the details of such a half-formed scheme. Talents, legal learning, and zeal, he thought he had found in his three trusted friends; in the Common Council he had no right to expect any one of these essential qualities. He felt, himself, that he was wholly unequal to the task-, and he did not think that the Common Council was likely to be more capable than himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-8\">\u2022The result of this inquiry into the true intent and meaning of the 20th clause of the will is, that the idea of making the \u201c.Common Council of Alexandria\u201d beneficiaries under the will is a solecism, since beneficiaries are those who take and enjoy, while a corporation can take only in trust for those who are to enjoy; that the beneficiaries contemplated by the'testator were.the people, and especially thg traders, of Alexandria'; and that the only inference which can be reasonably made from the omission of the testator to mention the Common Council is, that he intended that they should have, nothing, whatever to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>do with the trust, in any character; an inference which is sustained by the fact that he selected others, to wit, his attached and personal friends, to perform the only functions which the Common Council were capable of performing, namely, the functions of trustees. How deficient in legal certainty the whole scheme of the trust was will in due time be shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-5\"><em>Mr.-Cooke </em>then contended that this devise in the will was revoked in the codicil, and superseded by one of a still more vague and indefinite character, investing the trustees with a still more ample and even unlimited discretion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-6\">After examining this point, <em>Mr. Cooke </em>proceeded to show that the devise in the will (and <em>a multo fortiori </em>the devise in the codicil) creates, or attempts to create, a trust which is void for uncertainty, and one which a court of chancery will not and cannot enforce, on the general or ordinary principles of trusts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-7\">In support of this proposition, he cited Story on Equity, <em>Trusts, </em>&lt;\u00a7&gt; 979 <em>a, </em>and commented on the authorities there referred to, and 3 Leigh, 450 \u2014 491.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-8\">The devise to which these doctrines are to be applied is a devise \u201cin trust for such purposes as my executors consider promises to be most beneficial to the town and trade of Alexandria.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-9\">The principal classes in every seaport town are professional men, manufacturers, including handicraftsmen,, navigators, and traders, or men whose business it is to buy and sell for profit. The testator was himself a trader, and the fair inference from the fact that he mentions that class only is, that he intended that they should .be specially benefited. But how and to what extent they were to be preferred, the testator has omitted to say. In this respect, then, the devise is vague and uncertain. But, waiving this discrimination between the traders and the people in general, it has been shown that the people, and not the \u201c Common Council \u201d of Alexandria are the real beneficiaries. It has been shown that the testator intended to exclude the Common Council from all agency in the trust, and from all benefit. The Common Council could act only as trustees, and that office is filled by the executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-10\">It is a fatal objection to this trust, therefore, that there is no beneficiary capable of filing a bill against the trustees to enforce the trust. The people and traders of Alexandria were a continually fluctuating body of men, incapable, on the plainest and most elementary principles, of instituting and carrying on <em>a </em>suit iri law or in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-11\">But suppose that this uncertain and ever-changing body, \u201c the people and traders of Alexandria,\u201d or suppose, if you will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that'\u201c the Common Council,\u201d or any conceivable representative of the beneficiaries, were permitted to exhibit a bill against the trustees for relief. How could they, under this devise, define the relief to be given to them ? Or, if they asked for general relief only, how could the court, under this devise, undertake to define the relief to which the beneficiaries were entitled ? The mode of applying the fund to their benefit is left to the absolute -and unlimited discretion of the trustees or executors. Could the court decree that the fund should be invested in stocks, and the proceeds applied to the diminution of the poor-rates? Could the court decree that a portion of the principal or accruing interest should be lent to young traders just entering into business, and another portion to embarrassed traders, who could, give good security to repay the loan ? Could the court decree that the whole fund should be applied to the ex-tinguishment of so much of the debt of the corporation ? Or is there-any other conceivable- appropriation of the fund or its interest which would not be liable to the overruling objection of the trustees, \u201cthat they do not consider such appropriation as promising to be most beneficial to the town and trade of Alexandria \u201d ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-5\">Suppose that, to get clear of this difficulty, the court were to order the trustees to report to the' court such a scheme as promises in their opinion to be most beneficial to the town and trade of Alexandria, and that the trustees were to disregard the order ? What would be. the remedy ? Could the court do more, as against them, than annul the powers of the trustees, and take the fund out of their hands ? Suppose that this were done. The question would still recur, What is to be done with the fund ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-6\">And how would the court relieve itself from this difficulty ? Why, simply by referring to one of its canons, laid down by Judge Story in his Eqpity Jurisprudence, \u00a7 979, <em>a, </em>\u2014 \u201cCourts of. equity carry trusts into effect only when they are of a certain and definite character.\u201d And to another canon laid down by the- same jurist, in $ 979, <em>b, </em>that when such uncertain and indefinite trust is created by a will, the property passes to the next of kin- or heir at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-7\">So in the case of Morice <em>v. </em>Bishop of Durham, 10 Ves. 542,, the Lord Chancellor said, \u2014 \u201c It was the intention of the testatrix to create a trust; and the object, being too indefinite, has failed., The consequence of law is, that the'trustee takes the property upon trust, to dispose of it as the law will dispose of it. I think, therefore, the decree is right.\u201d The Master of the Rolls had decreed a distribution of the trust fund among the next of kin. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Mr. Cooke </em>then contended that the devise could not be sustained by being brought within the doctrine of \u201ccharities,\u201d because the courts in England would only protect those charities specially enumerated in the statute of 43d Elizabeth, within which classes this devise could .not be included. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. &lt;\u00a7&gt; 1160; 2 Fonbl.

Mr. Taylor said his own opinion was, that the devise in question was a legal and valid disposition of the residue of the estate. \u201c When your orator, now greatly disheartened, intimated, deferentially, that he had taken up a contrary opinion, Mr. Taylor said that he admitted that in Pennsylvania such a devise would not be good, but that it was good under the old law of Virginia, as it existed at the time of the cession of the town of Alexandria by Virginia, which law was the law of the County of Alexandria up to the time of Bennett\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-12\"><em>7. </em>An undoubting confidence was expressed in the ultimate result of the suit.

That plaintiff, \u201c having no distinct or settled views of the legal question thus suddenly forced upon him, or time to form any, \u2014 fevered by a rapid journey, \u2014 his spirits depressed by the recent death of his last kinsman, to whom he had been ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>derly attached, \u2014 and flurried and confused by the magnitude of the question he was called on to decide, and the necessity of deciding it at once, \u2014 felt himself wholly overpowered, and strongly inclined to succumb to the views so forcibly presented to him. And these views were, moreover, recommended to his favorable consideration by the offer, so tempting to a man in his situation, of a large sum of money without delay or furthef trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-5\">10. \u201cYour orator was given to understand that the will would and must be offered for probate on the next day.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-6\">11. It was impossible, in the time allowed him, to obtain counsel. \u201c He was, therefore, compelled to decide, without the aid of counsel, whether he would make the legal validity or invalidity of the devise the basis of his action; and being entirely in the dark, he concluded that the only safe course was to consider the devise void, and take what he could get for a release.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-7\">12.

After making a number of specific bequests, the testator declares, \u2014 \u201c The residue of my estate is left in trust of Hugh Smith, Robert I. Taylor, and Phineas Janney, for such purposes as they consider promises to to be most beneficial to the town and trade of Alexandria. If any difficulty occurs in construction as to any of my bequests, R. I. Taylor is especially charged to give said construction.\u201d Smith, Taylor, and Jan\u00fcey were appointed executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">In a codicil the testator declares, \u2014 \u201cNow in the inclosure I leave the residue of my estate, after payipg all bequests and appropriations, to some disposition thereof which my executors m\u00e1y consider as promising most to benefit the town and trade of Alexandria. Now I leave the same entirely to their disposition of it, in such manner as appears to them promises to yield the greatest good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">The complainant, William Wheeler, is next of kin and heir at law to the testqtor.. \u25a0 He filed his bill to set aside the. above devise, and also the compromise he made with the executors, under the impression that the devise was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">On reading the above residuary disposition of his estate, we cannot but observe the fact, that the testator had no settled purpose as to the mode of applying his bequest to \u201c benefit the town and trade of Alexandria.\u201d The town and trade of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>commercial city are closely connected, and whatever shall benefit the one will advance the interest of the other. These interests are inseparably blended; but they were treated by the testator as distinct objects of his solicitude and bounty. Perhaps no matter could give rise to a greater diversity of opinion, than that which is involved in this devise.. Shall the objects of the testator be most advanced by extending the lines of internal communication connected with the town, such as turnpike roads, railroads, or canals; or by improving and extending the wharves and warehouses of the city; or by deepening the harbour and removing obstructions to navigation; or by loaning the capital to men engaged in commerce,- .or by aiding some other enterprise beneficial to the trade and town ? Shall the bounty be limited to Our own citizens, if foreigners shall do more than they, to carry out the expressed objects of the testator ?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Under this devise, how can a court of chancery correct an abuse of the trust ? By what means shall it ascertain the misapplication of the fund ? There is nothing to restrain the discretion of the trustees, or to guide the judgment of the court. If the trust can be administered, it must be administered at-the will of the trustees, substantially free from all legal obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">But before we pronounce on the character of this trust, it is important to know by what law it &gt;is governed. Is the common law of England in relation to charities, as modified and enlarged by the statute of the 43d of Elizabeth, in force in Virginia? Charities have been administered, both at common law and in chancery, from an early period of English jurisprudence. But the \u2022 earlier decisions in that country are often inconsistent, and of no great weight of authority. The prerogative of the king was invoked as <em>parens patriae </em>where the charity was indefinite, arid a most liberal construction was given to the act of the 43d of Elizabeth; and under these influences a system has grown up in England favorable to the policy of charitable bequests. So far has this policy been carried, that wh\u00e9re the devise has been uncertain or impracticable, it has been sustained in some instances by what was supposed to be. the intent of the testator, or by approaching as near to it as practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">It would seem from the preamble to the statute of Elizabeth,that its object was mainly to institute a remedy where the charitable intent of the founders had not been carried out, by reason of frauds, breaches of trust, and negligence in those that should pay, &lt;fcc. All the objects specified in that statute are denominated charities, though they embrace \u201c the repairing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>bridges, ports, havens, causeways, churches, sea-banks, highways,\u201d &lt;fcc. There are some cases of charity, from their nature, though not specified in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Whether .this policy has been wisely cherished by the English government is not a matter for our consideration. Charitable bequests, from their nature, receive almost universal commendation. But when we look into the history of charities in England, and see the gross abuses which have grown out of their administration, notwithstanding the enlarged powers of the courts, aided by the prerogative of the sovereign and the legislation of Parliament,' doubts may be entertained whether they have, upon the whole, advanced the public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">When this country achieved its independence, the prerogatives of the crown devolved upon the people of the States. And this power still remains with them, except so far as they have delegated a portion of it to the Federal government. The sovereign will is made known to us by legislative enactment. And to filis we must look in our judicial action, instead of the prerogatives of the crown. The State, as a sovereign, is the <em>parens patrice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The common law, it is said, we bro\u00faght with us from the mother country, and which we claim as a most valuable heritage. This is admitted, but not to the extent sometimes urged. The common law, in all its diversities, has not been adopted by any one of the States. In some of them it has been modified by statutes, in others by usage. And from this it appears that what may be the common law of one State is not necessarily the common law of any other. We must ascertain the common law of each State by its general policy, the usages sanctioned by its courts,' and its statutes! And there is no subject' of judicial action which requires the exercise of this discrimination .more than the administration of charities. No branch of jurisprudence is more dependent than this upon the forms and principles of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In this view, we must look to the laws of Virginia as governing this bequest. Alexandria was ceded to the Union by Virginia in 1801, but the laws of that State, as they then existed,\u2019 remained in force over the ceded territory. It has since-been retroceded to Virginia. By an act of the Virginia Legislature in 1789, followed'by orie in -1790, a commission was appointed on English statutes, and in the act of 1792 all English statutes then in force were declared to be repealed ; <em>\u201c </em>th\u00e9 Legislature reciting that, at that session, it had specially enacted such of them as appeared worthy of adoption.\u201d The statute of the 43d of Elizabeth, if it ever was in force in Virginia; was repealed by the above act.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Some of the principles applicable to this case were considered by this court, in the Baptist Association <em>v. </em>Hart\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 4 Wheat. 1. Hart, a citizen of Virginia, made his will, which contained the following bequest: \u2014 \u201c Item, what shall remain of my military certificates at the time of my decease, both principal and interest, I give and bequeathe to- the Baptist Association that for ordinary meet at Philadelphia annually, which I allow to be a perpetual fund for the education of youths of the Baptist denomination, who shall appear promising for the min-, istry, always giving a preference to the descendants of my father\u2019s family.\u201d Ip-that case, the court held that \u201ccharitable bequests, where no legal interest is vested, and which are too vp.gue to be claimed by those for whom the beneficial interest was intended, cannot be' established by a court of equity, either exercising its ordinary jurisdiction, or enforcing the prerogative of the king as <em>parens </em>patriae, independent of the statute 43d Elizabeth.\u201d And it was said'the statute of 43d Elizabeth had been repealed in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">' In the cas\u00e9 of Gallego\u2019s Ex\u2019rs <em>v. </em>The Attorney-General, 3 Leigh, 450, the court held that \u201c the English statute of charitable uses, 43 Elizabeth, having been repealed in Virginia, the courts of chancery have no jurisdiction to decree charities where the objects are indefinite and uncertain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u201c If a trust be created in a party, but the terms by which it is created are so vague and indefinite that courts of equity cannot clearly ascertain either its objects or the persons who are to take, then the trust will be held entirely to fail, and the property will fall into\" the general funds of the author of the trust.\u201d Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., $ 979, <em>a. </em>\u201c So, where a testatrix bequeathed the residue of her estate to her executors, \u2018 upon trust to dispose of the same at such times,- and in such manner, and for such Uses and purposes, as they shall think fit, it being my will that the distribution thereof shall be left to their discretion,\u2019 \u201d it was held to be void for uncertainty. Ibid., &lt;\u00a7&gt; 979, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">In Wright <em>v. </em>Atkyns, 1 Turn. &amp; Russ. 157, Lord Eldon said, that in order to determine whether a trust of this sort is a trust which a court of equity, will interfere with, it is matter-of observation, first, that the words should be imperative ; secondly,, that the subject must be certain; and thirdly, that the object must be as certainias the subject. This principle is .also strongly illustrated in the case of Wood <em>v. </em>Cox, 2 Mylne &amp; Craig, 684; 10 Leigh, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">In Morice <em>v. </em>The Bishop of Durham, 10 Ves. 521, where a bequest \u201cin trust for such objects of benevolence and liberality as the trustee in his own discretion shall most approve, cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>be supported as a charitable legacy; and is therefore a trust for the next of kin.\u201d This was under the statute of 43d Elizabeth. The court said, <em>\u201c </em>The trust must be of such a nature that the administration of it can be reviewed by the court; or if the trustee die, the court itself can execute the trust.\u201d And the court remark, in regard to the case before them, \u201c The trustee takes not for his own benefit, but for purposes not sufficiently defined to be controlled and managed by this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The case of Vidal <em>v. </em>Girard\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 2 How. 127, was decided under the law of Pennsylvania. The court say, \u201c It has been decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, that the conservative principles of the statute of Elizabeth have been in force in Pennsylvania by common usage and constitutional recognition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Akl\">In a late case in Virginia, not yet reported, of Brand\u2019s Adm\u2019r <em>v. </em>Brand et al., the following devise was held to be void: \u2014 \u201c Third, I give to the Rev. W. J. Plummer, D. D., the residue of my estate, both real and personal, in trust for the board of publication of the Presbyterian Church in the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">From the principles laid down in the above cases, it is clear that the devise under consideration cannot be sustained. A trust is vested in the executors, but the beneficiaries of the trust are uncertain, and the mode of applying the bounty is indefinite. It is argued that the testator intended to give to the town of Alexandria, in its corporate capacity, the residuum of his estate. But. he did not so express himself. On the contrary, it clearly appears that the executors were made the repositories of his confidence, and the only persons who were authorized to administer the trust. The <em>cestui que trusts </em>were the- town and the trade of the town. It would be difficult to express in more indefinite language the beneficiaries of a trust. How can a court of chancery administer this trust. On what ground can it remove the trustees for an abuse of it. The discretion of the trustees may be exercised without limitation, excepting that the fund must be applied for the benefit of the trade and town of Alexandria. And if the application of the fund be, however remotely, connected with the objects of the trust, the judgment of the court could not be substituted for the discretion of the trustees.' It is doubtful whether so vague a bequest could be sustained under the 43d of Elizabeth. Without the application of the doctrine of <em>cy-pres, </em>it could not be carried into effect. In Virginia charitable bequests stand upon the same footing as other trusts, and consequently require the same certainty as to the objects of the trust and the mode of its administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>But the defendants insist, that the right of the complainant \u2022was compromised and finally settled, which is shown by a Writing under seal, and under which they paid to him twenty-five thousand dollars. The complainant prays that this agreement may be set aside as inoperative and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">It appears from the bill, that the complainant resides in the State of Pennsylvania, and that so soon as he could raise the means of paying his expenses, after he heard of the death of his uncle, he came to Alexandria. He had an interview with the executors, and stated to them his determination to test the validity of 'the will, so soon as he' should be able to employ counsel. This was before the probate of the will. Mr. Smith, one of the executors, expressing great kindness for him, was anxious to avoid a lawsuit. He did- not fear the result, as the executors had been advised by counsel in whom they had confidence, that the will was valid. He represented the vexations, delays, and expenses of a lawsuit, and intimated to the complainant that the executors were, willing to pay a sum of money to him if the matter could be compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">It appears that the complainant had been prodigal in his expenditures, and that, notwithstanding the provisions for his support which had been made for him by his uncle, he was without means and embarrassed. When the interview took place' which led to the compromise, the complainant again expressed his conviction that the will was not valid, \u00e1nd declared that he should try its validity by legal proceedings. Mr. Taylor, one'of the executors, was a distinguished, lawyer, a man of high standing, and in whom the complainant reposed the greatest <em>confidence; he </em>represented <em>to the </em>complainant that he had sundry written opinions of counsel in favor of the legal validity of the residuary devise, which- he offered to show to him.' His conversation conveyed to the complainant \u201c the clear and distinct impression, that there was but one opinion among the lawyers consulted, and that they were unanimous in favor of the validity of the devise.\u201d The complainant asked Mr. Taylor to state his opinion on the subject. He observed, that the complainant should not have asked him, but his opinion was, \u201c that the devise in question was a legal and valid disposition of the residue of the estate.\u201d At the same time, he admitted that in Pennsylvania such a devise would not be good ; but that it was good under the old law of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The complainant alleges that he had no settled views of the legal question, and being disheartened by the circumstances under which he was placed, he yielded to the compromise. He had but little time for reflection, and none to advise with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>counsel; and at last he came to the conclusion to consider the devise valid, and take what he could get for a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Under these circumstances, the complainant agreed to the compromise. It stated the residuary devise, and that its validity had been controverted by the complainant. That \u201c.the said executors, taking on themselves the burden of the execution of said will, and of the trusts aforesaid, and the said William Wheeler, to avoid the delay and expense of litigation, and finally to settle and adjust all doubts' and difficulties which might arise on the effect of said will, so as to leave the said executors to execute the same without delay or impediment, have agreed on the following terms of compromise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">1st. That twenty-five thousand dollars shall be paid to the complainant. 2d. That the executors shall release to him all claims to any property, real or personal; conveyed or settled on complainant by the testator in his lifetime. 3d. That the complainant shall release to the executors \u201c all his claims, in law or equity, to the estate, real and personal, devised and bequeathed, or intended to be devised or bequeathed, by the said Charles Bennett by his said will, to be held and disposed of by the said executors in the manner in and. by the said will prescribed. And that the said executors shall be at liberty, if any specification of the objects to which the residuary fund is to be applied be thought necessary, to apply the same to aid in finishing the Alexandria Canal, &amp;c., and to subscribe to any railroad or other roads communicating with the said town; to anymr to all of the above purposes, in such way as the said executors, or the survivors, may think most conducive to the prosperity and welfare of the town,\u201d &lt;fcc.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The complainant, it seems, had studied law, but it is manifest from the facts before us, that he was but little acquainted with business, was an inefficient and dependent man, easily misled, especially by those for whose abilities and characters he entertained a profound respect. From the high character of the executors, no one can impute to them any fraudulent intent in this'transaction.'; Looking to what they considered to be the object of the testator, they felt themselves authorized, if not bound, to effectuate his purposes by making this compromise with his heir'at law. They had no personal interest beyond that which was common to the citizens of Alexandria. And we admit that they may have acted under a sense of duty, from a misconception of their power under the 'will.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">But in making the- compromise, the parties did not stand on \u00e9qual ground. The necessities and character of the complainant were well known.to the executors'. Having the confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>denee expressed in the validity of the devise, they could hardly have felt themselves authorized to pay to the complainant twenty-five thousand dollars for the relinquishment of a pret\u00e9nded right. Nor could they have deemed .it necessary, in the agreement of compromise, substantially to constitute him the donor of the munificent bequest to the town and trade of Alexandria.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We are to judge of this compromise by what is stated in the bill, the facts being admitted by the demurrer. And it appears to us that the agreement, under the circumstances, is void. -It' cannot be sustained on principles which lie at the foundation of \u00e1 valid contract. The influences operating upon the mind of the complainant induced him to sacrifice his interests. He did not act freely, and with a proper understanding of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed, the demurrer overruled, and the' cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the County of Alexandria, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court,, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs, and that this cause be, and the same ,is hereby, remanded, for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity to the opinion of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
