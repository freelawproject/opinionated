The laws of Mississippi, which affect and regulate the rights of .these parties, provide that,-until the maker (Gibson) received notice of the assignment of the notes in question by the payee (.Harris) to the assignee (Brabston), he was entitled, notwithstanding the assignment, to claim the benefit, against the assignee, of every payment, discount, or set-off, which could legally exist between himself and the payee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asj\">Howard -and Hutchinson\u2019s Miss.

Miss. 453, Randolph sold land in Louisiana and received in payment certain notes <em>\u201c </em>made payable at the Agricultural Bank of Mississippi,\u201d on which Parham was indorser. The notes were assigned by Randolph to the Planters\u2019 Bank, who recovered .judgment against the indorser. The title of Randolph to the land proved bad, and his vendee was evicted. The indorser, Parham, prayed for an injunction and rescission of the contract, which was refused by the inferior court, and this appeal taken. It was contended that the assignee, the Planters\u2019 Bank, being an innocent holder, could not. be affected by failure of title; but the Court of Errors (Sharkey, C. J.) said, \u2014 \u201c This position is untenable. The statute (of Mississippi) gives the maker the' same defence against the holder that he had against the payee of the note. These notes were made payable at the Agricultural Bank.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-7\">,3. The evidence in the record shows, that on the 18th of December, T841, more than four years before either of the notes of Gibson, which were assigned by the payee (Harris) to Brabston, had become due, and before this action was commenced upon them, they were both completely annulled and discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-8\">It is shown by the record (\u00a7 1 of the Case Agreed) that the notes were executed by Gibson as a part of the purchase-money and consideration of a tract of land and some negroes bought by him from the payee (Harris), and that in the act of sale it was <em>\u201c </em>expressly stipulated between the parties (Gibson and Harris), that it was a sale in which the right of redemption was specially reserved in favor of the vendor (Harris), for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>period of ten years from the date of the sale (24th December, 1839), to be exercised by him at any time within that period, agreeably to the provisions of the laws of the State of Louisiana.\u201d (These laws are quoted in the statement of the case.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ7\">It is shown by the record, that Harris did, on the 18th of September, 1841, exercise his right of redemption ; and hy the Case Agreed, that Gihson did, on that day, reconvey to him all the property sold, and acknowledged to have received back the whole purchase-money and consideration, of which the amount of the two notes now sued on was declared to be a portion ; and .that all the promissory notes given at the time of the original sale had.been actually taken back and were cancelled, except the two notes for $ 13,000 now sued on, which \u201c were not then returned to Gibson, but Harris stipulated and guaranteed the said two notes should be returned to Gibson and can-celled, and to secure the performance of this he mortgaged all the property in favor of Gibson.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-6\">4. The evidence in the record shows, that neither at the time when the notes in question were assigned by Harris to Brabston, at Natchez, namely, the 21st of January, 1840, nor at the time when Harris exercised his right of redemption and Gibson reconveyed the property, namely, the 18th of December, 1841, nor before the time when this action was commenced, namely, the 14th of February, 1846, had any notice of the assignment of the-notes in question, direst or implied, been given to or received by the defendant, Gibson, either from the payee (Harris) or the assignee (Brgbston).</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-7\">No <em>direct </em>notice is averred, or offered to be proved by the plaintiff, or appears upon the record. It is denied by the defendant, Gibson, who avers that the assignment was without his knowledge or consent, and in fraud of his rights, and that he had no notice of it whatever, until long after his reconveyance of the property to Harris, and his release and discharge from the notes in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-8\">No <em>implied </em>notice, if such were sufficient to contradict the positive requisitions of the statute of Mississippi, can be inferred from any evidence in the record. The circumstance relied upon in argument, namely, that the notes in question were not cancelled and delivered up to the defendant at the time of the reconveyance of the property, and that he reserved a mortgage to secure their cancellation and delivery to him, affords no ground for such an inference.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-9\">Allein <em>v. </em>The Agricultural Bank, 3 Smedes &amp; Marsh. <em>57.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-10\">This was a suit by the assignee of a note against the maker, who had no notice of the assignment, and had paid the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>without its being delivered up, taking a bond conditioned for its subsequent delivery. It was held by the Court of Errors, that a payment of a note without its delivery, where the maker had no notice of its transfer, is <em>good; </em>and is protected by the operation of the statute of Mississippi. The fact of its nondelivery at the time might possibly raise a presumption that it had been assigned; but the proof of notice to the maker of. the assignment, is a matter requiring a higher degree of evidence than that of presumption. ' The obligation of indemnity extended merely to \u00e1 future delivery of the note. The fact of taking indemnity, might be considered as a presumptive notice of assignment, but still of no higher grade of evidence than that which arises from the non-delivery of the note, and, so far as it was intended as a protection against payment in the hands of other holders, was unnecessary; because such payment could not be enforced by them, by the terms of the statute, without proof of notice of the assignment to them. The statute allows the defendant, in all-actions upon such instruments, whether negotiable or not, the benefit of all want of legal consideration, failure of consideration, payments, discounts, profits, made, had, or possessed, against the same previous to notice of assignment. This has the effect to change the rule in many particulars as established by the law merchant. The assignee takes the note, subject to all objections and incumbrances that appertain to it, of the kind described in the statute, up to the time of notice of the assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\"><em>5. </em>The grounds upon which it is attempted to withdraw this contract, and the rights of the defendant (Gibson), in this action, from the provisions of this statute of Mississippi are not sustained, either by the evidence in the record, or the principles established by legal decisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">There is not a single circumstance to warrant the allegation of fraudulent cooperation between the maker (Gibson) and the payee (Harris) against the assignee (Brabston). On the contrary, if there is evidence of fraud, it is in the withholding, by the assignee (Brabston), of all notice of the assignment, which was contrary to law; in neglecting also to give Gibson any notice of the non-payment at maturity of Harris\u2019s own note of $ 6,000 (for which the notes in question were held merely as collateral security); and in adopting no proceedings whatever against her principal debtor. These acts, whether of fraud or gross negligence, deprived Gibson of the opportunity to protect himself, at the time of reconveying the property, and also at the time of Harris\u2019s bankruptcy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-7\">There is nothing in the form or substance of the notes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>question which exempts the party who commences an action upon them from the provisions of the statute of Mississippi, The indorsement of \u201c <em>Ne varietur \u201d </em>did not give, as is alleged, \u201c increased confidence and additional value \u201d to their negotiable character; on the contrary, it gave notice to the assignee that they were connected, when made, with other transactions, into which, receiving them as she did, not \u201c in the usual course of business,\u201d but as collateral security, she was bound to inquire. The cases of Fusilier <em>v. </em>Bonin, 12 Martin, 235, Canfield <em>v. </em>Gibson, 1 New Series, 145, and Abat <em>v. </em>Gormley, 3 Louis. 241, are decisions, not of the law of Mississippi, but of Louisiana, nor do they go further than to hold that the mere indorsement of <em>\u201c Ne </em>varietur,\u201d unaccompanied with other circum.stances, does not destroy in Louisiana the negotiable character of bills or notes, taken \u201c in the usual course of business.\u201d Indeed, Fusilier <em>v. </em>Bonin goes to show that, if the notarial act accompanying the note marked \u201c <em>Ne varietur </em>\u201d exhibits a right existing in the maker to cancel the note, the holder could not recover. In State Bank <em>v. </em>Orleans Navigation Co., 3 Louis. 294, 304, a third party was held bound to notice a defect disclosed by an instrument referred to in the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">The facts that the assignment of the notes was as a pledge or collateral security, and that the reconveyance of the property was subsequent to the assignment, though in accordance with the stipulation entered into, by a public notarial act, between the parties to the notes at the time they were made, are equally unavailing as grounds of exemption from the provisions of the statute of Mississippi.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">The allegation that the rights'of the-assignee (Brabston) are to be governed by the law, not of Mississippi, but of Louisiana, because the notes \"were accompanied by a mortgage of property in Louisiana; and that, if so governed, the assignee could recover in this action against the maker,upon the principles of the \u201c law.merchant,\u201d free from all equities he might have, cannot be sustained in either respect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">It has already been shown, that, although the notes were originally made in Louisiana, they were not payable there, and. therefore not governed by her laws. If they were, the \u201c law merchant \u201d would not authorize the recovery by the assignee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">Because the notes of which Brabston now seeks to recover the whole amount of $ 13,000 \u2022 were not taken in the usual course of business, or in payment or extinguishment of a debt, but merely as collateral security for a note of $ 6,000.

The evidence in the record exhibits no proof of such notice or proceedings; but, on the contrary, it shows the surrender by Gibson, from want of such notice, of property sufficient for his protection; the possession by Harris of large property when the guaranteed debt became payable ; and his insolvency and discharge before Gibson\u2019s knowledge of a claim against him.

These notes were given in part consideration for a plantation and slaves in Louisiana, sold by William Harris to Gibson, to secure the payment of which and other notes a mortgage was executed on the property. The words <em>\u201c Ne varietur </em>\u201d were indorsed on the notes to identify them with the sale of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On the 21st of January, 1840, these notes were assigned, in {he State of Mississippi, to the plaintiff, as collateral security for the payment of a note to her of the same date, given by Harris, who was a citizen of Mississippi, for six thousand dollars, payable twelve months after date. In the sale of \u25a0 the above property there was reserved to the vendor a right to repurchase it within ten years ; and it appears there was a redemption of the property at the price for which it was sold, and a reconveyance to^ Harris was executed on the 18th of September, 1841. Two notes on Gibson were given up as a part of the consideration for the repurchase, but the above two notes for thirteen thousand dollars, having been assigned by Gibson to the plaintiff, were not surrendered, but- Harris agreed that they should be given up and cancelled, and- a mortgage was executed on the property to indemnify Gibson against them. The first mortgage for . the consideration money was cancelled. Harris became bankrupt, and took the benefit of the bankrupt act in 1843.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The cause was submitted to the court on the facts agreed, and a judgment was rendered for the defendant. On several grounds, the plaintiff asks the reversal of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The notes were given in Louisiana, but they were made payable and indorsed in Mississippi; consequently they are governed by the law of Mississippi. The law of the place where a contract is to be performed, and not the place where it was executed, applies. The indorsement of a note subjects the indorser to the-obligations imposed by the law where the indorsement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">It is. contended that, under the law of Mississippi, the defendant is not bound. The law referred to is in Howard and Hutchinson\u2019s Digest, 373, which declares that \u201c all bonds, obligations', single bills, -promissory notes, and all other writings for the payment of money or any other thing, shall and may be assigned by indorsement,\u201d &amp;c., and the assignee may bring an action, &amp;c., \u201cand in all actions commenced or sued upon any such original bond, obligation, bill single, or promissory note, or other writing as aforesaid, the defendant shall be allowed'the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>benefit of all want of lawful consideration, failure of consideration, payments, discounts, and set-offs, made, had, or possessed against the same previous to notice of the assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The only question in the case which can arise under this statute is, whether the admitted facts constitute a defence to the action. The facts not being within the statute cannot be set up as a defence -under it. They do not show \u201c an illegal consideration, a failure of consideration, payment, discount, or set-off.\u201d There was no pretence of payment of these notes in the redemption of the property. They were declared to remain in force, and to be subject to extinguishment when obtained. The case cited, of Parham <em>v. </em>Randolph, 4 How. Miss. 453, was where the note was given for land, the title to which failed; the failure of the consideration was held a good defence against the note in the hands of an assignee. That case was clearly within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">These notes, being negotiable, were assigned to the plaintiff, for a valuable consideration, without notice, prior to the act of redemption. That act being a voluntary one by Harris, the assiguor of the notes, it could in no respect prejudice the rights of his assignee. Under the laws of Louisiana, the right of redemption may be enforced against a purchaser of the thing liable to be redeemed, though that fact was not named in the second sale. And when a vendor recovers the possession of land, by virtue of the power of redemption, he takes it free of all encumbrances created by ihe purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">But these principles can have no application to negotiable paper, though given for a thing purchased which the vendor may redeem. The purchaser who holds land or other property liable to be redeemed, reconveys the property only on the payment of the consideration money. And whether this payment be made by returns of the notes given, in money, or in some other manner acceptable to the parties, cannot be material. In the present case, it seems, Gibson was content to take a mortgage, on the property reconveyed, to indemnify him against the outstanding notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">From the fact that the notes were not given up, and an indemnity against him having been taken, a jury might well presume that Gibson had notice of the assignment. But this was not important to the right of the assignee. She stands unaffected by the reconveyance. The indorsement of the words <em>\u201c Ne varietur </em>\u201d could have no effect on. the notes which were payable in Mississippi, and which were indorsed to the plaintiff in that State. Nor could they have affected the negotiable character of the notes, had they been assigned in the usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>course of business in Louisiana. Abat <em>v. </em>Gormley, 3 Louis. 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">These notes were assigned to the plaintiff, as collateral security, by Harris, for the payment of his note for six thousand dollars, executed at the same time, which constituted a legal transfer of the notes, for the purpose stated. On the credit of these notes, it may be presumed, the plaintiff received the note of six thousand dollars from Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">If Gibson be considered as a guarantor, as contend\u00e9d, yet a notice was not necessary, as he received an ample indemnity against the six thousand dollars by the mortgage. But he was not a guarantor in any sense of that term. Harris assigned the notes as security, and, under the circumstances, he cannot complain of want of notice of his own default.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">No demand of the notes, when' due, at the Agricultural Bank of Mississippi, where they were made payable, was necessary. The action is against the maker of the notes, and if the money was in the bank, or if the party was there with the money to pay the notes on presentation, it is matter of defence, and consequently the demand at the bank need not be averred in the declaration, nor proved on the trial. This question was fully considered and decided in Wallace <em>v. </em>McConnell, 13 Peters, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">We think the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings, conformably to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it \u25a0 is now here ordered and adjudged by'this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity to the opinion of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
