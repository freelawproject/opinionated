George B. Graham, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-23\" pgmap=\"354(132) 355(45)\">The county collector of DeWitt county applied to the county court for judgment against delinquent lands and lots, for taxes and special assessments levied and assessed in the year 1884. The defendants in error appeared and filed their objections as to the lands and lots owned hy them, respectively, to the rendition of judgment against such lands and lots, for the special drainage assessment, interest and costs in drainage district No. 1, in Nixon township. The objections filed were,\u2014first, that the drainage district referred to in the collector\u2019s delinquent list had no legal existence, and no right existed to assess a tax for drainage purposes; second, that the proceeding for the organization of such district was not according to law; third, that the assessment was made by persons having no power or jurisdiction to enforce the same; fourth, that the jury was not legally impaneled; fifth, that the assessment was made upon an improper basis, and for an illegal purpose; and sixth, that the assessment was not legally and properly certified to the court.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\" pgmap=\"355\">On the hearing, the collector\u2019s delinquent list, duly verified, was offered and read in evidence, over the objection of defendants in error. In that list were included defendants in error, as owners, and a description of their several parcels of land, and against each parcel the taxes, special assessment, interest and costs assessed and accruing thereon for the year 1884, and remaining unpaid, and including the special drainage assessment in drainage district No. 1, in Nixon township, for that year. The collector also introduced in evidence a copy of the \u201cClinton Public,\u201d a newspaper published in DeWitt county, containing a copy of the collector\u2019s said delinquent list, with notice when judgment would be applied for, and the time and place when the sale of such lands as judgments should be obtained against would take place, with a certificate of the publishers as to its publication, which was read in evidence, over the objection of defendants in error. The collector having rested, defendants in error demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and objected to the rendition of judgment against their lands, and such demurrer and objection were by the court sustained, upon the ground, as the record shows, \u201cof want of proof of organization of drainage districts,\u201d and rendered judgment for the defendants in error. Exceptions to the ruling and judgment of the court were taken, motion for new trial overruled and exception taken, and the record is brought here by writ of error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b355-6\" pgmap=\"355\">Mr. William Booth, State\u2019s Attorney, and Messrs.

What such lists shall contain and show, is specified by law; and as no objection is made in this case to the form or substance of the list or notice of application, etc., or to the list as returned, the legal presumption obtains, that the officer whose duty it was to make such list, publication and notice, and return the same into the county court, performed this duty according to law.</p> <p id=\"b357-7\" pgmap=\"357(162) 358(32)\">It is the doctrine of this court, repeatedly announced, that, under the statute, the collector\u2019s sworn report of the list of delinquent lands, together with proof of publication thereof and notice of application, make a prima facie case, and that judgment is to be entered thereon, unless good cause is shown to the contrary, and that if there be any valid objections not appearing on the face of said delinquent list, notice, and proof of publication, it is for the land owner to point them out and make them appear. In this respect there is no difference between these special assessments and any other tax authorized by law. The collector having made a prima facie case, if there were irregularities, or valid reasons why this tax was not legally assessed, the burden was upon defendants in error to establish such irregularity or illegality. Durham v. The People, 67 Ill. 414; Karnes v. The People, 73 id. 274; Buck v. The People, 78 id. 560; Chiniquy v. The People, id. 570; Brackett v. The People, 115 id. 29; Mix v. The People, 81 id. 118; 86 id. 312; Fray v. Taylor, 106 id. 159.</p> <p id=\"b358-7\" pgmap=\"358\">Here, the land owners, defendants in error, offered no testimony whatever, either in support of their specific objection, or as tending in any way to impeach the validity of this special assessment. The collector was not bound to show that the tax was legally assessed, by proof, until the presumption created by his return of the delinquent list was overcome, and it was the manifest duty of the county court to have rendered judgment upon the collector\u2019s report of delinquent lands, and proof of publication, as required by law. For its error in this regard, the judgment of the county court of DeWitt county is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b358-8\" pgmap=\"358\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
