Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 65913.5 and 66008 (now \u00a7 66020)) as conditions to obtaining building permits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They urge that defendants Hayward Unified School District (HUSD or the district) and its governing board of education (the board) imposed the fees in violation of statutory requirements and constitutional limitations. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The fees in this case were imposed by the district under then-recent enabling legislation adding sections 53080 and 65995, which authorized imposing fees up to a maximum of $1.50 per square foot of new residential development. \u201cEnacted in 1986, the two statutes authorize school districts to require their local city and county governments to impose school facilities fees as a condition to granting a building permit. (Stats. 1986, ch. 887.) Earlier legislation had merely allowed school districts to transmit findings to the city council or board of supervisors that could provide a legal basis for the local government itself to impose the fees. (Gov. Code, [ch.] 4.7, tit. 7, div. 1, commencing with Gov. Code, \u00a7 65970 et seq.)\u201d <em>(Balch Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Haven Unified School Dist. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 783, 788 [268 Cal. Rptr. 543] <em>(Balch).)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The legislation took effect in January 1987 (Stats. 1986, ch. 887, \u00a7 14, p. 3087), and the board in September of that year adopted Resolution No. 8788-15, imposing a maximum school facilities fee of $1.50 per square foot on new residential construction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>HUSD operated twenty-three elementary schools, four intermediate schools (grades seven and eight) and five high schools (one a continuation school), and had not previously gotten development fees through either the City of Hayward or the County of Alameda. A history of declining enrollment in prior decades had reversed, bringing increases since 1984, particularly in the elementary grades. In response to capacity enrollment in some schools and projections of still greater enrollment, the district had acquired portable classrooms and set them up at existing elementary school sites, at costs of up to $50,000 ($80,000 for double units) each. Some elementary schools, or parts of them, were sold or leased in the 1970\u2019s, and one sale closed as late as March 1987. Increased enrollment in the higher grades was not yet a problem but would be. The board, based partly on seismic safety and other concerns unrelated to enrollment, ultimately voted in November 1988 to close Sunset High School (see <em>Citizen Action to Serve All Students </em>v. <em>Thomley </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 748 [272 Cal.Rptr. 83]), although the school apparently remained open at the time of the litigation below.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In preparation for the fees resolution, the board in early 1987 commissioned private consultant Gordon G. Getchel of Urbanplan to do a study of projected new school facility needs for the HUSD based on anticipated residential and commercial/ industrial development. Getchel in April submitted a study, \u201cAB 2926 Development Fee Implementation Study\u201d (hereafter Urbanplan report). Anticipating school facility costs of $2.97 per square foot of new residential development over the next 20 years, the report concluded: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cThe total amount of fees estimated to be collected from residential projects during the timeframe of this study does not exceed the cost of providing adequate school facilities to the students generated by those projects. Also the cost per square foot of residential development for providing those same facilities exceeds the maximum [$1.50-per-square-foot] fee allowable in all density categories.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The Urbanplan report was among the materials made available at two public hearings specially held that summer to receive community input on the proposed resolution. (Former \u00a7 54992 [see now \u00a7 66016, subd. (a), fn. 6, <em>post].) </em>The board adopted its resolution (No. 8788-15) on September 14, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Plaintiff developers paid the fees at issue here under protest in 1988 and 1989. Most fees were paid in 1988 under the 1987 resolution. A second resolution (No. 8889-23), adopted by the board in late 1988, was in effect when the 1989 fees were paid. It was passed in anticipation of statutory amendments (Stats. 1987, ch. 927) which would be operative in January 1989 and which appeared to specify more particular findings than the prior law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Plaintiffs filed separate suits in superior court, each seeking writ of mandate. The court ordered the actions consolidated and, treating each as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>seeking traditional mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085), denied relief in a written statement of decision and judgment. Plaintiffs timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">One issue debated below was whether imposition of the fees was reviewable under traditional mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) or instead administrative mandate <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1094.5). The court below applied the former, and the parties appear to agree now in principle that this was correct. We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Reviewing fees levied for <em>commercial </em>and <em>industrial </em>development under the same statutory scheme involved here, the Court of Appeal in <em>Balch, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 783, reasoned: \u201cAdministrative [mandate] . . . is available only to review adjudicatory decisions of government agencies. [Citation.] Since the school board\u2019s decision to impose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>development fees applied generally to all future commercial and industrial development within its jurisdiction, the decision had a legislative rather than adjudicatory character. . . . Moreover, [Code of Civil Procedure] section 1094.5 is restricted to agency decisions made in proceedings involving (a) a hearing, (b) presentation of evidence, and (c) findings of fact.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 791.) The scheme (\u00a7\u00a7 54995, 53080) does not provide for a hearing or the presentation of evidence, and the mere fact that required \u201cfindings\u201d are made does not render the action adjudicatory for these purposes. \u201c \u2018Although the statutory obligation to make a \u201cfinding\u201d is a characteristic shared with adjudicatory proceedings, it does not stamp the function with an adjudicative character.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Batch, supra, </em>at p. 791.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Thus the action imposing school facilities fees is quasi-legislative and reviewed under the narrower standards of ordinary mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085). We determine only whether the action taken was arbitrary, capricious or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, or whether it failed to conform to procedures required by law. Such limited review is grounded on the doctrine of separation of powers which (1) sanctions the legislative delegation of authority to the agency and (2) acknowledges the presumed expertise of the agency. <em>(Batch, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 783, 791-792.) The inquiry into arbitrariness or capriciousness is like substantial evidence review in that both require a <em>reasonable basis </em>for the decision. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 792.) \u201cNevertheless, precedents drawn from administrative mandamus proceedings should probably still be applied with caution to the review of findings in a quasi-legislative context. Procedural or evidentiary requirements drawn from analogy to judicial proceedings would appear peculiarly inappropriate . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Friends of La Vina </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1446, 1456-1457 [284 Cal.Rptr. 171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We examine in that context then a host of statutory and constitutional appeal arguments premised in part on claims that required \u201cfindings\u201d and supporting evidence were lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">One such \u201cfinding\u201d is of state constitutional impact and flows from section 50076. To avoid being deemed a \u201cspecial tax\u201d requiring two-thirds voter approval under Proposition 13 (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 4), a fee must be one \u201cwhich does not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service or regulatory activity for which the fee is charged and which is not levied for general revenue purposes\u201d (\u00a7 50076). This need for a \u201creasonable\u201d relation between cost and fee was echoed at all relevant times below in subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>(a) of former section 54992 (now \u00a7 66016), which stated in part that, unless voter approval had been obtained, \u201cno local agency shall levy a new fee . . . [in] an amount which exceeds the estimated amount required to provide the service for which the fee . . . is levied. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Stats. 1982, ch. 289, \u00a7 3, pp. 928-929.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Thus the fee resolution had to rest on some determination that the fees to be imposed would not exceed the <em>reasonable (or estimated) </em>cost of the service to be provided, and a burden was expressly cast on the district to produce evidence on point if the fee were challenged. Subdivision (a) of former section 50076.5 provided that in any judicial action challenging the imposition of any development fee as \u201ca special tax within the meaning of Section 50076, the city, county, or district has the burden of producing evidence to establish that the development fee does not exceed the cost of the service, facility, or regulatory activity for which it is imposed.\u201d (See now \u00a7 66024, subd. (a).) Plaintiffs challenged the fees in part as a special tax, but the court below concluded from the evidence that they were reasonable in that they did not exceed the reasonable cost of the service for which they were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Plaintiffs now challenge that conclusion through a confluence of related arguments, but to no avail. First, they argue that much of the evidence presented by the district below as having influenced the board\u2019s decision (on both resolutions) cannot be considered because it was not <em>furnished, to them </em>before the public hearings.  They say that they asked, under former section 54992 (now \u00a7 66016, subd. (a)), for copies of \u201call documents\u201d justifying fees imposition but were provided with \u201ccopies\u201d of only the August 1987 Urbanplan report and (evidently before the <em>second </em>resolution) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>an April 1988 report, \u201cSchools for the Nineties,\u201d written by District Superintendent Joel C. Thomley. We are urged that to consider any further evidence would violate both (1) the notice statute and (2) case law disallowing after-the-fact use of evidence not actually considered in decisionmaking proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Neither point has merit. The statute is procedural, requiring a public hearing. Interested parties who have made a written request get 14 days advance mailed notice of the time, place, subject matter and the availability of \u201cdata required\u201d by the section, meaning \u201cdata indicating the amount of cost, or estimated cost, required to provide the service for which the fee . . . is levied and the revenue sources anticipated to provide the service . . . .\u201d Notice aside, that data must be made \u201cavailable to the public\u201d 10 days before the hearing. (\u00a7 66016, subd. (a); fn. 6, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Plaintiffs say they were given \u201ccopies\u201d of the Thomley and Urbanplan reports. The statute, however, only required the district to make relevant data \u201cavailable\u201d for public inspection and to notify requesting parties, like plaintiffs, of that <em>availability. </em>To the extent, then, that plaintiffs complain of failure to <em>physically provide them </em>with further materials, they have no argument. The district\u2019s director of planning declared below, without dispute, that those further materials had \u201cat all times been . . . available to the public.\u201d The fact that they were not produced at the hearings or mailed to plaintiffs does not appear to violate the statute. We therefore need not decide whether such a violation \u2014 which in essence affects only how <em>informed </em>the public is when giving input to a school district\u2019s decisionmaking process\u2014 should bar a court from considering all data actually affecting the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on case law is flawed, too. The Supreme Court in <em>Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 376 [253 Cal.Rptr. 426, 764 P.2d 278], rejected the idea of posiapproval environmental review of projects as <em>\u201cpost hoc </em>rationalizations to support action already taken\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 394), but here the board properly considered its data <em>before </em>the time of decision. The record was not, as plaintiffs urge, \u201ccontrived\u201d after litigation had commenced. Further, in a case like this, which is governed by traditional rather than administrative mandate, it does not matter that not all data came out at a particular hearing.  \u201cWhereas in administrative mandamus the evidence is generally confined to the administrative record (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (e)), in cases subject to traditional mandamus . . . additional relevant evidence may be introduced for consideration. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Friends of La Vina </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d 1446, 1457.) Therefore, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>review for substantial evidence obliges us to consider all data considered by the board which was also introduced in the court below, whether or not it was presented at public hearings. (Cf. <em>No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 79, fn. 6 [118 Cal.Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66]; compare <em>Shapell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Governing Board </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 218, 233-234 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 818] [reports prepared after agency action are not properly considered].)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Like the court below, we find support in the record for a determination that the fees imposed under the resolution do not exceed the reasonable cost of the facilities provided by them and that the fees therefore do not constitute an invalid \u201cspecial tax\u201d enacted without voter approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument to the contrary hangs in part on a faulty perception that the law required, as support for projected \u201ccosts,\u201d some <em>specific plans </em>for new school facilities. They point to a letter from consultant Getchel, who in response to concerns voiced at the August 1987 public hearing (which he had attended) wrote that, while there was no express requirement in the new legislation, it had been \u201caccepted practice pursuant to other provisions of the Government Code\u201d to develop a list or description of specific projects, along with their costs and approximate completion schedules. Getchel correctly noted, however, that there was no express requirement in these statutes for that information (fns. 2 &amp; 6, <em>ante) </em>and, in fact, advised in the same letter that the board should consult legal counsel on the need for it. Even the later-enacted requirement of current section 66001, subdivision (a)(2) (discussed in pt. Ill, <em>post) </em>would not require a specific \u201ccapital improvement plan\u201d (fn. 5, <em>ante).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Nor, despite plaintiffs\u2019 urging, did case law require a specific building proposal. The court in <em>Beaumont Investors </em>v. <em>Beaumont-Cherry Valley Water Dist. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 227 [211 Cal.Rptr. 567], invalidated a water facilities fee, imposed on new development, as a special tax where relevant data (most of it not in the trial record) failed to reasonably allocate improvement costs among new users or, evidently, to show needs or costs adequately. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 236-238.) The court in <em>Bixel Associates </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1208 [265 Cal.Rptr. 347], likewise invalidated a fire hydrant/water main fee imposed on new development. The scheme there took a percentage of new construction <em>value </em>as reflected in building permits, without tying it to actual needs generated by the projects, and did not limit the use of fees so collected to offsetting new, as opposed to preexisting, city wide costs. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1219-1220; cf. <em>Shapell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Governing Board, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 218, 236, 244-245 [failure to allocate total increase between new and existing development].)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The scheme here suffers from none of those defects. The data (which all appear in the trial record) identify the increased enrollment and attendant new school construction costs attributable solely to new residential development. It accounts for varying density ranges (units per acre) of new development. Population figures are based in part on projections by ABAG (the Association of Bay Area Governments). Development trends are based in part on building permit activity, the City of Hayward\u2019s general plan, the availability of developable land, and higher development costs and density trends to be expected as that land becomes scarcer. New enrollment and facility construction costs are broken down into elementary, middle and high school figures. Data show the district\u2019s elementary and middle schools already operating at or near capacity, with portable classrooms having been added in recent years. Fees are ultimately tied to newly developed square footage (as dictated by statute) rather than to housing value or some other less reliable indicator of increased student populations.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Evidence of this sort meets case law requirements (see, e.g., <em>Russ Bldg. Partnership </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1987) 199 Cal.App.3d 1496,1505-1506,1511 [246 Cal.Rptr. 21]) without the need to show specific construction plans. The statute\u2019s goal is to ensure a <em>reasonable relationship </em>between the fees to be charged and the estimated cost of services, and the data here show that facilities fees of $1.50 a square foot will generate only <em>half </em>of the new school construction costs attributable to new residential development. In other words, the amount of the fee comes nowhere near exceeding the costs. With such a wide margin of error, we do not see what would be gained by having concrete construction plans to consider. Plaintiffs, in fact, do not say how actual plans might have altered, for example, the Urbanplan report\u2019s cost projections. Their concern seems to be that fees will be collected and then not used for actual school construction. That concern, however, is addressed <em>elsewhere </em>in the statutory scheme. Subdivisions (c) through (e) of section 66001 require that collected fees be kept segregated from other funds; unexpended fees are accounted for yearly; if a use for them cannot be shown, they are refunded pro rata with interest. (Fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>With that ongoing mechanism in place to guard against unjustified fee retention, there is no reason to think that the Legislature meant to require school boards to make a concrete showing of all projected construction when initially adopting a resolution. The resolution might be in effect for decades. We cannot imagine the Legislature wanting a board to have decades of concrete plans in hand. \u201cAll that is required ... is that it demonstrate that development contributes to the need for the facilities, and that its choices as to what will adequately accommodate the influx of students are reasonably based. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Shaped Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Governing Board, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 218, 239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Plaintiffs offer some specific criticisms of the Urbanplan report. Bearing in mind that we review the record only to ensure that it provides a reasonable basis <em>overall </em>for the board\u2019s action, we find that none of these criticisms, individually or together, seriously undermine the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">One criticism is that the report\u2019s projections are based on a 20-year time frame, assertedly \u201carbitrary\u201d because 20 years is too long a period to yield accurate results. It is no doubt true, as testimony below showed, that accurate projections become more difficult when long time frames are used, but this does not make the use of 20 years \u201carbitrary\u201d in a legal sense. Testimony shows that the 20-year time frame was one used in ABAC figures which in turn fed the Urbanplan report. We note that the use of a 45-year time frame to calculate public transit fees has been upheld as \u201cnot arbitrary or unreasonable\u201d <em>(Russ Bldg. Partnership </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d 1496, 1509). As was said in that case and is even more true of a 20-year term, \u201cwe cannot state that such long term forecasts are inherently unreliable or are so arbitrary as to be mere speculation.\u201d (I<em>d., </em>at pp. 1511-1512.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Plaintiffs criticize the Urbanplan report for its exclusive focus on permanent construction as opposed to less costly, movable structures. They note that the district had in recent years relied solely on the latter to fill its overflow needs. There is no flaw. The choice between permanent and movable facilities, we think, is a legislative one whose wisdom we cannot second guess. <em>(Terminal Plaza Corp. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 892, 912 [223 Cal.Rptr. 379].) Even if we could, the choice made here seems reasonable. A school district does not have to mitigate fee impacts by erecting only movable structures, and the fact that only movable structures were added in recent years does not change our view. Evidence shows that it takes about five years, from initial planning to occupancy, to build a new school, and increased enrollment had been a fairly new phenomenon in the district. With long-term projections now showing a steady increase in student enrollment, the board could reasonably conclude that new <em>permanent </em>schools were finally justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">A related argument is that the Urbanplan report failed to provide data on <em>existing </em>enrollment or capacities, but this argument flows apparently from plaintiffs\u2019 misconception that our review is limited to data provided at the public hearings. Other data available to the board, including yearly facilities reports, gave that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Plaintiffs fault the report for failing to include \u201csite-specific\u201d data showing a \u201cclose connection\u201d between new development and the fees to be imposed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>However, their citation to \u201ctaking\u201d cases shows that they are blurring legal principles (see pt. IV, <em>post). </em>The fee at issue here is a general one applied to all new residential development and valid if supported by a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and estimated cost of services. Site-specific review is neither available nor needed. <em>(Shapell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Governing Board, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 218, 239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We reject out of hand plaintiffs\u2019 attack on claimed \u201cweaknesses and gaps in the data collection process\u201d used for the Urbanplan report. Rather than brief those arguments, they purport to \u201cincorporate\u201d them from papers filed below. We do not consider such arguments on appeal. <em>(Balesteri </em>v. <em>Holler </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 717, 720-721 [151 Cal.Rptr. 229].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The record provides a reasonable basis for upholding the school facilities fee as reasonably related to the cost of facilities. The fees are not a prohibited \u201cspecial tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Because plaintiff Garrick Development Company paid some of its challenged fees in 1989, after the effective date of section 66001 (fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>we address that statutory change and the 1988 resolution passed to comply with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">A school district is a \u201clocal agency\u201d within the meaning of the statute. (\u00a7 66000, subd. (c).) Subdivision (a) of section 66001 provides that \u201c[i]n any action establishing, increasing, or imposing a fee as a condition of approval of a development project by a local agency,\u201d the agency must identify the <em>purpose </em>of the fee (subd. (a)(1)) and the <em>use </em>to which it is to be put (subd. (a)(2)). It must also determine \u201chow there is a reasonable relationship between the fee\u2019s use and the type of development project\u201d on which it is imposed (subd. (a)(3)) and between \u201cthe need for the public facility and the type of development project\u201d on which it is imposed (subd. (a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">These requirements appear to expand slightly on the reasonable relationship test previously used by courts to test quasi-legislative action like the board\u2019s in this case. Having the use and purpose of the fee identified, the agency has to find a \u201creasonable relationship\u201d between the \u201ctype\u201d of project and both the fee\u2019s use and the need for the facility. In our case, the type of project (residential development) had to bear a reasonable relationship to the need for the facility and the use to which the fee would be put.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">The resolution imposes a fee of $1.53 per square foot (see inflation adjustment in former and current \u00a7 65995, subd. (b)(3)) and identifies as its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>purpose \u201cnew school construction and reconstruction\u201d attributable to residential development. Plaintiffs take issue with language in the prior, superseded resolution about \u201crehabilitation through reconstruction\u201d (fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>claiming that \u201crehabilitation\u201d does nothing to increase capacity, but they offer no argument against the new language, which simply tracks the statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 65995, subd. (a), 53080, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Uses for the fees are identified by reference to a \u201creport\u201d denoted \u201cExhibit A,\u201d which we presume is the Urbanplan report (fn. 4, <em>ante). </em>We have rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that any concrete construction plans were necessary to support estimated \u201ccosts,\u201d and no such specificity is apparently needed to show \u201cuses\u201d under section 66001. The section specifically rejects the need for a capital improvement plan, allowing the showing to be made from \u201cgeneral <em>or </em>specific plan\u201d requirements (italics ours) or other \u201cpublic documents that identify the public facilities\u201d (\u00a7 66001, subd. (a)(2); fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>That language does not connote site-specific plans for school construction \u2014 certainly not at the initial adoption stage of a resolution which might remain in effect for decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The resolution finally reflects, by reference to the exhibit report \u201cand other relevant information considered\u201d by the board, determinations that a reasonable relationship exists between the type of development (residential) and the fee need and uses (\u00a7 66001, subds. (a)(3), (a)(4)). The relationship for both need and use is because new residential development \u201cwill generate numbers of new students\u201d who will attend the schools (fn. 5, <em>ante). </em>We see no flaw in those findings and ample support for them in the total information considered by the board. (Cf. <em>Batch, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d 783, 793.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Plaintiffs rely on section 66001 for their view that site-specific information must be present. The fact that subdivision (a) speaks of a relationship between the use and need on one hand and the \u201ctype\u201d of development on the other, however, defeats any argument that some nexus must be found between the fee and a <em>particular </em>project on which it is imposed. The subdivision clearly applies to decisions to impose fees on a <em>class </em>of development projects rather than particular ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Some support for plaintiffs\u2019 position might appear from subdivision (\u00a3&gt;) of section 66001, which states: \u201cIn any action imposing a fee as a condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>approval . . . , the local agency shall determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the public facility or portion of the public facility attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed.\u201d (Fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em> However, we concur in the position of the district and court below \u2014 that subdivision (b) does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Subdivisions (a) and (b) describe different stages of a fee imposition process. Subdivision (a) \u2014 which speaks of use and need in relation to a \u201ctype\u201d of development project and of agency action \u201cestablishing, increasing, or imposing\u201d fees \u2014 applies to an initial, quasi-legislative adoption of development fees. Subdivision (b) \u2014 which speaks of \u201cimposing\u201d fees and of a reasonable relationship between the \u201camount\u201d of a fee and the \u201ccost of the public facility or portion of [it] attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed\u201d \u2014 applies to adjudicatory, case-by-case actions. Only at that stage could a local agency know how much of a public facility\u2019s cost (or some portion of it) is attributable to \u201cthe development\u201d as opposed to a \u201ctype\u201d of development. Giving the subdivisions this interpretation also reconciles why both apply to actions \u201cimposing\u201d fees. If subdivision (b) applied to quasi-legislative action, as plaintiffs would have it, then its reasonable-relationship requirement could have been added to those in subdivision (a). Moreover, as a practical matter, determining subdivision (b)\u2019s reasonable relationship between \u201camount\u201d and a particular development at the quasi-legislative stage would be imprecise at best. Plaintiffs\u2019 construction of both subdivisions as applying to quasi-legislative action could also leave a local agency without legislative guidance on what kind of \u201creasonable relationship\u201d to look for when relevant statutes call for an adjudicatory stage of the approval process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Section 66001 governs a wide range of local agency actions taken under differing statutory requirements. Some call for adjudicatory findings and some do not. For example, where a district imposes fees on a commercial or industrial development project, a statute requires, beyond the initial resolution-stage findings, \u201cfindings on either an individual project basis or on the basis of categories of commercial or industrial development\u201d (\u00a7 53080.1, subd. (e)(1)(A)) and a chance for the developer to appeal the decision <em>(id., </em>subd. (e)(2)). Second-stage findings are also required when school facilities fees are imposed on a greenhouse (\u00a7 53080.15).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">No second-stage action is prescribed for fees imposed on <em>residential </em>projects like the ones at issue here (\u00a7 53080). The Legislature was apparently satisfied that a need for new school facilities based generally on projected new residential development was nexus enough as a matter of law, without a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>need for case-by-case adjudication, so long as fees did not exceed the prescribed maximum rate. It deemed the yearly accounting and refund mechanisms of section 66001, subdivisions (d) and (e) (fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>adequate protection against abuse, mismanagement and changed needs. That being so, the board was not required to make findings under subdivision (b) of section 66001. Its findings under section 66001, subdivision (a) were adequate and supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Plaintiffs raise several constitutional arguments, none of which have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\n<em>Taking</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Their \u201ctaking\u201d claim rests on <em>Nollan </em>v. <em>California Coastal Comm\u2019n </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 825 [97 L.Ed.2d 677, 107 S.Ct. 3141] <em>(Nollan), </em>in which the high court rejected, as violating the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against taking without just compensation, a permit condition requiring beachfront lot owners to provide a public access easement across their lot. The condition failed to \u201c \u2018substantially advance\u2019 \u201d asserted legitimate state interests (protecting public view of the beach, overcoming a psychological barrier to its use and preventing congestion) <em>(id., </em>at pp. 834-835 [97 L.Ed.2d at pp. 687-688]) because there was an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 837 [97 L.Ed.2d at p. 689]) shown between the condition and those interests <em>(id., </em>at pp. 838-839 [97 L.Ed.2d at pp. 690-691]).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Such a nexus, if required here (but see <em>Casella </em>v. <em>City of Morgan Hill </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 43, 56-57 [280 Cal.Rptr. 876] [rejecting strict standard of <em>Nollan </em>in a case of mobilehome rent control], review den.

Plaintiffs have never sought in this litigation to show that their projects would <em>not </em>bring new students into the HUSD. Nor have they sought to show that the amount of the fees imposed denied them an economically viable use of their land. <em>(Casella </em>v. <em>City of Morgan Hill, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d 43, 57-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">No Fifth Amendment taking is shown, and no separate analysis is offered under the parallel state protection (Cal.
