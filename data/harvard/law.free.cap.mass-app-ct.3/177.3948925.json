L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14) a decision of the Department of Public Welfare (department) rendered under G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 16 (as amended through St. 1969, c. 885, \u00a7 11), denying the claim of the plaintiff which is hereinafter described. The case is physically before us on papers which include the record of the proceedings before the department, something called \u201cParties Agreed Statement of Facts\u201d which was submitted to and considered by the Superior Court,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a copy of what we are advised is the pertinent version of the department\u2019s Massachusetts Public Assistance Policy Manual (Manual) .<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The material facts may be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">On January 10, 1964, the plaintiff\u2019s then husband secured from the Probate Court for the county of Hampden a decree of divorce nisi<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from the plaintiff in which she was awarded custody of the three minor children of the parties and he was ordered to make weekly payments to her of $40 for the support of the children. For some reason which is not entirely clear, such payments as were made by the former husband were made to the probation office of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the District Court of Springfield, which remitted them to the plaintiff until December 11,1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">On March 16, 1967, the plaintiff applied to the department for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) assistance payments for herself and the three children. On March 28, 1967, the department approved the application, subject to the qualification that the plaintiff\u2019s family budget was to be determined on the basis of her needs and those of two of the children who were then living in the plaintiff\u2019s home, and would not reflect the needs of the third child, who had been placed in the Bel-chertown State School in 1965 and who still resided there.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because she was receiving (through the District Court) some support payments from her former husband, the plaintiff\u2019s monthly AFDC payments were in the amount of the budgeted need as thus computed, less the support payments actually received, which were treated as an \u201cavailable resource\u201d (Manual, c. IV, \u00a7 B, p. 1). The plaintiff was duly advised in writing of the department\u2019s determination and of her right to appeal therefrom within sixty days if dissatisfied (Manual, c. VI, \u00a7 B, p. 2). She did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">From April 7, 1967, until December 11, 1967, the plaintiff received support payments from her former husband which were supplemented by AFDC assistance payments in such amounts that her combined income from both sources was equal to the amount of the family budget, as computed in the manner previously described. On December 11, 1967, the department arranged with the District Court to have the sporadic support payments which were being made by the former husband remitted to itself, while at the same time increasing the amounts of its direct payments to the plaintiff so that they would be equal to the total amount of the computed family budget (Manual, c. IV, \u00a7 B, p. 8) .<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Those arrangements for payments persisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>until August 3, 1970, when the plaintiff relinquished custody of the child at Belchertown to her former husband pursuant to a modification of the divorce decree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The department did not give the plaintiff an express written explanation of its actions in rearranging payments in the manner just described. We think, however, that the purpose of any such requirement was met in this case. The plaintiff must have understood the rearrangements from the facts (a) that she was no longer receiving payments from the District Court and (b) that she was receiving grant checks which were increased by amounts which reflected the support payments which her former husband should have been making to the District Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff, although aware of her right of appeal if dissatisfied, took no appeal from the rearrangement within sixty days (Manual, c. VI, \u00a7 B, p. 2) of December 11, 1967, or within sixty days of her first learning of the rearrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">At various times following December 11,1967, the plaintiff, according to her testimony at the departmental hearing, made purchases of clothing and personal effects for the child at Belchertown.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On several occasions she tried without success to persuade the department to reimburse her for such expenditures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The appeal which gave rise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>present proceedings was filed by the plaintiff with the department on December 14, 1970. It purports to be from some unidentified official\u2019s refusal to approve a request made by the plaintiff on November 23, 1970, that she be paid $937.66, which is said to represent one third of the aggregate of the support payments made by the former husband between December 11, 1967 (when the department rearranged the method of payments), and August 3, 1970 (when the plaintiff relinquished custody of the child at Belchertown).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The theories of the plaintiff\u2019s request (which was denied by the department) appear to be that the department, which had refused to include the needs of the child at Bel-chertown in the determination of the AFDC family budget and thus had not been supporting that child, acted wrongfully (a) in diverting to itself the one third of the support payments which had been intended by the Probate Court for the use of that child and (b) in forcing the plaintiff to use for the support of that child portions of the budget which had been intended by the department to meet the needs of the other two children who were living with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We do not pause to examine the plaintiff\u2019s theories in detail,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for a majority of the court are of the opinion that any legitimate grievance the plaintiff may have had with respect to the rearrangement of payments which was effected on December 11, 1967, was barred by the expiration of the aforementioned sixty-day appeal period long before the plaintiff purported to appeal on December 14, 1970.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Although \u201ca decision in favor of an appellant applies retroactively to the date the incorrect action was taken\u201d (Manual, c. VI, \u00a7 C, p. 3), that section clearly applies only to action from which a timely appeal has been taken. The plaintiff\u2019s request for $937.66 was unequivocally retroactive in nature. It sought modification or reversal of a course of action which had been initiated by the department more than three years earlier (and of which the plaintiff had been given timely written [see n. 9] and oral notice), and which had terminated more than three months earlier. We see no error in the department\u2019s denial of the request. To hold otherwise would be to nullify the requirement that appeals be filed within sixty days of written notification of the action to be appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-15\"> The appeal in this case was argued on March 20, 1974, before a panel comprised of Justices Rose, Goodman and Grant, and on that date one of the members of the panel was assigned to the preparation of an opinion which would reflect the views of the panel. In Februarv <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>of 1975 the other three justices were called in to take part in the decision pursuant to Rule 24(a) of Mass.

There was absolutely no change in the total income of the plaintiff. Manual, c.

Nor has she offered to prove any correlation between the $937.66 and the aggregate of the amounts she may have spent on the child at Belchertown (see nn. 10 and 11). Nor is there any effort to reckon with the amounts which the referee found were being paid by the plaintiff\u2019s former husband directly to the Belchertown State School and which he subtracted from the support payments made to the District Court after January of 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\"> We pass the point that the plaintiff\u2019s real complaint (as the referee concluded) is as to the March 28, 1967, decision (from which no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>appeal was taken) that the needs of the child at Belchertown were not to be reflected in the computation of the aggregate amount of the plaintiff\u2019s AFDC family budget.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b200-6\">Goodman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6d\">(dissenting). In my view the department wrongfully denied Mrs. Pomeroy\u2019s claim that she was entitled to one-third of the funds paid to the department by the probation officer of the District Court of Springfield who had received them as support, ordered by a Probate Court for Mrs. Pomeroy\u2019s three children, from the father of the children, only two of whom were eligible for and given aid by the department. The third child, R-, had been placed in the Belchertown State School in 1965, and her needs were not included in the AFDC grant made on March 28, 1967, because she was not living at home. G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1967, c. 658, \u00a7 27. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 606 (a). Yet the department, on December 11, 1967* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>arranged with the District Court to turn over to the department the father\u2019s support payments for all three children, although the department was making payments to Mrs. Pomeroy for only two of the children. Mrs. Pomeroy had no notice of this change until after it had been accomplished.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The result was obvious. Mrs. Pomeroy used funds designated for the two children to meet the expenses of R-\u2019s needs at the Belchertown School.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">On or about November 23,1970, Mrs. Pomeroy requested that one-third of the $2,813 ($937.66) paid to the department through the District Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> until August 3, 1970 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>(when she relinquished R-\u2019s custody to her former husband) be paid to her. This request was denied, and on December 14, 1970, the plaintiff appealed under G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 16, as amended through St. 1969, c. 885, \u00a7 ll.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">I submit that the referee\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d that \u201cthe agency acted correctly in applying all available income to the needs of the family members in the home\u201d and that the appeal was untimely are erroneous as a matter of law (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 14 [7] [c], 14 [7] [g], as renumbered by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3) and, further, that (contrary to the trial judge\u2019s ruling) Mrs. Pomeroy\u2019s claim was properly brought against the department under G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">1. I see no justification for the department\u2019s ruling that support paid for R-could be applied to \u201cthe needs of the family members in the home.\u201d The department\u2019s only claim to funds paid by the father of the children for their support arose under G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 21, which provides in relevant part, \u201cThe department shall be subrogated to the rights to support and maintenance of any welfare recipient to the extent of any payments made by the department to such recipient.\u201d However, R-was not a \u201cwelfare recipient\u201d; she had been expressly excluded from the AFDC grant originally made by the department because she was not at home but at the Belchertown School. Thus the department had no right in connection with payments for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>other two children to appropriate funds ordered for R-\u2019s support by the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Further, \u00a7 21 must be construed in harmony with 42 U. S. C. \u00a1602(a) (7) (1970)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (see <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Acting Director of Pub. Welfare of Cambridge, </em>355 Mass. 182, 187 [1969]), which is binding on the department. <em>King </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>392 U. S. 309, 317 (1968). <em>Banner </em>v. <em>Smolenski, </em>315 F. Supp. 1076, 1078-1079 (D. Mass. 1970). That section of the Federal Code has consistently been interpreted as prohibiting consideration of support payments intended for the benefit of a non-AFDC recipient in computing AFDC grants. <em>Gilliard </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>331 F. Supp. 587, 593 (W. D. N. C. 1971), aff\u2019d. 409 U. S. 807 (1972). <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>State Dept. of Social Servs. </em>266 Md. 162, 165-166, 169-170 (1972). <em>Bourque </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Welfare, </em>308 A. 2d 543, 546-547 (Conn. Cir. Ct. 1972). See also <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Goldmark, </em>366 F. Supp. 947, 951-953 (D. Mass. 1973); <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>272 A. 2d 676, 679 (D. C. Ct. App. 1971). In those cases the funds applicable to a non-AFDC recipient were generally used to reduce the AFDC grant. I can see no real distinction between that situation and this one in which, as a condition of the grant, monies designated for Mrs. Pomeroy to use for R-\u2019s support were retained by the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The department\u2019s brief suggests that R-has no \u201cproperty right\u201d in the Probate Court decree. This seems to me beside the point. Once the money was received by the District Court, it became a \u201cjoint resource\u201d in accordance with the Manual, c. IV, \u00a7 B, p. 1, which provides, \u201cIt is important to determine to which members of the assistance household the income belongs. A joint resource between two or more owners is divided equally.\u201d Under that for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>mula, the particular resource (the support payments) is divided among the other two \u201cmembers of the assistance household\u201d to which they are applicable (the other two children), and R-, who with them is a \u201cjoint owner.\u201d This reading of the regulation is not disputed by the defendant. It is obviously intended to eliminate a time-consuming accounting based on Mrs. Pomeroy\u2019s actual expense and makes administrative sense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">2. The appeal was timely. As is clear from the Statement of Agreed Facts, Mrs. Pomeroy \u201cnever received notice of\u201d the department\u2019s action in diverting the support payments for R-from the District Court. Nor did she receive \u201cnotice of her right to appeal said action,\u201d and her appeal on December 14, 1970, was therefore timely. The sixty-day period, if it began to rim at all, began sometime on or after November 23, 1970, when the denial of her request for payment precipitated the appeal. It is immaterial (as the trial judge ruled and the majority opinion does not dispute) that Mrs. Pomeroy did not appeal the original determination that R-was not entitled to an AFDC grant \u2014 though this is the basis for the department\u2019s ruling that the appeal was not timely. Mrs. Pomeroy had no quarrel with that original determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The majority ignores the Agreed Statement of Facts and predicates its position on an inference of actual knowledge of just what the department had done when it diverted the funds from the District Court in December of 1967, and of her right to appeal. There was, of course, an awareness that a change had occurred soon after December 11, 1967, though whether that was sufficient notice to her of the ramifications of the department\u2019s action seems to me highly dubious. See <em>Vargas </em>v. <em>Trainor, </em>508 F. 2d 485, 489-490 (7th Cir. 1974). But, with all respect, I find no basis for an inference that Mrs. Pomeroy was even aware of her right to appeal prior to November 23, 1970, at which time she went to an OEO office.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>In any event, the regulations are clear. The Manual provides for <em>written notice </em>of the right to appeal an action of the department.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And this requirement is also mandated by the Federal regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It seems to me particularly important that there be strict adherence to these provisions. Persons subject to the welfare program are not apt to be sophisticated in the ways of a bureaucracy. The response to a change made by the department without explanation is hardly likely to be a telephone call to a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">3. Further, the appeal was properly filed under G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 16.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The regulations give this section an expansive application. Thus the Manual, c. VI, \u00a7 B, p. 1 (\u201cComplaint and Appeal Procedures: Appeals\u201d), provides, under the heading \u201cBasis of Appeal,\u201d that an \u201c [a] pplicant or recipient has the right of appeal when he is dissatisfied for any of the following reasons: ... (7) Assistance seems inadequate. (8) Agency policy as it affects his situation \u2014 \u201d Also, the Manual, c. VI, \u00a7 A, p. 1 (\u201cComplaint and Appeal Procedures: Inquiries and Complaints\u201d), provides that if a \u201ccomplaint\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201ccannot be adjusted... the individual... should be informed of the right to appeal and have a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>hearing or review without a hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even at its narrowest, it can hardly be said that receipt of amounts less than those to which a recipient is entitled can be said to be \u201cadequate.\u201d Administrative appeals have generally been allowed in other jurisdictions in similar situations. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>272 A. 2d 676, 678 (D. C. Ct. App. 1971); <em>Bourque </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Welfare, </em>308 A. 2d 543, 545 (Conn. Cir. Ct. 1972); <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>State Dept. of Social Servs. </em>266 Md. 162, 164-165 (1972). And such an appeal would seem to be required by the Federal regulations. See 45 C. F. R. \u00a7 205.10 (a) (5) (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Accordingly, I would set aside the decision of the department and order (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 [7], as renumbered by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3) that the department take such steps as may be necessary to effect the payment to Mrs. Pomeroy of the sum of $937.66 (see fn. 3), the stipulated amount due retroactively. <em>Bourque </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Welfare, supra, </em>at 547. See <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>345 F. Supp. 666, 675 (N. D. 111. 1972), vacated on other grounds sub nom. <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>412 U. S. 914 (1973); Manual, c. VI, \u00a7 C, p. 3. Interest on that sum should be computed from the date of the filing of the administrative appeal on December 14, 1970. <em>Massachusetts Gen.

The majority opinion indicates some doubt whether the amount is correct and whether some adjustment may not be necessary (1) because the referee stated in her decision that after January 29, 1970, the father paid for R-\u2019s needs directly to the Belchertown School, deducting her share from his support payments (majority opinion, fn. 12), and (2) because at some time $100 was paid to Mrs. Pomeroy by the department in connection with R-\u2019s needs (majority opinion, fn. 11). A short answer is that the amount of $937.66 is stipulated in the Agreed Statement of Facts, which characterizes it as \u201cpaid into the Welfare Department for the support of R-....\u201d Further, however, this amount derives from District Court ledger sheets attached to the Petition for Review which were apparently at the hearing before the referee (\u201cThe records we have @ere, is what we received from the court... [ljedger sheets....\u201d). <em>A</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">1. The referee\u2019s statement is not borne out by the transcript. A letter dated January 29, 1970, from the District Court, included in the transcript, merely says that \u201c[h]e [the father] intends to provide support and clothing for his child in Belchertown directly between he and the child.\u201d Mrs. Pomeroy testified that \u201cBelchertown never got any money. Never got any at all.... Dr. Bowser [of Belchertown] wouldn\u2019t agree with [the arrangement] ....\u201d Nor do the ledger sheets, as I read them, supply any additional light. Thus the Agreed Statement of Facts stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>lates that Mrs. Pomeroy \u201cpaid the expense of R-\u2019s personal needs\u201d until\" August 3, 1970. In any event, the referee\u2019s statement, if accepted (though contrary to the Agreed Statement of Facts), would merely require a recalculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">2. It is not clear just when the $100 was paid, and it was apparently not deemed of sufficient significance to be mentioned in the Agreed Statement of Facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b202-14\"> The statute provided in relevant part: \u201cAny person aggrieved by the failure of the department to render adequate aid or assistance under any program of aid or assistance administered by the department ... shall have a right to a hearing, after due notice, upon appeal to the commissioner of public welfare.
