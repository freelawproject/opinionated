See Mass. RCiv.P. 1A, subpar. 3, 365 Mass. 731 (1974). The amount of the judgment consisted of three elements, each of which is challenged by the defendant: (1) $10,500 as the agreed-upon price for construction work to be performed by the plaintiff under its subcontract with the defendant; (2) $2,541.81 as damages caused by the defendant\u2019s delays in furnishing materials necessary to the plaintiff\u2019s performance of the subcontract; and (3) $341.11 for extra work performed by the plaintiff. The trial judge filed written findings and rulings, and the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">1. The defendant first contends that the judge was plainly wrong (see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>366 Mass. 197, 200 [1974]) in finding that the plaintiff had \u201cperformed the [sub] contract.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">While the evidence of performance as presented by the plaintiff was so sparse and disjointed as to bring the plaintiff dangerously close to a failure of proof, we cannot say that the evidence was so deficient as to render the judge\u2019s finding plainly wrong. The plaintiff\u2019s field superintendent testified that he was familiar with the plans and specifications; and the trial judge could have inferred performance from the testimony that \u201c[w]e erected the pre-cast,\u201d that on being asked \u201c[w]hen was the job completed\u201d he answered \u201c[a]round the twenty-ninth of October\u201d \u2014 with some \u201ccorrective\u201d work done later \u2014 and that \u201cthe job ended\u201d sometime in November when he made a \u201cfinal inspection\u201d in order \u201cto wrap up ... [the] job.\u201d Other testimony by the field superintendent and testimony by an officer of the defendant called by the plaintiff also yielded some support for the trial judge\u2019s finding. The defendant introduced no evidence to the contrary, or even attempted to elicit any such evidence through cross-examination or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">2. The defendant next contends that there was error in so much of the judgment as allowed recovery of expenses incurred by the plaintiff because of the defendant\u2019s delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>on several occasions in furnishing materials required for the performance of the plaintiff\u2019s work. The contention is without merit. It is clear from the subcontract, as amended by a letter agreement signed by the presidents of both parties, that the subcontract price was \u201cbased on continuous operation\u201d by the plaintiff\u2019s crew at the job site and that the transportation of materials to the site by the defendant was to be \u201cscheduled ... for arrival time to avoid any delays in unloading of materials.\u201d Cf. <em>Chas. T. Main, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy. </em>347 Mass. 154, 162-164 (1964). The plaintiff\u2019s field superintendent testified that a schedule had been agreed upon orally with the defendant\u2019s general manager by which the defendant would \u201chave a continuous flow of trucks on the job,\u201d beginning at 8:00 a.m. with \u201cat least two [trucks] an hour.\u201d He also testified that the defendant failed to meet that schedule and that as a result the plaintiff\u2019s crew and equipment remained idle for approximately nine hours. Thus, the evidence supported the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had broken the subcontract in this regard and was liable to the plaintiff for the damages caused thereby. <em>P. A. Dolan Co. </em>v. <em>P. S. Thorsen Co. of Massachusetts, </em>324 Mass. 376, 377-378 (1949). Cf. <em>Quentin Vespa Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Construction Serv. Co. </em>343 Mass. 547, 553-554 (1962) .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">3. However, the plaintiff\u2019s claim in the amount of $341.11 for the extra work which it allegedly performed beyond the scope of the contract must be measured by the fair value of the work; the plaintiff introduced no evidence whatsoever of such value. Nor did the plaintiff indicate in any way how the sum was computed. That claim must therefore be excluded from the judgment. <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Steadman, </em>269 Mass. 250, 251 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>4. Accordingly the judgment is to be modified by substituting the principal sum of $13,041.81 for the sum of $13,382.92 and by making appropriate adjustments in interest. As so modified the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\"> We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s argument that the superintendent\u2019s testimony in respect to the delays was inadmissible and should have been struck; the terms of the amended subcontract and the evidence of the oral scheduling agreement with the defendant\u2019s general manager provided an ample foundation for the superintendent\u2019s challenged testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
