Cain (Patrick) and Airport Express, Inc. (Airport) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from a final judgment in an action against John G. Cain, Jr. (John), in which the plaintiffs sought (among other things) declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and an accounting. The case was tried before a judge who filed \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order for Judgment\u201d (Mass. R.Civ.P. 52[a]). The evidence is reported. Our summary of the facts is taken primarily from the trial judge\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ings and from those factual allegations made by the plaintiffs in their bill of complaint that were admitted by the defendant in his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Patrick and John are brothers and the sole stockholders in Airport, a Massachusetts corporation engaged in the trucking business at the Boston airport (Logan). They each hold 50% of the outstanding shares. Patrick is the president and a director of Airport. John is treasurer, clerk, and a director.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In 1969 Patrick purchased Airport, an existing corporation, for $9,500. One of Airport\u2019s principal assets at that time, which it still possesses, was a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission (referred to as \u201cICC rights\u201d) which relates to Airport\u2019s authority to carry goods throughout Massachusetts. About six months later, John went to work for Airport. On August 10,1971, Patrick and John executed a document entitled \u201cArticles of Copartnership.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 29,1971, Patrick executed and delivered to John a \u201cbill of sale\u201d under seal for fifty shares of Airport stock (constituting 50% of the outstanding shares) reciting receipt of \u201cone ($1.00) dollar and other valuable consideration.\u201d Sometime in 1972 John was elected treasurer, clerk, and a director of Airport. From that time until the present the directors of Airport have been Patrick, Susanne Cain (Patrick\u2019s wife), John, and Esther D. Cain (John\u2019s wife).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>From 1972 until May, 1973, John borrowed amounts from Airport totalling $4,000. No portion of this sum has been repaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Under date of March 11, 1972, John delivered a letter to Patrick stating that \u201ceffective immediately I am hereby cancelling all contractual agreements between us____The termination includes any and all written or verbal agreements of any type____\u201d In a separate letter sent on the same date, John, \u201c[i]n accordance with the terms of the by-laws for Airport\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, offered to sell his shares to the corporation; this offer was not accepted by Airport.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The corporation continued to operate as previously without change in officers and directors and with John and Patrick drawing equal salaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">As of May 17, 1974, Novo Airfreight (Novo), a freight forwarder which accounted for a substantial part of Airport\u2019s business, terminated its agreement with Airport.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On or about the same date, John activated Airfreight Specials (Specials), a proprietorship of which he was the sole owner. Specials is a tenant, rent free, in Novo\u2019s space. Since then, 25% or 30% of Novo\u2019s business has been given to Specials, while Airport\u2019s share of Novo\u2019s business has declined from 50% to 7% or 10%. Two truck drivers left the employ of Airport in mid-May, 1974, and are now employed by Specials. There was conflicting testimony at trial whether Specials had taken over another of Airport\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">There was also conflicting testimony as to access to corporate books and records and the corporate checkbook. Patrick claimed that John had denied him access to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>records, while John testified that Patrick had never requested such access. Finally there was a conflict as to the amount of time John devoted to Airport\u2019s affairs, with John testifying that in 1974 on the average he worked twelve to fifteen hours a day for Airport, while Patrick testified that during that period John only kept the books and did the billing and occasionally came into the office for two or three hours.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The final judgment granted relief only to the extent of requiring repayment of the $4,000 borrowed by John from Airport and declaring that the vote on May 11, 1974, (fn. 4) to have Airport purchase John\u2019s shares was voidable by the corporation. The defendant did not appeal, and we do not disturb that much of the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Patrick contends that he also is entitled to the retransfer of the 50% stock interest held by John and to damages arising out of the breach of the partnership agreement \u2014 both to be effected by way of a \u201cpartnership accounting.\u201d Airport asks that John be enjoined from competing with Airport, for damages arising out of past competition and \u201cother [\u201cinimical\u201d] actions,\u201d for the return of salary payments made to John from July 27, 1973, and for counsel fees to be paid by John. Patrick also asks for an injunction giving him access to the corporate books and records and the corporate checkbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">I. The Partnership Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Patrick\u2019s claims are based on the partnership agreement (fn. 2) which, he claims, John breached and of which, he contends, the transfer of stock was a part. However, the trial judge found (in his \u201crulings of law\u201d; <em>Commercial Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Mortgage &amp; Loan Co. Inc. </em>276 Mass. 335, 338 [1931]) that the partnership agreement, which contained \u201cno time limit or term for the duration of the partnership [or] ... provision as to how the partnership can be terminated,\u201d was dissolved on March 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>1972, the date of the letter from John to Patrick. See G. L. c. 108A, \u00a731(1) (b). He also found that \u201cthere was no agreement or understanding between the brothers that the transfer of the 50% interest in the enterprise was conditioned on the continued operation of the partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">These findings are not clearly erroneous. Mass. RCiv.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). They are based on the face of the documents \u2014 the partnership agreement, the letter terminating it, the bill of sale, and the stock certificate. The trial judge could rely on them and discount, as he did, the confused and conflicting testimony on which Patrick seeks to rely. Nor was the trial judge required to find a waiver of the termination notice from the fact that the parties did not appear to have changed their method of operation after the notice. Their method of operation was as consistent with their relationship as joint stockholders in Airport as with a partnership. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>171 Mass. 318 (1898), on which the plaintiffs rely, is inapposite. There the court <em>sustained </em>a finding by a single justice of waiver of a notice based on <em>inconsistent </em>conduct. Whether a finding in this case that there had been a waiver of the termination notice might also have been sustained (which we need not decide) , is immaterial. Cf. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass. 608, 614-615 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Though technically upon the termination of the partnership by the letter of March 11, 1972, Patrick became entitled to an accounting (G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 43), this does not aid him in his claim to John\u2019s stock which, on the trial judge\u2019s findings, was not a partnership asset or in any way affected by the termination of the partnership. Further, the damage claims are based on events which occurred after the letter of termination. The plaintiffs\u2019 brief refers to various grievances, none of which appears to have occurred before May, 1973 \u2014 the earliest date to which the plaintiffs\u2019 brief points.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>II. The Corporate Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The claims against John as shareholder, officer, and director of Airport stand quite differently, particularly in view of the recent case of <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc. </em>367 Mass. 578 (1975), in which the Supreme Judicial Court dealt with a close corporation, of which Airport is an obvious example. \u201c[T]he enterprise remains one in which ownership is limited to the original parties... in which ownership and management are in the same hands, and in which the owners are quite dependent on one another for the success of the enterprise.\u201d <em>Donahue </em>case at 587. The court there held that \u201cstockholders in the close corporation owe one another substantially the same fiduciary duty in the operation of the enterprise that partners owe to one another... [and] this strict good faith standard [measures] ... their duty of loyalty to the other stockholders and to the corporation\u201d (footnotes omitted). <em>Donahue </em>case at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The <em>Donahue </em>case, moreover, builds on and finds support in such cases as <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass. 608 (1962), and <em>Samia </em>v. <em>Central Oil Co. of Worcester, </em>339 Mass. 101 (1959), in which close corporations under particular circumstances were assimilated to partnerships or joint ventures in measuring the fiduciary duty owed to the corporation by a stockholder, officer, and director of the corporation. Thus in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass, at 617, the court sustained the claim in a stockholder\u2019s derivative suit that the defendant, a director and officer of the cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>poration, who was also the operating shareholder, had \u201cattempt [ed] to seize for his own benefit an advantageous opportunity which belonged to Polytop [the corporation]\u201d and restricted the defendant\u2019s competition with the corporation. The court said, \u201cDoubtless, while any joint venture in corporate form continued and while Jennings [the defendant] was a director and officer of Poly top, Jennings and his wife were bound to act only in its best interests.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>case at 620. See <em>Samia </em>v. <em>Central Oil Co. of Worcester, supra, </em>at 122 (the defendants, who were also shareholders, \u201cwere not free, as directors of Central, to take wholly for themselves a business opportunity of Central\u201d). Whatever the limitation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the extension in the <em>Donahue </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at 597, of \u201cthis strict duty of loyalty to all stockholders in close corporations,\u201d that duty seems to us to be particularly applicable to the circumstances in this case, and we look to partnership law to assess John\u2019s duty to Airport and whether he breached it when he organized Specials, hired former Airport employees, and took much of Novo\u2019s business away from Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Such competition is a clear violation of the fiduciary duty owed by one partner to another. \u201c[T]he general rule [is] that a partner will not be permitted to obtain for himself profits arising from carrying on a separate business of the same nature as that of the firm... but must account to his copartner for the benefits derived therefrom.\u201d <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>213 Mass. 303, 306 (1913). <em>Shulkin </em>v. <em>Shulkin, </em>301 Mass. 184, 192-193 (1938). Henn, Corporations, \u00a722, p. 54 (2d ed. 1970). Crane and Bromberg, Partnership, \u00a7 68, p. 391 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Indeed, John\u2019s acquisition of Novo\u2019s business, formerly enjoyed by Airport, whether viewed as the appropriation of a corporate opportunity or direct competition with Airport (see Henn, Corporations, \u00a7 236, p. 459 [1970]) is, in the circumstances of this case \u2014 quite apart from his posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>tion as a stockholder in a close corporation \u2014 a violation of John\u2019s duty as an officer and director \u201creasonably to protect the interests of the corporation.\u201d <em>Production Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>327 Mass. 372, 377 (1951), in which an officer was held responsible to the plaintiff corporation for profits he had made through another corporation (wholly owned by him) from the manufacture of a saw-sharpening machine. The plaintiff corporation could recover because (though then manufacturing heavier machinery) it was equipped to make the machine and was contemplating expanding into the manufacture of this type of machine \u2014 something less drastic than the direct competition in this case which \u201cprevent [ed] or hinder [ed] the corporation in effecting the purposes of its creation.\u201d <em>Lincoln Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>309 Mass. 417, 421 (1941) (dictum). <em>Weis-mann </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>338 Mass. 502, 505 (1959) (indicating as a consideration whether \u201cthe corporate charter powers were broad enough to include sales activity of the type and on the scale undertaken\u201d). <em>Anderson Corp. </em>v. <em>Blanch, </em>340 Mass. 43, 50 (1959) (holding that in establishing a competing company the defendant \u201cdid not five up to his fiduciary relation as a general corporate officer to the corporation\u201d). <em>Rosenblum </em>v. <em>Judson Engr. Corp. </em>99 N. H. 267, 273 (1954). See <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Durfee &amp; Canning, Inc. </em>323 Mass. 187, 193, 199-203 (1948); Note, Fiduciary Duty of Officers and Directors Not to Compete with the Corporation, 54 Harv. L. Rev. 1191, 1197-1198 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The competition in this case is quite different from the type of activity in which an officer or director of a corporation may be expected to engage as \u201ca natural concession to commercial practice\u201d (see Note, 54 Harv. L. Rev. at 1197) where the office or directorship is not in a close corporation and is not a full-time job. Here one of John\u2019s duties to Airport was, he testified, as a salesman to promote for Airport the very business he had appropriated for himself. Further, he testified that another of his duties was to collect receivables, and this placed him in conflict with his personal interest in keeping for himself Novo\u2019s good will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>and business since Novo was in debt to Airport, the exact amount of which was in question.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">John\u2019s appropriation of Novo\u2019s business is not excused by the trial judge\u2019s findings that \u201cAirport lost this business because Novo Airfreight was dissatisfied with Patrick as his attitude was one of non-cooperation [and that] [f]or six or seven months prior to May, 1974 Novo Airfreight was looking for a carrier to replace Airport.\u201d From the testimony of Novo\u2019s manager and John\u2019s testimony it appears that they had discussed the withdrawal of Novo\u2019s business from Airport and its assumption by John for about thirty days before the consummation of the arrangement (on May 17, 1974) between Novo and John\u2019s operation as Airport Specials. Yet it appears John did not consult Patrick about this imminent loss to Airport. However, whether John was acting in good faith is not decisive. \u201cBreach of the duty could be found although no corruption, dishonesty, or bad faith was involved.\u201d <em>Production Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>327 Mass, at 378. John could not enter into an arrangement inconsistent with his fiduciary duty. It was incumbent on him either to get Patrick\u2019s consent<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or relieve himself of his obligation to Airport by severing his relationship as officer, director, and equal stockholder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he argument that a fiduciary is not subject to the general rule here involved where the venture is one that the corporation itself is unable to take advantage of is not persuasive.\u201d <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Durfee &amp; Canning, Inc. </em>323 Mass, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>202. <em>Irving Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Deutsch, </em>73 F. 2d 121, 124 (2d Cir. 1934), cert. den. 294 U. S. 708 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">For John\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty, Airport<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is entitled to recoup from John all the profits he made from Novo\u2019s business and any other business competitive with Airport. (There is an indication in the transcript that John handled such other business.) <em>Production Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>327 Mass, at 378-379. See <em>Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine Co. </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>303 Mass. 1, 10-11 (1939); Henn, Corporations, \u00a7 236, p. 460 (2d ed. 1970). However, the court did not reach this issue and made no findings as to John\u2019s profits. The case must therefore be remanded for this purpose to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Airport also claims that John should be required to repay to the corporation the salary he received from the time he began competing with Airport by the activation of Specials.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But whether he should be required to repay his entire salary or whether he should receive a credit for the actual value of his services depends on the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the circumstances, including John\u2019s good faith and whether he actually performed substantial services to Airport. See <em>Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine Co. </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>303 Mass, at 4 (complete forfeiture refused; \u201cthe salaries paid to officers were not compensation for services in the ordinary sense at all\u201d) ; <em>Production Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>327 Mass, at 379 (total forfeiture of compensation where the record was sparse as to the benefits conferred by the defendant\u2019s services) ; <em>New England Inv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>329 Mass. 230, 237 (1952) (\u201cIn view of the manner in which Sandler managed the corporation for his personal benefit, he is not in a position to charge for possible incidental benefits which the corporation may have received from his management\u201d); <em>Anderson Corp. </em>v. <em>Blanch, </em>340 Mass, at 50-51 (\u201capportionment of compensation to services properly performed\u201d on the basis of \u201cclear findings\u201d of the specific value of the services). See also <em>Shulkin </em>v. <em>Shulkin, </em>301 Mass. 184, 194 (1938) (wrongdoing partner did not forfeit salary in a partnership accounting); <em>Greenan </em>v. <em>Ernst, </em>408 Pa. 495, 514-515 (1962) (applying \u201cthe old adage that \u2018the laborer is worthy of his hire\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The evidence in this regard was oral and conflicting. The differences can best be resolved by findings in the Superior Court, which it can thereupon use as a basis for deciding the extent (if any) to which repayment should be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Airport is also entitled to injunctive relief against competition by John so long as he is an officer or director of Airport <em>(Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine Co. </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>303 Mass. at 14; see <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass. at 620-621) and, under the <em>Donahue </em>case, <em>supra, </em>so long as he is a shareholder in Airport. See <em>Shulkin </em>v. <em>Shulkin, </em>301 Mass. at 190 (\u201c[T]he defendant could not properly engage in business which was in competition with that of the partnership\u201d) . If he disassociates himself from Airport, there appears to be no reason on this record to prohibit him from engaging in the trucking business in competition with Airport. <em>Anderson Corp. </em>v. <em>Blanch, </em>340 Mass. at 53. See <em>Na</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>tional Hearing Aid Centers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avers, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 285, 291 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">III. Miscellaneous Claims (Patrick\u2019s)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Patrick\u2019s other contentions do not require extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">a. Dissolution of the corporation. His contention, as an alternative to a partnership accounting (see part I), that this court provide for the dissolution of Airport is inconsistent with G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 99 (b), which lodges such jurisdiction in the Supreme Judicial Court. \u201c[T]he stockholder in the close corporation or \u2018incorporated partnership\u2019 may achieve dissolution and recovery of his share of the enterprise assets only by compliance with the rigorous terms of the applicable chapter of the General Laws.\u201d <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc. </em>367 Mass, at 591. That the Supreme Judicial Court under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A, may refer a petition for dissolution to the Superior Court does not give us the power to order the Superior Court to entertain such a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">b. Counsel fees. Patrick contends that he is entitled to reimbursement for counsel fees from John personally in litigating Airport\u2019s claims and relies on <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass. at 621, in which the court refused to disturb such an award. The court held that \u201c[a]wards of this type, in such cases, commonly rest in sound judicial discretion.\u201d The Superior Court in this case made no findings on the issue and made no award. At least to the extent that further proceedings may bring additional funds into the corporation, Patrick under general principles is entitled to reimbursement from those funds for counsel fees in its behalf. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Acc. Co. </em>318 Mass. 238, 242-243 (1945). We do not decide in the abstract what circumstances might call for the application of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass. at 621. See <em>Samia </em>v. <em>Central Oil Co. of Worcester, </em>339 Mass, at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>IV.

At a meeting of the board of directors of Airport on May 11, 1974, it was voted to purchase John\u2019s shares for $40,000. The stock was never in fact purchased, and the trial judge declared this vote of the board voidable by the corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b488-13\"><em> </em>The agreement provided for termination upon a two-week notice by either party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\"> None of the conflicts referred to was resolved by the trial judge in his findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\"> Patrick\u2019s contention, which is based on the existence of the partnership, that he is entitled to access to Airport\u2019s books and records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>must also fail. This does not preclude relief by the Superior Court, upon appropriate findings, to Patrick as director (Henn, Corporations, \u00a7 216, pp. 426-427 [2d ed. 1970]) or stockholder <em>(Varney </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>194 Mass. 239, 241 [1907]; see G. L. c. 249, \u00a75, as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7291). Cf. <em>New England LNG Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>368 Mass. 259, 260-261, fn. 1 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">We do not understand that Patrick is seeking a partnership accounting apart from these claims. The business generally appears to have been handled through Airport, leaving nothing to require a partnership accounting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> See concurring opinion by Wilkins, J., in the <em>Donahue </em>case at 604 and, e.g., part IIIa and fn. 7 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> We need not attempt to determine whether John\u2019s duties were as officer, director, or employee. Even if they were those of an employee, it was his duty as director to see to it that they were performed consistently with the welfare of the corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> There is no evidence of inequitable conduct by Patrick which might permit John to claim unclean hands. Nor was that defense pleaded. See <em>American Window Cleaning Co. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>343 Mass. 195, 201 (1961); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass, at 619.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> We are not here concerned with a minority stockholder not involved in management.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> We follow \u201c[t]he usual practice in Massachusetts [which] has been to afford relief in a case of this character to the corporation, on the ground that the stockholders have only derivative rights against one who has wronged their corporation.\u201d <em>Samia </em>v. <em>Central Oil Co. of Worcester, </em>339 Mass, at 123. This is not inconsistent with <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc. </em>367 Mass. 578 (1975). Although the <em>Donahue </em>case was considered as an action \u201cin the personal right of the plaintiff [stockholder] \u201d (see fns. 2, 4), it describes the fiduciary duty on which it is based as running \u201cto the other stockholders <em>and to the corporation\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). <em>Donahue </em>case at 593. Further, the court suggested as an appropriate judgment the payment to the corporation of the amount the defendant received from the corporation for shares of his stock. While the \u201cviolation of his fiduciary duty [was] to the other stockholders,\u201d it consisted in \u201cobtain [ing] assets from his corporation\u201d for which it was entitled to reimbursements. <em>Id. </em>at 603.
