L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (f), as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>through St. 1966, c. 584. See now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (d), as appearing in St. 1972, c. 741, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Superior Court decree was in conformity with the decision of the reviewing board, which had affirmed and adopted as its own the findings and decision of the single member. The insurer appeals from the award, arguing that there is insufficient evidence in the record of loss of hearing in both ears to qualify under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The single member\u2019s findings must be sustained unless \u201cwholly lacking in evidential support.\u201d <em>Sutherland\u2019s Case, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 58,59 (1974). If the findings of the Industrial Accident Board \u201ccould be reasonably deduced from the evidence and the rational inferences of which it was susceptible, ... [then] the decision ... must be sustained if there may be found from the evidence any facts or combination of facts that would support it____The decision of the board is not to be set aside unless a different conclusion is required as matter of law.\u201d <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 707 (1947). But see <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The employee, George Vouniseas, was injured when in the course of his employment he was struck on the head by a cement block. The employee has been receiving total incapacity compensation apart from his claim filed for compensation for specific injuries under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provided in subsection (f) for compensation \u201c[f]or the loss of hearing of both ears.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The evidence most favorable to the employee, supporting the single member\u2019s finding, was as follows. Doctor Peter H. Dillard, a neurosurgeon,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and an impartial examiner to whom the claimant was referred by the Industrial Accident Board, reported: \u201capparently ... deaf in the left ear, and cannot hear normal watch ticking even against the right ear____This hearing loss is apparently total on the left, and appreciably diminished on the right... his capacity for the work he was doing at the time of injury is probably nil... in the long run his capacity for gainful employment will be modified largely by his ability to compensate for his hearing loss.\u201d Doctor Bernard Zonderman, an otologist and also an impartial examiner, found: \u201cDuring the examination, it was noted the patient was obviously reading the interpreter\u2019s lips____Audiograms revealed a profound, almost total, deafness in his left ear and about 80 db loss by aid conduction in his better, right ear. No bone conduction could be ascertained in the left ear and the bone conduction in the right ear was poor____It was my impression from his history and examination that this patient has a profound deafness in the left ear and a severe hearing loss in his better, right ear averaging eighty percent loss of hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">1. We first consider the insurer\u2019s contention that there is no evidence to support the finding of a loss of hearing in both ears. There is no statutory standard by which \u201closs of hearing\u201d is to be measured.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It appears that this is a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of first impression in this jurisdiction and thus requires a careful inquiry as to what was intended by the statutory language \u201closs of hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The Industrial Accident Board has issued guidelines for \u00a7 36 specific injury compensation. In suggesting the amount of compensation to be awarded for the various injuries, the guidelines state the standard for loss of hearing as \u201ctotal loss of hearing for all practical purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Precedent in the case law of this jurisdiction for the adoption of a \u201closs for all practical purposes\u201d standard in cases dealing with \u00a7 36 specific injury claims may be found in <em>Morley\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 148, 150 (1951). In that case, the court found that an injured hand was permanently incapable of use where the employee had lost the use of the hand \u201cfor all practical purposes.\u201d In addition, both parties appear willing to accept this guideline, and the single member applied it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Total loss of hearing for all practical purposes does not mean that the employee must be unable to hear any sounds under any conditions. See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 348, n. 91 (1968). The loss may be classified as total for purposes of this guideline although some degree of hearing is retained. Similar treatment has been given to those portions of \u00a7 36 which have employed the language \u201cpermanently incapable of use\u201d or similar language as the standard for compensating injuries to a member not involving severance. In <em>Meley\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 136,139 (1914), it was held that to satisfy that standard \u201c[t]he incapacity of use need not be tantamount to an actual severance of the hand; it is enough that the normal use of the hand has been taken entirely away.\u201d Accord, <em>Floccher\u2019s Case, </em>221 Mass. 54, 55 (1915). Thus, a loss need not be total or complete in a literal sense in order to be compensable, and the Industrial Accident Board\u2019s guideline \u201ctotal loss of hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>for all practical purposes\u201d appears to be consistent with the statutory scheme of \u00a7 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The statutory language found in the workmen\u2019s compensation law of Georgia, \u201ccomplete loss of hearing,\u201d Ga. Code \u00a7 114-406 (r), would appear to invoke a stricter standard than the Massachusetts language, \u201closs of hearing.\u201d Nevertheless, the Georgia provision has been construed to mean \u201cfor all ordinary and practical purposes unable to hear.\u201d <em>Shipman </em>v. <em>Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co. </em>105 Ga. App. 487, 493 (1962). In the <em>Shipman </em>case, also a case of first impression, the evidence disclosed a fifty-one percent loss of hearing in the right ear, measured by the audiometer test, and medical testimony indicated that for all practical purposes hearing had been lost in that ear. The Georgia court reasoned that since the act was related to industry, the standard of loss of hearing should be related to the industrial purposes and uses of the employee\u2019s hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 493. In a later case, the same court held that \u201ceven if one has some hearing ability in an ear but the ear has none of the hearing ability required of his work, he is deemed to have a \u2018complete loss of hearing\u2019 in the ear for the purposes of workmen\u2019s compensation.\u201d <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Woody, </em>118 Ga. App. 819, 820 (1968) .<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the <em>Shipman </em>case, the claimant could not hear ordinary and normal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>sounds with his right ear and upon this evidence and evidence of a fifty-one percent loss in the right ear, a \u201ccomplete loss of hearing\u201d in that ear was found. In the case before us, Dr. Zonderman\u2019s finding of an eighty percent binaural loss would appear to surpass the loss of hearing shown in the <em>Shipman </em>case. See also <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Woody, supra \u25a0 </em>(also sustaining a ruling of complete loss of hearing in one ear upon a finding of a fifty-one percent loss of hearing in that ear). Additionally, Dr. Dillard found that the employee\u2019s hearing ability was diminished to the point where his capacity for the work he was doing at the time of injury was probably nil.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The single member, in finding \u201cfor all practical purposes ... a total loss of hearing in both ears,\u201d took into consideration the type of work the employee did. He was justified in doing so. This is consistent with the purposes underlying \u00a7 36 specific injury compensation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Massachusetts does not neglect consideration of industrial worth in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>whether there has been a loss of a bodily function. For instance, reduction of vision to twenty-seventieths of normal, which is fully compensable under \u00a7 36, is generally known as the standard for industrial blindness. See <em>Piz-zano\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 380, 383 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">We conclude that the evidence presented by the two impartial medical examiners, upon which the single member relied in his findings, supports the award of compensation made under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (f), for loss of hearing in both ears. We accept the Industrial Accident Board\u2019s guideline of \u201ctotal loss for all practical purposes\u201d as the applicable standard for evaluating loss of hearing. Evidence of an eighty percent binaural loss of hearing, in particular, provides a basis for holding that the above standard was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">2. The insurer presented a motion to the reviewing board, seeking to have the case recommitted in order to amplify the record by conducting further tests upon the hearing of the employee and to receive an audiology report of one Dr. Chaves, who had conducted tests on July 20, 1972. In addition, the insurer seeks recommittal so that the single member can make specific findings of subsidiary facts bearing on the question of loss of hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">By virtue of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10, the reviewing board has authority to recommit a proceeding to a single member for the purpose of obtaining additional findings of fact. However, that section also provides that \u201c[n]o party shall as of right be entitled to a second hearing upon questions of fact,\u201d and that provision has been construed to mean that the introduction of new evidence is ordinarily a matter within the discretion of the reviewing board. \u201cCommonly there should not be a rehearing.\u201d <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 581, 585 (1931), citing <em>Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 98, 101 (1915); <em>Devine\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 588, 595 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The Superior Court has the power to order a rehearing \u201con the ground of newly discovered evidence, when in accordance with sound practice and settled principles concerning a new trial at common law that course ought to be pursued.\u201d <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489, 495-496 (1922). <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 586. <em>Sabbagh\u2019s Case, </em>346 Mass. 504, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>507 (1963). \u201cNew trials will not be granted on the ground of newly discovered evidence except upon proof of \u2018important evidence of such a nature as to be likely to have a material effect upon the result, which could not reasonably have been discovered before the trial by the exercise of proper diligence and respecting the production of which on motion there has been an entire want of laches.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 586-587, quoting <em>Berggren </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>231 Mass. 173, 177 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The Industrial Accident Board denied the insurer\u2019s motion to recommit, and the Superior Court issued a final decree in conformity with the board\u2019s decision. \u201cWhen the Industrial Accident Board and a judge of the Superior Court have decided that there ought not to be a rehearing, the only question before... [us] ordinarily is whether the record shows an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 586, citing <em>Devine\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">It was properly within the discretion of the board and the Superior Court judge whether the information contained in the report of Dr. Chaves and his suggestion that additional tests be conducted was newly discovered evidence, and there was no abuse of discretion in declining to reopen the proceedings to admit further medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">An additional ground for recommittal urged by the insurer is that the single member made insufficient subsidiary findings. Broad general findings which do not disclose the view taken of the facts will be acceptable only where no contrary inference can be drawn from the evidence. The reviewing board or single member must set out subsidiary findings in a form sufficiently explicit so that the correctness of the general findings may be reviewed. See <em>Rozek\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 205, 206-207 (1936); <em>Demetrius\u2019s Case, </em>304 Mass. 285, 286 (1939). We conclude that the single member\u2019s report contains a sufficient statement of what evidence he relied upon in awarding compensation to the employee under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (f). He refers specifically to certain statements upon which he relied, i.e. those statements, discussed earlier in this opinion, which were part of the medical evidence presented by the two impartial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>medical examiners. Thus, in the circumstances of this case, the single member\u2019s decision, adopted by the reviewing board, contained a sufficient statement of the findings of subsidiary fact upon which he relied in reaching his conclusions to allow us effectively to review the question whether, in reaching those conclusions, he correctly applied the proper legal standards. Contrast <em>Herson\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 402,407 (1960); <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 1,6 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\"> The 1972 amendment is not applicable, since the injury occurred on November 12, 1970.

That award is not contested on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\"> In general, the purpose of the Massachusetts Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is to compensate an injured employee for the impairment of his earning capacity.

App. Ct. 889 (1972), we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\"> A House of Representatives minority report, commenting on proposals to add the loss of hearing provisions to the list of specific injuries in section 36, recognized that there is \u201cno provision as to just how the loss of hearing is to be measured.\u201d 1947 House Doc. No. 1803, at 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\"> As to the weight t\u00f3 be accorded such an administrative guideline see <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc. </em>347 Mass. 337, 343-345 (1964). See generally <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>323 U.S. 134, 139-140 (1944); Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 5.03 (1958). Cf. <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. </em>362 Mass. 417, 441-442 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\"> Rhode Island, as did Georgia, rejected a technical definition of \u201ccomplete loss of hearing\u201d and construed the phrase in a practical sense. <em>Pilkanis </em>v. <em>Leesona Corp. </em>101 R.I. 494 (1966). Contrast <em>Hartlieb </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>12 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. Rep. 118 (1974). The <em>Pilkanis </em>case construed language of the Rhode Island workmen\u2019s compensation law, G. L. 1956, \u00a7 28-33-19, which also provides compensation for \u201ccomplete loss of hearing.\u201d The Rhode Island Supreme Court formulated a stricter standard than that of Georgia, stating that an injured worker would not be entitled to specific compensation even though the loss was extensive enough to make his hearing worthless industrially, if he still retained \u201csome degree of ... hearing which is of practical and useful benefit to him in his daily pursuits.\u201d <em>Pilkanis, supra, </em>at 499. Nevertheless, in <em>Lamont </em>v. <em>Aetna Bridge Co. </em>107 R.I. 686 (1970), the court implied that losses of only fifty percent in one ear and forty percent in the other would be sufficient, under the <em>Pilkanis </em>standard, to warrant a finding of a complete loss of hearing. See also <em>Lozowski </em>v. <em>Nicholson File Co. </em>92 R.I. 270 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\"> See 1956 Ann. Surv. of Mass. Law, \u00a7 19.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">See also 1947 House Doc. No. 1803, at 2-3 indicating that specific compensation was intended to compensate \u201cfor loss of possible future increases in earnings that... [an individual] might reasonably be expected to achieve were it not for his handicap and deformity,\u201d and for the deprivation of the ability for self-help, i.e. the ability to do chores and errands for which one does not receive income but which are of value to any individual and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Cf. 1949 House Doc. No. 918, and 1949 Senate Doc.
