L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C (see G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, as in effect prior to St. 1973, c. 588), and of possession of a controlled substance (heroin) with intent to distribute the same (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a731 and 32). The only exceptions argued are those taken to the denials of motions for directed verdicts on each indictment, presented at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The common argument is that the evidence was insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>warrant an inference of possession by either defendant of any of the articles in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The virtually identical bills of exceptions reveal only the following. In the course of observing the apartment where the guns and heroin were subsequently found, two Boston police officers had seen both defendants enter and leave \u201cseveral\u201d times, or on \u201cseveral\u201d occasions. At approximately 3 p.m. on March 22, 1973, one of those officers, along with other officers, sought entrance to the apartment in order to execute a search warrant. Roger answered the outer door, which opened into the living room. One or two women, not arrested, were in the living room. Tommy was discovered in bed in a room adjoining the living room. One of the searching officers was \u201caware\u201d Tommy had been in the hospital the day before the search. During the course of the search the two shotguns and 275 envelopes containing heroin were discovered in the kitchen. Roger was immediately arrested, but Tommy was not, \u201cbecause of his condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">There was no evidence that the apartment was the home of either defendant or that either had rented it for his own use or for the use of the other. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fancy, </em>349 Mass. 196, 199-200 <em>(1965); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>358 Mass. 817, 818 (1971). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>356 Mass. 85, 86-87 (1969). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guerro, </em>357 Mass. 741, 745, 748, 751-753 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Xiarhos, </em>2 Mass.

Nor was there evidence to indicate that either defendant had exercised dominion or control over the portion of the apartment in which the guns and heroin were found. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frongillo, </em>359 Mass. 132, 133-134, 137-138 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dinnall, </em>366 Mass. 165, 168, 169-170 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>2 Mass.

The presence of Tommy in a bedroom in the early afternoon was not suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ficient to show dominion or control over the apartment as a whole (compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>358 Mass. 817, 818 [1971]), nor were the unnumbered comings and goings of the defendants at unspecified times and intervals in the past.
