L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, to vacate an award made by the board of conciliation and arbitration (board) \u2014 see G. L. c. 23, \u00a7 7 \u2014 in an arbitration between the company and the defendant (union), parties to a collective bargaining agreement which provided for arbitration by the board as the final step of a grievance procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The facts out of which the grievance arose, as found by the board and substantially uncontroverted, are as follows: On December 29, 1972, one Ernest Currie, an employee of the company, was assigned to work on the 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shift on December 31. He was also asked to work the following shift from 4:00 p.m. to midnight. After changing his New Year\u2019s plans, he agreed to do so. He was thus scheduled to work two eight-hour shifts \u201cback to back\u201d on December 31, extending through New Year\u2019s Eve. At about 10:00 a.m. on December 31, while working on the first of the two scheduled shifts, he was notified that he would not be needed to work the later shift. He claimed he was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>titled to eight hours\u2019 pay, and the union and the company jointly referred the controversy to the board under the following submission: \u201cDid the Company violate the agreement between the parties relative to the grievance of Ernest Currie dated January 1,1973? If so, what shall the remedy be?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The board, with the industry member dissenting, \u201cafter having weighed the evidence and arguments of the parties,\u201d made the following award: \u201cThe Company violated the agreement between the parties relative to the grievance of Ernest Currie dated January 1, 1973____The Board directs that Ernest Currie be awarded 8 hours pay at the appropriate rate for the shift cancelled on Sunday, December 31, 1972.\u201d The company\u2019s application to vacate the award was denied in the Superior Court, and judgment was ordered to be entered accordingly. The company appealed to this court. We hold that the Superior Court correctly refused to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The claim was based on the clause of the contract (Art. VI, \u00a7 l[e]) insuring that \u201c[ejmployees shall be assigned a definite time to report for work\u201d and providing for advance notice of lack of work and a guarantee of eight hours\u2019 work for any employee who reports at his regular time. The submission, made jointly by the parties, thus left to the board the question how, in the circumstances of this case, to deal with the frustration of an employee\u2019s expectation of work for which he reported, and the resulting inconvenience. Looking to discover how this not uncommon irritant \u2014 the subject matter of Article VI, \u00a7 1(e) \u2014 had been handled by the parties, the board found that \u201cthe evidence regarding past practice reveals that the company has either paid for or provided 8 hours work for those employees who reported before they were notified of the cancellation of their extra or overtime work.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The award, based on the contract clause informed by the practice, complied precisely with the provision of the arbitration clause that the board may not \u201cpass upon or decide any question except that which is submitted to them in the Submission Agreement.\u201d (See fn. 1, <em>supra.) </em>Thus \u201c[t]he reference and the award drew their \u2018essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morceau </em>v. <em>Gould-National Batteries, Inc. </em>344 Mass. 120, 124-125 (1962), citing and quoting from <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp. </em>363 U. S. 593, 597 (1960). As was said in <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Mari &amp; Sons Flooring Co. Inc. </em>362 Mass. 560, 563 (1972), \u201cIn the instant case, the parties contracted to submit their controversy to an arbitrator for final determination. His decision answered the questions submitted to him and was within the scope of the reference. The parties bargained for his final interpretation of their collective bargaining agreement. They got what they bargained for. \u2018[Where] the arbitrator\u2019s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from his\u2019 \u201d \u2014 citing <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp. </em>363 U. S. at 599. \u201cEven a grossly erroneous decision is binding in the absence of fraud.\u201d <em>Trustees of the Boston &amp; Maine Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. </em>363 Mass. 386, 390 (1973) (a case of commercial arbitration in which judicial scrutiny is at least no narrower than in a labor arbitration; see <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co. </em>363 U. S. 574, 578 [I960]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The company argues that in dealing with this submission the board was limited by subclause [a] (see fn. 1, <em>supra), </em>which provides that the board may not \u201cadd to... or modify any of the terms of this Agreement\u201d \u2014 a contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>which is open to it. <em>Morceau </em>v. <em>Gould-National Batteries, Inc. </em>344 Mass, at 124. <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Mari &amp; Sons Flooring Co. Inc. </em>362 Mass, at 562-563. See <em>School Comm. of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, ante, </em>151, 155-156 (1975). This subclause is common in arbitration clauses. See <em>Holly Sugar Corp. </em>v. <em>Distillery, Rectifying, Wine &amp; Allied Wkrs. Int\u2019l Union, AFL-CIO, </em>412 F. 2d 899, 904 (9th Cir. 1969), which characterizes such a subclause as \u201cboiler-plate.\u201d Indeed, a substantially similar provision was involved in <em>Morceau </em>v. <em>Gould-National Batteries, Inc. </em>344 Mass. at 123-124, in which the court said (p. 124), \u201c \u2018[I]n the absence of fraud the decision of the arbitrators is binding even though they may have committed an error of law or fact.\u2019 [citing cases] ... \u2018The parties received what they agreed to take, the honest judgment of the arbitrator as to a matter referred to him\u2019 [citing cases].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">In <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>American Mfg. Co. </em>363 U. S. 564, 565, and fn. 1 (1960), the court referred to an arbitration clause containing just such a subclause as \u201ca provision for arbitration (regarded as the standard form) of all disputes between the parties \u2018as to the meaning, interpretation and application of the provisions of this agreement.\u2019 \u201d The court pointed out, without dealing explicitly with this subclause (p. 567): \u201cYet, the agreement is to submit all grievances to arbitration \u2014 There is no exception in the \u2018no strike\u2019 clause and none therefore should be read into the grievance clause, since one is the <em>quid pro quo </em>for the other.\u201d In our case, too, in which the contract binds the parties to arbitrate \u201cany difference... between the Company and the Union or its members as to the meaning and application of this Agreement\u201d (see fn. 1, <em>supra) </em>and contains a no-strike clause, the board was empowered to deal with the \u201csubject submitted to\u201d them. <em>Trustees of the Boston &amp; Maine Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. </em>363 Mass. at 391. <em>Western Iowa Pork Co. </em>v. <em>National Bhd. Packinghouse &amp; Dairy Wkrs. </em>366 F. 2d 275, 278 (8th Cir. 1966). <em>Humble Oil &amp; Ref. Co. </em>v. <em>Local 866, </em>447 F. 2d 229, 233 (2d Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The company also seems to argue that subclause [a] (see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>fn. 1, <em>supra) </em>somehow precludes the consideration of plant practice. The answer to this contention is found in <em>Humble Oil &amp; Ref. Co. </em>v. <em>Local 866, supra, </em>at 232. The contract there provided for arbitration of a violation of \u201can express provision\u201d of the contract; the court in upholding an arbitration award used much the same approach as we adopt. The court said (p. 232): \u201cIn construing the provisions of Article 30-1 of the contract to determine the employees\u2019 recall rights, the Chairman made use of a typical battery of construction techniques, relying especially upon the parties\u2019 previous practices under predecessor bargaining agreements ____\u201d The court further said (pp. 232-233): \u201cWe see nothing in the arbitration clause which forbids resort to such rudimentary tools of construction. If the Board were barred from resorting to bargaining history and rights established under similar language in past contracts, the parties to the contract would be remitted to securing arbitration only when there was a violation of a provision so plain and unambiguous as to require no collateral evidence of intent \u2014 and we might add hardly requiring arbitration itself. To emasculate the arbitration clause, absent a more clear and definite intent that the parties intended it to have such a wooden effect and to be construed so antiseptically, would be contrary to the well-recognized presumption in labor law favoring private settlement of labor disputes\u201d \u2014 citing the <em>\u201cSteelworkers </em>trilogy.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Western Iowa Pork Co. </em>v. <em>National Bhd. Packinghouse &amp; Dairy Wkrs. </em>366 F. 2d 275, 278 (8th Cir. 1966), the court dealt with a clause (like subclause [a]) that the arbitrator \u201cshall have no power to add to, subtract from, change or modify any provision of this Agreement but he is authorized only to interpret the specific provisions of this Agreement____\u201d The court said (p. 278): \u201cThis exclusion is broad and general in its application and does little more than repeat the law found in the <em>Enterprise </em>case, <em>supra </em>[363 U. S. at 597 (1960) ], to the effect that an arbitrator is \u2018confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement.\u2019 This exclusion does not clearly take this dispute or the award outside of the specifically granted authority of the arbitrator. Therefore, resolving all ambiguity of authority, as we must, in favor of coverage, we have no alternative but to hold that the awards are valid.\u201d See <em>Medo Photo Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>274 F. Supp. 209, 214-216 (S. D. N. Y. 1967), affd. per curiam 386 F. 2d 451 (2d Cir. 1967); <em>United Furniture Wkrs. of America </em>v. <em>Virco Mfg. Corp. </em>257 F. Supp. 138, 141-143 (E. D. Ark. 1962). See also <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co. </em>363 U. S. at 578-582; Shulman, Reason, Contract, and Law in Labor Relations, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 999, 1004-1005 (1955); Cox, Reflections Upon Labor Arbitration, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 1482, 1498-1499 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The company\u2019s minute dissection of the board\u2019s opinion is adequately answered in <em>Morceau </em>v. <em>Gould-National Batteries, Inc. </em>344 Mass, at 124, where the court said, \u201c[M]ere ambiguity in the opinion is npt a reason for refusing to enforce the award, even when it permits the inference of a want of authority\u201d \u2014 citing <em>United Steelworkers of Amer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>ica </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp. </em>363 U. S. at 597-599, and quoted in <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Mari &amp; Sons Flooring Co. Inc. </em>362 Mass. at 562. Further, to a great extent the plaintiff\u2019s objections \u201c[a]\u00a1though... expressed in terms that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of the matter referred to him for decision... are in fact objections that the arbitrator committed a variety of errors of law.\u201d <em>Trustees of the Boston &amp; Maine Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. </em>363 Mass. at 391-392.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Thus the company\u2019s criticism of the board\u2019s opinion is without merit. If anything, it demonstrates the futility of its attempted distinction between an erroneous interpretation of a contract term and an addition to a contract term. Whatever may be the value of this distinction in other contexts (see <em>West Coast Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Elec. Wkrs. </em>431 F. 2d 1219, 1221 [9th Cir. 1970]), in this case it makes no functional difference and is merely semantic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\n<em>Order for judgment denying application affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-9\"> Article XVI of the agreement, \u201cSettlement of Disputes,\u201d provides in pertinent part: \u201cShould any difference arise between the Company and the Union or its members as to the meaning and application of this Agreement, the dispute shall be settled finally in the following manner: ... 3.

Wkrs. Union Local 1645, </em>362 F. 2d 677 (2d Cir. 1966), cited by the company, which held that the arbitrator went beyond his authority in ruling that an employer was required to give its employees election day time off because the subject had been a matter of negotiation and was omitted from the contract. The court said (p. 233): \u201cBut [in the <em>Torrington </em>case] the final agreement itself contained no provision remotely bearing on employee rights for election day time off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We are not to be understood as approving the <em>Torrington </em>case. There was a strong dissent (362 F. 2d at 682-684), and the case has been disapproved in, e.g., <em>Holly Sugar Corp. </em>v. <em>Distillery, Rectifying, Wine &amp; Allied Wkrs. Int\u2019l Union, AFL-CIO, </em>412 F. 2d 899, 905 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>Dallas Typographical Union No. 173 </em>v. A. <em>H.
