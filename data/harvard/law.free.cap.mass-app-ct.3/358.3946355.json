No provision for alimony or for care and maintenance of the child was included in the original decree, which had become absolute in the interim. The evidence is not reported, but the judge made a report of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Lawrence filed two petitions on March 6, 1973. The first petition alleges a change in circumstances and prays that Barbara \u201ccontribute towards the support of the said minor child.\u201d This petition further prays that the June 14, 1972, decree be \u201cmodified in accordance with MGL, Chap. 208, Sec. 34 &amp; 34A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>____\u201d The second petition, similar in form to the first, makes no mention of child support in the prayer but prays for modification of the earlier decree in accordance with G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34A. The December 6, 1973, decree, captioned a \u201cDecree of Modification,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> orders that Barbara\u2019s undivided one-half interest in certain real estate be conveyed to Lawrence \u201cunder the provisions of General Laws, Chapter 201, Section 34\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****8(which we treat as a reference to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34). Barbara seeks to have this decree vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">It was error to issue a decree ordering conveyance of Barbara\u2019s interest in the real estate pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. Section 34 provides for a decree of part of the wife\u2019s estate, in the nature of alimony, to the husband. See <em>Oder v. Ober, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 32, 35 (1973). However, as Lawrence points out in his brief, \u201cneither of [his] ... [petitions refer [sic] to \u2018alimony\u2019 as they are basically concerned with child support.\u201d Lawrence\u2019s specifications also indicate that his request for support is limited only to the needs of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The court was without authority to make a decree under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>section 34, which provides for alimony, when the order for support was intended <em>only </em>for the benefit of a minor child. \u201cAlimony\u201d may include provision for the support and maintenance of the minor children as part of the award to the former spouse. <em>Topor </em>v. <em>Topor, 287 </em>Mass. 473, 475 (1934). <em>Topalis </em>v. <em>Topalis, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 530, 532 (1974). However, an award in the nature of alimony is not proper upon these petitions, where Lawrence does not appear to be requesting any provision for his own support. Authority for a Probate Court decree ordering provision for the care and maintenance of minor children is derived from G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Moreover, the report of material facts is not adequate to support the decree, as that report fails to set out the facts necessary to permit us to review a decree for the care and maintenance of a child. See <em>Topor </em>v. <em>Topor, supra, </em>at 475-477. See generally, <em>Vergnani </em>v. <em>Vergnani, </em>321 Mass. 699, 700-701 (1947); <em>Vergnani </em>v. <em>Vergnani, </em>321 Mass. 703, 704 (1947). (For discussion of the circumstances to be taken into consideration in making such a decree, see <em>Topor </em>v. <em>Topor, supra; Coe </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>313 Mass. 232, 235-237 [1943] ; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>325 Mass. 28, 30-31 [1949].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">For the above reasons the decree must be reversed, and the petitions dismissed without prejudice to Lawrence\u2019s filing a new petition for the care and maintenance of the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\"> These inartfully drawn petitions, apparently aimed only at support for the child, pray for relief under inapplicable sections of the General Laws. (G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, provides for alimony, and G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34A, provides for the enforcement of an alimony decree ordering conveyance of real estate. See <em>Dee </em>v. <em>Dee, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 320, 323-324 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\"> There is no authority to grant alimony under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, by <em>modifying </em>a decree nisi which contains no provision for alimony. Rather a <em>new </em>decree is required. Compare G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, subsequently amended by St. 1974, c. 565, with G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 37. See <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>311 Mass. 329, 331-332, 333-334 (1942); <em>Kinosian </em>v. <em>Kinosian, </em>351 Mass. 49 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-16\"> It is not clear which of the two petitions the decree is based upon, or whether it is based upon both considered jointly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
