Lewis, now deceased,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> recovered damages to his automobile. The plaintiffs claimed that the damages resulted from the defective repair by the defendant of the positraction differential in the rear end of the automobile (the Lewis car) and that on December 27, 1965, because of the defective repair, the Lewis car went out of control and collided with another automobile. The defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions raises first the issue whether there was sufficient evidence so that a jury could find that the positraction differential examined by the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, who testified it was defectively repaired, was the positraction differential from the Lewis car. We think there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">There was testimony that after the accident the Lewis car was towed away by a company providing wrecker service to its place of business, where it was kept intact until February 28, 1966, when it was taken to an automobile salvage yard. On March 3, 1966, the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness picked up from the salvage yard, on loan, a positraction differential from an automobile of the same model and year as the Lewis car. On March 21, 1966, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>salvage yard was notified to bill a particular insurance company for the positraction differential taken by the expert and did so on the same day. The bill indicates that the differential came from the Lewis car. There was further testimony that the only automobile of that model and year on the lot on that date was owned by a person named Lewis. See <em>Brockton Hosp. </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>345 Mass. 616, 617 (1963).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bill was admitted into evidence as a record kept in the regular course of business, and its admission implies a finding by the trial judge of all the facts prerequisite under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. <em>Sawyer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>354 Mass. 481, 483 (1968), and cases cited. After the bill was admitted, the defendant inquired further about the circumstances surrounding the billing, but nothing elicited vitiates the trial judge\u2019s implied findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The defendant further argues that there was insufficient evidence that it was negligent. The expert testimony presented by the plaintiffs, though disputed, was a sufficient basis for the jury to find negligent repair of the positraction differential, and the evidence that this contributed to the accident was similar, and at least as extensive, as the evidence in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 16, 18-20 (1972), <em>S. C. </em>364 Mass. 382, 385 (1973), in which jury findings fixing the responsibility for negligent repair were upheld. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>U-Haul Co. Inc. </em>360 Mass. 71, 74 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiff Milham, who was a passenger in the car while the owner\u2019s son was driving, was not a person who might reasonably be expected to be affected by the defectively repaired positraction differential is without merit. There is ample evidence that he was not a trespasser <em>(Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>363 Mass. 693, 707-708 [1973]) and that he was at least as much a \u201cforeseeable plaintiff\u201d (Prosser, Torts, \u00a7 100, p. 662 [4th ed. 1971]) as a pedestrian <em>(Kennedy </em>v. <em>U-Haul Co. Inc. </em>360 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Mass. at 71) or other stranger <em>(Clancy </em>v. <em>R. O\u2019Brien &amp; Co. Inc. </em>345 Mass. 772 [1963]). See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Lonergan, </em>285 Mass. 266, 270 (1934); <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>319 Mass. 372, 373 (1946); Restatement 2d: Torts, \u00a7 395, comment i, p. 330, and \u00a7 404, p. 364 (1965). See also G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-318, as amended by St. 1971, c. 670, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Other jurisdictions have taken the same view. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>114 Ga. App. 873, 874, 878-879 (1966) (as in this case, a guest passenger in an automobile driven by the son of the owner could recover against the party who negligently repaired the vehicle). See also <em>Royal Motors Inc. </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>275 F. 2d 3 (D. C. Cir. 1960); <em>Kalinowski </em>v. <em>Truck Equip. Co. Inc. </em>237 App. Div. (N.
