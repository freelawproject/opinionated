L. c. 231A; <em>Fred C. McClean Heating Supplies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westfield Trade High Sch. Bldg. Comm. of Westfield, </em>345 Mass. 267, 269-270 [1962]) valid an award to M. Frank Higgins Co., Inc. (Higgins) of a contract for the furnishing and installation of carpeting in student housing which was contracted for by Southeastern Massachusetts University Building Authority (Authority) with J. A. Schroeder Construction, Inc. (Schroeder) as general contractor. The plaintiff attacks the trial judge\u2019s determination that Higgins was the \u201clowest eligible and responsible bidder\u201d and argues that it, rather than Higgins, was the lowest bidder and entitled to the contract. (It was conceded that both the plaintiff and Higgins were \u201celigible and responsible.\u201d) The trial judge made findings and rulings. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">1. We discuss first the argument made by Higgins<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the Authority was not in any event required to award the contract to the lowest bidder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Section 17 of the act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> establishing the Authority (St. 1964, c. 703, as amended) makes applicable to the Authority the competitive bidding statute (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L), which has as one of its \u201cfundamental... objectives ... [to] enable [ ] the public contracting authority to obtain the lowest price for its work that competition among responsible contractors can secure.\u201d <em>Interstate Engr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 757 (1975). It is true, of course, that under \u00a7 44H of that statute it is contemplated that th\u00e9 sub-bids be opened before the general contract is awarded and that the qualifying sub-bids be circulated among prospective general contractors, each of whom is free to use a sub-bid which may not be the lowest. The general contractor does so, however, at the risk of elevating his own bid and losing the general contract (id., dissenting opinion at 762-764); and thus the interest of the public in the lowest possible cost is safeguarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In this case the Authority solicited bids for the carpeting contract after the general contract had been awarded \u2014 how long afterward does not appear from the record. But the Authority was assured that the cost would be minimized by the procedure established for the project in the general conditions and the supplementary general conditions of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (this being a federally aided project). Those conditions, included in the bidding documents (Condition No. 36 and Supplementary General Condition 2, both captioned \u201cStated Allowances\u201d), provided a \u201cCash Allowance\u201d for the furnishing and installation of carpet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ing, thus fixing a flat amount which each bidder for the general contract was to include in his bid to cover this item instead of the amount of a specific sub-bid for this work. The general contractor was required to \u201cpurchase the \u2018Allowed Materials\u2019 [the carpeting, including installation in accordance with the specifications] as directed by the Owner [the Authority] on the basis of the lowest and best bid of at least three competitive bids\u201d \u2014 with the general \u201ccontract price... adjusted accordingly\u201d if there should be a difference between the amount of the carpeting sub-bid and the \u201cCash Allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">It is significant that this procedure is in substance the same as that provided in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 441(1) for the selection of a sub-bidder when, following an invitation for sub-bids pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 44C and 44H, \u201cno sub-bid is filed ... or... a rejection of all sub-bids... occurs.\u201d In such case an \u201caddendum\u201d is issued in lieu of a fist of sub-bidders for the particular class of work which sets out \u201cthe amount to be included by a general bidder... for such sub-trade.\u201d Thereupon, the awarding authority solicits new sub-bids and the general contractor is required to \u201ccause the work covered by such sub-trade to be done by the lowest responsible and eligible sub-bidder...\u201d \u2014 with the general \u201ccontract price... adjusted by the difference between the subcontract sum and the amount stated in the addendum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Reading that condition and supplementary condition together with the \u201cForm for General Bid\u201d in \u00a7 44F (to which, as is unquestioned, the general contract was subject) in the light of \u00a7\u00a7 44H and 441, it is clear that the installation and furnishing of carpeting was intended to be, and was, encompassed in the total construction for which the general contractor was responsible. He was not, however, to do the carpeting as \u201c[t]he work of the general contractor\u201d in \u201cItem 1\u201d of the \u201cForm for General Bid\u201d but rather through a subcontractor. The carpeting was therefore a \u201cclass of work for which the awarding authority deem[ed] it necessary or convenient to receive sub-bids\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44C (18), and was in effect a sub-bid under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201cItem 2\u201d of the statutory form for which, however, an \u201caddendum\u201d had been substituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\u201cThe work called for in the contract under consideration obviously was to be done in connection with the construction of a public building... and was a necessary phase of the construction.\u201d <em>Gil-Bern Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>353 Mass. 503, 505 (1968). Accordingly, we conclude that the carpeting subcontract was subject to the competitive bidding statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Burlington, ante, </em>399, 401-402 (1975), in which a carpeting contract was awarded separately from any other contract in a program for the rehabilitation of a school, and we nevertheless held that it could not be said as matter of law that the installation was so insignificant that the contract was one merely for the supply of goods, in which case it would not be subject to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L. In the instant case, as in the <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>case, the detailed specifications for installation of the carpeting suggest that the contract calls for \u201cconstruction\u201d rather than merely for the purchase of goods. But we need not dwell on this matter since Higgins concedes that in the circumstances of this case \u201ccarpeting could be included by the awarding authority under the catch-all in [\u00a7 44C (18) ] \u201d, a concession which implies that the installation in this case was of sufficient significance so that the contract was one for \u201cconstruction\u201d and thus subject to the competitive bidding statute by virtue of the mandate of \u00a7 17 of St. 1964, c. 703 (see fn. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">To be sure, the competitive bidding statute contemplates the procedure outlined in \u00a7 44H before the Authority goes to the procedure in \u00a7 441, but none of the parties has objected to the bypass of \u00a7 44H in this case or to the resort, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>in substance, to \u00a7 441 in the first instance. Indeed, Higgins mentions in his brief that the Authority made the bidding procedures subject to the competitive bidding statute, but Higgins apparently did not think it sufficiently significant to mention the failure to follow \u00a7 44H. Higgins does point to various other deviations from the competitive bidding statute but only as indications that the Authority did not intend to apply the statute in its entirety. On our analysis, that is not material since the Authority was bound to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">In any event, whatever other deviations may or may not be tolerated<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, we are not inclined to compound the error (if error there be). It seems to us that the clear language of St. 1964, c. 703, \u00a7 17, and its obvious policy would bar the Authority, where \u2014 as here \u2014 the competitive bidding statute is applicable, from choosing a higher sub-bidder over the lowest sub-bidder at the expense of the Authority, absent some extraneous justification (\u00a744D; <em>Interstate Engr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass, at 758). See <em>Rudolph </em>v. <em>City Manager of Cambridge, </em>341 Mass. 31, 35-36 (1960) (involving the interpretation of \u00a7 441).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">2. We agree with the plaintiff that it is entitled to a declaration that it was the lowest eligible and responsible bidder and that the Authority should have awarded it the carpeting subcontract. The bidding form which the Author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ity required to be used in submitting bids is set out in facsimile below.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The \u201cnet contract sum\u201d specified by the plaintiff on the bidding form was $64,695, and the yardage indicated was 6,400 square yards; Higgins\u2019 \u201cnet contract sum\u201d was $66,-693, and the yardage indicated was 7,000 square yards. The plaintiff\u2019s \u201cADDITIONS OR DEDUCTIONS in yardage\u201d totalled $10.05; Higgins\u2019 totalled $8.15, with a handwritten notation \u201cmaterial only.\u201d The three other nondisqualified bidders specified \u201cnet contract sum[s]\u201d ranging from $70,-142 to $79,320; the yardage indicated with these sums ranged from 6,000 square yards to 7,200 square yards.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\n<em>CARPET</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>PROPOSAL FORM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">For furnishing and installing Carpet and Underlayment for the Student Housing \u2014 Phase II:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">To: The Southeastern Massachusetts University Building Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Pursuant to and in compliance with the Instructions to Bidders, this Specification, and Plans and Specifications dated September 14, 1971 prepared by Hugh Stubbing and Associates, Inc., the undersigned hereby proposes to furnish and install Carpet as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">\n<em>BASE BID</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">_square yards of carpet and underlayment for the net contract</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">sum of_</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">Dollars ($_).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">ADDITIONS OR DEDUCTIONS in yardage:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">CARPET: $_/sq.yd.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">CARPET UNDERLAYMENT: $_/sq.yd.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">Date: _</p>\n<p id=\"b604-18\">Signed: _</p>\n<p id=\"b604-19\">By: -</p>\n<p id=\"b604-20\">Address: _</p>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">PROPOSAL FORM Page 1</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The Authority did not award the subcontract on the basis of the \u201cnet contract sum,\u201d which, in the plaintiff\u2019s bid, was about $2,000 less than in Higgins\u2019 bid and was the lowest of all the bids. Instead, it awarded the subcontract (as set out in the vote of the Authority) on the basis of the \u201clowest unit price for the yardage submitted.\u201d This figure was computed by dividing the \u201cnet contract sum\u201d in the bidding form by the indicated yardage. The computation resulted in a \u201cunit price\u201d of $9.53 for Higgins and $10.11 for the plaintiff, and Higgins was awarded the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">We see no warrant for the method employed by the Authority. Whether the Authority could, in its discretion, have advertised for bids on a unit price basis (see <em>Pacella </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn. </em>339 Mass. 338, 346 [1959]; <em>Quincy Ornamental Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Findlen, </em>353 Mass. 85, 89 [1967]) is beside the point. The fact is that it did not do so. The bidding form required from each bidder a fixed sum (the \u201cnet contract sum\u201d) at which he proposed to furnish and install carpet and underlayment \u201c[p]ursuant to and in compliance with the Instructions to Bidders, this Specification, and Plans and Specifications dated September 14, 1971____\u201d The specifications provided that the \u201cscope\u201d of the work was to \u201c[f]urnish and install all labor and materials required to complete CARPET work, as shown on the drawings and specified in this SECTION____\u201d Nowhere in the bidding documents did the Authority specify the square yardage of carpeting necessary to do the job to which a bidder would be required to commit himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The \u201cSUB-CONTRACT FORM\u201d (see fn. 4) which was included in the bidding documents, and to which the bidding was directed, also called for the subcontractor to \u201cfurnish all labor and materials required for the completion of all work specified for CARPETING \u2014 STUDENT HOUSING, PHASE II, SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS UNIVERSITY, and the plans referred to therein____\u201d And this was to be done at a fixed price.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2019 Clearly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the undertaking was to carpet the specific spaces indicated on the drawings; it was not to furnish any specific yardage, for none was referred to in the \u201cSUB-CONTRACT FORM.\u201d Higgins executed this contract for $66,693, the \u201cnet contract sum\u201d in its bid. The plaintiff\u2019s bid was a proposal to sign the same contract for about $2,000 less.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The critical figure in the proposal form was clearly the \u201cnet contract sum\u201d \u2014 the eventual contract price at which the lowest bidder was to undertake the carpeting. It measured the dollar cost to the Authority, since it was the figure with which the \u201cStated Allowance\u201d \u2014 $90,000 \u2014 (discussed at p. 582 of this opinion) was to be compared to determine just how much would be subtracted from it (the difference accruing to the Authority) if the \u201cnet contract sum\u201d were less than the \u201cStated Allowance,\u201d or how much the Authority would be required to add to the general contractor\u2019s price if the \u201cnet contract sum\u201d exceeded the \u201cStated Allowance.\u201d In the instant case, the cost to the Authority was decreased by the difference between $90,000 and Higgins\u2019 bid of $66,693. Had the plaintiff\u2019s bid of $64,-695 been accepted, an additional $2,000 would have accrued to the Authority.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Nor do we find any inconsistency to result from the provision in the bidding form for \u201cADDITIONS OR DEDUCTIONS in yardage.\u201d Read in the light of paragraphs 17 and 18 of the General Conditions, that provision applies to carpeting either added to or eliminated from the work fixed by the specifications. Paragraph 17, entitled \u201cChanges in Work,\u201d provides, \u201c... Charges or credits for the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>covered by the... change shall be determined by one or more, or a combination of the following methods: (a) <em>Unit bid prices previously </em>approved...\u201d (emphasis supplied). And paragraph 18, entitled \u201cExtras,\u201d provides, \u201cWithout invalidating the contract, the Owner may order extra work or make changes by... <em>adding </em>to or <em>deducting </em>from the work, the <em>contract </em>sum being adjusted accordingly____All the work of the kind bid upon shall be <em>paid for at the price stipulated in the </em>proposal...\u201d (emphasis supplied). It seems clear that the prices requested in the bidding form for the additions or deductions are intended to provide the \u201cunit bid prices previously approved\u201d if there should be changes in work, and the \u201cprice stipulated in the proposal\u201d if there should be extras.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Accordingly, interpreting the bidding form to achieve internal consistency and consistency with all the bidding documents, we hold that the plaintiff was the lowest eligible and responsible bidder and was entitled to the award of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">3. The plaintiff asks that damages be assessed against the Authority. It appears from the transcript that the question of damages was deferred until the issue of entitlement to the contract was decided, but the trial court\u2019s disposition of the case precluded litigation of that issue. Therefore, the trial court on remand will be required to deal with the matter and decide, in the light of the facts developed, the extent to which the case of <em>Sardella Constr. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Braintree Housing Authy. ante, </em>326, 331-335 (1975), further appellate review granted 368 Mass. 817 (1975), is applicable. See <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Burlington, ante, </em>at 402-403 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The final decree is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-11\"> Only Higgins among the defendants filed a brief in this case. The Authority stated in a letter to this court that Higgins\u2019 brief represented the position of the Authority. Schroeder did not file an answer or otherwise participate in the proceedings in the Superior Court or in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-6\"> Section 17 reads in part: \u201cThe provisions of sections twenty-six to twenty-nine, inclusive, and of sections forty-four A to forty-four L, inclusive, of chapter one hundred and forty-nine of the General Laws, and the provisions of section thirty-nine F and thirty-nine G of chapter thirty of the General Laws are hereby made applicable to the Authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\"> Indeed, the subcontract, which was ultimately signed by Higgins and Schroeder, was in the form provided in \u00a7 441, omitting only paragraph 5 (here inapplicable) which provides: \u201cThis agreement is contingent upon the execution of a general contract between the Contractor and the Awarding Authority for the complete work.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\"> The bypass of \u00a7 44H in favor of \u00a7 441 does not seem to us to have resulted in added cost to the Authority or to have impinged on the other purpose of the public bidding statute to \u201cestablish [] an honest and open procedure for competition... [and] place [] all general contractors and sub-bidders on an equal footing.\u201d <em>Interstate Engr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass, at 758. Indeed, if anyone were disadvantaged by the bypass of \u00a7 44H, it would have been Schroeder, the general contractor, to which \u00a7 44H would have given some flexibility in choosing a subcontractor. Apart from the general contractor\u2019s interest, we do not see that the deviation was of significance, either to the parties or to the public. <em>Ahern Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Acton-Boxborough Regional Sch. Dist. </em>340 Mass. 355, 358-359 (1960). <em>Gil-Bern Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>353 Mass. at 505-507. See <em>Loranger </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Regional High Sch. Dist. Sch. Comm. </em>338 Mass. 450, 458-459 (1959). And there may have been good reason to handle the carpeting in this way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\"> The \u201cSUB-CONTRACT FORM\u201d provided in pertinent part: \u201cThe Subcontractor agrees to furnish all labor and materials required for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the completion of all work specified for CARPETING \u2014 STUDENT HOUSING, PHASE II, SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS UNIVERSITY, and the plans referred to therein.. . for SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS UNIVERSITY BUILDING AUTHORITY, all as prepared by ...
