The case is before us on the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>mittee\u2019s appeal under G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 ID (as in effect prior to St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 60), from an order for judgment in favor of the petitioner, and on the committee\u2019s exceptions to the denial of certain of its requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The principal issue presented by the appeal is whether the petitioner, at the time the committee refused to renew his employment for the 1973-1974 school year, had acquired tenure at discretion under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41 (as amended through St. 1956, c. 132, \u00a7 1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>and \u00a7 42 (as amended through St. 1970, c. 388, \u00a7 1).- If he had acquired such tenure, the committee could dismiss him only by complying with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 42, which were not observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The parties stipulated facts which are dispositive of the appeal. The petitioner was first employed by the Easton schools between September 1,1969, and November 10,1969, as a substitute teacher. During that time he taught for eleven days, filling in for absent teachers. On November 10, 1969, the petitioner was appointed a full time teacher and served as such for the remainder of the 1969-1970 school year. During that year, the petitioner was employed for a total of 147 days, eleven days as a substitute teacher and 136 days as a regular teacher. The full 1969-1970 year was 182 days. The petitioner was thereafter employed by the committee as a regular teacher during the 1970-1971, 1971-1972, and 1972-1973 school years. On April 10, 1973, the petitioner was notified that the committee would not renew his teacher\u2019s contract for the 1973-1974 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">On these facts it cannot be concluded that the petitioner, when hired for the 1972-1973 school year, had served \u201cfor the three previous consecutive school years\u201d so as to acquire tenure under \u00a7 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>It has never been decided whether tenure under \u00a7 41 can be attained through substantially full time employment as a substitute teacher. See <em>Nester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, </em>318 Mass. 538, 541-542 (1945). In that case the court did hold, however, that \u201cthe phrase \u2018served... for the three previous consecutive school years\u2019 in \u00a7 41 signifies a continuity of service for that period and is not satisfied by intermittent and irregular service as a substitute.\u201d 318 Mass. at 542. The petitioner\u2019s eleven days of substitute teaching during the period September 1,1969, to November 10, 1969, cannot be characterized as more than \u201cintermittent and irregular service.\u201d The petitioner\u2019s 136 days of full time service for the remainder of the 1969-1970 school year occupied \u201ca substantial period of time in... [that year], but it was considerably less than the period comprising a normal school year and does not in our opinion constitute the regular and continuous employment that the statute contemplates.\u201d <em>Nester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We do not agree with the petitioner\u2019s contention that this case is governed by <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schools of Quincy, </em>363 Mass. 731 (1973), and <em>Frye </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Leicester, </em>300 Mass. 537 (1938), both of which held that tenure under \u00a7 41 can be attained through part-time employment of a regular and continuous nature for the requisite period. In the <em>Frye </em>case, the teacher who was held to have attained tenure had been hired, during the first of the three probationary years, to teach three periods out of seven each day. The court stated that \u201cthe statute recognizes no separate classification of \u2018part time\u2019 teachers. ... [T]he findings show continuous employment of a substantial <em>character.. .for the entire period.\u201d </em>300 Mass. at 540 (emphasis supplied). The plaintiff in the <em>Ryan </em>case, although called a \u201cpermanent substitute teacher,\u201d was in fact a permanent part-time teacher hired to teach a specified number of days, each week for eleven entire school years. The <em>Ryan </em>case (at 738-739) delineates and reaffirms the distinction between regular part-time service, such as that in the <em>Frye </em>case, and irregular intermittent service, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>such as that in the <em>Nester </em>case. The latter governs the facts in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In view of the outcome of the appeal, the committee\u2019s bill of exceptions is deemed waived. The order for judgment is reversed, and the petition is to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\"> \u201cEvery school committee, in electing a teacher... who has served in its public schools for the three previous consecutive school years ... shall employ him to serve at its discretion....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> \u201c[A] teacher ... employed at discretion under ...
