L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. The defendant Kennedy questions the findings of independent bases of in-court identifications made by two prosecution witnesses and challenges the exclusion of questions put to the victim on cross-examination. Assignments of error not argued in the defendant\u2019s brief are deemed waived. Rule 1:13 of the Appeals Court, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 889 (1972). The defendant Wilson raises the question whether, in the circumstances of this case, an in-court identification resulted in a denial of due process of law, notwithstanding his failure to move to suppress the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>identification or to take an exception to its admission. He also contests the denial of his motion for a directed verdict, on the ground that sufficient evidence was not introduced to establish his complicity in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">From the evidence introduced at trial the jury could have found the following facts. Kennedy sought and obtained permission to borrow a station wagon from one Lee Guest. Wilson drove the car to a shopping area in Williams-town in which was located the Colonial Package Store. There was only one other car in the area of the parking lot which served the store. Wilson parked alongside that car, although heading in the opposite direction, i.e., away from the package store. The parking spaces between the two cars and the store were all vacant. The other car was occupied by a thirteen-year old girl, Laurie Richardson, and her two-year old niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Kennedy got out of the car and went into the package store for approximately five minutes. He purchased six bottles of beer from Barbara Mottor, the proprietor of the store. When this transaction was completed, he asked her for change for the telephone. When she opened the cash register, he reached for the money in the register and pulled a gun. Kennedy instructed Mottor to sit on the floor and proceeded to clean out the register. He then ran back to the car (without the beer), stuffing the money into his pocket. He \u201cjumped in,\u201d and the car drove off. A gun, which was identified as the one used in the robbery, was later found underneath the seat on the driver\u2019s side of the station wagon. It was a toy gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">1. Kennedy took exception to the denial of his motions to suppress the anticipated (and subsequently admitted) in-court identifications of him by Barbara Mottor and Laurie Richardson, claiming that their identifications were tainted by impermissibly suggestive out-of-court identifications.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have carefully reviewed the evidence at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>pre-trial hearing held on the motions, and we conclude that the judge\u2019s findings of fact were supported by the evidence. We further conclude that his determination that Mottor\u2019s in-court identification would have an independent source was fully supported by his subsidiary findings* and reflected a proper application of the standards laid down by the United States Supreme Court <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218 [1967]; <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293 [1967]; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U. S. 377 [1967]), and repeated in this jurisdiction on many occasions. 4 See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>356 Mass. 74 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>357 Mass. 250 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>361 Mass. 431, 434-438 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Leaster, </em>362 Mass. 409 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>362 Mass. 542 (1972), and cases cited therein; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 282, 286-288 (1973). It was also established by clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identification by Richardson would have an independent source.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[Cjareful findings supported by the evidence and upholding an in-court identification are not likely to be disturbed by us.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, supra, </em>at 254. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra, </em>at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">2. Kennedy also argues that he was denied the right to cross-examine the victim Mottor at trial as to whether the man who robbed her had a moustache. He claims that the exclusion by the trial judge of a series of three questions put to the victim impermissibly circumscribed his right to confront the witnesses against him in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (see <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U. S. 400 [1965]), and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The point is not well taken. The trial judge did not rule out the subject matter which counsel for the defendant was attempting to elicit. Rather, he was waiting for counsel to formulate the question in an acceptable form.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that after three attempted questions counsel for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ant never returned to this subject matter indicates to us no more than that counsel voluntarily, although perhaps in frustration, chose to abandon this line of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The defendant took an exception only to the exclusion of the third formulation of the question, and thus we shall consider whether that question was properly excluded. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>358 Mass. 233, 236 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richter, post, </em>701 (1975). The form of the third attempted question was, \u201cDid you see a man in your store on July 5,1973 that had a moustache?\u201d The question is too vague and indefinite since it apparently anticipates an answer that would include any man who was in the store on the designated day. See generally, Leach &amp; Liacos, Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence, 69 (4th ed. 1967); McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 7 (2d ed. 1972); Underhill, Criminal Evidence, \u00a7 491 (5th ed. 1956). It was properly within the discretion of the judge to exclude the question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>339 Mass. 557, 580-581 (1959); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slaney, </em>345 Mass. 135, 142 (1962); Mottla, Proof of Cases, \u00a7 447 (2d ed. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">3. Wilson contends in his brief that it was error to admit the in-court identification of him by Laurie Richardson. He argues that the use of the in-court identification violated his due process rights in that it was based on a momentary observation and was tainted by suggestive pretrial confrontations. However, we do not consider the argument. The defendant\u2019s assignments of error contain no reference to this point. No motion to suppress or motion to strike was made, and no objection or exception was taken to the identification testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel instead attacked the identification on cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 387, 389 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(1974). He introduced in evidence a photographic identification of the defendant by the witness,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> an accidental confrontation as the handcuffed defendant entered the District Court building,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the observation and identification of the defendant by the witness at the probable cause hearing in the District Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Defense counsel apparently chose as a matter of strategy to challenge the in-court identification by presenting the question of its reliability to the jury, to be considered as part of their factual determination. The defendant, not having raised at trial any question of law whether the in-court identification should have been suppressed, and not having claimed an assignment of error on this point, cannot now raise it before us. It has been stated broadly that in appeals under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, an assignment of error is necessary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>333 Mass. 751, 756 (1956), and cases cited. However, as was stated in the <em>Conroy </em>case: \u201c[Wjhile, in a proper case, we have said that a defendant cannot raise a question of law for the first time in a brief filed in this court, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Skalberg, </em>333 Mass. 255, 256 [1955], we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>also said that in appropriate instances this court has and will exercise the power to set aside a verdict or finding in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice when a decisive matter has not been raised at the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conroy, supra, </em>at 757, and cases cited. A careful examination of the record reveals that no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice is present in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dupont, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 571 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">4. Wilson also contests the denial of his motion for a directed verdict, on the ground that sufficient evidence was not introduced to establish his complicity in the robbery.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The evidence as to Wilson\u2019s participation in the robbery was as follows. Wilson and Kennedy picked up the car from Lee Guest shortly before the robbery. When Guest turned the car over to them, Wilson immediately took the driver\u2019s seat. In the parking lot, Wilson parked the car some distance from the store heading away from the store and toward an exit. After committing the robbery, Kennedy ran toward the car, opened the door, and \u201cjumped in.\u201d There was evidence that Kennedy did not have any beer or a bottle of liquor from the store. The car than drove off. The toy gun, identified as the one used to perpetrate the robbery, was later found underneath the front seat of the car on the driver\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The jury were free to infer from the above evidence that Wilson was engaged in a joint enterprise with Kennedy to rob the liquor store. \u201c Tt is not essential that the inferences drawn from facts or circumstances be necessary inferences.\u2019 The inferences must only be reasonable and possible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mangula, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 785, 791 (1975), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>354 Mass. 193, 197 (1968), cert. den. sub nom. <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>393 U.S. 1058 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\"> The judge suppressed out-of-court identifications by Barbara Mot-tor of Kennedy at the North Adams police station, where the defendants were the only two nonuniformed persons present, and at the Wil-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>liamstown police station, where a photograph of Kennedy was the only one bearing the date of the robbery. The judge also suppressed an out-of-court photographic identification by Laurie Richardson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> The judge found that Barbara Mottor had the following opportunity to observe the person who robbed her in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u201cThat the person was in the store for approximately five minutes and was in and around the shelves.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\u201cThat there were certain partitions in this store that cut the defendant\u2019s view off from Barbara Mottor for part of the time, but that she did wait upon the man who came in,...</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">\u201cThat she had an observation of him in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">\u201cThat this observation was made during the daytime.

S. 901 (1973), affd. on rehearing 363 Mass. 665 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 282, 287 (1973). See note 3, <em>supra, </em>and note 5, <em>infra, </em>as to the judge\u2019s findings concerning the witnesses\u2019 opportunities to observe Kennedy. It is also significant for the finding of an independent basis for the in-court identification that the observation is made \u201cunder circumstances likely to fix in the mind of the witness the identity of the person confronted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>357 Mass. 250, 254 (1970). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, supra, </em>at 288. The witness Mottor, who viewed the defendant while he pointed the gun at her, and the witness Richardson, who observed the defendant stuffing money into his pocket while running, both observed the defendant under impressionable circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b240-6\"> As to Laurie Richardson\u2019s ability to observe, the judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">\u201cThat she saw a man get out of the passenger\u2019s side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">\u201cThat he looked toward her and she looked toward him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">\u201cThat she saw him walk some thirty or forty feet into the package store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">\u201cThat sometime thereafter he came out of the package store and was sort of running, and that he was tucking money into his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">\u201cThat she saw him on the side view, and saw him as he got into the car, at which time he faced toward her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">\u201cThat she had an opportunity to look at him anywhere from five to ten to fifteen seconds, or longer. The exact time was not given. Her estimate was that it took him about five seconds to walk, or run from the package store back to the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b240-13\"> The trial judge made clear that his reasons for excluding the questions were on the basis of the form of the questions only. After the first question, he stated, \u201cI will sustain the objection to the form. You can rephrase that question.\u201d After the second question he stated, \u201cIn that form, sustained,\u201d and after the third, \u201cIn that form I will sustain it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\"> Counsel for the defendant initially did object to the in-court identification on the ground that there was no evidence that the witness had observed the defendant at the time of the incident. (This assertion was erroneous as there had been such evidence.) However, when the court questioned defense counsel as to whether he wanted the prosecution to develop such a foundation, defense counsel withdrew his objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b242-5\"> The testimony elicited from the witness, first by Wilson\u2019s counsel and then on redirect by the prosecution, concerning <em>the </em>photographic identification indicates that the witness correctly identified the defendant\u2019s picture from the two sets of four different pictures she was shown. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion before us now that the picture of the defendant was in some way conspicuous, the witness testified there was no special notation on the picture. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U. S. 377 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>361 Mass. 665, 672-673, 675-676 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\"> See <em>Geraway </em>v. <em>Scafati, </em>320 F.
