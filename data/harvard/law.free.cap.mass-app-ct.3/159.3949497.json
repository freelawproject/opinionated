J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsR\">This is a bill in equity to restrain the defendants from obstructing a watercourse which carries the flow of \u201csurface water\u201d from land owned by the trustees of the Parkview Electronics Trust<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and from higher land across the trustees\u2019 and the defendants\u2019 lands to the Aber-jona River. The plaintiff also seeks an assessment of damages. The case was referred to a master to \u201cfind the subsidiary facts on each issue tried and report them and his general findings based on such subsidiary findings to the court.\u201d Rule 86 of the Superior Court (as amended effective June 1, 1970). The defendants filed objections to the master\u2019s report (which are treated as exceptions) and moved to discharge the reference to the master and to set aside his report. Upon the denial of that motion, the defendants moved to have the report recommitted. That motion was also denied, and an interlocutory decree was entered overruling the defendants\u2019 exceptions and confirming the master\u2019s report. The trial judge then entered a final decree ordering the defendants to unblock and reconstruct the alleged watercourse and to grant the trustees an easement to maintain the watercourse as reconstructed. The defendants appeal from the denial of both motions and from the interlocutory and final decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">We summarize the material facts found by the master. The trustees\u2019 property adjoins the northerly side of the defendants\u2019 property. South of the defendants\u2019 property is the Aberjona River, toward which slope all of the trustees\u2019 and defendants\u2019 property and the nearby land. Running approximately along the boundary between the trustees\u2019 and defendants\u2019 properties, but entirely on the defendants\u2019 property, is an abandoned railroad spur track, the roadbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>of which is appreciably higher than the surrounding land.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u201c[T]he water drainage system of the... [trustees\u2019] property carries its water in a southerly direction to... [a] cul de sac at the entrance of\u201d a concrete or stone culvert or pipe which leads under the spur railroad track to a formerly \u201cswampy area\u201d on the defendants\u2019 property apparently extending to the Aberjona River. Metropolitan Sewerage Commission plans of 1893 and 1914 \u201cindicate a culvert construction under the... spur track at the locus of\u201d the present culvert. \u201c[T]here was evidence\u201d that in 1959 the culvert protruded from the southerly side of the roadbed and was called to the attention of one of the defendants; however, a prior owner of the trustees\u2019 property apparently discovered the existence of the culvert in late 1959 only after he looked at an old plan indicating its existence and \u201cunearthed\u201d its northerly opening. Although the master reported that there was no evidence that anyone had ever seen any water flowing from the southerly end of the culvert, he did find that around 1960 water was observed \u201cseeping\u201d into its northerly end. The master also found that \u201cwater has been seen on a number of occasions at the culvert entrance on one day and then less water at this same entrance or mouth the next day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">On December 31, 1959, the defendants leased their property for a period of one year to the town of Winchester (town) for use as a dump. The town\u2019s dumping and landfill operations caused the level of the defendants\u2019 property to be raised. When the town\u2019s bulldozer operator showed the culvert opening to one of the defendants, that defendant told him to bury the culvert opening.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the blockage of the culvert, water, backing up from the \u201carea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>near the culvert,\u201d flooded parts of the trustees\u2019 property in 1962, 1967, and 1968. (There was also a finding by the master that water from the trustees\u2019 property flooded the defendants\u2019 property in 1963 and 1965.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The master\u2019s general findings included findings (1) \u201cthat a well defined water course exists on the... [trustees\u2019] property,\u201d (2) \u201cthat the 1893 and 1914 plans indicate that ... [in the construction of the culvert] pains were taken for purposes of continuing an existing flow of water in its southerly direction to the river,\u201d and \u201cindicate a south westerly water course from the... [defendants\u2019] end of the now buried culvert in a definite direction to the area of the... Aberjona River,\u201d (3) \u201cif such course existed that a significant portion was covered by the landfill operation conducted on... [the defendants\u2019] premises,\u201d and (4) that there was no evidence from which to determine the trustees\u2019 monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">1. If the trustees\u2019 \u201cwater drainage system\u201d was part of a natural watercourse which continued across the defendants\u2019 property to the Aberjona River, the defendants can be ordered to unblock that portion of the watercourse which has been covered up. See <em>McGowen </em>v. Carr, 272 Mass. 573, 576 (1930); <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fortier, </em>292 Mass. 268, 272, 274 (1935); <em>DiNardo </em>v. <em>Dovidio, </em>312 Mass. 398, 402 (1942); <em>Kuklinska </em>v. <em>Maplewood Homes, Inc. </em>336 Mass. 489, 494 (1957); <em>Lincoln Park Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>339 Mass. 334, 336 (1959); <em>Myhr </em>v. <em>Vlahakis, </em>348 Mass. 795 (1965). However, the findings of the master leave us in doubt whether the trustees\u2019 \u201cdrainage system\u201d was part of a natural watercourse. To prove the existence of a watercourse \u201cit must be made to appear that the water usually flows in a certain direction, and by a regular channel, with banks or sides. It need not be shown to flow continually; it may be dry at times, but it must have a well defined and substantial existence.\u201d <em>Ashley </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>11 Cush. 192,195 (1853). See also <em>Yaskill </em>v. <em>Thibault, </em>273 Mass. 266, 268 (1930); <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fortier, </em>292 Mass. 268, 271, 274 (1935); <em>Kuklinska </em>v. <em>Maplewood Homes, Inc. </em>336 Mass. 489, 493 (1957). The master\u2019s findings on the issue whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>there was a sufficiently constant flow of water to constitute a watercourse appear to be more in the nature of a recital of contradictory evidence than findings of fact. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Noone, </em>341 Mass. 488, 490-491 <em>(1960); Flynn </em>v. <em>Korsack, </em>343 Mass. 15, 16-17 (1961); <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Rainbow Recording Corp. </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 783, 784, n. 2 (1974). But even assuming the master\u2019s report contains sufficient findings for us to infer the necessary flow of water, the report is inadequate in another respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The report contains no finding as to the source of the alleged waterflow other than the drainage of surface water from the trustees\u2019 land. Contrast <em>McGowen </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>272 Mass. 573, 575-576 <em>(1930); Kuklinska </em>v. <em>Maplewood Homes, Inc. </em>336 Mass. 489, 493 (1957); <em>Myhr </em>v. <em>Vlahakis, </em>348 Mass. 795 (1965). Such a fact, standing alone, does not negative the existence of a natural watercourse. See <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fortier, </em>292 Mass. 268, 271, 273-274 (1935). Nor does the fact that the alleged watercourse flowed in a man-made channel along a part of its route. See <em>Stimson </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>197 Mass. 568, 570-572 (1908); <em>McGowen </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>272 Mass. 573, 575-576 (1930); <em>Yaskill </em>v. <em>Thibault, </em>273 Mass. 266, 267, 268 <em>(1930); Kuklinska </em>v. <em>Maplewood Homes, Inc. </em>336 Mass. 489, 493-494 (1957). But, given these facts, in order for us to find that the now obstructed channel is a natural watercourse, it must also appear that the channel was something more than an artificial \u201cditch for carrying off surface water and draining the land through which it passed.\u201d <em>Stimson </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>197 Mass. 568, 572 (1908). See <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>7 Allen 19, 21-22 (1863); <em>Fortier </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>307 Mass. 292, 294-296 (1940); <em>Kuklinska </em>v. <em>Maplewood Homes, Inc. </em>336 Mass. 489, 493-494 (1957), citing <em>Stimson </em>v. <em>Brookline, supra. </em>Compare <em>Kuklinska </em>v. <em>Maplewood Homes, Inc., supra, </em>at 492-493. Here this requirement could best be met by a showing that, at some point in time, surface water from the area in question, unassisted by man, gathered and flowed in a natural channel over substantially the same ground as the now obstructed channel. Compare <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fortier, </em>292 Mass. 268, 272-274 (1935), with <em>Fortier </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>307 Mass. 292, 294-296 (1940). See also <em>Braun </em>v. <em>Foxboro Co. </em>346 Mass. 771 (1963). But on this issue of fact the master\u2019s report is completely silent. It contains no finding (nor any findings which would support an inference, <em>National Hearing Aid Centers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avers, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 285, 286 [1974], and cases cited) whether the trustees\u2019 \u201cdrainage system\u201d is a naturally existing channel, a substitute therefor, or an artificial drainage ditch; it contains no finding whether any \u201cexisting flow of water\u201d which the original culvert was designed to carry under the spur track was an existing flow in a natural channel. Although we might infer that the \u201cswampy area\u201d on the defendants\u2019 property existed naturally, a swampy area hardly qualifies as the \u201cstream of water ... having a bed and sides or banks\u201d necessary to constitute a natural watercourse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Luther </em>v. <em>Winnisimmet Co. </em>9 Cush. 171, 174 (1851).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">2. The master\u2019s findings of fact suggest the possibility that the trustees have obtained a prescriptive easement to drain onto the defendants\u2019 property. See <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>7 Allen 19, 21-22 (1863); <em>DiNardo </em>v. <em>Dovidio, </em>312 Mass. 398, 402-403 (1942); <em>Kuklinska </em>v. <em>Maplewood Homes, Inc. </em>336 Mass. 489, 494 (1957). But as neither the parties nor the master has considered the question, we are not in a position to make a determination whether the trustees have obtained any such easement. For example, while unexplained use of an easement for twenty years will be presumed to be under claim of right and adverse <em>(For-tier </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>307 Mass. 292, 298 [1940]), here, because the easement issue has not been raised, the defendants have had no opportunity to show that the trustees\u2019 and their predecessors\u2019 use of any easement, even assuming it to have been open and continuous (see <em>Foot </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>Bauman, </em>333 Mass. 214, 216-218 [1955]), was permissive, or was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">3. For the reasons stated above, the master has failed to make sufficient subsidiary findings on vital issues. The case is to be remanded to be further heard by the judge or recommitted to the master to make additional findings. The judge is to determine to what extent the report of the master is to be set aside. <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>329 Mass. 36, 42-43 (1952). <em>Lenari </em>v. <em>Kingston, </em>342 Mass. 705, 709-710 (1961). <em>Lattuca </em>v. <em>Cusolito, </em>343 Mass. 747, 753 (1962). <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Rootes Motors, Inc. </em>348 Mass. 464, 469 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The interlocutory and final decrees are reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\"> The plaintiff is the managing agent of this property.
