The case involved the validity of article 562, Customs Regulations 1899, so far as it relates to Tariff Act July 24, 1897. e. 11, \u00a7 2, Free List, par. 649, 30 Stat. 194 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1687]. The pertinent portion of said article reads as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b526-4\">\u201cArt. 562. When entry is made free of duty under paragraphs * * * 649, * * * of the act of July 24, 1897, the oath or declaration required of the importer or consignee must be actually made at the time of entry, and no bond for the production of the same will be accepted in lieu thereof.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-5\">Curie, Smith &amp; Maxwell (W.

S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1687], The oaths necessary to establish the right to free entry were not before the collector at the time of making the entry, but they were before him at the time of its liquidation. There is no regulation which empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to abridge the right of free entry of articles such as those here in question when imported under the conditions shown to exist herein; and inasmuch as the evidence of said right was before the collector at the time of his action, duty should not have been assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The decision of the Board of General Appraisers is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
