After a trial before the court without a jury, judgment was granted for $3,583.50.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its conclusions of law the trial court concluded that \u201cplaintiff is not entitled to attachment or order of arrest against the defendants by virtue of the provisions of section 826 of the New York Civil Practice Act.\u201d In its oral opinion prior to formal judgment the trial court stated that New York\u2019s law as to body execution was \u201can antiquated law\u201d; that he was not satisfied that he \u201cwould incarcerate anyone for a civil debt\u201d; that such a law goes \u201cback a few centuries\u201d ; and that possibly we have \u201coutlived that procedure.\u201d The trial court mindful of the stories of debtors\u2019 prisons of two centuries ago obviously did not wish to lend itself to any part of such a practice in this more enlightened day and age \u2014 and understandably so. Equally important is the protection of victims of fraud and embezzlement and the use of all lawful forces of government to restore to them their property of which they have been deprived.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-20\">Two statutes relating to the question in issue, and still in good standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>in New York, are sections 826<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 764<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the New York Civil Practice Act. Section 826 gives a right to arrest in an action involving the wrongful conversion of property. This section is implemented by Rule 64 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. providing that \u201cAt the commencement of and during the course of an action\u201d remedies provided by the laws of the state, including arrest, are available. Section 764 deals with the \u201cIssuance of execution against the person generally.\u201d Rule 69(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure transposes this remedy into federal practice in aid of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Plaintiff here did not cause the defendants to be arrested during the action. Judgment has now been obtained and execution remains unsatisfied. Section 764 and not section 826 prescribes the proper procedure, namely, an application upon affidavit stating the nature of the action, the right to execution, the amount of the judgment, the amount unpaid and the time when and the place where the judgment has been returned wholly or partially unsatisfied. When these facts are presented the court may grant such relief, if any, under section 764 as in its discretion may be justified under the circumstances. There was no occasion to incorporate any relief obtainable under section 826 in the judgment. Paragraph 5 of the Conclusions.- of Law is stricken. The judgment otherwise is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-21\">.

The issuance of the execution shall rest in the discretion of such court, judge or justice. The application for the issuance of the execution may be made without notice, or with such notice as the court, judge or justice may direct, and shall be made by affidavit which shall set forth in detail the right of the party to the execution, the amount of the judgment, the amount unpaid, and the time when and place where the execution against the judgment debtor\u2019s personal property has been returned wholly or partially unsatisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
