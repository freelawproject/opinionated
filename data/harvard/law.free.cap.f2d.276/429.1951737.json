The terms under which the fund is to be administered are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>set forth in a trust agreement dated February 27,1953. The agreement closely follows the requirements of Section 302(c) (5) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 186(c) (5). It provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that management of the fund, which consists exclusively of annual contributions by the publishers, shall be in the hands of six trustees, of whom three are to be appointed by the Association and three by the Union. The fund was initially established in 1953. The welfare benefits payable under the trust agreement have been provided for by the purchase of contracts from insurance companies, the premiums therefor being paid from the fund. In 1957 the three Union trustees proposed that the trustees investigate the possibility of adopting a self-insurance program rather than continuing to pay premiums to independent insurance companies. The trustees authorized a consulting firm to make the investigation. The firm reported, stating that, as to many of the benefits the fund was intended to provide, self-insurance would be feasible and would achieve a small annual saving. At a meeting on November 19, 1957 the Union trustees proposed that the fund become a self-insurer in those areas in which the report had indicated such a program would be feasible. The Association trustees voted against the proposal. A deadlock thereby having been created the Union trustees, pursuant to paragraph 10.E. of the trust agreement, petitioned the district court for the appointment of an impartial umpire to resolve the deadlock, a power expressly conferred upon the district court by Section 302(c) (5) (B) of the Labor Management Relations Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court below, Bryan, J., 166 F.Supp. 929, granted the petition, and the Association trustees have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Appellants\u2019 argument is quite simple. The parties agree that paragraph 10.E. of the trust agreement should be regarded as an arbitration clause. The parties further agree that if an umpire were appointed he would have only those powers conferred in paragraph 10.E. Paragraph 10.E. gives the umpire power over \u201c * * * a deadlock upon any question coming before the Trustees for decision.\u201d Appellants contend that since the scope of the trustees\u2019 power is limited to the functions provided for in the trust agreement, the above-quoted language should be construed so as to limit the umpire\u2019s power to the same functions. Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>maintain that the proposal for self-insurance was beyond the scope of the trust agreement and that, since there could be no issue for the umpire to arbitrate, they conclude that the district coui't erred in granting appellees\u2019 petition that an umpire be appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">In Local No. 149 of American Federation of Technical Engineers v. General Electric Co., 1 Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 922, 927, certiorari denied 1958, 356 U.S. 938, 78 S.Ct. 780, 2 L.Ed.2d 813, it was aptly said by Judge Magruder that when a party to a collective bargaining agreement seeks a federal decree compelling arbitration under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, the court \u201chas the inescapable obligation to determine as a preliminary matter that the defendant has contracted to refer such issue to arbitration, and has broken this promise.\u201d See also Brass and Copper Workers Federal Labor Union, etc. v. American Brass Co., 7 Cir., 1959, 272 F.2d 849, 853. The parties have pointed out no reason why a district court should restrict itself more severely when asked to appoint an umpire under \u00a7 302(c) (5). The promise of the parties was to agree on an umpire \u201cin the event of a deadlock upon any question coming before the Trustees for decision.\u201d Decision implies choice; in no real sense does a question come before the trustees for decision if the answer sought by the proponent would require action plainly beyond the powers conferred upon the trustees. In other words, while a trustee petitioning for the appointment of an umpire need not demonstrate that his interpretation that the issue was one the trustees could decide is the correct one, see Engineers Association v. Sperry Gyroscope Co., 2 Cir., 1957, 251 F.2d 133, 137, certiorari denied 1958, 356 U.S. 932, 78 S.Ct. 774, 2 L.Ed.2d 762, he must at least establish that it is a possible one. As Chief Judge Murrah suggested in Local 1912, International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. United States Potash Co., 10 Cir., 1959, 270 F.2d 496, 498, certiorari denied, 80 S.Ct. 1609, a court need not order arbitration when it is prepared to say \u201cwith positive assurance that the contract is not susceptible to an interpretation to cover the asserted dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">Having examined the agreement, the relevant portions of which are set forth in the footnote,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3****8 we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>appellees\u2019 interpretation that self-insurance is a permissible alternative to the</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">purchase of insurance policies from independent insurance companies is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>fairly arguable. In addition to the overall tenor of the agreement, we are particularly drawn to this conclusion by consideration of Paragraph 5, commencing, \u201cThe Trustees shall use and apply the Trust Fund for the following purposes, and none other,\u201d going on to list three specific purposes, of which the purchase of insurance policies is one. Since the trustees were plainly without power to approve the proposal that the fund become self-insuring, any deadlock on this subject was not upon a \u201cquestion coming before the Trustees for decision,\u201d and appellants\u2019 promise to agree upon an umpire in such event did not become operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Judgment reversed with directions to dismiss the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-4\">. Section 302(c) (5) (B) provides that a trust agreement, in order for the trust to qualify under Section 302(c) (5), must contain the following provisions relative to the resolution of deadlocked questions: \u201c* * * jn the event the employer and employee groups deadlock on the administration of such fund and there are no neutral persons empowered to break such deadlock, such agreement provides that the two groups shall agree on an impartial umpire to decide such dispute, or in event of their failure to agree within a reasonable length of time, an impartial umpire to decide such dispute shall, on petition of either group, be appointed by the district court of the United States for the district where the trust fund has its principal office, * * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The trust agreement in the present case follows the requirements of Section 302 (c) (5) (B). Paragraph 10.E. reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">\u201cE. In the event of a deadlock upon any question coming before the Trustees for decision, the Trustee's shall agree on an Impartial Umpire, who shall sit with the Trustees as a committee to decide such question and whose decision, in the event of such deadlock, shall be final and binding. <em>Upon the failure of the Trustees to agree upon such Impartial Umpire </em>within seven days after said deadlock, the Impartial Umpire to decide such question shall, upon petition of either the Association-appointed Trustees or the Union-appointed Trustees, be appointed by the District Court of the United States for the District where the Fund has its principal office.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">The trust agreement employs the language : \u201cdeadlock upon any question coming before the Trustees for decision.\u201d The statutory language is: \u201cdeadlock on the administration of such fund.\u201d Appellees argue that by this difference of expression the parties intended an area of arbitrability greater than that required by Section 302(c) (5) (B). We, however, believe that the phrases have identical import.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-5\">.
