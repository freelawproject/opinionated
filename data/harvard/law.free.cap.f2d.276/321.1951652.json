The order resulted from a complaint by the Civil Aeronautics Administrator, as he was then called, charging that on July 17, 1958, petitioner had endorsed the log-book of R. C. Jaye for flight instruction when this had not been given by petitioner or any other holder of a flight instructor rating. Section 20.136 of the Civil Air Regulations, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.136, to which the complaint did not specifically refer, requires that a flight instructor \u201cshall sign the student pilot\u2019s record for each period of flight instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">Petitioner\u2019s answer admitted falsely signing Jaye\u2019s log-book but denied that \u201cthis displayed such disregard for the Civil Air Regulations that said flight instructor certificate should be revoked\u201d; as \u201cNew Matter\u201d petitioner recited alleged \u201cduress\u201d practiced on him by Jaye. Hearing was waived. The Hearing Examiner suggested that petitioner might wish to reconsider his waiver of a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>ing; petitioner did not do so. In accordance with the Board\u2019s practice in non-hearing cases, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.17, the Administrator then filed a \u201crecommendation\u201d with the Hearing Examiner. Attached to this were copies of two letters from Jaye. The first made the charge that petitioner had signed Jaye\u2019s log-book for a flight in which Jaye was accompanied by a pilot not licensed as an instructor. The second gave further details and added that, four days after the 45-minute Sight as to which petitioner had made the false entry, petitioner gave Jaye 45 minutes of instruction but did not sign the log. The recommendation commented adversely on petitioner\u2019s excuse as to duress. Petitioner says no copy of the recommendation was sent to him; the Board does not deny this. The Examiner rendered an Initial Decision concurring in the Administrator\u2019s view that the alleged duress did not excuse the false entry and ordering revocation. Petitioner appealed to the Board, alleging that the Examiner had not given adequate consideration to his defense of coercion and that the sanction was excessive. The Board affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">We need not pass upon the Board\u2019s contention that some of the attacks that petitioner now makes on the Board\u2019s order are not open to him under \u00a7 1006(e) of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486(e), which limits us to objections urged before the Board unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to urge them. For we find petitioner\u2019s objections to be without merit in any event. Petitioner criticizes the complaint on the ground that it did not inform him of the precise section of the Civil Air Regulations claimed to be violated. However, the complaint clearly apprised the petitioner of the facts contended to constitute a violation and the legal consequences claimed to ensue. It thus complied with \u00a7 5(a) (3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1004(a) (3); the Regulations had been duly published as required by \u00a7 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a), and the Administrator was not required to refer to the particular section claimed to have been violated, at least when his failure to do so was in no way misleading. American Newspaper Publishers Ass\u2019n v. N. L. R. B., 7 Cir., 1951, 193 F.2d 782, 799-800, affirmed, 1953, 345 U.S. 100, 73 S.Ct. 552, 97 L.Ed. 852; see N. L. R. B. v. Pecheur Lozenge Co., 2 Cir., 1953, 209 F.2d 393, 402, certiorari denied 1954, 347 U.S. 953, 74 S.Ct. 678, 98 L.Ed. 1099. Petitioner next attacks the failure to send him a copy of the Administrator\u2019s recommendation. While it would have been better practice to have done this, we cannot say that the Board\u2019s rule, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.17, required it or that the Board was bound to require it when hearing had been waived. In any event, petitioner was not prejudiced, since the recommendation contained no facts which petitioner disputed and he had full opportunity to reply to its arguments on his appeal from the Initial Decision. See Sisto v. C. A. B., 1949, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 31, 179 F.2d 47, 51. Plainly \u00a7 20.136 of the Regulations was violated; the mandate that an instructor \u201cshall sign the student pilot\u2019s record for each period of flight instruction\u201d means equally that he shall not sign the record for instruction not received. The Board was justified in overruling petitioner\u2019s excuses of \u201cduress\u201d on the part of Jaye and of penitence on his own part by giving Jaye a later lesson for which petitioner did not sign the log-book, the latter apparently constituting a fresh violation of the regulation. While the remedy of revocation, with a three-months\u2019 waiting period before issuance of a new certificate, may have been severe under the circumstances, we cannot find it was arbitrary where safety is at stake.
