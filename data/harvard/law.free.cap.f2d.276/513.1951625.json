The practices were found prohibited by \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-26\">Examination of the testimony before the Federal Trade Commission shows clearly that in the 21-jewel watch commonly sold by others in the trade there are no jewels that do not have either a function of bearing or a function of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tection against wear from friction, and that it is only stones that perform these functions that are properly called \u201cjewels\u201d in the watch industry. Cf. Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat: 621-622, 19 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 1001, Par. 367(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">As to the Resevoil device in question, convincing evidence indicated that the four stones of the Resevoil did not serve a mechanical function of bearing or of protection against frictional wear. Petitioner\u2019s statement that the Resevoil watches were 21-jewel watches is therefore misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We have examined the petitioner\u2019s other objections but find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The order of the Federal Trade Commission is affirmed and enforcement is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
