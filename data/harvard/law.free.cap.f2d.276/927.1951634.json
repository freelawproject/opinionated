The grievance asserted is that the person in the job was required to do \u201cgroup leading\u201d without being given group leader pay and a claim was made for such pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">Chief Judge Gourley in an exhaustive opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that the parties after a thorough trial period of approximately six months had agreed upon a classification of the job. That consisted of an appropriate job title, \u201cyard office clerk\u201d; evaluating the elements of the job and fixing a salary rate. There was the further finding that since then there had been no change in the duties of the position. The court rightly concluded that the problem before it was clearly a wage and job classification problem which was not subject to arbitration under the bargaining agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-15\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-13\">.
