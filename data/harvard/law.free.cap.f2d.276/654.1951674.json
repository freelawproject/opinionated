The sole point upon which he relies is his contention that his constitutional rights were violated by the search for and seizure of the narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Appellant was apprehended as he entered the United States at the Juarez International Bridge by customs agents who were informed that it was his purpose to import heroin from Mexico to the United States. After his apprehension appellant was seen to swallow an envelope. After he was subdued when he resisted detention, he was taken to a hospital where he was administered an emetic, which resulted in the regurgitation of the heroin, which was seized and held as evidence against him. The court denied his motion to suppress the evidence and found the appellant guilty upon the same evidence offered in connection \u25a0with the motion to suppress, the parties having stipulated that this course be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">The facts presented to the court below support its denial of the motion to suppress, bringing the case squarely under our holdings in King v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 754, and Ramirez v. United States, 5 Cir., 1959, 263 F.2d 385, and distinguishing it from the holding of the Supreme Court in Rochin v. California, 1952, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183. Upon the authority of these two decisions by this Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-16\">. And cf. Haerr v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 533, and Blackford v.
