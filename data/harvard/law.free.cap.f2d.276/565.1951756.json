H. Overholser, to enjoin them from using the appellee\u2019s trade names. In 1942 the appellee, a Georgia corporation, purchased the assets of a Florida corporation, \u201cCredit Bureau of Miami, Inc.,\u201d including the name \u201cCredit Bureau of Miami.\u201d The appellee allowed the Florida corporation to be dissolved by operation of law in 1945 for nonpayment of franchise taxes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>However, the appellee began operations of the purchased corporation on November 1, 1942, and operated its credit information business under the trade name \u201cCredit Bureau of Miami\u201d until April 1956. On the latter date the appellee began to use the similar trade name \u201cCredit Bureau of Greater Miami,\u201d and on April 18, 1956, registered this trade name under the Florida Fictitious Names Statute (F.S. \u00a7 865.09, F.S.A.) The appellee was known by, and referred <em>to </em>by, these trade names by its customers and the general public during these periods. The appellant, Overholser, had operated the same type business as the appellee in Dade County from 1934 to 1945 under the name \u201cCredit Service, jlnc.\u201d In 1945 this corporation was dissolved for nonpayment of franchise taxes, but Overholser continued in the same business under the same name until June 1957, when he formed the Florida corporation, \u201cThe Credit Bureau of South Florida.\u201d This corporation retained the trade name of \u201cCredit Service\u201d which was registered on August 20, 1957, under the Florida Fictitious Name Statute. In September 1957, Overholser formed .a second Florida corporation under the name \u201cMiami Credit Bureau, Inc.\u201d The \u25a0appellant corporation contracted for a listing in the Miami Telephone Directory \u25a0under the name \u201cMiami Credit Bureau, Inc.\u201d for the year commencing December 31, 1957. The district court found that Overholser knew that the appellee was operating in Dade County under the name of \u201cCredit Bureau of Miami\u201d and \u25a0since April 1957, under the name \u201cCredit Bureau of Greater Miami,\u201d and that \u25a0Overholser deliberately used the name \u201cCredit Bureau of Miami, Inc.\u201d for the purpose of misleading and confusing the public thereby obtaining business advantages which rightfully belonged to the appellee. The evidence discloses that there were delays in the appellee\u2019s mail .and telephone calls and an increase in its operating expenses resulting from this confusion, and the trial court ruled that the then existing jurisdictional amount of \u00a73000.00 was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The major contentions made by the appellant are: (1) A corporation may not lawfully acquire a vested right in its fictitious name; (2) the names here involved are not such as enjoy the protection of the law; (3) the appellee abandoned the trade name \u201cMiami Credit Bureau, Inc.\u201d when it allowed the Florida corporation to be dissolved and when it began using the name \u201cCredit Bureau of Greater Miami\u201d; (4) there was no proof of confusion such as would support the trial court\u2019s findings on this issue; and (5) there was no proof of damages in the amount of \u00a73000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The law is clearly against the appellant on the first point. Like a natural person, a corporation can acquire a fictitious or trade name particularly where it has a secondary meaning, as here. This principle of law is supported by the cases from numerous jurisdictions and by the texts. See, for example, Meredith v. Universal Plumbing &amp; Construction Co., 1938, 272 Ky. 283, 114 S.W.2d 94, 96, and 6 Fletcher on Corporations, \u00a7 2442 (1950 RV). No Florida statute or case has been cited to the contrary, and the extent to which Florida law prohibits the use by one corporation of the same name as that already being used by another corporation is indicated by the following language from this Court\u2019s decision in Scalise v. National Utility Service, 5 Cir., 1941, 120 F.2d 938, 940:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">\u201cIt is the law too, not only in Florida but generally elsewhere that it is a wrongful act to organize a domestic corporation by the same name as that already known to be used in the state by a foreign corporation, although the foreign corporation is not domesticated, but is doing business, in the state without a permit, and an injunction will issue, not merely after the charter has been obtained to prevent the use of the name in unfair competition, but to restrain the procuring or issuing of the charter under the proposed name or if the charter has been issued, to restrain the use of the name. 13 Am. Jur., Sec. 135, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>278; * * * Children\u2019s Bootery v. Sutker, 91 Fla. 60, 107 So. 345, 44 A.L.R. 698.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Second, the appellant contends that the words \u201cCredit Bureau\u201d and \u201cMiami\u201d are descriptive and geographical and, therefore, are incapable of being appropriated as a trade name. This is a well known limitation of the establishment of trademarks, but is not applicable to trade names. Children\u2019s Bottery v. Sutker, 1926, 91 Fla. 60, 107 So. 345, 44 A.L.R. 698. See also Restatement, Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 715, 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The argument that the appellee abandoned its trade names by expiration of its charter misses the whole point of the evidence that the public and particularly those desiring credit reports and making requests for information all considered the appellee as the \u201cMiami Credit Bureau\u201d and were confused by the appellant\u2019s use of the same name. Moreover, the appellee did not abandon the name \u201cCredit Bureau of Miami, Inc.\u201d but merely permitted the dissolution of the Florida corporation whose assets and name it had acquired. The \u201cMiami Credit Bureau\u201d and \u201cCredit Bureau of Greater Miami,\u201d if not the grammatical equivalent of each other, are so obviously synonymous as to be self-refutation of the contention that the appellee abandoned the former trade name when it began to use the latter in April of 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">It was also urged that the appellee did not prove the requisite jurisdictional amount of $3,000.00 existing prior to July 25, 1958. Some courts have recognized that an actual monetary loss or potential loss of the jurisdictional amount is not a requirement of jurisdiction in a suit for injunction for infringement of a trade name, but that the amount in controversy- is the value of the good will. See Safeway Stores v. Suburban Foods, D.C.E.D.Va.1955, 130 F.Supp. 249, 253. However, we need not rely on such a proposition in view of the trial court\u2019s finding of fact that the jurisdictional amount was directly involved. There was evidence to the effect that there was a delay in appellee\u2019s telephone calls, increased use of personnel time, greater operating costs and a loss of business resulting from the confusion in names. We think that in view of this evidence the trial court\u2019s determination was not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Likewise, the evidence is sufficient to support the finding that there was confusion caused by the appellant in refutation of the appellant\u2019s final contention that the trial court\u2019s findings on this matter were \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Indeed in a colloquy between the trial judge and Overholser the latter virtually admitted that he picked out the appellee\u2019s trade name and used it in the telephone directory in the hope that those looking for a credit bureau would find the name and come to him. In other words he was banking on creating confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
