The plaintiff was a guest in the home of the defendant\u2019s tenant. She received injury when a porch collapsed as she stepped on it in leaving the house. Jurisdiction is based solely on diversity of citizenship as the plaintiff is a Californian and the defendant a Pennsyl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>vania corporation. The accident took place in Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania law governs. The responsibility of a landlord for failure to make repairs was thoroughly discussed by the district judge in his examination of the Pennsylvania decisions on the subject. He came to the conclusion that there was no right by the tenant\u2019s guest against the landlord. We can add nothing to the district court\u2019s discussion of the Pennsylvania authority. D.G.W.D.Pa., 181 F. Supp. 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
