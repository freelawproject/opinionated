Martin Weiner Corp., 2 Cir., 274 F.2d 487, these appeals from orders granting temporary injunctions bring before us questions arising from the use of copyright to protect fabric designs.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Plaintiff owns two copyrights for designs known as \u201cNo. 965-Embroiderette\u201d and \u201cNo. 652-Embroiderette.\u201d The certificates are in the form used by the Register of Copyrights for \u201creproductions of a work of art,\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(h); the nature of the work is described as \u201cDesign.\u201d The designs covered by the two. copyrights are identical in form, but the fabrics differ somewhat in appearance since No. 965 was printed on a white and No. 652 on a checked red-and-white background. However, as the legal questions are the same, we shall generally discuss the case as if only one copyright were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">In contrast with Peter Pan, the design that plaintiff\u2019s fabric reproduced was not original with it. Plaintiff had seen the design embroidered on a dress which its stylist bought. The embroidery was what is known in the trade as \u201cSchiffli,\u201d this referring to a machine making embroidery of quality. Plaintiff\u2019s stylist had the embroidered design photographed and then worked with its fabric printer for some months to develop an arrangement of varying colors that would give on a flat surface something of the three-dimensional effect of embroidery. Plaintiff copyrighted a fabric reproduction so made in the summer of 1959, and offered the fabrics for sale to dress manufacturers shortly thereafter. No question is raised as to plaintiff\u2019s compliance with 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 10 concerning the copyright notice, see Peter Pan v. Martin Weiner Corp., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">At the end of 1959, defendants began to market among dress manufacturers fabrics which plaintiff claims to infringe-its copyrights. One of plaintiff\u2019s salesmen testified that a salesman of defendants, to whom he had complained of defendants\u2019 copying, admitted they had' purchased a dress containing plaintiff\u2019s, copyrighted design. Defendants offered no evidence to rebut the inference from this.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">At the end of January, 1960, plaintiffs brought two actions in the Southern District of New York for infringement of their respective copyrights. Plaintiffs sought temporary injunctions. Judge Dawson directed a hearing; this was held on February 1. Acting with dispatch, the judge handed down on February 9 an opinion directing that temporary injunctions issue; orders to that end were entered on February 15. Defendants appealed to this Court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (1), and moved for stays. \"When these motions came on for argument on February 29, Judge Clark, who was presiding, pointed out that, because of the relatively short lives of designs such as these, decisions with respect to the stays would determine the appeals for all practical purposes and suggested early argument on the appeals themselves. Accordingly, these were argued on March 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-16\"> Defendants do not dispute that the \u201cSchiffli\u201d embroidered design was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201cwork of art,\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(h), Mazer v. Stein, 1954, 347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630. Their principal argument both in the District Court and here was that, despite this, plaintiif\u2019s copyright was invalid since, in contrast with Peter Pan, the embroidered design was in the public domain and, as defendants alleged, plaintiff\u2019s reproduction contained no element of originality. We think Judge Dawson correctly held defendants\u2019 attack on the validity of the copyrights to be foreclosed by the principle enunciated in Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, Inc., 2 Cir., 1951, 191 F.2d 99, which upheld copyrights on mezzotint reproductions of paintings that were in the public domain. Judge Frank\u2019s opinion explained, with care and learning, the difference between the requirement of invention for patents and that of originality for copyrights, and reaffirmed the statement in Gerlach-Barklow Co. v. Morris &amp; Bendien, Inc., 2 Cir., 1927, 23 F.2d 159, 161, that the latter requirement was satisfied, in the case of a reproduction of a painting in the public domain, by \u201ca distinguishable variation.\u201d Here plaintiff offered substantial evidence that its creation of a three-dimensional effect, giving something of the impression of embroidery on a flat fabric, required effort and skill. Although others may have done the same with respect to other \u201cSchifflis,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s contribution to its reproduction of this design sufficed to meet the modest requirement made of a copyright proprietor \u201cthat his work contains some substantial, not merely trivial, originality.\u201d Chamberlin v. Uris Sales Corp., 2 Cir., 1945, 150 F.2d 512, 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s case fails not on validity but on infringement. Here also the opinion in Alfred Bell &amp; Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, supra, went to the heart of the problem in pointing out, 191 F.2d at page 105, that, while \u201cdefendants\u2019 arguments about the public domain\u201d had proved irrelevant on the issue of validity, they could be relevant \u201cin their bearing on the issue of infringement, i. e., whether the defendants copied the mezzotints.\u201d Judge Frank made his precise thought plain by reference to the \u201cDishonored Lady\u201d case, Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Corp., 2 Cir., 81 F.2d 49, 54, certiorari denied, 1936, 298 U.S. 669, 56 S.Ct. 835, 80 L.Ed. 1392. There the basic story, of the ill-fated Madeleine Smith, had long been in the public domain. However, plaintiffs had taken from this \u201cbut the merest skeleton,\u201d and the requirement of originality was amply satisfied. Nevertheless as Judge Learned Hand explained, the \u201cpublic demesne\u201d remained important on the issue of infringement since defendants are \u201centitled to use, not only all that had gone before, but even the plaintiffs\u2019 contribution itself, if they drew from it only the more general patterns; that is, if they kept clear of its \u2018expression.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We think that is what defendants\u2019 fabric did. The claimed originality and the distinctive feature of plaintiff\u2019s reproduction is the three-dimensional look; this is what defendants\u2019 fabric lacks. Additionally, the butterfly patterns in plaintiff\u2019s fabrics do not appear in defendants\u2019; the well defined bands of color in plaintiff\u2019s cloth are not duplicated; and the sharp outline of plaintiff\u2019s patterns contrasts with the somewhat diffuse nature of the patterns and coloring in defendants\u2019 fabrics. We need not determine whether if the basic design had been original with plaintiff, defendants\u2019 fabric might not be sufficiently imitative to infringe under the test laid down by Judge Hand in Peter Pan. For here, in contrast, the basic design was in the public domain and plaintiff was entitled to relief only if defendants copied its \u201cexpression,\u201d as the defendant in Alfred Bell v. Catalda Fine Arts, supra, was found to have done. See Judge-Smith\u2019s full opinion in the District Court, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1947, 74 F.Supp. 973, 977. See also Gross v. Seligman, 2 Cir., 1914, 212 F. 930. Cf. Eggers v. Sun Sales Corp., 2 Cir., 1920, 263 F. 373. This defendants did not succeed in doing, whatever their intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">We recognize that the District Judge found the contrary and that, in reviewing his order, we are bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Fed.R.Civ.Proe. 52, 28 U.S.C. However, the record contains almost no evidence \u2022on the issue of infringement other than the fabrics themselves. In such a case, \u2022as has been said with respect to trademark infringement, \u201cwe are in as good a position as the trial judge to determine\u201d the issue. Eastern Wine Corp. v. Winslow Warren, Ltd., 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 955, 960, certiorari denied, 1943, 320 U.S. 758, 64 S.Ct. 65, 88 L.Ed. 452. See Orvis v. Higgins, 2 Cir., 180 F.2d 537, 539, certiorari denied, 1950, 340 U.S. 810, 71 S.Ct. 37, 95 L.Ed. 595. Moreover, the District Judge\u2019s citation of the Peter Pan decision on the issue of infringement at least suggests that he may have used a test that was not wholly applicable where the \u201cwork of art\u201d was in the public domain and thus only plaintiff\u2019s \u201cexpression\u201d was protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The orders granting temporary injunctions are therefore reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
