A., directed the entry of a final judgment on that portion of the amended counterclaim upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. As appears from the opinion of the district court, that portion is entirely severable from the remainder of the counterclaim and constitutes one separate claim in an action presenting multiple claims for relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appeal being from a final decision of the district court entered pursuant to Rule 54(b), this Court has jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291; Vol. 6;-Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 2nd ed., Paragraphs 54.27, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-18\">The appellants attack the holding of the district court that the claim asserted in their counterclaim accrued, if at all, in Arkansas and not in Mississippi,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and insist that the claim or cause of action accrued at Clarksdale, Mississippi, when C &amp; L failed to make payment to the Kincades at that place. The real gist of the counterclaim is not, however, simply for a failure to pay a fixed, definite or liquidated sum of money, but is for breach of a contract to be performed entirely in Arkansas. We agree with the district court that the claim accrued, if at all, in Arkansas, and that the case of Le Mieux Brothers Corp. v. Armstrong, 5 Cir., 1937, 91 F.2d 445, relied on by appellants, is inapplicable. Finding ourselves in agreement with the opinion and decision of the district court, its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A5RB\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-14\">. The full and able opinion of the district court is reported as C &amp; L Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation v.
