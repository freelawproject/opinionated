The record discloses that after his release on parole Melton violated that parole and committed state offenses for which he was sentenced to the Missouri State Penitentiary. The trial court held that there was no unreasonable delay in the execution of the warrant, that it was lawfully served, and that the writ should be discharged. As service of the original sentence was interrupted by parole violation and incarceration in a 'state penal institution the full term of that sentence has not been completed and Melton is properly in custody. See Zerbst v. Kidwell, 304 U.S. 359, 58 S.Ct. 872, 82 L.Ed. 1399; Groce v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 121 F.2d 800; Teague v.
