He found that the sole reason for the discharge was the Union\u2019s insistence \u201cupon compliance by the Company with the hiring hall clause of its contract,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that Pfeifle had attempted \u201cto secure preferential treatment\u201d and \u201csought to circumvent the legal and regularly required \u2022employment procedures\u201d under which new employees must be engaged through the hiring hall; that the hiring hall \u201cwas being run in a nondiscriminatory manner,\u201d and he recommended that the complaint be dismissed as to both respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The Board reviewed the rulings made by the examiner at the hearing, and affirmed them. On consideration of the Intermediate Report and the entire record the Board decided that it \u201chereby adopts the findings of the Trial Examiner but not his conclusions or recommendations.\u201d It then concluded that the Company and the Union had violated the sections of the Act previously referred to in maintaining their hiring hall agreement, holding that \u201can exclusive hiring hall contract was unlawful unless it explicitly provided for three safeguards\u201d \u25a0of the sort prescribed in the Board\u2019s \u2022opinion in Mountain Pacific Chapter of the Associated General Contractors, Inc., et al., 119 N.L.R.B. No. 126A, handed down subsequent to the Intermediate Report in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The first infirmity in the Board\u2019s conclusion is that the decision in Mountain Pacific, on which it relies, was held erroneous in N. L. R. B. v. Mountain Pacific Chapter of Assoc. Gen. Con., 9 Cir., 270 F.2d 425, where the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of that order was denied. The decision of that case that such a hiring-hall agreement, either with or without the so-called \u201csafeguards\u201d or \u201cprotective clauses\u201d, ias not per se illegal, has been further restated and reemphasized by that court in Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 9 Cir., 276 F.2d 63. This court, in National Labor Relations Board v. F. H. McGraw &amp; Co., 6 Cir., 206 F.2d 635, 640, 641, recognized the same rule, citing with approval two of the cases which the Ninth Circuit decisions followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such is the general rule stated by the courts. Other decisions, in accord, are cited in Morrison-Knudsen, supra. The only case indicating a contrary rule is that of a divided court in Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc. v. National Labor Relations Board, D.C.Cir., 275 F.2d 646. The majority opinion, which neither states the facts nor discusses the law, does not appeal to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The Board acknowledges that its practice and rulings heretofore, at least prior to its Mountain Pacific ruling, have proceeded upon the theory that \u201cwe have not found a provision that personnel be secured through the offices of a union violative of the Act absent evidence that the union unlawfully discriminated in supplying the Company with personnel.\u201d (The quotation is from The Humkin-Conkey Construction Company, 95 N.L. R.B. 433, 435.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the Board puts it, its prior practice \u201cwas to correct hiring hall abuses as they arose in individual cases rather than to treat the hiring hall itself.\u201d Now, however, the Board tells us it finds its prior rulings to be unsatisfactory. It says that the legality of exclusive hiring halls \u201chad not been comprehensively treated by the Board in its decisions prior to Mountain Pacific.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">The Board explains at great length why it believes a new approach and a new rule is necessary. It says its old \u201ccase-to-case method\u201d where the Board always \u201cpredicated its decision upon the existence of discriminatory practices apart from the effect of the contract\u201d was \u201cno longer sufficient\u201d, it had proven ineffective so that now it was necessary to \u201cdeal with the legality of hiring halls on a comprehensive basis.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This comprehensive basis involves the Board\u2019s determination here, in the words of its brief, that \u201cthe undeniably discriminatory result of the exclusive hiring hall flows as much from the agreement itself as from the illegal operation of the halls of some unions,\u201d and that \u201cillegal discrimination against nonmembers is inherent in the hiring provision itself.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">As we understand the Board\u2019s position, it is that its experience proves that its effort to pick off the sour fruit frequently appearing on the hiring hall tree has been ineffective and altogether frustrating, so now it proposes to chop down the whole tree whenever it is not propped up by the Board\u2019s three \u201cprotective clauses.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">That the rule here contended for is a new one is noted by the Board\u2019s statement in its brief: \u201cThe case at bar is the first case in which the Board has explicated to this Court its reasons for finding that an exclusive hiring agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ment violates the Act even though it may not on its face give preference in employment to members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">There is no doubt that the Board has power, in appropriate cases, and in furtherance of its delegated function of making the National Labor Relations Act work, to establish new rules. What may be called new rules may stem from two sources or theories of power. One is the broad grant of power in \u00a7 6 of the Act (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 156) authorizing the Board \u201cto make * * * in the manner prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act, such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subehapter.\u201d The manner prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act is stated in \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of that Act (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1002, 1003), and calls for appropriate publications in the Federal Register, and in some cases for notice and an opportunity to be heard. Perhaps the Board might have saved itself a lot of trouble by utilizing this method of making a rule. At any rate, plainly it did not call on this source of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">A second mode by which new rules sometimes come into being is through the process of administrative adjudication. Just as courts generally do not hesitate to announce new rules to govern novel or changed conditions, so administrative boards often lay down new so-called \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules. What the Board is authorized to interpret is the provision of \u00a7 8(a)(3) condemning discrimination in regard to hire which, in the language of Radio Officers v. National Labor Relations Board, 347 U.S. 17, 48, 74 S.Ct. 323, 340, 98 L.Ed. 455, has \u201ca tendency to encourage\u201d membership in a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">We disclaim any suggestion that because, in past years, the Board has never held that an exclusive hiring-hall agreement, on the face of it, has such a tendency, it may not now, through a proper adjudicatory process, rule that it does indeed have such a tendency. \u201cOne of the purposes which lead to the creation of such boards is to have decisions based upon evidential facts under the particular statute made by experienced officials with an adequate appreciation of the complexities of the subject which is entrusted to their administration.\u201d Republic Aviation Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 324 U.S. 793, 800, 65 S.Ct. 982, 986, 89 L.Ed. 1372. And the Board\u2019s first interpretative decision does not have to be the final one.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">But while we have no occasion here to doubt that an administrative board, may, as the courts have always done, declare new rules through a process of case to-case adjudications, yet we think this Board has not properly done so in this particular case, and that for two separate and distinct reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">First, without considering whether such is a requirement of due process, we note that \u00a7 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1004) provides that \u201cIn every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing * * * (a) Persons entitled to notice of an agency hearing shall be timely informed of * * * (3) the matters of fact and law asserted.\u201d Here there was not only no complaint charging that the hiring hall agreement was illegal, or that, in the words of the Board\u2019s belated position, \u201cillegal discrimination against nonmembers is inherent in the hiring provision itself\u201d, but it was ruled, both by the examiner and the Board itself, that the validity of the hiring hall was not in issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>We hold that the Board cannot establish its attempted rule by an adjudication of a matter not in issue before it. In the absence of the statutory notice of \u201cthe matters of fact and law asserted\u201d the Board lacked power to pass upon any such issue as that now tardily argued in its briefs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>There is a second reason why we think the Board cannot apply its newly conceived rule in this case. This becomes apparent when it is noted what the Board is trying to do hege. In an effort to minimize the effect of the Board\u2019s order its brief contains some statements which are not quite consistent with its main argument. Thus it says: \u201cThe only substantial affirmative action [the order] imposes upon either party is that it requires the reinstatement of Pfeifie with back pay.\u201d It says \u201cthe Board is not requiring the Company or the Union to insert any clauses in their contract.\u201d And in response to the Union\u2019s argument that the Mountain Pacific Rule may not be applied retroactively to the instant case, the brief says that <em>\u201cthe </em>only portion of the Board\u2019s order which has any retroactive effect is that which requires respondents to make Pfeifie whole for any loss he may have suffered by reason of the discrimination against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Nothing could be more unrealistic. For Pfeifie, although only one man, furnishes the test case through which the Board now seeks to procure an adjudication that the respondents were guilty of an unfair labor practice solely and only because their hiring-hall contract, perfectly legal and valid according to the Board\u2019s settled rule at the time it was made, has now, retroactively, been adjudged per se illegal for want of one of the Board\u2019s three protective clauses demanded under its new ruling. The Board\u2019s doctrine would retroactively invalidate every union contract which contains an exclusive hiring hall provision. If the Board\u2019s order stands, it is doubtful if even the Board can say how many hundreds or thousands of employers and unions are, as of now, guilty of similar unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"> It is not suggested that under no circumstance may an administrative ruling apply retroactively. Indeed, as suggested in Securities and Exchange Comm. v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. at page 203, 67 S.Ct. at page 1581, any \u201ccase of first impression has a retroactive effect, whether the new principle is announced by a court or by an administrative agency.\u201d But in particular cases, for a board to make its new ruling retroactive may well be an abuse of discretion. And this court, under the Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 10(e) (Title 5, \u00a7 1009(e) is required to \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion. * * * \u201d We think the sound principle applicable is that stated in National Labor Rel. Bd. v. National Container Corp., 2 Cir., 211 F.2d 525, 534, as follows: \u201cIt is well settled that where, as here, an administrative agency in pursuance of its adjudicatory function makes an <em>ad hoc </em>change in one of its administrative policies, such change may be applied retroactively in an appropriate case. Securities and Exchange Comm. v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194 [67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995]. The test is whether \u2018the practical operation of the Board\u2019s change of policy * * * [will] work hardship upon respondent altogether out of proportion to the public ends to be accomplished.\u2019 N.L.R.B. v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., supra, [195 F.2d 149] * This is in accord with the limitations upon retroactivity which were recognized in the Chenery Corp. case, supra, where it was noted that \u201cill effect of the retroactive application of a new standard\u201d must be balanced against the necessities of the public. In weighing these matters here we are impressed with the fact that there appears no reason why the public interest demands that the new rule be imposed at once, and now, as to this particular contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>We are of the opinion that here, as in the case of N.L.R.B. v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 9 Cir., 195 F.2d 141, 149, 151, from which the Second Circuit quoted, the Board\u2019s change of rules would work hardship upon respondents \u201caltogether out of proportion to the public ends to be accomplished.\u201d As we have noted above, the Board has ample ways of instituting new rules without working any such hardship on these particular respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We hold that its attempted retroactive action here was, in the words of the Atkinson case, supra, \u201cagency action which we are directed by \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act to set aside as arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Enforcement of the Order is denied, and the Order is set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-10\">.

The ruling of the examiner appears in a footnote to the Intermediate Report, as follows: \u201cAfter baying rested his ease and during the cross-examination of a union witness, the General Counsel suddenly sought to show an illegal administration of the hiring hall. As the complaint against the Union contained no allegation of such an unfair labor practice and as no evidence to that effect had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>adduced daring the General Counsel\u2019s case-in-chief, the undersigned ruled the proposed attack on the hiring hall as such incompetent. During the colloquy following this ruling, the General Counsel appeared to agree with said ruling when he stated: \u2018We are not trying to throw out the whole hiring hall. We are saying there was discrimination with respect to the individual himself.\u2019 \u201d The matter then referred to appears in the transcript of the hearing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cTrial Examiner: Are you attacking the hiring hall in this case? Mr. Corenman: Yes, we are. We are contending it is a discriminatory hiring hall. Mr. Paradise: Mr. Trial Examiner, if he is, he has rested Ms case. He hasn\u2019t put in any proof on it, and I don\u2019t think he can now. Mr. Corenman: I think we have ample proof to argue this case. Trial Examiner: I didn\u2019t see anything in the complaint that led me to believe there was any attack on the hiring hall. If you can show it to me, I\u2019ll be \u2014 Mr. Coremnan: Yes, I\u2019ll be glad to do that, Mr. Examiner. Trial Examiner: This is the first I\u2019ve recognized there was an attack on the hiring hall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">\u201cMr. Paradise: Mr. Trial Examiner, I want to press my objection, in part (apart) from the fact that I agree with you, there is no attack on the hiring hall in this complaint. The General Counsel has rested Ms case. He has put in Ms evidence on the hiring hall. This witness was not questioned about the referral practices of the union in his direct testimony. There is absolutely no warrant for counsel for the General Counsel roping (reopening) this case on cross-examination on the hiring hall issue. Trial Examiner: What evidence is there in your case in chief as to the attack on the hiring hall? Mr. Corenman: Mr. Examiner, the evidence is Pfeifle himself was not referred to the job because he had been expelled from the union for letting Ms withdrawal card lapse, and they were not referring Mm for that reason. Pfeifle has so testified, and so did Rieg. And, furthermore, Pfeifle was also being discriminated against in the discriminatory operation referral system in that they were making an exception of Pfeifle and would not refer him, would not in any case refer him to the E &amp; B Brewery, because that was his last employer when Ms withdrawal expired and he was expelled, and we have testimony on that score from both Pfeifle and Rieg. Trial Examiner: I don\u2019t understand that as an attack on the hiring hall. Mr. Corenman: That shows the hiring hall was discriminatorily administered with respect to Pfeifle. If it was discriminatorily administered with respect to Pfeifle, then, of course, there is a violation of section 8(b) (2) and section 8(a) (8). Trial Examiner: That doesn\u2019t bring the whole hiring hall into the question. I\u2019ll sustain your objection. Mr. Corenman: We are not trying to throw out the whole hiring hall. We are saying there was discrimination with respect to the individual himself. Trial Examiner: I\u2019ll take any evidence you have on discrimination as far as Pfeifle is concerned, but as far as going into the hiring hall, I see no reason to go into it. Mr. Corenman: Mr. Examiner, when counsel attempts to bring in evidence that he has a non-diseriminatory hiring hall, I think I am entitled to attack it whenever he brings it into issue with his own testimony. Mr. Paradise: I haven\u2019t brought that in with this witness at all. Trial Examiner: I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s been brought in. I\u2019ll sustain the objection. Yon may proceed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-20\">Said the Board: \u201cThe Board has reviewed the rulings made by the Trial Examiner at the <em>hearing and </em>finds that no prejudicial error was committed. The rulings are hereby affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-22\">The Board\u2019s brief here concedes that \u201cthe validity of the contract was not an issue at the hearing.\u201d See Morgan v. United States, 804 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. <em>773, 776, </em>82 L.Ed. 1129: \u201cThose who are brought into contest with the Government in a quasi-judicial proceeding aimed at the control of tlieir activities are entitled to be fairly advised of what the Government projjoses and to bo heard upon its proposals before it issues its final command.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b659-23\">. The Board attempts to avoid this result by two arguments, both specious. Eirst, it says that after the Intermediate Report here the Board\u2019s decision in Mountain Pacific came down, and then the General Counsel filed a brief with the Board in this case urging that the contract here was invalid under Mountain Pacific. The Board says that although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the Union then urged that the Board could not properly consider that argument because the validity of the hiring hall provision had not been litigated, \u201cit did not question the validity of the [Mountain Pacific] decision itself.\u201d Secondly, it says, respondents did not assert they had any evidence to adduce with respect to the Mountain Pacific issue.</p>\n<p id=\"ADa\">Since the Board was without power to consider any such issue, it is hard to perceive why the Union was called upon to debate the Mountain Pacific case, or to offer evidence on a non-existent issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
