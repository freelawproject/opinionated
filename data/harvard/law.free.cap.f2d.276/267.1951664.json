We find the difference between plaintiff\u2019s average weekly wages before his injury and his average weekly earning capacity to be $..........

The appellant urges that there was either <em>no </em>evidence or insufficient evidence to support that finding. Without detailing the testimony on that issue, it is enough to say that we agree with the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>that it was sufficient to support such finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Appellant\u2019s next contention is that, since it is undisputed that no order of the Texas Industrial Accident Board was obtained for a change in medical aid, hospital services or medicines, Section 7a of Article 8306, Texas Vernon\u2019s Ann. Civil Statutes, quoted in footnote 3, supra, is an insuperable obstacle to plaintiff\u2019s recovery for such items. Admittedly, this point has not been clearly settled by any decision of the State courts. The one closest in point appears to be Texas Employers\u2019 Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Bradshaw, Tex.Civ.App., 1930, 27 S.W.2d 314, where recovery for medical services separately secured by the injured party was sustained. The opinion in that ease does not, however, discuss the provisions of Section 7a, supra. Further, the evidence in that case is much clearer than in this that the insurance carrier acquiesced in the second doctor treating the injured workman until he recovered. Appellant insists that Texas Employers Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Hodnett, Tex.Civ.App., 1948, 216 S.W. 2d 301, is controlling. That case, however, was decided under the statute prior to its amendment in 1957. The old statute required express authorization by the Industrial Accident Board for medical services beyond the initial four-week period, and the medical services for which recovery was denied in the Hodnett case were performed after that period. For the same reason, as well as others not necessary to be detailed, this Court\u2019s decision in Robertson v. National Surety Corp., 5 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 642, is not applicable to the present question. In the absence of an authoritative interpretation of Section 7a by the State courts, the district court and this Court must of necessity determine the meaning and applicability of that Section.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Some guidance is furnished by the general rule that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act should be liberally construed so as to effectuate the beneficent purposes for which it was enacted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 7, quoted in part in footnote 2, supra, clearly provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u201cIf the association fails to so furnish reasonable medical aid, hospital services, nursing, chiropractic services and medicines as and when needed after notice of the injury to the association or subscriber, the injured employee may provide said medical aid, nursing, hospital services, chiropractic services, and medicines at the cost and expense of the association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3q\">That provision does not seem to us to be qualified by Section 7a. Many cases might arise in which the securing of reasonable medical aid, hospital services and medicines was urgent or certainly could not await the time that would be necessary to obtain a change order from the Board. Section 7a seems intended simply as a means, when circumstances will permit, to decide in advance on the necessity for a change. It does not, in our opinion, preclude recovery where, as here, the insurer has in fact failed to furnish reasonable medical aid, hospital services and medicines as and when needed after notice of the injury, the services and aid being furnished by the insurer were inadequate, and the circumstances were such as to support a finding that it knew or ought to have known that this was so. The fact that no express demand was made upon the carrier to furnish additional medical service does not preclude recovery here. For, upon sufficient evidence, the jury found that such expenses were reasonable and were needed by the plaintiff for proper diagnosis and treatment, and the court, which had reserved the right to determine whether they were recoverable, determined that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The judgment is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-22\">.

The employee shall not he entitled to recover any amount expended or incurred by him for said medical aid, hospital services, nursing, chiropractic services, or medicines, nor shall any person who supplied the same be entitled to recover of the association therefor, unless the association or subscriber shall have had notice of the injury and shall have refused, failed or neglected to furnish it or them within a reasonable time. At the time of the injury or immediately thereafter, if necessary, the employee shall have the right to call in any available physician, surgeon, or chiropractor to administer first-aid treatment as may be reasonably necessary at the expense of the association.\u201d 22 Tex.Civ.Stat.1959 P.P., pp. 3, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-15\">. \u201cSee. 7a.

If the association fails promptly to comply with such order after receiving it, the Board may permit the employee or some one for him to provide the same at the expense of the association under such reasonable regulations as may be provided by said board.

In that event the court may submit to the jury written questions susceptible of categorical or other brief answer or may submit written forms of the several special findings which might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or it may use such other method of submitting the issues and requiring the written findings thereon as it deems most appropriate. The court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter Urns submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue. If in so doing the court omits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives his right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury retires he demands its submission to the jury. As to an issue omitted without such demand the court may make a finding; or, if it fails to do so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\">.
