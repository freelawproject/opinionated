The cotton had been delivered to Gulf Shipside \u201ccommencing on or about July 18,1956.\u201d The liability insurers first sued denied any coverage earlier than November 29,1956, the earliest date on which, in any event, their policies could have been effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Schwabach then filed a supplemental complaint naming as additional defendants \u201cUnderwriters at Lloyds, London, and/or Companies signatories to, as underwriters thereof, a certain policy or policies of liability insurance\u201d numbered WA-1994 and issued on January 11, 1956, by J. K. Seear (USA) Ltd., insurance brokers. Certain attorneys appeared and filed an answer to the supplemental complaint in which they denied the court\u2019s jurisdiction over any parties defendant; denied that any underwriter at Lloyd\u2019s or Companies had \u201cever signed, bound or otherwise committed himself or itself, for the coverage purportedly represented by Certificate No. WA-1994\u201d; and averred that, in any event, the certificate itself was \u201ccancelled, rescinded and/or withdrawn <em>ab initio </em>by Seear (USA)\u201d in February 1956, by notice to Adrien Bodet, Gulf Shipside\u2019s insurance broker, months before the damage in suit occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Subsequently, Gulf Shipside filed a cross-claim under Certificate WA-1994 against \u201cdefendant Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London and/or Companies,\u201d demanding that they \u201cdefend (Gulf Ship-side) at their cost\u201d in this proceeding. The same defenses, contained in the answer to the supplemental complaint, were urged to the cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">A separate trial was held on the issue of coverage under Certificate WA-1994, at the conclusion of which the district court filed its opinion that, \u201cassuming (but not deciding) that Certificate No. WA-1994 was validly issued, apparently or otherwise, the risk thereunder was validly terminated\u201d by Seear (USA)\u2019s February 1956 notice to Mr. Bodet, because \u201cBodet was Gulf\u2019s agent in general charge of its insurance problems and notice to and acceptance by him of the no coverage advice, not only binds the principal, but complies with the formality for cancellation of insurance as required by LSA-R.S. 22:636, subd. A (l).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">From the judgment or order entered pursuant to that opinion, an appeal was permitted under the Interlocutory Appeals Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and it was further ordered that the motion for leave to file petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition be heard at the same time as said appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">The full and excellent opinion of the district court cited in footnote 2, supra, relieves us of the necessity for a detailed statement of the facts and issues. We find ourselves in general agreement with that opinion, but with certain important exceptions which require a somewhat different decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">There was no evidence that any underwriter at Lloyd\u2019s or any Company had ever accepted, or otherwise committed itself for, the risk described in Certificate WA-1994. There was a complete lack of evidence to prove that J. K. Seear (USA), Ltd. had any authority, either actual or apparent, to bind any individual underwriter at Lloyd\u2019s or any Company on the risk identified in the said certificate. No premium for the coverage was ever remitted to any underwriter at Lloyd\u2019s or to any Company sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>made a defendant to the supplemental complaint. Certificate WA-1994 actually amounted to no more than a broker\u2019s certificate. It created an obligation on the part of J. K. Seear (USA), Ltd., but it alone could not bind an underwriter or company which had not committed itself for the risk described.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The district court never did acquire jurisdiction over any identifiable defendant to the supplemental complaint or to the cross-claim under Certificate WA-1994. Its judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss said supplemental complaint and cross-claim for lack of jurisdiction. Costs of appeal are taxed against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The issues having been thus decided, there is no necessity for the filing of the petition for mandamus and prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Leave denied, reversed with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\">.
