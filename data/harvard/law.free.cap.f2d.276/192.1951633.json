H. Martin Construction Company in the installation of a sewer line. Appellant\u2019s injuries allegedly resulted from negligence of the Appellee in the handling of a heavy steel plate, referred to as a \u201cskid plate\u201d, which was permitted to fall upon the appellant\u2019s left leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Question is made on this appeal with respect to the admission of evidence during the trial of the acceptance of Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits by the appellant and a redemption agreement between him and the compensation carrier of his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Upon the facts and circumstances here presented, evidence relating to Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance and the redemption agreement aforesaid was not erroneously received. There was no objection on the part of appellant. In fact, there was a stipulation in open Court under which this evidence was admitted. The District Judge took adequate precautions to instruct the jury concerning the matter. It results there was no prejudicial error in this regard. Spelker v. Knobloch, 1958, 354 Mich. 403, 93 N.W.2d 276, 278; Sprinkle v. Davis, 4 Cir., 1940, 111 F.2d 925, 128 A.L.R. 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The Court finds no merit in other contentions of the appellant. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
