Brown, W. B. Freeman, R. A. Gray, and E. L. Gates, be, and the same hereby are, granted and the amended complaint in this cause hereby is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question of law without prejudice to any right the plaintiff may have to bring an appropriate action in the courts of the state of Florida for the relief prayed for in the amended complaint in this cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADO\">and plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Here, with a lengthy brief, arguing the question presented as though it were still an open one, plaintiff insists that the judgment was wrong and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The defendants, citing many cases in support of their claim that the so-called constitutional question sought to be raised has been many times determined to be without substance, insist that <em>the </em>district judge\u2019s action was right and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We find ourselves in complete agreement with this view. The judgment is affirmed. Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152; California Water Service Co. v. City of Redding, 304 U.S. 252, 255, 58 S.Ct. 865, 82 L.Ed. 1323; Wood v.
