For a first cause of action, plaintiff alleges a contract for the prosecution to judgment of an action in the supreme court for a. stipulated! sum, and the completion and fulfillment of that contract by the entry of judgment; for a second cause of action, the subsequent employment of plaintiff to collect the judgment through proceedings in the surrogate\u2019s court of Westchester county, the services rendered in that court, and the reasonable value thereof. The affidavit upon which? plaintiff moved for the order of reference states that the bill of particulars, as filed, contains about 25 separate and distinct items of service and credits, which on the trial will be legitimate subjects of investigation.
