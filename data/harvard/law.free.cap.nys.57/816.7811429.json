Bates and James F. Pierson. Defendant Bates was hot summoned. Judgment was obtained on the joint promissory note of defendants. Thereafter an action was brought against defendant Bates alone, and he demurred' on the ground of defect of parties defendant, and that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, because it showed that the note was joint, while it was described as a joint and several note.

The amendment asked for was just and reasonable, and against which defendant had no moral right to complain. No injustice would have been done had the proposed amendment been permitted. To deny it certainly worked harm and injustice to plaintiff. The-plaintiff must therefore be permitted to serve his proposed amended' complaint within three days after the entry of order hereon, upon payment of taxable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">The .orders and judgment appealed from must be so modified, and, as modified, they are affirmed. No costs or disbursements of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
