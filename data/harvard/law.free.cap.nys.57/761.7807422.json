No actual authority in the husband to make a contract for or on behalf of the defendant was shown, nor does the testimony show sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>apparent authority or ratification on her part to authorize the rendition of a judgment against her. Simpson v. Bonnel (appellate term, Feb., 1899) 56 N. Y. Supp. 225. It also appears by the record that no objection was made or exception taken to the dismissal of the complaint at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case. This, together with the failure of proof, as heretofore stated, requires an affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent.
