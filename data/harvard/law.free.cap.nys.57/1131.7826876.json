The relator, who became trustee under his will in 1893, resided, and still resides, in the city of Albany, and never has resided in Kingston. He has an office in Kingston for the business of the trust estate. He was assessed as such trustee upon the personal property of the estate every year from 1892 to 1897, both inclusive, and paid the taxes levied thereon. In 1898 he was assessed in a much larger amount than in previous years, and appeared before the assess- or in due time, and objected thereto, made proof of his nonresidence, but stated that he would not object to a satisfactory assessment, and that he could make satisfactory arrangements as to an assessment in Albany. The assessor reduced the amount of the assessment one-half, but to that the relator still objects. He is not assessed upon the trust estate in Albany. The amount of the assessment, if any is proper in Kingston, does not appear to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-10\">We think the order should be affirmed. The assessor in Kingston had no jurisdiction. The nonresident trustee, if the assessment were satisfactory to him, could, of course, withhold all objection, but, if he chose to insist upon his objection, he had the right to do so. The .'Tax Law (Laws 1896, c. 908) \u00a7 8, provides: \u201cEvery person shall be taxed in the tax district where he resides when the assessment for taxation is made, for all personal property owned by him, or under Ms control as agent, trustee, guardian, executor, or administrator.\u201d This does not give the assessor of the tax district where the person \u25a0does not reside any jurisdiction. Wilcox v. City of Rochester, 129 N. Y. 247, 29 N. E. 99. It is possible the relator might, by his acts or \u25a0declarations, estop himself from questioning the jurisdiction. He probably did so for the years previous to 1898, but we do not think a proposal to submit to the jurisdiction if the assessment should prove \u2022satisfactory precludes the relator, in the absence of any evidence of his \u2022satisfaction, from insisting upon the objection of nonresidence, distinctly presented by him. Whether the relator escapes taxation altogether is not here material. We do not hold that an arrangement with an assessor in Kingston without jurisdiction would have any legal force with an assessor in Albany with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-11\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
