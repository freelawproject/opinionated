In fulfillment of the first installment of 10 gross, 1,440 toe clips were delivered to the \u25a0 defendants, who made payment therefor without objection. The re- \u25a0 mainder having been subsequently sent, and having been received mnd retained by the defendants, this action was brought to recover \u25a0.the purchase price. The sole issue litigated was how many toe clips were required to fill the order. The defendants claimed that, by the iusage of the trade and the understanding of the parties, \u201c25 gro.\u201d meant 25 gross pair, and that, the plaintiff havinv delivered only single toe clips,\u2014that is, 144 to each gross,\u2014but half the quantity contracted for had been received. The justice adopted the plaintiff\u2019s construction that the agreement contemplated single toe clips. This was warranted by the oral and written evidence introduced on the trial. The unequivocal language of the order, containing no reference to pairs, opposes the defendants\u2019 contention. Moreover, their own catalogue, which was produced on the trial, is inconsistent with their position. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>They maintained that toe clips were invariably sold by the pair; yet, in their own catalogue, toe clips are not quoted by the pair, notwithstanding the testimony of one of the defendants that every article sold by the pair was therein so quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\">Finally, the defendants recognized the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the contract by accepting 1,440 toe clips as the equivalent of the first 10 gross. It is true they sought to overcome the presumption arising from their acquiescence by ascribing the acceptance, and the consequent payment, to the oversight of an employ\u00e9. The inconclusive testimony offered to support this explanation failed to convince the justice. The exceptions urged are trivial, and, the issue of fact having been determined with fairness, the judgment should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
