The evidence clearly shows that the deceased, in anticipation of a fatal result attending upon the operation \u25a0which she was about to undergo, applied to the officer of the bank to'have the fund represented in the books deposited in trust for the plaintiff. This was done, and an. entry to that, effect made in the book of deposit, and also in the books-of the bank. While she retained the custody of the bank books, yet. she made such direction as to their disposition as would place them in the custody of the bank, evidently for delivery to the cestui que trust. Such acts upon her part had the effect of changing the title to the' money, and vesting it in the cestui que trust. As the court has found, and the evidence warrants such finding, the intent accompanied the act; and within the authorities relied upon by the defendant, of Proseus v. Porter, 20 App. Div. 44, 46 N. Y. Supp. 656, and Beaver v. Beaver, 117 N. Y. 421, 22 N. E. 940, the finding of the court below is clearly sustained. Nor do we think that the statement of the officer of the bank that he would prepare an . order for the transfer of the accounts sufficient to defeat the passing of title to the money. Such order was evidently for the protection of the bank, and, had it been in fact executed, there would -have been no further change in the accounts themselves, either in the pass books or on the books of the bank; and that clqarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>constituted a declaration of trust in favor of the cestui que trust; . and its effectiveness would not have been added to by the execution of the order. The notice in the bank book, requiring the* person drawing money to present a written order, signed by the owner, when the book is not presented in person, relates exclusively to the drawing of the money, and is for the protection off the bank. It can have no effect upon the declaration of trust made by the donor, nor would the cestui que trust be required \u00a1. to have an order, if in possession of the books; and it seems com \u2022 elusive that, when the donor provided for the delivery of the books-to the bank, she intended the bank to, in turn, deliver them to the person entitled thereto. Nothing further would be needed to enable the possessor to draw the money, as he would then stand . in the position of being the owner of the money and the holder \u25a0 of the bank book, under the rules of the bank, and no order would'. be necessary. We fully agree in the opinion delivered by the.- \u2022 learned court below, and can safely rest our decision thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
