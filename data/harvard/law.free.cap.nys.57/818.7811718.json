Reynolds v. Gilchrest, 9 Hun, 203; Donohue v. Lyons, 30 App. Div. 622, 51 N. Y. Supp. 612. In the absence of proof that the misconduct complained of did result in loss to the judgment creditor, the order should have been that, such moderate fine be imposed as would pay the prosecuting attorney for his costs and expenses, and that the debtor appear for examination. The debtor concededly failed to appear on the return day, and the evidence fully justifies the finding that he willfully disobeyed the. order requiring him to appear for examination. For this misconduct the order fixed the costs and expenses at $40, and, after a \u25a0 careful examination of the record, we are of opinion that that sum ,1s fair and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">It follows that the order appealed from should be modified by \u2022seducing the fine imposed to $40, and requiring the judgment debt-er t\u00a9 appear and submit to an examination, and, as so modified, affirmed^ with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
