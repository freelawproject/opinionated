The respondent contends that this is \u201can appeal from an order allowing costs of motion,\u201d and, therefore, not appealable, under the case of Lennox v. Eldred, 65 Barb. 526, and others. We do not agree with him. We think that the order was inadvertently signed, as it is not usual, and certainly, in this case, not proper, to charge defendant with the costs of granting a favor to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Moreover, the order reads \u201cwith ten dollars costs to the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys,\u201d and this makes it still more evident that the order was prepared by attorneys for presentation for signature in the hurry of chambers business, as costs are awarded to a party, and not to the attorney. Ordinarily, if imposed at all, motion costs are awarded against the plaintiff who desires to retire his suit, and are to compensate defendant for being needlessly taken into court. In the case at the bar, it is apparent that the order under criticism is too harsh and arbitrary to be within sound discretion. Fleischman v. Fleischman (Sup.) 30 N. Y. Supp. 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The order appealed from is modified, by striking out the provision therein giving the plaintiff costs against the defendant, to be paid to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and by inserting, in lieu thereof, $10 costs of motion to defendant, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs of this appeal, besides disbursements for printing, to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">FITZSIMONS, C. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
