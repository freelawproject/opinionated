J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB-\">In Re Taylor\u2019s Estate, 30 App. Div. 213, 51 N. Y. Supp. 609, we held, in an opinion written by the present writer, that where funds had 9come into the hands of an administratrix, for which she had never accounted, and she had not publicly and officially renounced her trust, the statute of limitations had not commenced to run in her favor. In our consideration of that case we overlooked In re Rogers\u2019 Estate, 153 N. Y. 316, 47 N. E. 589, where it was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that a proceeding to compel an administrator to account is controlled by the 10-year statute of limitations applicable to suits in equity. The orderly administration of justice and obedience to authority compels us to say that our decision in Re Taylor\u2019s Estate was erroneous, and our decision of the present appeal must follow the decision in Re Rogers\u2019 Estate. Sarah E. Longboth\u00e1m died in 1880, and letters of administration on her estate were granted to her husband in the same year, but he has never filed any account of his proceedings. The present proceeding was not instituted till November, 1898, 18 years after the appointment of the administrator. The surrogate, on the authority of the Rogers Case, held that the statute of limitations operated, and dismissed the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The decree must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Order of the surrogate of the county of Kings affirmed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
