J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYA\">The referee\u2019s report has stated the facts so fully that it is not necessary to repeat them in detail. It is sufficient to indicate the ground upon which the action is brought. The plaintiff alleged that he was in the employ of the defendant, in the business conducted under the name of the \u201cContinental Works,\u201d under an agreement in the nature of a quasi partnership, by which he was to receive a stated salary and a commission on the profits of the business; that when he left the defendant\u2019s employment he received a check for a sum which the defendant falsely represented to be in fact the actual amount of the plaintiff\u2019s percentage; and he asked an accounting and judgment for the sum which should be found due to him. The defendant denied any false representations, and set up annual s\u00e9ttlements for several years during the latter part of the plaintiff\u2019s service, and a full accord and satisfaction at the termination of his employment. The record is voluminous, covering 850 pages, and has required careful examination, resulting in entire approval of the referee\u2019s findings of fact and off law. He decided that the annual and final settlements were fair, final, and conclusive; that the final settlement was a complete accord and satisfaction between the parties; and dismissed the complaint. The findings of fact are made on contradictory evidence, the preponderance of which sustains the defendant\u2019s contentions, and we may not disturb these findings. As the plaintiff\u2019s counsel does not in his brief discuss any exceptions to the admission or exclusion\" of evidence, it is unnecessary to refer to them in detail. None command our attention. The extra allowance was. fixed at $750 (5 per cent, on $15,000). The motion therefor was made on all the papers, a certificate of the referee, and an affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney showing that the amount claimed by the plaintiff in the action was $40,000, being the plaintiff\u2019s alleged percentages on $600,000. This was the aggregate of the items attacked in the plaintiff\u2019s objections to the defendant\u2019s account. The opposing affidavit seems to admit that about $12,000 was in controversy. On the moving papers, the court, at special term, was justified in estimating \u201cthe sum claimed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>or the value of the subject-matter involved\u201d (Code, \u00a7 3253), to have been over $15,000, and we see no reason to interfere with his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
