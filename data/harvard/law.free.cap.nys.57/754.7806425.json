The disclaimer of liability was based on a denial of the contract, and of the performance of the services. One of the plaintiffs testified to all the facts necessary to establish the cause of action. The defendant asserted that the plaintiffs represented the purchaser of the claim, who, called as a witness by the defendant, rather negatived, than supported, the latter\u2019s contention, by his denial that the plaintiffs were acting in his behalf.
