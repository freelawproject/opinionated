Even were it not proven, as it was by his own testimony, that the officer did not see the occurrence, the reception in evidence of the blotter, wherein the motorman\u2019s conduct was characterized as reckless and causative of the accident, was error prejudicial to the defendant. It was, at best, but a record required for specific purposes, and not a public record,' in such sense as to make its contents evidence of the facts between private parties. The judgment of the general term of the city court should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">FREEDMAN, P.
