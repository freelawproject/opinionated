We cannot say that he was wrong in this view; and' the correctness of his conclusion that the questions of law involve\u00ae were grave enough to warrant a stay is in no wise affected by the subsequent action of the elevated railroad company in instituting ccmrdemnation proceedings to acquire the plaintiff\u2019s property. If it clearly-appeared that there was no merit in the appeal, and, furthermore*, that it was taken purely for delay, in order to enable the railroad company to procure, through the condemnation proceedings, a lower valuation of the plaintiff\u2019s premises than had been fixed in the equity action, a different question would be presented. Upon the paper\u00a9 before him, we think that the learned judge at special term properly exercised his discretion in refusing to vacate the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Order affirmed, without costs.
