The answer denied the allegation of due performance, and upon this issue the parties proceeded to trial. On the trial it was not claimed that the work was performed within the time specified in the contract, but the plaintiff claimed the time provision was waived by the guarantor, this defendant. When the plaintiff sought to introduce evidence of this waiver, the defendant duly objected, and evidence under his exception was introduced. This was error. The only issue raised by the pleadings- was the performance of the. written contract. McEntyre v. Tucker, 36 App. Div. 53, 55 N. Y. Supp. 153; Elting v. Dayton (Sup.) 17 N. Y.
