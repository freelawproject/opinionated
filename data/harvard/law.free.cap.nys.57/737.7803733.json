Therefore what was paid under it was rent. The facts that the amount was exactly one month\u2019s installment, and that the plaintiff accepted a receipt as for rent, weigh heavily against his attempt to regain the money on the ground that it was a deposit. The recovery of the money paid was therefore properly denied him. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent.
