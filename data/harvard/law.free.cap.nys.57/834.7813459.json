The plaintiff testified to delivering to \u201cdefendants\u201d the articles sold. The narration of the testimony is meager, as in most returns of justices of the peace, but by the use of the term \u201cdefendants\u201d we understand the plaintiff to testify that he made the delivery to both of the defendants. The fact that the pass book bore the name of the defendant Mrs. Post, though evidence to show that the credit was extended to her alone, was not conclusive on the subject. There was a question of fact presented to the justice for his determination, and, as there was some evidence to sustain his finding, the county court could not interfere with it, or set it aside. In fact, we are at a loss to see any even plausible ground on which the judgment against the wife was wholly reversed. Interest before suit, however, was improperly allowed by the justice, as the plaintiff showed neither a custom between the parties to pay interest nor any demand before action brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">The judgment of the county court should be reversed, and the judgment of the justice of the peace should be modified by striking therefrom the sum of $2.66, and, as modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
