The order appointing Mr. Hyatt receiver was made after due notice to the judgment debtor and judgment creditors having proceedings pending. The only right which the Pennsylvania Glass Company had, after the appointment of such receiver, was to have such receivership extended so as to protect its interest. It was therefore proper for the special justice to deny its motion to vacate said receivership.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
