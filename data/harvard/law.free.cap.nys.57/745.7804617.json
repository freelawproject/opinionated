Y. Supp.. 34, a local, inferior court, created since the adoption of the present constitution, had not jurisdiction of the defendant, because it is. provided in the constitution (article 6, \u00a7 18), \u201cThe legislature shall not hereafter confer upon any local or inferior court of its creation * * * any greater jurisdiction * * * than is conferred upon county courts by or under this article,\u201d and county courts have-not, and so are expressly prohibited from having, such jurisdiction, in that the constitution (Id. \u00a7 14) \u2018further provides \u201cthat their jurisdiction shall not be so extended as to authorize an action therein-for the recovery of money only * * * in which any person not a resident of the county is a defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The objection was well taken, notwithstanding that the Greater-New York charter (section 1364) has ordained that \u201cthe said municipal court has jurisdiction in * * * an action against * \u00ae * a foreign corporation having an office in the city of New York.\u201d By its very creation in and by the state of New Jersey, the defendant was made a- resident of, and domiciled within, that state, from which it was incapable of passing personally. Plimpton v. Bigelow, 93 N. Y. 598. In so far as it conf\u00e9rs upon the municipal court jurisdiction in an action for the recovery of money only against a foreign corporation, section 1364 of the Greater New York charter is unconstitutional, and therefore nugatory. The judgment should \u25a0be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
