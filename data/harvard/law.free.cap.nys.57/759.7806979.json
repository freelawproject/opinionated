The court below, by its judgment, decided all disputed questions of fact in favor of the plaintiff. The court had a right to pass upon all questions of fact, and its conclusion in this case cannot be said to be clearly against the weight of evidence. It must be assumed that the court decided that this defendant, at the time the mare in question was offered for sale and struck off to the plaintiff, represented and warranted her to be sound. The defendant must be treated, under all the facts and circumstances of this case, as having been the agent for. the real owner; and having failed, as was determined by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>court, to disclose his principal, he is therefore liable in damages for such breach of warranty. Argersinger v. MacNaughton, 114 N. Y. 535, 21 N. E. 1022; Cabre v. Sturges, 1 Hilt. 160.
