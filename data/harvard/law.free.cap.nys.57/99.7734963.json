The case contains conflicting evidence, and seems to have been tried by both parties more in the nature of an accounting than otherwise; but the judgment for the defendant is clearly right, because no recovery upon a cause of action founded upon contract could be had under the pleadings, and the testimony wholly failed to establish conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">Judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
