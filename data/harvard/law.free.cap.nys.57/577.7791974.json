On the day of the ..\u00a1accident, the plaintiff and a man named Benson were standing on c the southeast corner of Twenty-Third street and Second avenue. - One of defendant\u2019s cars came along from the east, moving west- \u2022 shly towards Second avenue. Plaintiff and Benson stepped for- \u25a0 ward towards the street, Benson signaling to the driver of the \u25a0\u2022-car by raising his hand, and the plaintiff hailing him by call. The \u25a0 -movement of the car was thereupon slowed down to less than an - ordinary walk. The plaintiff and Benson went forward, and -sought to get upon the front platform, Benson being in the lead. When plaintiff\u2019s foot was on the step, and before he got on the 'platform, the speed of the car was suddenly accelerated, and it \u00a1started forward with a jerk. This threw the plaintiff off. The =car ran across his foot, necessitating its amputation. Such was .the plaintiff\u2019s story, and substantially the same story was told by :\u00b1he only witness whom he produced as to the occurrence of the \u00a1\u00a1accident. The learned trial judge dismissed the complaint at the \u2022 -close of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-22\">We think this disposition of the case was erroneous. It was not negligence, as matter of law, for the plaintiff to board the car when it was moving very slowly. Eppendorf v. Railroad Co., 69 N. Y. 195; Morrison v. Railroad Co., 130 N. Y. 166, 29 N. E. 105; Distler v. Railroad Co., 151 N. Y. 424, 45 N. E. 937. The negli\u00a1\u00bfgence of the defendant consisted, not in failing to bring the car ujt\u00ae a complete stop, but in accelerating its speed, and starting it S&amp;arward, before the plaintiff had got safely on the car. Morrison v. Railroad Co., supra. The ground on which the learned trial judge seems to have disposed of the case was that the evidence was insufficient to show .that the driver was apprised of the int emtio n of the plaintiff to board the car, and that \u201cafter the driver .-.-admitted the first man the railroad company was not under any .-.\u00a1obligation .to have him look around to see if anybody else. was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>getting on before he. changed the speed of the car.\u201d Of course, if the driver was neither actually apprised, nor should, in the exercise of ordinary care, have been apprised, of the intention of the .plaintiff and his companion to board the car, he was not chargeable with negligence in increasing the speed of the car while they were attempting to get on. But the fact that both the plaintiff and his companion hailed the car, and that immediately thereafter the car was slowed down, was sufficient to require the submission to the jury of the question -whether the driver either knew, or should have known, that the parties were, seeking to become passengers on the car. Nor are we inclined to admit the proposition that, as a matter of law, where one person is seeking to get upon a car, either stopped or slowed down for the purpose, there is no duty imposed upon the servants of the company in charge of the car to look and see if any one else is following and seeking to take advantage of the car being stopped to board it. Dean v. Railroad Co., 34 App. Div. 220, 54 N. Y. Supp. 490. That question is generally one of fact-, depending on the circumstances of the particular case. In this case, at least, it would seem that if the driver either knew, or should have known, that one of the parties intended to get upon the car, he knew, or should have known, that such was the intention of both. Still, the question was one for the jury. Exceptions sustained, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
