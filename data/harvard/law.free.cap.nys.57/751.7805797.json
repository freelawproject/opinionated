A lease was executed between the parties, whereby the plaintiff, as landlord, demised to the defendant \u201cthe corner building known as \u20183683 Third Avenue\u2019 in the city of New York, consisting only of the cellar, .store, and floor above, being known as the \u2018Front Avenue Building,\u2019 and does not include rear, or any premises in rear, of said front building.\u201d The lease contains, among others, the following covenant: \u201cThe tenant shall pay the Croton water rent which shall be assessed \u25a0on said premises, when due, and, on his failure to pay, the same shall become due on his next month\u2019s rent.\u201d Under this covenant, the plaintiff claims the right to hold the defendant for the water rents \u25a0of the entire premises, including front and rear buildings, while the defendant, having paid the rent for the front building, contends that he has discharged his entire liability. The obvious intention of the parties, as disclosed by the lease, supports the defense. The term \u25a0\u201cpremises,\u201d in common parlance, is used to signify the land, with its appurtenances; but its usual and appropriate meaning in conveyances is the thing demised or granted by the deed. 19 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 4; New Jersey Zinc Co. v. New Jersey Franklinite Co., 13 N. J. Eq. 331. The \u201csaid premises\u201d referred to in the covenant embraced only the front building, and the defendant could not, under the lease, be charged with the water tax imposed upon the rear building, which was not demised to him. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent. AJ1 concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
