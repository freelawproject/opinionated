We find, upon a careful reading of the case, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the defendant has good grounds for feeling aggrieved, and for appeal to this court. It was for the trial court alone to construe the contract between the parties, and to instruct the jury as to its meaning. Dwight v. Insurance Co., 103 N. Y. 341, 8 N. E. 654. The terms being undisputed and unambiguous, the question thereon was solely one of law (Kenyon v. Association, 122 N. Y. 247, 25 N. E.. 299; Moxley v. Railroad Co., 143 N. Y. 649, 37 N. E. 824), and should not have been left to the jury. It was error, upon the uncontradicted evidence, not to find that the acts done by persons, complained of by plaintiff, were not committed by the defendant or its servants (King v. Railroad Co., 66 N. Y. 181), and so to instruct the jury, or to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">For these reasons, the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, the verdict set aside, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
