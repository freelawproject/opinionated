On the contrary, he charged that, if plaintiff was entitled .to a verdict, the jury should fix the amount thereof. In his charge the justice did refer to several items of damage which were testified to by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. These items were correctly recited in \u2022the charge. It was not error to recite these items. They were ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>parently presented to the jury by him for the purpose of.refreshing their memory, and' not for the purpose of limiting and \u2019-fixing the amount of their verdict. We think that the evidence shows th\u00e1t the injuries complained of were caused solely by reason of the .negligence of the defendant, and that plaintiff was free from contributory negligence. The verdict, was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
