Co. v. Germania Fire Ins. Co., 63 Hun, 275,18 N. Y. Supp. 50 (affirmed 138 N. Y. 252, 33 N. E. 1065), it was said: \u201cIt has frequently been determined that, where no sum of money is claimed in the pleadings or allowed to the plaintiff, there is nothing upon which an extra allowance can be based, and the court has no power to grant it.\u201d The statement as to the nature of this action in the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney is that it \u201cwas brought to obtain some sort of relief in respect to a paper in the form of a general release which had been executed by the plaintiff, including an injunction against its use.\u201d Taking this statement as correct, and with the most favorable view of the nature of the action, it is clear that there was involved therein no proper basis for an allowance. No subject-matter of money value was involved, and therefore there was no basis upon which to fix an allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We think the order appealed from should be modified by striking out the provision granting the extra allowance, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
