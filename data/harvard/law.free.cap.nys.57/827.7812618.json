An examination of the record discloses no errors of law calling for a reversal of the judgment. The issues of fact were fairly presented to the jury, and they have disposed of them in favor of the plaintiff. The damages awarded as compensation to plaintiff are not so large as to show that the jury must have been actuated by passion, partiality, prejudice, or corruption. Stephens v. Knitting Co.
