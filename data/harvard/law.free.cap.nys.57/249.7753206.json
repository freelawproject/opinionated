Before getting into his vehicle, the owner and driver saw a car coming up, half a block away. \u201cIt was going very fast,\u201d said a youth who was with him, in answer to a direct question of the court. \u201cIt was going at the full speed of the cable,\u201d the motorman testified. With this to confront him, the man entered his wagon, and, without further looking, turned about to go downtown. When the wagon was turned right around, and the horse and the first wheel were off the track, he saw the car, which struck a hind wheel, overturning the wagon, and injuring it and its contents, and a finger of the driver. For these, this action was brought, and the plaintiff recovered judgment, to which he was not entitled. Instead of showing absence of contributory negligence on his part, he and his witnesses proved his gross carelessness, in driving without being watchful as to the danger he was then almost sure to meet. Of himself, he said he \u201ccould not look.\u201d If by that he meant that his wagon was so covered that he could not see about him, that helps him nothing. If a man does not take heed to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>way when he should, it is of little moment whether it be because he does not take the trouble to look, or because he beforehand has so surrounded himself that he cannot look.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">FREEDMAN, P.
