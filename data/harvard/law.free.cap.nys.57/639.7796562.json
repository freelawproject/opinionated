Webster, being duly sworn, deposes and says he resides at No'. '211 Hawthoyne street, in the city of Brooklyn', county of Kings, and state of .New York. That deponent is married, and defendant Emma A. Webster is his wife. That this action was brought to foreclose a mortgage for $2,500 \u2022on the house and premises on which deponent resides. That dep\u00f3nent and his wife were duly -served with a summons and complaint in this action, a copy of which is hereto annexed and forms a part of this affidavit, and failed to appear therein and interpose an answer, for the reason that they were informed and believed that their interest in the property .could not be affected in said action, as deponent\u2019s claim as interest in the property antedated the making of the mortgage, and was anterior thereto, and the court would \u25a0have no jurisdiction, and its decree could not, in any event, -affect-deponent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>said claim or interest, which is based on the following facts and circumstances: That on the 5th day of June, 1889, the deponent entered into an agreement with Daniel Doody, a copy of which is hereto annexed and forms a part of this affidavit. That said Daniel Doody, pursuant to the terms of said agreement, set aside the property mentioned in the complaint herein and the moving papers on this application as one of the plots on which deponent was to erect a house. That deponent immediately entered upon the performance of said agreement, and carried it out to the satisfaction of said Daniel Doody, and in conformity with the terms of the agreement, except aS to the time limit within which the houses were to be completed, which limit was waived by said Daniel Doody. That the house in question was completed on the 1st day of May, 1890, and deponent moved into the same, with his family, where he resided to the present time and still resides, with the exception of a few months when deponent rented the house for his own benefit. That deponent has been in actual, open, and undisputed possession of said house and premises from the 1st day of May, 1890, to date, as the owner thereof, under and by virtue of said agreement, and has paid full value therefor. That deponent is informed and believes that prior to the 22d day of December, 1890, the said Daniel Doody conveyed said property to John Hart, a bookkeeper in the employ of said Doody, for a nominal consideration, for the purpose of .having said Hart make the bond and mortgage mentioned in the complaint herein. That the attorney for the plaintiff knew of the interest of deponent when the mortgage was taken. That such mortgage was made on the 22d' day of December, 1890, months after deponent had entered into possession of said property as aforesaid, without the knowledge and consent of deponent, and no part of the money raised by said mortgage was ever paid to deponent, and deponent never in any way ratified the acts of said Hart and Doody in respect thereto. That said Doody subsequently took title to said property, and on the 1st day of August, 1893, conveyed the same, subject to the mortgage aforesaid, for $2,590, to William H. Haywood, a clerk in the office of said Doody. That said Haywood, on the same day, gave back to said Doody a purchase-money mortgage for $1,500, which mortgage said Doody assigned to Asa W. Parker, on the 23d day of September,, 1893. That on the 28th day of September, 1893, deponent commenced an1 action against said Doody, Hart, Parker, Howard, and others for the specific performance of his agreement, asking that the deed to Haywood and mortgages given be set aside, and the said property be conveyed to deponent, and on the same day filed lis pendens in the county clerk\u2019s office of Kings county. That said deeds and mortgages were made without the knowledge or consent of deponent, and no consideration was given deponent, and deponent never in any way ratified the acts of either or any of said parties in respect thereto. That on the 11th day of December, 1893, said Parker commenced an action to foreclose said mortgage for $1,500. Deponent interposed an answer setting forth the facts heretofore mentioned. The case was placed on the special term calendar of the supreme court, and was tried before Mr. Justice Gaynor. The complaint would have been dismissed, bad not deponent\u2019s counsel consented to try the priority of deponent\u2019s claim. Said justice held deponent had rights under said contract anterior to said mortgage, which should be adjusted, and by a decree, a copy of which is hereto annexed, appointed Hugo Hirsch, Esq., referee to hear and determine said account, and the rights of the parties thereunder, and suspended the execution of the judgment of foreclosure and sale until the rendering of the report of the referee, etc. That deponent and his counsel have been unable to get issues properly framed on part of said Doody to try the matter before the referee. That deponent has repeatedly requested said Doody to carry out the terms-of the agreement, and to convey to deponent said, property, but he postponed the matter from time to time on various pretenses, offering to give-deponent a deed of said property, and \u2018call things square,\u2019 which proposition deponent refused, as said Doody is indebted to him in the sum of $2,000 over- and above the property heretofore mentioned now in possession of deponent ahd the equity in the other house mentioned, in the decree signed by Mr. Justice Gaynor. That on the 23d day of July, 1894, deponent attended the sale of the property heretofore mentioned, at- the Kings County court house, and,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>in the presence of the referee, the purchaser,' Daniel F. Doody, the son of Daniel Doody, the maker of the contract heretofore mentioned, and all present, and before the property was sold, stated that he was the owner- and in possession of the property about to be sold under a contract made prior to-the mortgage under which the property was being sold, and that the- purchaser at such sale would take subject and subordinate to his claim and-'rights, and' that the purchaser took with notice that deponent\u2019s interest and claim was not' cut off by the foreclosure of said mortgage. That said Daniel Doody was at the sale, and was present when his son purchased the' property, and was also present when deponent made his statement. That the writ prayed for should not- be allowed, for the reason that deponent was in possession- of the property, and had paid for the same, before the mortgage was executed, and the mortgagee took subject to his rights and with notice; that deponent\u2019s claim was anterior to the mortgage, consequently the foreclosure could not affect .his rights, and no decree the court could make in this action could abridge his rights; that said court has no jurisdiction over the person or rights of deponent; and that the priority and anteriority of deponent\u2019s claim cannot be tried in this proceeding. An ejectment suit should be brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-5\">\u201cHanson S.

The judgment of foreclosure does not appear in the present record; consequently we are uninformed as to its terms. The complaint, however, in the action appears in the record, and, so far as its averments affect Webster, it is in the usual form, that the defendants claim or have some interest in or lien upon the mortgaged premises, which is subordinate to the lien of the mortgage. It follows, therefore, that Webster\u2019s lien would remain unaffected by any judgment which might have been \u25a0entered under the complaint, unless his lien was in fact subordinate thereto. It appears by the affidavit of Webster, and the agreement which is made a part of the same, that he entered into possession of the premises in pursuance of said agreement; that he has fulfilled the same upon his part, and has paid the purchase price in full, and has been ever since the construction of the building, and prior to the execution of the mortgage foreclosed, in the open, visible possession and occupation of such premises. It is therefore clear that, if these allegations are true, Webster could not be affected in his right or title to the property under any judgment entered in the foreclosure action, and it made no difference, as to such rights, whether he appeared and answered or made default. Jacobie v. Mickle, 144 N. Y. 237, 39 N. E. 66. It follows, therefore, that, as to Webster, he may not be disturbed in his possession and occupation by virtue of this judgment, in consequence of which the writ of assistance is not authorized. The court below concluded that Webster was bound by the judgment of foreclosure, and that his rights were cut off. This, as we have seen, was erroneous. The court also held that the proof offered in support of the motion established that in fact Webster had no lien. But it was not disputed that he had an agreement of purchase, and his affidavit is that he entered into possession under the same. It is clear, therefore, that he may have and hold a valid lien, his claim in this respect may not be adjudicated upon summarily, and the court is not authorized to try such title upon affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">It follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
