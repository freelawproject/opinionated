The first floor of the building was reached by means '\u2022\u2022of a flight of steps, which extended from the sidewalk to a hall, and in the \u25a0 \u00a1southeast corner of this hall was a room occupied by the defendant\u2019s president ..and. secretary as an office. This room was separated from the hall by a glass -\u00a1partition, and west of it was another room, used as \u00e1 shop; both rooms having - .doors which opened into the hail. On the south side of the hall was a stairway, Heading up to the second story, connecting with which was another stairway, : Heading to the third story, and in the northeast comer of the lower hall was an \u2022\u2022 -elevator, which was used for the purpose of hoisting freight from one part -.of the building to another. At the time of the accident which lies at the foun-dation of this action one William H. Hutchinson was a tenant of the defend\u00a1an\u00ed, .-and as such occupied the third and a portion of the second floors of this' \u2019-building. Access to his rooms was obtained by means of the common entrance \u2022 \u00abon Caledonia avenue and the stairways leading from the first to the second -\u25a0and third floors. On the afternoon of the 5th day of December, 1895, the plain\u00a1\u00a1iiff started for Mr. Hutchinson\u2019s place of business, in order, if possible, to \u201c\u25a0\u2022obtain \u2019employment. She was not familiar with the building, never having \u00a1'been'\u00a1there before, and, upon entering the same, inquired of a gentleman, whom -\u00a1she met going out, where she could find the elevator. The person to- whom \"\u00abthis inquiry was addressed was unable to answer the same, but directed her ' \u00a1to -the defendant\u2019s office. She thereupon went to one of the defendant\u2019s rooms, \u25a0\u2019\"where she met a Mr. Smith, who was in the defendant\u2019s employ in the capacity '\u25a0of a packing clerk, of whom she made a similar inquiry, and Smith at once .\u00a1left his work, and started down the hallway towards the elevator, the plain- \u00a1tiff following .Mm. As they walked along, the plaintiff stated to Smith that \u2022\u2022\u00a1.she wished <em>to see </em>Mr. Hutchinson, and Smith remarked that his office had neeeen\u00edly been removed to the second floor. The plaintiff testified that when \"-they reached -the end of the hall she stopped for Smith to open the door of \"the elevator, which he did; that he thereupon turned around, so as to face Jher; that, without looking up or down, she then stepped through the opening, \u00a1assuming that the elevator was there, and at once fell to the bottom of the well, receiving injuries which were very painful in their character, and from \u201cwhich .it .is quite probable she will never entirely recover. The evidence of the \u00a1\u2022plaintiff \u00a1as to what took place after she entered the building was flatly conrtradieted in several essential particulars by the defendant\u2019s witnesses, and the tissues thus presented were submitted to the jury, which found in favor of the a\u00edMntiff. A motion was thereupon made for a new trial on the minutes of 'the -court. This motion was granted, and from the order granting the same \u00a1this appeal is brought.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AQ9\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

It follows, therefore, that the defendant is liable, and that the verdict must stand, if Smith, in conducting the plaintiff to the elevator, was acting within the scope of his authority, or with the knowledge and consent of the defendant\u2019s officers, either express or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">It is sometimes assumed, in cases of this character, that, where the relation of master and servant exists, the responsibility of the f dinner for any negligent act of the latter necessarily follows; and such is undoubtedly the rule, provided the negligent act was committed within the scope of the servant\u2019s employment. When, however, the servant undertakes to carry out a separate and independent purpose of his own,\u2014where, in other words, instead of doing that which he is employed to do, he steps outside of his proper sphere of duty to render some service which he is not employed to render, \u2014the liability of the master ceases. This rule, or, more properly speaking, .this exception to a well-established rule, is so obviously founded in good sense and Justice as to require no citation of authority to support it. But it sometimes happens, by reason of the many and diversified duties which the servant is required to perform, that it is difficult to determine just when he is, and is not, acting within the scope of his employment. In such cases the law furnishes a test, 'the application of which seldom fails to resolve all doubt, and that test is: Was the act complained of committed by the authority of, the master, either expressly conferred or fairly to be implied from the nature of the employment and the duties incident thereto ? In short, was it done in the prosecution of the master\u2019s business? Wood, Mast. &amp; Serv. \u00a7 279; Cosgrove v. Ogden, 49 N. Y. 255; Keep v. Walsh, 17 App. Div. 104, 44 N. Y. Supp. 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">In order that this test may be properly applied to the case in hand, let us briefly advert to some of the salient features which the evidence may be said to fairly and clearly establish. The defendant was the owner of a three-story building, which it occupied in connection with the tenant, Hutchinson, who carried on a separate business. Access to the second and third floors of this building was obtained by means of suitable stairs; but, in order to facilitate the removal of the goods and merchandise which were manufactured by the defendant, as well as by Mr. Hutchinson, an elevator had been constructed in one end of the hall, and this elevator, which ran from the basement to the third floor of the building, had attached to it a sign, which read: \u201cFor Freight Only.\u201d The witness Smith was in the employ\" of the defendant as its packing clerk, and his proper place of business, when in the performance of his duties, was at a table in the shop. Precisely what his duties were does not appear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>but it may be assumed that their performance required him to make use of the elevator. Indeed, he testified\" that he was in the habit of operating it; and it appears that, when he or' Mr. Hutchinson had occasion to go from one floor to another, they used the elevator for that purpose. It does not appear, however, that Smith had charge of the elevator, or that it was any part of his duty to operate the same for the conveyance of passengers. On the contrary, it does appear affirmatively that he had no authority to use it for any such purpose, and, although he admitted that, on two occasions prior to the accident, he had, in violation of the direction printed upon the sign, carried persons upon the elevator from one part of the building to another, he stated that he did so upon his own responsibility,' and without the consent or knowledge of the defendant\u2019s officers. In this the witness is corroborated by the evidence of his father, the defendant\u2019s secretary, and by Mr. Boswell, its president and treasurer, as well as by Mr. Hutchinson, who, although sworn on behalf, of the plaintiff, testified that he used the elevator for no other purpose than for freight, except to ride upon it occasionally, that he did not allow his employ\u00e9s to ride upon it, and that, if they did so, it was contrary to his - instructions. These facts, none of which is seriously controverted by the plaintiff, when subjected to the test to which we have adverted, make it plain, we think, that in conducting the plaintiff to the elevator, with the intention of conveying her thereon to the second floor, Smith not only undertook to do something which he was not employed to do, but that he openly violated the rules and regulations of the business in which he was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It is argued, however, that, even admitting this to be the fact, there was evidence in the case which would justify the jury in finding that in this particular instance Smith was impliedly authorized to use the elevator for the purpose of conveying the. plaintiff to the second floor; and this contention is made to rest upon the grounds \u2014First, that the defendant\u2019s president and secretary were aware of Smith\u2019s intention when he went out of the office, in company with the plaintiff, and raised no objection thereto; and, second, that it had been customary for passengers to use the elevator as a means of conveyance for a long time prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The only evidence to sustain the first of these grounds is furnished by the plaintiff herself, who testified that when she entered the defendant\u2019s office, and inquired for the elevator, Mr. Boswell, the defendant\u2019s president, was sitting at his desk, four or five feet distant from her, and that further on was another man, whom she assumed to be Mr. Smith, the defendant\u2019s secretary. She did not address either of these persons, nor did they speak to her; but she insists that she spoke in a tone of voice sufficiently loud for them to have heard her. These gentlemen, however, testified that they did not hear the plaintiff make any inquiries, nor did they see her until after the accident; and their evidence in this regard was materially strengthened by that of the young man, Smith, who stated that when the pl\u00e1intif\u00ed asked him to show her to the elevator he was not in the office, but in the adjoining shop, or packing room. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the evidence upon this branch of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>case, taken as a whole, is insufficient to establish either knowledge or consent on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">As regards the question of custom, the plaintiff\u2019s case is still weaker. But two witnesses, aside from Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Smith, testified that they ever rode in the elevator prior to the accident. One of these was a stenographer in the employ of Mr. Hutchinson, who said that she and her co-employ\u00e9s usually went up by the stairway, but that on one occasion she did use the elevator, and her recollection was that she did so by permission of Smith, the packing clerk. The other witness was also an employ\u00e9, and a sister of Mr. Hutchinson, who testified that she sometimes used the elevator to reach the upper room, that when she did so she operated it herself, and that she was not certain that she ever used it prior to the accident. It is not shown .that any of the defendant\u2019s officers knew that either of these persons used the elevator in the manner described by them; but, on the contrary, the president and secretary both swore unequivocally that they did not, and that it was never used, to their knowledge, by any person other than an employ\u00e9, as a means of conveyance. Giving to this evidence, therefore, all the effect which can possibly be claimed for it, it simply proves that in one or two isolated instances there was a departure from the prescribed order of business in the defendant\u2019s establishment, but that the same was never brought to the attention or knowledge of the defendant\u2019s officers. This certainly does not go far towards establishing a custom, if, indeed, it can be said to have any tendency in that direction; for, in order to charge the master with liability for the unauthorized acts of his servant, it must be shown that he either had actual notice of such acts, or else that they were committed so frequently and under such circumstances as to justify the presumption of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In our view of the case, no error was committed by the trial court in granting a new trial, and, consequently, the order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
