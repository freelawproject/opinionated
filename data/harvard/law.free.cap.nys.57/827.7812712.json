The action was brought to recover damages for an assault alleged to have been committed upon plaintiff by one of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s while she was proceeding to take passage on one of the \u25a0defendant\u2019s ferryboats at the foot of Thirty-Ninth street, in the city of Brooklyn. The answer denies the several allegations of the \u25a0complaint. We have examined the evidence taken on the trial, and find that there was a sharp conflict between the plaintiff and the gateman, called on the part of the defendant, as to what actually \u25a0did take place on the occasion complained of. It was said in Campion v. Parker (Sup.) 28 N. Y. Supp. 827:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">\u201cIt is a general rule that a new trial will not be granted, on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence, where the testimony is contradictory. It is only where the verdict is so clearly against the weight of evidence as to furnish proof that the jury were influenced by passion, prejudice, or mistake, that it should be set aside. It is not enough that the court would have reached a different conclusion from a careful study of-the ,evi'\u25a0dence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">We are satisfied that the verdict was not so clearly against the weight of evidence upon this question as to justify a reversal of the judgment. Hardcastle v. Heine (Sup.) 54 N. Y. Supp. 171; Millot v. Railroad Co., 64 Hun, 634, 19 N. Y. Supp. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">The jury fixed the amount of plaintiff's compensation under a fair and impartial charge from the court, and we are not disposed, under all the circumstances, to say that it was excessive. Stephens v. Knitting Co. (Sup.) 20 N. Y. Supp. 916; Sayles v. Hoetzel (Sup.) 20 N, Y. Supp. 554; Scott v. Association (Sup.) 26 N. Y. Supp. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">No errors of law were committed on the trial that call for a reversal of judgment, and the judgment and order appealed from must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">O\u2019DWYER, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
