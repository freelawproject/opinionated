Koehler &amp; Co. The plaintiffs became owners of said note prior to its maturity and for a valuable consideration, and had no notice of such alleged diversion. The fact that plaintiffs gave credit on an antecedent debt due from Koehler &amp; Co. to them makes them holders in go\u2019od faith for value. See Laws 1897, c. 612, \u00a7 51. Said section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-20\">\u201cValue is any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. An antecedent or pre-existing debt constitutes value, and is deemed such, whether the instrument is payable on demand or in future time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-21\">Even without the aid of the law just referred to, the plaintiffs were bona fide holders of said note, because they received the same in absolute payment of part of the debt due them.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-22\">We find there was no error, and judgment is therefore \"affirmed, with, costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-23\">SCHUCHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
