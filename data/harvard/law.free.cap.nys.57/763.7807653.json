The pleadings were verified. The sufficiency of the denial of the assignment contained in the answer may be questioned, but, in fact, the trial proceeded upon the assumption that the assignment had been put in issue; and the testimony of the plaintiff utterly failed to establish an assignment. But, independently of that question, the dismissal of the complaint for insufficiency of proof cannot be disturbed, for the following reason, viz.: The answer fully and sufficiently denied the allegations of the complaint as to the performance of the work and labor, and the furnishing of the materials; and upon these points the plaintiff neither gave, nor offered to give, testimony. He should, at least, have moved for leave to complete his case, and offered to prove performance; but he closed his case without making any such effort. Judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
