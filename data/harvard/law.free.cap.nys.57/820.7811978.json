No such application was made in this case, nor is it claimed that the notice of application was served on the judgment debtor, but it is claimed that the notice was served on the attorneys of record for the defendant in the action in which the judgment was obtained, and that such service was equivalent to service on the debtor personally. We do not think so. The attorneys of record could have appeared on the motion, and waived personal service, as in the case of Moore v. Empie, 17 App. Div. 218, 45 N. Y. Supp. 539; but they did not do so, but elected to treat the service as a nullity. This they had a right to' do, and it follows that the service was not such as is required by the Code, and the order entered thereon must be reversed, with costs. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
