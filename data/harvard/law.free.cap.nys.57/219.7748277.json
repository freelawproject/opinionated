J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlB\">The complaint is based upon a debt due to Griffin &amp; Giles for commission due them in effecting an exchange of certain premises owned by defendant. A counterclaim is set up in defendant\u2019s answer against Griffin alone. The counterclaim was demurred to. Demurrer was sustained; hence the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">It was proper to sustain the demurrer. The counterclaim set forth was based upon a debt due from Griffin alone. The cause of action set forth in the complaint alleged a claim due to Griffin &amp; Giles jointly. A separate debt cannot be set off against a joint debt. Spofford v. Rowan, 124 N. Y. 108, 26 N. E. 350. This view of the matter renders it unnecessary for us to consider, the other points-presented by respondent in his demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">Order and judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs..
