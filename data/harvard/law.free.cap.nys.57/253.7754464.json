After that, the plaintiff\u2019s father and agent was in direct communication with Shove concerning the maintenance and keep of the horse, to whom, also,, he wrote that, if he had an offer for the horse, he would sell him. In the month of May, McCann, Sr., had a conversation .with the defendant, and then the defendant wrote Shove, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-15\">\u201cMr. McCann was here at my place a few days ago, and said to me to tell you to sell his horse to the best advantage possible, and make out bill for keep, and report to me as soon as sold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">Shove sold the horse. When the McCanns learned of this, they demanded the horse from the defendant, and, upon refusal, the plaintiff brought this action to recover damages for the conversion of the animal.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">Whatever liability the defendant thus may have incurred to the plaintiff, and ultimately to Shove, he did not assume or exercise such-rights over the animal as to make him liable in an action for conversion. The judgment of the municipal court should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">Judgment of the municipal court reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
