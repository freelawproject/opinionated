In this calculation, if calculation he made, he was mistaken ; for, although the horse and part of the vehicle safely crossed the track, the wagon was struck by the car, and crushed against the pillar. For the damage thus done to the vehicle, the baker brought this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">For the defendant, the motorman testified that he saw the baker\u2019s wagon \u201cabout two and a half pillars away,\u201d a little before it was turned easterly; that, so soon as he saw the horse turned from the south-bound track, he sounded the gong as a warning; and that, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>soon as it became apparent that Kelbe intended to cross the avenue, he took all the means in his power to stop the car, which he did within the shortest space possible,\u2014about 40 feet. The motorman was corroborated as to his efforts to stop the car by the conductor, by other witnesses for the defendant, and also by the plaintiff\u2019s principal witness, other than Kelbe. Still there might have- been something in the statements of Kelbe, and, in the circumstances of the' accident, warranting the submission to the jury of the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence. It was otherwise as to the absence of contributory negligence on the part of the baker\u2019s driver. Intending, as he said he did, to drive into Ninetieth street, he did not cross the avenue directly when he had opportunity, nor did he wait until he had reached Ninetieth street, but he drove diagonally towards the street. Instead of driving, as would a man of ordinary prudence, and as he might be.expected to do, tempted by a chance of cutting off a little of the distance, Kelbe took the risk of passing between the pillar and the rapidly coming car; and his employer must take the consequences of his imprudence, and not the defendant company. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">FREEDMAN, P.
