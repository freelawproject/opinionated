The petition, besides reciting the customary facts, sets forth that the statutory notice in writing, to the effect that the landlord elected to terminate the tenancy, had been duly served on the tenant five days before the expiration of the alleged term. The answer denied every allegation of the petition, except that the respondent was the landlord of the premises. At the trial, no proof whatever was offered of the service of this notice. This defect of proof has in this court but recently been held to constitute substantial and reversible error (Hedden v. Nederburg [Sup.] 55 N. Y. Supp. 613); and, following that and kindred decisions (Tolman v. Hoading, 11 App. Div. 264, 42 N. Y. Supp. 217; Beach v. Bainbridge, 7 Hun, 81; Posson v. Dean, 8 Civ. Proc. R. 177), we must reverse th\u00a7 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-17\">Order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
