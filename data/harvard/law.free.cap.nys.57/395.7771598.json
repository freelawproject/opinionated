Subsequently, because of a cold, and of the sudden change in the weather, the plaintiff left said first car, and boarded a closed car,\u2014one immediately in the rear of the same, and attached thereto. The conductor of the latter car then demanded from plaintiff his fare, which plaintiff refused, for the reason that he had already paid a fare to the conductor in charge of the first, or open, car. Because of this refusal he was ejected from the last car; hence this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">The demand of the conductor in charge of the closed car for plaintiff\u2019s fare was just and reasonable. The plaintiff had voluntarily chosen to take passage in the open car. If, for reasons satisfactory to himself, and for his own interest, he subsequently wished to take passage in one of defendant\u2019s closed cars, he thus made himself a new passenger, and defendant has the right to require him to pay the usual fare. The refusal of plaintiff to pay said fare entitled defendant\u2019s servant to use necessary physical force to eject plaintiff from the car. In our judgment no unnecessary force or violence was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">Finding there was no error, judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-17\">SCHUCHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
