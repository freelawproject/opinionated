So much of the application as was for severance was addressed to the discretion of the city court, and is not hereto appealable. Passing by the question whether the denials were so precisely in the terms of the complaint as to be negatives pregnant, or no defense at all, to the allegations that the plaintiff had not capacity to sue, it is to be held that these allegations are allegations of a substantial defense, which, when ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>ified, as here, even if made, as here also, upon information and belief,, might not be stricken out as sham upon affidavits, however earnest and cogent be the statement of the affiants as to the falsity of the defendant\u2019s averments, for the defendant is entitled to a trial upon, that defense by a jury. That is secured by Const, art. 1, \u00a7 2. Against loss or inconvenience from the consequent delay the plaintiff has no-present legal remedy. As suggested in our court of last resort, the plaintiff, if it be aggrieved by falsehood in the verification of the answer, may bring help to others, if not to itself, if it \u201cperform the duty incumbent upon every good citizen to prosecute those known to be guilty of perjury.\u201d Wayland v.
