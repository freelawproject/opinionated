Law (Laws 1893, c. 338), to recover a penalty of $100 for keeping), using, and serving as food for the guests, boarders, and employ\u00e9s. of the defendant a substance made in violation of the provisions of article 2 of the agricultural law, which article relates to dairy products. The food thus furnished is described in the complaint as-\u201ca certain oleaginous substance not produced or made exclusively from unadulterated milk or cream and not the product of the dairy, but an article or substance colored in imitation or semblance of' natural butter produced from pure unadulterated milk or cream = of the same.\u201d The defendant has demurred to the complaint on', the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a. cause of action; and the sole question which is raised upon this-, demurrer is whether there is a sufficient allegation that the defendant furnished to Ms boarders such an article as- is- prohibited by the agricultural law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-17\">\u25a0 In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the appellant argues that, although other portions of the- agricultural Iaw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>contain other prohibitions, it is plain that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney could have had reference to none except that contained in the first part of section 26 of the statute in question, which reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-5\">\u201cManufacture and Sale of Imitation Butter Prohibited. No person by himself, his agents or employes, shall produce or manufacture out of or from any animal fats or animal or vegetable oils not produced from unadulterated milk or cream from the same, the article known as oleomargarine or any article or product in imitation or semblance of natural butter produced from pure, unadulterated milk or cream of the same.\u201d Laws 1893, c. 338, as amended by Laws 1897, c. 768.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">It would seem necessary, in order to bring the case within the \u2022scope of this provision, that the complaint should allege that the article or product in imitation or semblance of natural butter which was kept by the defendant and furnished to his boarders \"had been manufactured from animal fats or animal or vegetable \u2022oils not produced from unadulterated milk or cream. This view Is confirmed by reference to the first part of section 26, before its \u00bfamendment in 1897, when it read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-7\">\u201cManufacture and Sale of Imitation Butter Prohibited. No person, by \u25a0himself, his agents or employes, shall produce or manufacture out of or from \u2022 any animal fats or animal or vegetable oils not produced from unadulterated milk, or cream from the same, any article or product in imitation or sem.\"blance of natural butter produced from pure, unadulterated milk or cream of \u25a0\u00bfthe same.\u201d Laws 1893, c. 338, as amended by Laws 1894, e. 426.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">If we compare the provision before the amendment with the \u25a0provision after the amendment, it clearly appears that the prohibition in this portion of the statute formerly related and now re-dates solely to substances manufactured out of animal fats or animal or vegetable oils not produced from unadulterated milk; so that, if the complaint cannot find support elsewhere than upon section 26 of the agricultural law, the omission to allege that the article kept and furnished by the defendant was made out of such \u25a0fats or oils is fatal to the pleading. I was at first inclined to think that the complaint might be regarded as having been drawn under .another provision of the statute, amply sufficient to sustain it. ' This is section 27, which, among other things, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-12\">\u201cNo person shall manufacture, mix or compound with or add to natural \u2022 milk, cream or butter any animal fats or animal or vegetable oils nor make \u2022 or manufacture any oleaginous substance not produced from milk or cream, with intent to sell the same as butter or cheese made from unadulterated ;milk or cream or have the same in his possession with such intent; nor shall \u00bf\u2022\u25a0any person solicit or take orders for the same or offer the same for sale, nor \u2022shall any such article or substance or compound so made or produced, be sold ;as and for butter or cheese the product of the dairy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-15\">Here the prohibition against manufacturing for sale as butter ot cheese any oleaginous substance not produced from milk or cream is not qualified or affected by the prior prohibition against adding animal fats or animal or vegetable oils to natural milk, cream, or butter; and the making or selling of such oleaginous substance is forbidden in a clause which is not limited by anything indicating that it is designed, to apply only to articles derived from .animal fats or animal or vegetable oils. In order to constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>manufacture in violation of this portion of the statute, however, it is essential that there shall be an intent to sell the oleaginous substance therein proscribed as genuine butter or cheese; but, unfortunately for the complaint before us, it lacks any allegation of .such intent. I am therefore unable to perceive how it can be sustained; for the pleader has failed to allege facts sufficient to show that the article or substance furnished by the defendant to his bo\u00e1rders or employ\u00e9s was made in violation of any of the provisions of article 2 of the agricultural law; and this he must do in order to make out his statutory cause of action. Laws 1893, c. 338, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">I think the interlocutory judgment should be reversed, and judgment directed for the defendant, with leave to the plaintiff to amend on the usual terms. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
