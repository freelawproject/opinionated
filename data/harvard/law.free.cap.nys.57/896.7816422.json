J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzXH\">The plaintiff, on an evening of January, 1898, was driving a \u201creach\u201d wagon on the easterly or north-bound track of the defendant\u2019s road on Rogers avenue, in the .borough of Brooklyn, when he heard the bell of a car coming up behind him and began to turn off the east track onto the west track, and while in this act the inside of the rear right-hand wheel of his wagon was struck by the car, whereby the wagon was upset and the plaintiff thrown off and injured. There was much strife at the trial as to whether the,plaintiff was driving north on the north or the south bound track, and whether he turned off the south-bound track onto the north-bound track; but, as this was a disputed question, we must assume the plaintiff\u2019s contention to be true, and this, it may be said, is in accord with some of the evidence of the defendant, and is confirmed by the fact that the wagon was struck on the inside of the rear right-hand wheel. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that \u201cthe plaintiff has failed to establish the cause of action set forth in the complaint.\u201d This was not very definite; but, as the complaint necessarily alleged that, the plaintiff was not careless or negligent, we assume that this ground was within the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">This court is committed to the doctrine that while it is not negligence, as matter of law, for one driving a wagon at night in the track of a surface railroad to fail to look backward to see an approaching car, yet he may not rely wholly upon the supposition that the railroad\u2019s servants will see him in time to give warning, and that he-must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>be on the alert to discover in some manner and by some exercise of his senses the approach of a car from the rear. Devine v. Railroad Co., 34 App. Div. 248, 54 N. Y. Supp. 626; Johnson v. Same, 34 App. Div. 271, 54 N. Y. Supp. 547; Quinn v. Same (decided at the March term of this court) 57 N. Y. Supp. 544. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence on this subject is briefly as follows: He was seated over the rear axle with a boy beside him, who was not examined as a witness, but whose absence was fully accounted for. The plaintiff said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-5\">\u201cI come along Rogers avenue and I heard a bell, and I looked back and I turned out of the track, and while I was turning out I got hit, and I flew off the wagon. That is all I remember. * * * At the time I was hit I had the horse over in the other track already, and the front wheels there in the other track on the left hand on which the cars go out. When I was struck the forward part of the truck\u2014the front wheels\u2014were on the other track\u2014the left-hand track\u2014with the horse. * * * When I heard the bell behind me, X was about twenty feet in front, or twenty-five feet. I didn\u2019t hear any bell till then.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">He also said that his horse was going at a slow walk, and that he turned out wrhen he heard the bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Bewick, one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, testified that \u201cthis car was at least three blocks away from him when he commenced to ring the bell, and coming at a terrible speed, and the car was about Leffert\u2019s Place when the man commenced to turn out.\u201d Leffert\u2019s Place is three blocks distant from Malbone street,\u2014the place of the accident. The-plaintiff had turned out of the track once before for an overtaking car, thus displaying some degree of attention, and the jury might believe-\u2019 the testimony of Bewick that the plaintiff began to turn out of the track when the bell was rung at Leffert\u2019s Place, although the plaintiff himself testified that he did not begin to turn till he heard the bell, when the car was 20 or 25 feet away; for it is in evidence that the-plaintiff\u2019s injuries have in some, though perhaps slight, degree impaired his mental ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Under this state of the evidence, the court properly submitted to the-jury the question of the plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence, and we may not disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
