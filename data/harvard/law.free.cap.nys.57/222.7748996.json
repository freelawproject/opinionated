Railway Co., 21 App. Div. 427-432, 47 N. Y. Supp. 540, it is manifest that the verdict complained of herein must he set aside. In that case, exactly as in the one at bar, the plaintiff had no evidence to corroborate her on the question of defendant\u2019s negligence; but, when plaintiff rested, there was sufficient proof to carry the case to the jury. The defendants in both cases made out defenses- by disinterested witnesses, so that it may not be said that only the conductor and gripman testified in defendant\u2019s behalf. The verdict was clearly against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">We think that permitting the physician to testify, against objection, to the presence of bodily ills not complained of in the pleading of plaintiff, was error also calling for reversal. This subjected defendant to a surprise that it could not have guarded against, since 'it was not called upon to meet proof of other particulars of permanent injury than those definitely stated in the complaint. Hergert v. Railway Co., 25 App. Div. 220, 49 N. Y. Supp. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">Judgment and order appealed from reversed, and new trial ordered, upon condition that defendant pay to plaintiff the costs and dis-, bursements of the former trial; the appellant to have costs and disbursements of this appeal, to abide the event of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">MeCARTHY, j., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
