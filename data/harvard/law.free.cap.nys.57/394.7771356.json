It is based upon the complaint, answer, and an affidavit made by the defendant\u2019s attorney. Concerning all the allegations contained in the complaint, the defendant denies any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to each and every allegation thereof. The affidavit of its attorney amplifies and particularizes this denial, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>shows that defendant has no knowledge or information concerning the allegations in said complaint, and upon which, of course, it is apparent plaintiff bases this action. It is therefore apparent to us that defendant has no knowledge or information which would enable it to successfully defend this action, unless the particulars asked for and granted by the order appealed from are given it. Such .order, in our judgment, is just and reasonable, and imposes upon plaintiff no unjust or unfair requirement. All the details asked for and granted are certainly within the knowledge of plaintiff, and should be freely given by him. He is not an infant of 12 years. He is 19 years old, and should be, and undoubtedly is, able to do all that is required by the order in question, which is hereby affirmed, with costs to respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
