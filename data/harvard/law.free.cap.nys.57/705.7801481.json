Birdsall, as administratrix of the will of Thomas J. Birdsall, deceased, against Charles J. Grant, impleaded with M. Frances Grant, to foreclose a mortgage executed by defendants on the land conveyed to said M. Frances Grant by Lucy C. Grant. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant Charles. J. Grant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A1RH\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b729-12\">The following is the opinion of the court below (DUNWELL, J.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b729-13\">The clause in the deed from Lucy C. Grant to M. Frances Grant which qualifies the fee is the subject of the controversy in this action. The deed, which, is in the usual form, by its terms conveys a title in fee, \u201csubject, however, to-the condition following: The second party [M. Frances Grant] is to devote, pay, and use the income and profits of said premises to and for the benefit-support, and maintenance of her son, Charles J. Grant, during his natural life.\u201d Plaintiff asserts the words in question to be a condition subsequent,, while defendants insist that they create a trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b729-14\">The intention of the grantor seems to have been to convey the fee to- hen-son\u2019s wife, requiring her, however, to apply the income to the son\u2019s support during his life. She might accomplish the object of her son\u2019s support either-by a trust or a condition. She could confer upon M. Frances Grant a title to the real property, as trustee, or convey to her the fee upon condition. By-, the deed which she gave she used words presently vesting the title in fee.She did not employ any of the conventional words usually selected to convey \u25a0 a title in trust. The language used created a title in fee. Immediately following the conveyance of the fee she imposes upon it the burden of her son\u2019s, support. She, herself, calls it a \u201ccondition\u201d; for she uses this language, \u201csubject, however, to the condition following,\u201d etc. It is not to be supposed): that because support and maintenance are permitted by the statute as one off the objects of a trust, all methods employed for the same purpose must necessarily be considered trusts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Here is a plain conveyance of a fee, and attached thereto a condition that &lt;the income and profits are to be devoted to the support of another for life. \"The condition being such that its performance necessarily takes place after the vesting of title, it falls within all the definitions of a \u201ccondition subsequent.\u2019\u2019 Underhill v. Railroad Co., 20 Barb. 459, 460; Livingston v. Gordon, 84 N. Y. 142, 143; Hogeboom v.. Hail, 24 Wend. 146. Such a condition may be waived or released by the person entitled to enforce it. Wheeler v.
