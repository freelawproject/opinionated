It is admitted that the attorney made an agreement with the plaintiff whereby he had an interest in any recovery as compensation for his services. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 458-467, provides that, where an order is made permitting prosecution by the plaintiff of the action as a poor person, the court, by order, must assign an at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>torney, \"who must act without compensation.\u201d The agreement made was therefore fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s right to a continuance of the action as a poor person by an attorney acting under such an agreement. The force of this argument, however, is said to be met by a stipulation which the attorney says he made subsequently, and before the motion, but which does not appear in the moving papers, whereby he stipulated that he would prosecute the action without compensation. If such a stipulation has been made, it has not been filed, nor does it appear among the papers, nor are we informed of its exact terms. And, which is equally important, there is no statement from the plaintiff herself that she has accepted or acted upon the force of the stipulation, and no statement as to what her understanding or arrangement is as to compensation, or as to whether she is under any obligation to pay to this attorney, or to any third person for his use and benefit, any money as compensation. The conditions under which an order of this kind may be granted are set forth in Harris v. Insurance Co., 20 Civ. Proc. R. 192, 13 N. Y. Supp. 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We think, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 \u25a0 costs and disbursements, and that the motion should be denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
