Of these asseverations, the plaintiff proved none upon the trial. He testified that he first met the defendant in the defendant\u2019s store, in July, and offered him some property for his farm in Connecticut, and that they had some, correspondence, a part, but not the beginning, of which he introduced in evidence. In a letter of July 15th, after referring to some property apparently disparaged by the defendant, he wrote: \u201cI send you herewith the particulars of another property, which may suit you better: No. - E. 98th street; * * * price, $17,000; one mortgage, $11,000.\u201d The defendant replied on the same day: \u201cKindly let me know by mail on what conditions the deal in 98th street can be made. I have seen it. [Salutation and signature.] P. S. Let me know all particulars, including length of time on mortgage.\u201d On the 19th the plaintiff wrote: \u201cThe owner of the property * * * tells me that the mortgage of $11,000 is on the property for some time, and has been due for over <em>\u00e1 </em>years, and he is positive that, so long as interest are paid punctually, the mortgage can remain for always.\u201d And on the 21st he wrote further: \u201cMy party has seen the farm, and made me the following proposition: He will accept the farm free and clear, and $2,000 cash, in payment for his property E. 98th street, subject to a mortgage of $11,000.\u201d The next day the defendant wrote: \u201cI have well considered your proposition, and the utmost I could give is $1,000, the farm free and clear.\u201d On the 26th the plaintiff replied: \u201cI have seen my party again, and * * * I persuaded him to accept your proposition of $1,000 cash and the farm free and clear. If satisfactory to you, you can meet the party to-morrow (Wednesday, July 27th), at eleven o\u2019clock a, m., \u00ae * to close the matter.\u201d The defendant answered, on the same day, excusing himself from the appointment, and saying: \u201cMeanwhile will you kindly find out if I can procure from them a standing mortgage. Upon receipt of your answer, I will let you know when I can meet your party.\u201d To this the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tiff replied on July 28th: \u2018In reference to the mortgage, can only state that the same can positively remain as long \"as interest are paid punctually. The mortgage was made a good many years ago, and is now four years overdue, which shows very plainly that the party does not want the money. It would be foolish to disturb the mortgage, and insist on an extension, as long as the mortgagee is satisfied.\u201d Then, and on the same day, the defendant ended the chaffering, as he had a right to, even if he gave a conventional, rather than the real, reason for his action, with a postal card running: \u201cYours received, and in reply would say that, owing to unforeseen circumstances, I am unable to make the deal as I would wish, so I am compelled to drop it at present.\u201d In all this the plaintiff proved neither employment nor agreement upon the terms and conditons, nor promise to pay, or to sell or to exchange. The mere statement by the defendant of the utmost he could give in money and property did not make an offer, nor could another make it a proposition by calling it a proposition. The plaintiff\u2019s letter, purporting to accept a proposition by the defendant, was itself but an offer, and could only become part of an agreement through acceptance by the defendant. Harvey v. Facey [1898] App. Gas. 552. Moreover, the plaintiff had kept negotiations from passing a preliminary stage by failing to furnish particulars about the stability of the mortgage according to request, which request he again disregarded after what he called the acceptance, and reproved his alleged employer as foolish for the requirement. The judgment should have been given to the defendant, and it should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">FREEDMAN, P, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b307-7\">LEYENTRITT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIuE\">(concurring). In my opinion, the correspon:</p>\n<p id=\"A7c\">dence between the plaintiff and the defendant, as detailed by Mr. Justice MacLEAN, established an agreement for the exchange of the defendant\u2019s farm for the property on East Ninety-Eighth street; and if the plaintiff had proven, to the satisfaction of the trial justice, employment by the defendant, or an express or implied promise on his part to pay brokerage to the plaintiff, the latter would have been entitled to recover. The plaintiff was, however, concededly the agent of the owner of the Ninety-Eighth street property, and on his behalf proposed an exchange to the defendant. The mere fact that the transaction was not in the nature of a sale, but involved an exchange, does not impliedly charge the defendant with any liability to compensate. The record fails to disclose any evidence of employment or of a promise to pay; hence the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
