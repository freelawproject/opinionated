Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">We first address Defendants\u2019 argument that the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress intercepted wiretap evidence. A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is ordinai\u2019ily reviewed under a mixed standard. <em>United States v. Garcia-Jaimes, </em>484 F.3d 1311, 1320 (11th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. June 11, 2007) (06-11863). Therefore, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of law to those facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Defendants contend that officers lacked probable cause to place the March 2004 wiretap on Dennard\u2019s cell phone because information in the affidavit used to support the wiretap was stale. According to Defendants, the 2004 wiretap application merely repeated information contained in an October 2003 application supporting a wiretap on the telephone of Oscar Knowles, who was one of Dennard\u2019s and Sills\u2019s co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">The district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. Although the March 2004 wiretap application relied on some events that occurred in 2003, the information provided in the application indicated that Dennard regularly purchased and sold cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>20 F.3d 445, 450-51 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cWhen reviewing staleness challenges we do not apply some talismanic rule which establishes arbitrary time limitations.... Because the affidavit alleged ongoing activity and a continuing relationship between coconspirators, the information was not fatally stale.\u201d); <em>United States v. Domme, </em>753 F.2d 950, 953 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cWhen criminal activity is protracted and continuous, it is more likely that the passage of time will not dissipate probable cause.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>In addition, the 2004 wiretap application was supported by information not provided in the 2003 application, including an analysis of Dennard\u2019s cell phone activity in January 2004 that showed many calls to a phone in Knowles\u2019s possession. <em>See United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that, even if an affidavit is stale, \u201csuch information is not fatal where the government\u2019s affidavit updates, substantiates, or corroborates the stale material\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). The affidavit supporting the March 2004 wiretap application contained sufficient information to establish probable cause; and the district court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">II. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We turn to Sills\u2019s arguments that the government presented insufficient evidence to support his convictions. Although \u201c[t]he sufficiency of the evidence ... is a question of law and is reviewed <em>de novo,\u201d </em>we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and make all inferences and credibility choices in the government\u2019s favor. <em>GarciaJaimes, </em>484 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">A. Possession with Intent to Distribute Cocaine</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">We first address Sills\u2019s argument that the government offered insufficient evidence to support his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Sills admits that law enforcement seized a large amount of cocaine and money from his house; but he contends that the government failed to show that he knew about this contraband. In addition, according to Sills, the evidence showed that he was present at a place where Knowles delivered drugs but did not show that Sills actually knew that a drug delivery had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">To convict a defendant under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the government must prove three elements: (1) knowledge; (2) possession; and (3) intent to distribute. <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1391 (11th Cir.1989). \u201cPossession can be actual or constructive and can be shown through direct or circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2155, 167 L.Ed.2d 882 (2007); <em>see also Poole, 878 </em>F.2d at 1392 (explaining that \u201c[c]onstructive possession need not be exclusive and can be proven circumstantially by ownership, dominion, or control over the premises on which the substance is located\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Upon searching Sills\u2019s residence, agents discovered seven kilograms of cocaine and approximately $195,000 in cash, most of which was hidden in shoe boxes in a bedroom closet. In addition, at trial, the government introduced recordings of several conversations between Sills and Knowles in which they discussed having or needing a particular number of \u201co\u2019clocks\u201d; and \u00e1 Florida Department of Law Enforcement Special Agent testified that \u201co\u2019clock\u201d was a reference to kilograms of cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">Although Sills asserted during his trial testimony that he was referring to video game systems and not cocaine during his conversations with Knowles and further contended that the cocaine and money found in his house did not belong to him, the jury was free to disbelieve this testimony. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201cthe jury, hearing the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>words and seeing his demeanor, was entitled to disbelieve his testimony and, in fact, to believe the opposite of what he said\u201d) (internal quotation and alteration omitted). Viewing the evidence\u2014including the large amount of cocaine and cash found hidden in Sills\u2019s home and the recorded conversations between Sills and Knowles using code-words for cocaine\u2014in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that Sills possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">B. Conspiracy to Distribute Cocaine</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Sills next contends that the government presented insufficient evidence of a single conspiracy to distribute cocaine. He asserts that the evidence instead demonstrated multiple conspiracies between different people with Knowles and that, by failing to show that he was aware of Knowles\u2019s activities with other conspirators, the government only presented evidence at trial of a \u201crimless wheel conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">To sustain a conspiracy conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the government must offer sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) an illegal agreement existed to possess with intent to distribute cocaine; (2) Sills knew of the agreement; and (3) Sills knowingly and voluntarily joined the agreement. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>313 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWe will not reverse a conviction because a single conspiracy is charged in the indictment while multiple conspiracies may have been revealed at trial unless the variance is (1) material <em>and </em>(2) substantially prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1347 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cThe arguable existence of multiple conspiracies does not constitute a <em>material </em>variance from the indictment if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational trier of fact could have found that a single conspiracy existed beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">In this case, the jury could have found that a single conspiracy existed. Each of the conspirators shared the common goal of buying and selling drugs with Knowles. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he finding of a single conspiracy is permitted where a \u2018key man\u2019 directs and coordinates the activities and individual efforts of various combinations of people.\u201d). And two co-conspirators testified that Knowles had drugs available for sale only after Sills had visited him. Sufficient evidence was presented to support Sills\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">C. Firearm Possession</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Sills also argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to show a nexus between the firearms found at his home and a drug trafficking crime. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">Here, Sills does not dispute owning the weapons and ammunition found at his home; and some of these guns were found in the room where almost $195,000 was hidden in a closet. In addition, seven kilograms of cocaine were found in Sills\u2019s home. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have determined that a nexus existed between the firearms and the cocaine. <em>See United States v. Molina, </em>443 F.3d 824, 829-30 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe nexus between the gun and the drag operation can be established by accessibility of the firearm, proximity to the drags or drug profits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is found.\u201d) (internal quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>We affirm Dennard\u2019s and Sills\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">. Although Defendants filed separate briefs in this case, they have adopted each other\u2019s arguments. But to the extent that Dennard attempts to adopt\u2014without additional briefing\u2014Sills's arguments that the government presented insufficient evidence to support Sills's convictions, we do not address Dennard's challenge. <em>See United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 963 n. 13 (11th Cir.1990) (declining to review defendant's challenge\u2014 raised by adopting the arguments of his co-defendants\u2014to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction because \"the fact-specific nature of an insufficiency claim requires independent briefing if we are to reach the merits\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-17\">. For example, a confidential informant identified Dennard as a weekly or bi-weekly source of supply of cocaine for Antoine Thomas; and the informant personally observed some of these drug transactions. In addition, the informant described Dennard\u2019s regular pattern of purchasing cocaine from Knowles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">. For example, during one of these conversations, Knowles asked Sills about a \"two o'clock\u201d; and Sills told Knowles that Sills had \"two, three, four, five o\u2019clock, whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
