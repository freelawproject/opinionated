On appeal, Shiflett\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues on appeal, but asking the court to review whether the district court erred in declining to apply the safety valve provisions pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(f) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). Shiflett has also filed a pro se supplemental brief, in which he makes a series of claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel and the adequacy of his Rule 11 hearing. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">Shiflett\u2019s first issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in failing to apply the safety valve provision and thereby exempt him from the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of sixty months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (2000). To qualify for sentencing under the safety valve provision, a defendant must meet all five criteria set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), and incorporated into USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 (a). The fifth requirement of the safety valve is that, before sentencing, \u201cthe defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan....\u201d USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 (a)(5). A defendant must make an affirmative effort to disclose to the Government everything he knows concerning the offense before he may be eligible for sentencing under the safety valve provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>sion. <em>United States v. Ivester, </em>75 F.3d 182, 184-85 (4th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant satisfied the safety valve requirements is a question of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>114 F.3d 429, 432 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The district court denied application of the safety valve on the ground that Shiflett had not been forthcoming about his dealings with the other individuals involved in the drug conspiracy. Shiflett contends that his omissions were the result of imprecise questioning and his \u201clack of understanding.\u201d However, as Shiflett concedes, the details of the debriefing sessions are not contained in the record and therefore cannot be reviewed on appeal. Furthermore, while Shiflett asserts that his lack of disclosure was the result of confusion, he has failed to present any evidence to counter the Government\u2019s contention that he was evasive in his answers. <em>See Ivester, </em>75 F.3d at 184-85. Therefore, we find the district court did not err in determining Shiflett failed to qualify for application of the safety valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Shiflett raises a number of claims relating to his counsel\u2019s performance. Allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion rather than on direct appeal unless the record conclusively demonstrates ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Such a claim cannot be fairly adjudicated on direct appeal when the appellant has not raised the issue before the district court and there is no statement from counsel on the record. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir.1991). We find there is no evidence in the record to support Shiflett\u2019s allegations. Therefore, we find Shiflett\u2019s claims must be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion rather than on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Shiflett also raises a number of claims regarding the adequacy of his Rule 11 hearing. Because Shiflett did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, we review any challenges to the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Shiflett alleges that the plea agreement led him to believe that the safety valve would be applied in his case and that the trial court failed to disabuse him of this notion during the Rule 11 hearing. However, the plea agreement stated that \u201cDefendant can argue for a two-level reduction of his sentence pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5C1.2,\u201d and that the Government was free to oppose such a reduction. Furthermore, the district court informed Shiflett of the mandatory minimum sentence of five years while noting that he could argue for a two-level reduction under the safety valve provision, which would also permit him to be sentenced below the mandatory minimum. Accordingly, Shiflett\u2019s claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Shiflett next claims that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was not properly notified of his rights and was under the influence of medication following surgery. For medication to render a defendant incompetent, his mental faculties must have been so impaired that he was \u201cincapable of full understanding and appreciation of the charges against him, of comprehending his constitutional rights, and of realizing the consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Truglio, </em>493 F.2d 574, 578-79 (4th Cir.1974) (internal quotation and citation omitted). When a district court is informed that a defendant is under the influence of medication, the court has a duty to make further inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competence to plead guilty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561, 564 (4th Cir.1999). When a defendant\u2019s answers raise a \u201cred flag\u201d regarding his mental state, the court must expand its inquiry to ensure that the plea is being made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Id. </em>at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Shiflett did not assert he was under the influence of medication at the time of the hearing; rather, he stated he had taken pain medication on the day before the hearing. In any event, the district court did inquire as to Shiflett\u2019s status, as he stated only that he was a \u201clittle sore\u201d and felt he was able to continue with the hearing. In contrast to <em>Damon, </em>none of the answers provided by Shiflett or his counsel raised any \u201cred flags\u201d regarding adverse effects on his mental state that may have resulted from the prior use of medication. <em>See Damon, </em>191 F.3d at 565. There is no indication from the Rule 11 colloquy that Shiflett did not understand his rights or the charges against him, and while Shiflett contends on appeal that he would not have pled guilty had he not taken the narcotics, he provides no support for this assertion. Accordingly, the district court did not err in its inquiry regarding Shiflett\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Shiflett also contends the court should have explained his rights under Rule 11 prior to inquiring as to whether he wished to enter a guilty plea and the Rule 11 colloquy failed to inform him that he had a right to \u201cpresent evidence.\u201d Shiflett apparently asserts the district court faded to comply with Rule 11(b)(1)(E), which requires that the defendant be informed of his \u201cright at trial to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, to be protected from compelled self-incrimination, to testify and present evidence, and to compel the attendance of witnesses.\u201d At the hearing, the district court informed Shiflett of his right to testify and to present and cross-examine witnesses. While the district court did not specifically mention the right to \u201cpresent evidence,\u201d Shiflett has not demonstrated that this minor omission affected his decision to plead guilty. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 532 (4th Cir.2002). Accordingly, Shiflett has failed to demonstrate that the district court plainly erred during the Rule 11 colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Shiflett\u2019s next claim is that the trial court was not aware of its authority pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to sentence him below the mandatory minimum even without application of the safety valve. However, the district court could not sentence Shiflett below the statutory mandatory minimum unless it first determined that he had met the requirements for the safety valve. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Shiflett\u2019s claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Finally, Shiflett claims the conspiracy charge is void because all of the other parties to the conspiracy were government agents. Shiflett asserts that Justin \u201cRandy\u201d Popielasz, who was identified in the information and the plea agreement as a member of the drug conspiracy, was a confidential government informant. However, this matter was addressed during the sentencing hearing. The Government explained that despite Shiflett\u2019s personal beliefs, Popielasz was not a government informant. While Shiflett persists in his allegation that Popielasz was serving as a government agent, there is no evidence in the record to support this contention. Accordingly, Shiflett\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Shiflett\u2019s conviction and sentence. Additionally, we deny Shiflett\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal as moot. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>ing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
