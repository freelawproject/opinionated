Broner, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal, with prejudice, of her amended complaint in which she alleged claims of employment discrimination based on race (African-American) and related claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Broner sued her prior employer, DeKalb County; Washington Mutual Bank; Shapiro &amp; Swertfeger, the law firm that represented Washington Mutual Bank; Jack Swertfeger, an attorney for Shapiro &amp; Swertfeger; William Linkous, also an attorney; Judge Glen Galbaugh, a state court judge who signed an order requiring Broner to pay rent into the court registry; First American Field Services; and Gail Gonzalez and Philip Hasty, employees of First American Field Services (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d). Her claims were based on the termination of her employment in May 2002, her subsequent contact with members of the Dekalb County Police Department concerning potential criminal trespass charges if she did not leave her job, and her subsequent filing of bankruptcy. The district court dismissed her amended complaint with prejudice, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), because it failed to allege any facts that, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>proven, would state a claim on which relief could be granted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a pleading contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d The complaint need only provide enough information to give a defendant fair notice of the plaintiffs claim and the grounds the claim is based on. <em>Seagood Trading Corp. v. Jerrico, Inc., </em>924 F.2d 1555, 1576 (11th Cir.1991). A district court may dismiss a case proceeding <em>in forma pawperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) at any time if it determines that the action is frivolous or fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, (ii). A claim is frivolous if it is \u201cwithout arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of an IFP complaint, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, for abuse of discretion. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003). We show leniency to <em>pro se </em>litigants, but will not serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel or rewrite a pleading in order to sustain an action. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">On appeal, Broner argues that her complaint should not have been dismissed because she alleged sufficient facts to support a finding of liability. With regard to the termination of her employment, the district court found that \u201cshe has not alleged a single fact which would support a finding that Defendants Linkous and De-Kalb County knew or should have known that her termination was based upon any improper reason(s) or purpose(s).\u201d Moreover, the district court found that, other than alleging that she was African-American and some defendants were white, Broner \u201chas not alleged a single fact to support her claimed civil rights violations.\u201d The district court also determined that Broner failed to allege any facts in support of her claims that Washington Mutual and its attorneys violated any bankruptcy, fair housing, or debt collection statutes. The district court ultimately concluded that \u201cPlaintiffs amended complaint does not allege facts which, if proven, would support her claims.\u201d Accordingly, the court dismissed her civil action with prejudice, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Broner then filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, a notice of appeal, and a motion to proceed IFP on appeal. The district court denied her motion to file an amended complaint, because the action was already dismissed with prejudice, and, in any event, Broner\u2019s appeal divested the district court of jurisdiction over the case. The court likewise denied Broner\u2019s motion for IFP status, finding that she had not presented any non-frivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">Broner then moved to proceed IFP with this Court. We denied leave, finding this appeal to be frivolous, and denied her motion for reconsideration. For the reasons stated in the district court, including that Broner has failed to allege <em>any </em>fact that could potentially lead to liability under any of the statutes on which she relies, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding her complaint frivolous and did not err in finding that it failed to state a claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, her complaint was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>properly dismissed with prejudice, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1070-16\">. Broner asserted that the Defendants engaged in a mass conspiracy to violate her civil rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1988. She also asserted claims against Washington Mutual Bank, Shapiro &amp; Swertfeger, Jack Swertfeger, William Linkous, Glen Galbaugh, and Philip Hasty for violating the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\u201d), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq.; </em>the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 <em>et seq.; </em>the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 <em>et seq.; </em>the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 <em>et seq.; </em>the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 <em>et seq.; </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831n(2)(A); and O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 44-7-52 and 44-7-58. Broner stated separate claims against DeKalb County and William Linkous for violations of the Bankruptcy Code; 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a) of the FCA; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-3 and 2000e-2(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1988; and unspecified portions of the FHA. Broner sued Gail Gonzalez for violations of the FCA, the FDCPA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">. Although not the basis for the district court\u2019s analysis, we observe that Broner previously filed an unsuccessful suit against De-Kalb County, in which she asserted the same claims. <em>See </em>Rl-14 at Exh. A; CM/ECF for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, No. 1:03cv3877, doc. 31. Her appeal from that case was unsuccessful. <em>See Broner v. DeKalb County, </em>Appeal No. 06-11108 (11th Cir. Apr. 13, 2006) (order dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>missing appeal in part, remanding in part, and directing that case is closed). To the extent Broner has already litigated the claims arising out of her termination with DeKalb County, her attempt to reassert these claims is barred by the law of the case doctrine. See <em>This That and the Other Gift and Tobacco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cobb County, Georgia, </em>439 F.3d 1275, 1283 (11th Cir.2006) (discussing the law of the case doctrine).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
