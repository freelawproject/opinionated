Terry argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from a storage unit pursuant to a warrantless search and that the district court erred by not considering the disparity in the 100:1 cocaine to crack ratio in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-28\">\u201cThe denial of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. We must defer to the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous, but we are to review the district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Fernandez, </em>58 F.3d 593, 596 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cTo have standing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>challenge a search, one must manifest a subjective expectation of privacy in the invaded area that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. The individual\u2019s expectation, viewed objectively, must be justifiable under the circumstances. The individual challenging the search beai\u2019s the burdens of proof and persuasion.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>133 F.3d 1394, 1398 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Terry failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that he had a reasonable expectation of a right to privacy in storage unit C-4, the storage unit which was searched, as that unit did not belong to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">We find meritless Terry\u2019s argument that the district court was obliged to consider the crack-to-cocaine ratio in sentencing. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1366-67 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Accordingly, Terry\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
