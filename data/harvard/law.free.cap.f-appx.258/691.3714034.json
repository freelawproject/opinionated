He contends that he was entitled to a safety-valve sentence below the statutory minimum because he truthfully provided the Government with information about the crime. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The district court did not commit clear error by finding that Castaneda made inconsistent statements to the Government about the number of smuggling trips he made and was thus not completely truthful in his disclosures to the Government. Castaneda failed to show that he was entitled to the safety valve reduction. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 433 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Castaneda also contends that he should have received a downward departure from the advisory sentencing range because he participated in the criminal activity under duress. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12. This contention is moot because Castaneda cannot avoid the statutory minimum sentence by way of the safety valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
