In his petition, he argues that he is confined illegally because the speedy-trial waiver he executed prior to trial was invalidated by <em>Zedner v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 489, 126 S.Ct. 1976, 164 L.Ed.2d 749 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The proper vehicle for attacking errors that occurred during or before sentencing is a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, however, if a prisoner can demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d he may be permitted to bring a habeas corpus claim pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001) (emphasis removed). The savings clause applies to a claim that is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Carbe fails to show that <em>Zedner, </em>which was decided in the context of a direct appeal, applies retroactively or that it rendered any offense of conviction \u201cnonexistent.\u201d Thus, he has failed to demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedies were ineffective and inadequate. The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Carbe\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel, for bail pending appeal, and to supplement the record are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
