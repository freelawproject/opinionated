California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Verastegui-Zapata has been deported and has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED in part as frivolous and in part as moot. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b690-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
