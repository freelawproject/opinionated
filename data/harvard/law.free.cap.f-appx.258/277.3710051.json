We find no error in the BIA\u2019s order; therefore, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-15\">In 1995, Pereira, a native and citizen of Brazil, was served with an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing for having overstayed her nonimmigrant visa, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). In March 1996, she received written notice that a hearing on her asylum claim would be held in August in Boston, Massachusetts. Pereira failed to appear at that hearing and was ordered removed <em>in abstentia. </em>She then filed a motion to reopen, arguing that, in July, she had moved from Massachusetts to Sunrise, Florida; had notified the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) of her address change; and had requested a change of venue to Miami, Florida. The IJ granted the motion and reopened Pereira\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-16\">In March 1997, written notice was sent to Pereira\u2019s Sunrise, Florida, address that her asylum hearing would be held in Miami in July. Pereira again failed to appear and was ordered removed <em>in abstentia. </em>In March 2001, Pereira filed a motion to reopen claiming that she had not received notice of the hearing; her motion was accompanied by a change of address form indicating that she had moved from Pompano Beach, Florida, back to Hyannis, Massachusetts. The IJ denied the motion, finding that Pereira had received notice of the hearing. Notice of the denial was sent to Pereira\u2019s Sunrise, Florida address.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">Mailing from an address in Deerfield Beach, Florida, Pereira filed another motion to reopen in March 2002, indicating that there had been \u201cno response\u201d to her 2001 motion. The IJ denied this second motion as time and numerically-barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pereira appealed the denial of her 2002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>motion to the BIA, which upheld the IJ\u2019s denial in July 2003. The BIA\u2019s decision was mailed to the Pompano Beach address Pereira had provided to the INS in May 2003. In June 2006, Pereira filed the instant \u201cMotion to Reconsider\u201d with the BIA, arguing that she was entitled to equitable tolling on the motion because she had been unaware of the BIA\u2019s July 2003 decision until recently, as her \u201cimmigration advisor\u201d\u2014whose Lighthouse Point, Florida, address had also been listed on Pereira\u2019s May 2003 address change form\u2014had failed to inform her of the decision. The BIA considered Pereira\u2019s motion as both a motion to reconsider<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a motion to reopen and denied the motion. Peira now appeals this decision, again asserting a claim of equitable tolling based on her immigration advisor\u2019s \u201cfraud.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">As an initial matter, the Government contends that we lack jurisdiction to review the relevant order because the motion was filed outside the statutory filing deadlines for motions to reconsider and to reopen, relying on <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (stating that 90-day deadline for motions to reopen is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore it is not subject to equitable tolling\u201d), and <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1278-79 (11th Cir.1999) (stating that 180-day statutory time limit on motions to reopen in connection with <em>in abstentia </em>deportation orders was \u201cjurisdictional and mandatory\u201d). But these statements from <em>Abdi </em>and <em>Anin </em>are more properly regarded as dicta: we did not dismiss those cases for lack of jurisdiction, but instead concluded in both cases that the BIA\u2019s denial of an untimely-filed motion to reopen was no abuse of discretion. <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150; <em>Anin, </em>188 F.3d at 1278. Moreover, reading the statutory filing deadline as jurisdictional in the strict sense of the term would directly conflict with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), which grants the BIA discretion to reopen any case at any time <em>sua sponte. </em>Thus, we do not lack jurisdiction to review Pereira\u2019s motion to reconsider or to reopen simply because it was untimely.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Turning then to the merits of Pereira\u2019s petition, we review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider or to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1145 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Here, Pereira did not move to reopen or for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s July 2003 decision for almost three years, well beyond the 90-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>day period for filing a motion to reopen, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and the 30-day period for filing a motion for reconsideration, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). And we have no occasion to decide whether to recognize equitable tolling of these deadlines, because Pereira\u2019s claim for such relief is meritless: the administrative record shows that the BIA\u2019s July 2003 decision was served on Pereira at her Pompano Beach address\u2014not the Lighthouse Point address of her \u201cimmigration advisor.\u201d Given these facts, we cannot say that the BIA\u2019s denial of Pereira\u2019s motion was arbitrary or capricious. We therefore deny Pereira\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-18\">. With some exceptions not applicable here, an alien may file one motion to reopen a final administrative order of removal, which must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">.

Pereira\u2019s brief also attacks the validity of the prior orders in her case, including her <em>in abstentia </em>removal and the denial of her other motions to reopen. Those orders were not listed in the notice of the appeal and are not properly before us in this appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b307-11\">. Every other circuit to consider this question has similarly determined that the statutory filing deadlines for motions to reopen are not jurisdictional, but are more analogous to statutes of limitations. <em>See, e.g., Borges v.
