In that order, the Board construed Tamrat\u2019s \u201cMotion to Reconsider,\u201d denied by the immigration judge, as a motion to reopen and dismissed the appeal on the ground that the new evidence was not \u201cmaterial, previously unavailable,\u201d or specific to her claimed fear of persecution. The Board\u2019s order also denied Tamrat\u2019s \u201cMotion to Reopen and Remand\u201d as numerically barred under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-26\">In her brief on appeal, Tamrat challenges only the Board\u2019s denial of her second motion. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Tamrat\u2019s \u201cMotion to Reopen and Remand.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2007); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (standard of review of denial of motion to reopen). We therefore deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re Tamrat, </em>No. A97-745-429 (B.I.A. Jan. 17, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"AHJ\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-16\"> D.F., the son of Tamrat\u2019s common law husband, is listed as a rider in the amended petition for review. However, D.F. does not meet the definition of a child under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(b)(1) (West 2005 &amp; Supp.2007), and so cannot be a derivative beneficiary of Tam-rat's application. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A) (West 2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.21(a) (2007). Further, D.F. raised no issues concerning his own application with the Board or in this court. Therefore, he is entitled to no relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
