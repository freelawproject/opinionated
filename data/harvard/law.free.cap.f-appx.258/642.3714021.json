Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), action as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. Cardona contends that he had a First Amendment right to correspond with a prisoner in another institution whom he purported to represent as a next friend in that other prisoner\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 action. Cardona did not establish his status as a next friend in the other prisoner\u2019s proceeding, <em>see Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 164, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990); <em>Magallon v. Livingston, </em>453 F.3d 268, 271 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2974, 165 L.Ed.2d 981 (2006); his First Amendment claim rests on a flawed factual premise. Moreover, Cardona has no general First Amendment right to communication with prisoners in other prison units. <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 91, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-25\">Cardona\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-26\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Cardona\u2019s action and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). The district court\u2019s dismissal and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal in <em>Cardona v. Tuite, </em>No. 07-30041, 2007 WL 4371967 (5th Cir. Dec. 10, 2007) (unpublished), also count as two strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Id. </em>As Cardona has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-27\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b670-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
