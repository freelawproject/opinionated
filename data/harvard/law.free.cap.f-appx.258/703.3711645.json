The district court construed the motion for judicial review as a successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and denied the motion because Sangs failed to obtain our certification of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-18\">The government does not make a jurisdictional challenge, but we must consider this court\u2019s and the district court\u2019s jurisdictional basis. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). The district court has jurisdiction to correct or modify Sangs\u2019s sentence in limited circumstances under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b) and (c). The applicable provision here permits jurisdiction if the government moves to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under Fed. R.CrimP. 35(b)(1). The court has jurisdiction when this motion is made more than one year after sentencing if the defendant has substantially assisted the government by providing \u201cinformation not known to the defendant until one year or more after sentencing\u201d; information that was provided within one year of sentencing that did not become useful until more than one year after sentencing; or information that the defendant could not have reasonably anticipated to be useful until more than one year after sentencing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(2)(A)-(C); <em>see also United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-21\">The district court has jurisdiction to review a government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35 motion only where the defendant has made a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that the government has refused based on an \u201cunconstitutional motive.\u201d <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>63 F.3d 381, 389 n. 6 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-22\">Sangs\u2019s motion for judicial review was \u201can unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain\u201d because \u201chis motion and situation do not fit any provision\u201d of the Rule. <em>Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142. Sangs did not make a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d of \u201cunconstitutional motive\u201d that might have permitted the district court to review the Government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number><em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Accordingly, we affirm on the alternate grounds that the district court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
