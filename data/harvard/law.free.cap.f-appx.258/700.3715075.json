He contends that the district court erred in determining that he had an aggravated role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) because he did not manage or supervise the stowaways.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-21\">Cardona did not provide any rebuttal evidence to refute the information in the presentence report (PSR), nor did he demonstrate that the information was materially untrue. Thus, the district court was free to adopt the information in the PSR as its findings without further inquiry or explanation. <em>See United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996). Further, the majority of the information in the PSR was obtained directly from the factual basis which Cardona signed. At the plea hearing, Cardona confirmed that he understood the factual basis and that it was factually correct. Although Cardona argues that he did not know the stowaways, that the stowaways did not know him, that he was never at the location of the ship or on the ship itself, and that he had no contact with the stowaways, he admitted that his name was on a piece of paper found on one of the stowaways and that he and his co-conspirators were headed toward the ship in order to collect and distribute the cocaine. Moreover, by his own admission, Cardona organized the importation of 128 and 150 kilograms of cocaine in April and June of 2004. Therefore, the district court\u2019s determination that Cardona was a manager or supervisor and that the criminal activity was extensive is plausible in light of the record as a whole, and Cardona has not shown clear error. <em>See United States v. Fullwood, </em>342 F.3d 409, 415 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Cardona also contends that the district court erred when it denied him a safety valve reduction pursuant to \u00a7 5C1.2. Specifically, he argues that the district court\u2019s determination that he was not eligible for a safety valve reduction was based on its erroneous conclusion that he was a manager or supervisor under \u00a7 3B 1.1(b). Because the district court did not clearly err in determining that Cardona was a manager or supervisor under \u00a7 3B1.1(b), Car-dona was ineligible for a safety valve reduction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(4). Therefore, Cardona has not shown clear error. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Further, Cardona contends that the district court erred when it denied him an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1(b). Because the Government did not file a motion under \u00a7 3El.l(b), Cardona did not qualify for the additional one-level reduction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1(b); \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Finally, Cardona contends that the district court erred when it denied his request for a downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.0 or, alternatively, a downward variance in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Cardona does not argue that the district court denied his request for a downward departure because it believed erroneously that it had no authority to depart. Therefore, this court does not have jurisdiction to review Cardona\u2019s argument that the district court erred when it denied his request for a downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.0, and his appeal is dismissed as to this issue. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>263 F.3d 436, 440 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">To the extent that Cardona invokes the district court\u2019s authority under \u00a7 3553(a), he effectively argues that the sentence was unreasonable under the standard announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The record reflects that the district court considered Cardona\u2019s request for a downward variance, the recommendations of the presentence report, the applicable guideline range, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because the district court exercised its discretion to impose a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range, the sentence was presumptively reasonable, and this court may infer that the district court considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-70, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Cardona has failed to demonstrate that the district court clearly erred in exercising its broad sentencing discretion by imposing a sentence that failed to account for sentencing factors entitled to significant weight, gave significant weight to improper or irrelevant factors, or represented a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED in part and DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b728-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
