He contends that our rulings giving a presumption of reasonableness to guidelines sentences effectively reinstate mandatory guidelines sentencing and render his sentence unreasonable as a matter of law. Salazar-Garcia\u2019s arguments concerning this court\u2019s presumption of reasonableness are foreclosed by both this court\u2019s caselaw, <em>see United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006), and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-27\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Salazar-Garcia challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
