Armendariz concedes that this issue is foreclosed, but he nevertheless seeks to preserve it for Supreme Court review in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). As Armendariz concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See Brieva-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 356, 360-61 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Galvan-Rodriguez, </em>169 F.3d 217, 219-20 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Armendariz also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b695-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
