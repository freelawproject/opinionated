(\u201cBanyan\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Banyan on Plaintiffs complaint alleging that her termination was (i) based on unlawful sex discrimination, in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, et seq; (ii) in retaliation for exercising her rights to take leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601, et seq; and (iii) in response to her complaints of unlawful conduct by Banyan, in violation of the Florida Whistleblower\u2019s Act, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 112.3187.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgt. Co., </em>246 F.3d 1305, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). We \u201cmust draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,\u201d and we \u201cmay not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2110, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (addressing standard for granting Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 judgment as a matter of law which is the same standard applied under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56). Summary judgment is due to be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>r\u00edes, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). A party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing no genuine issue of fact is in dispute, <em>see Eberhardt v. Waters, </em>901 F.2d 1578, 1580 (11th Cir.1990); and the party opposing summary judgment must show more than a \u201cmere scintilla of evidence\u201d to survive and support a jury question. <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The facts are set out in some detail in the district court\u2019s exhaustive opinion. Stated very briefly, Banyan provides aviation services and is regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d). After her most recent promotion in the Spring of 2004, Plaintiff served as Avionics Operations Manager, a position whose chief responsibility was to oversee the accuracy of the Avionics Department\u2019s work orders. Plainitff had no budgetary responsibilities and no contracting responsibilities. In her position as Avionics Operations Manager, Plaintiff reviewed for accuracy the work of two male employees who did have budgetary and contracting responsibilities. According to Plaintiff, each of these men objected to a woman reviewing his work and showed his resentment by treating her differently than he would a male colleague. Plaintiff complained to her superiors about her perceived ill treatment and sex discrimination. Plaintiffs layoff by Banyan, she contends, was a termination in retaliation for complaining about sex discrimination. Plaintiff also took sick leave which she asserts was leave protected under the FMLA; her layoff, she asserts, was in retaliation for exercising her FMLA rights. And Plaintiff claims that she refused to cooperate with\u2014and complained about\u2014a fellow employee\u2019s evasion of an FAA required drug test; her termination, she contends, was in retaliation for her complaints and violated the Florida Whistleblower\u2019s Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The district court concluded that Plaintiff failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case on each of the counts charged. Although concluding that no <em>prima facie </em>case had been established under Title VII, the Florida Civil Rights Act, FMLA or the Florida Whistleblower\u2019s Act, the district court concluded also that\u2014assuming establishment of a prima facie case\u2014Plaintiff failed to proffer sufficient evidence that Banyan\u2019s contended justification for terminating Plaintiff was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Plaintiff argues she proffered sufficient evidence of mendacity to raise a jury issue on whether Banyan\u2019s stated grounds for terminating Plaintiff\u2014Banyan\u2019s elimination of the position due to financial difficulties\u2014was pretextual. Citing <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), Plaintiff contends that her <em>prima facie </em>case, combined with evidence from which a jury could conclude that Banyan\u2019s asserted justification was false, was sufficient to defeat summary judgment and to permit a jury to decide that Banyan acted unlawfully. Plaintiff points to record evidence that Banyan (i) misrepresented to the EEOC that certain employees had been laid off when they actually were terminated; (ii) failed to correct these errors once they were found; (iii) inadequately investigated charges that an employee evaded required drug testing; (iv) delayed in reporting to the FAA non-compliance with required drug testing; and (v) singled Plaintiff out for layoff when other layoffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>had involved multiple employees and failed to offer Plaintiff another position.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Our review of the summary judgment record as a whole, <em>see Reeves, </em>120 S.Ct. at 2110, confirms the view of the district court: Plaintiffs purported evidence of mendacity fails to create a triable issue of pretext.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the light of the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence of Banyan\u2019s financial difficulties and downsizing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff proffered\u2014at most\u2014a mere scintilla of evidence in her effort to challenge Banyan\u2019s legitimate non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory financial reasons for terminating Plaintiffs employment. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (\u201cThe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d). Banyan\u2019s summary judgment motion was due to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-12\">. The district court order also denied Plaintiff's cross motion for summary judgment on her FMLA and Florida Whistleblower's Act claims. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint included also equal pay and hostile work environment claims. Plaintiff makes no challenge to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on these claims; appeal of these issues is deemed abandoned. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (issues not argued on appeal are deemed waived; passing reference in an appellate brief is insufficient to raise an issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">. Consideration of the pretext issue is only required if a plaintiff has established first a <em>prima facie </em>case. We will assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Plaintiff established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII, the FMLA, and the Florida Whistleblower\u2019s Act. We proceed in this manner because the district court addressed the pretext issue, and Plaintiff claims that <em>Reeves </em>error \"permeated the district court\u2019s ruling on all counts.\u201d As we explain, we see no <em>Reeves </em>error; in reaching the pretext issue, we imply no error in the district court's conclusion that Plaintiff failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case on the asserted counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-23\">. The record discloses that the Avionics Department had net income of $556,003 for the fiscal year ending July 2003; that figure plunged to $72,158 for the fiscal year ending July 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
