Mungo and Robert Byrd also pled guilty to possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). Mungo was sentenced to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, Steven Byrd was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Robert Byrd was sentenced to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but contending (1) the district court wrongly classified Mungo as a career criminal; (2) the district court failed to comply with the requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in accepting Steven and Robert Byrd\u2019s guilty pleas; (3) the district court did not properly calculate Robert Byrd\u2019s advisory guideline range; and (4) the district court\u2019s sentence for Robert Byrd was unreasonable. The Defendants were advised of their right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so, and the Government elected not to file a responsive brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">Mungo questions whether he was properly classified as a career offender because the drug conspiracy began prior to when he committed the acts underlying his prior convictions. Section 4B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides that a defendant should be classified as a career offender when (1) the defendant is over eighteen, (2) the instant crime is a felony that is a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">Mungo only challenges whether his other felony convictions were \u201cprior\u201d to his conviction for the drug conspiracy. The drug conspiracy began in January 1997 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>and continued through September 2005. To establish that Mungo was a career offender, the district court relied on felony convictions Mungo sustained in 1998 and 2002. In so doing, the district court properly determined that because the conspiracy continued after Mungo was convicted for the other offenses, those convictions can properly be considered \u201cprior felony convictions\u201d for purposes of categorizing him as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Elwell, </em>984 F.2d 1289, 1298 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Steven and Robert Byrd question whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in conducting their guilty plea hearings. Reviewing their records for plain error, we conclude the district court conducted a thorough inquiry pursuant to Rule 11. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Lastly, Robert Byrd contends that his sentence is unreasonable, but he offers no basis for this contention. The record shows the district court appropriately calculated the advisory guideline range and considered it in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). Robert Byrd\u2019s sentence, which is well within the applicable Guidelines range and the statutory maximum, is therefore reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined Defendants\u2019 respective records and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We also deny Robert Byrd\u2019s motion to deconsolidate his case from Steven Byrd\u2019s and Mungo\u2019s appeals. This court requires that counsel inform their respective clients, in writing, of their right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If any Defendant requests that such a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
