Because the factual findings of the ALJ are supported by substantial evidence and the legal conclusions of both the ALJ and the Board are consistent with applicable law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Noble Morgan (Morgan), a former coal miner, died on July 7, 1999, at the age of 61. During his years of employment with the coal mines, Morgan engaged primarily in underground work as a roof bolter, working in dusty conditions. He also worked as a carpenter for several years, and then later as a security guard for a coal mine, where he was not exposed to a significant amount of coal dust. Morgan filed two applications for black lung benefits during his lifetime, the first in 1973 and the second in 1997. Both of Morgan\u2019s claims for living black lung benefits were denied by the District Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Two years prior to his death, Morgan was diagnosed with colon cancer. Although he was treated for the cancer and underwent chemotherapy, the medical evidence reflects that at some point prior to his death, the cancer may have metastasized to his spine and possibly other areas, as well. Additionally, the record reflects that Morgan suffered from congestive heart failure and smoked tobacco for more than forty-five years at the rate of a pack of cigarettes or more per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Morgan\u2019s death certificate lists his immediate cause of death as \u201clobar pneumonia\u201d and indicates that an autopsy was performed of the \u201clung only.\u201d J.A. 92. The autopsy report was issued by Dr. Alex Racadag on July 12, 1999, five days after Morgan\u2019s death. Based on his examination of Morgan\u2019s lung tissue, Dr. Racadag rendered a diagnosis of \u201cacute bronchopneumonia and lobar pneumonia,\u201d \u201cmild simple coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis with focal emphysema\u201d and \u201cpleural adhesions,\u201d noting simply, as a \u201ccomment,\u201d that these conditions \u201cprobably contributed to the patient\u2019s morbidity and subsequent demise.\u201d J.A. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">On July 29, 1999, petitioner, Morgan\u2019s surviving spouse, filed a timely claim for survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act. On October 4, 1999, the District Director denied petitioner\u2019s claim for survivor\u2019s benefits. Petitioner then requested a formal hearing before the Office of Administrative Law Judges and a <em>de novo </em>hearing was eventually held before an ALJ on February 28, 2002. On August 27, 2002, following the presentation of evidence and the submission of written closing arguments, the ALJ denied petitioner\u2019s claim for black lung survivor\u2019s benefits. J.A. 352-73. The ALJ\u2019s August 27, 2002 decision included a lengthy description of Morgan\u2019s work and medical history, as well as a detailed summary of the medical evidence in the administrative record, including chest x-rays, pulmonary function studies, arterial blood gas studies and various physicians\u2019 reports. In the end, the ALJ found that petitioner had established the existence of legal pneumoconiosis on the basis of chest x-ray and certain medical opinion evidence, but concluded nonetheless that petitioner had failed to establish that the pneumoconiosis caused, substantially contributed to, or hastened Morgan\u2019s death, a required element for entitlement to survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act. J.A. 368-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Petitioner sought review of the ALJ\u2019s August 27, 2002 decision, arguing essentially that the particular medical opinions relied on by the ALJ to support his causa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>tion conclusion could carry little or no weight given that these physicians did not diagnose Morgan with pneumoconiosis, as did the ALJ. Thus, on September 12, 2003, the Board remanded petitioner\u2019s claim to the ALJ for further consideration in light of <em>Scott v. Mason Coal Co., </em>289 F.3d 263 (4th Cir.2002), wherein we recognized that when a medical opinion is in \u201cdirect contradiction\u201d to the ALJ\u2019s finding that a miner suffers from pneumoconiosis arising out of his coal mine employment, the ALJ can give weight to that opinion only if he provides specific and persuasive reasons for doing so, and even then, the opinion can \u201ccarry little weight, at the most.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">On remand, and by Order dated February 12, 2004, the ALJ again denied petitioner\u2019s request for survivor\u2019s benefits, concluding, as before, that petitioner was unable to sustain her burden of proving that pneumoconiosis caused or contributed to Morgan\u2019s death. J.A. 410. In reaching this result, the ALJ relied primarily on the causation opinions of four physicians, namely Dr. Everett F. Oesterling, Dr. P. Raphael Caffrey, Dr. Stephen T. Bush and Dr. Samuel V. Spagnolo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically responding to the concerns expressed by the Board in their remand order, the ALJ found, <em>inter alia, </em>that these four physicians had diagnosed symptoms consistent with, and therefore not in direct contradiction to, the AL J\u2019s finding of legal pneumoconiosis and thus, that their opinions could be relied on under <em>Scott. </em>J.A. 408-10. A brief summary of these four physicians\u2019 findings illustrates this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">First, Dr. Oesterling, a pathologist board-certified in anatomic and clinical pathology as well as nuclear medicine, reviewed Morgan\u2019s autopsy slides and medical records. He found the \u201cmost significant aggregate of mine dust deposition\u201d in Morgan\u2019s lung tissue to be approximately 0.5 millimeters in greatest dimension, a size \u201cnot sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of coalworkers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d J.A. 206-07. Dr. Oesterling reported that he observed \u201climited black pigment contained within a loose matrix of pink fibers\u201d in the lung tissue; he also identified \u201cabundant numbers of elongate birefringent silica crystals,\u201d noting specifically that \u201cthe dust is indeed of coalmine origin.\u201d J.A. 207. He nonetheless opined that \u201c[d]espite the presence of this mine dust, the quantities are insufficient to warrant more than a comment that these lungs demonstrate anthracotic pigmentation.\u201d J.A. 207. Noting the presence of pneumonia and emphysema in Morgan\u2019s lungs, Dr. Oesterling found those conditions attributable to Morgan\u2019s long-time cigarette use rather than to his exposure to coal dust. He further concluded that the extensive pneumonia that led to Morgan\u2019s death was caused by congestive heart failure, cancer, and the resultant therapies associated with cancer. Finally, and particularly relevant here, he concluded that \u201cthe limited structural change [in the lungs] due to mine dust exposure could have in no way hastened or contributed to [Morgan\u2019s] death.\u201d J.A. 209. Put differently, Dr, Oesterling concluded that \u201cmine dust exposure could not have produced lifetime disability nor could it have in any way contributed to or accelerated [Morgan\u2019s] death.\u201d J.A. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Dr. Caffrey, also a board-certified pathologist, observed a \u201cmoderate amount of anthracotic pigment with a few tiny hilanized nodules\u201d when examining the autopsy slides of Morgan\u2019s lung tissue. J.A. 186. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>He likewise observed \u201csome bireMngent particles present\u201d in the lung tissue, noting that \u201cthe changes on the left side are very minimal\u201d and that \u201cin the lymph node tissues there is only a small amount present.\u201d J.A. 186. Dr. Caffrey further noted that \u201c[tjhere is only a very minimal amount of anthracotic pigment present and most of this is subpleurally located with a very minimal amount around a few blood vessels and respiratory bronchioles.\u201d J.A. 187. He stated definitively that he did not see \u201cany anthracotic pigment with associated reticulin deposits and focal emphysema.\u201d J.A. 187. Thus, he concluded that \u201c[t]here is no evidence of silicosis within the lung tissue, there is no evidence of complicated pneumoconiosis, and there is no evidence of simple coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis either in my opinion.\u201d J.A. 187. On this issue, he specifically stated, <em>inter alia, </em>the following: ,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">It is my opinion ... that Mr. Noble Morgan definitely did not have coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis or any other occupational lung disease. I say this because there is only a very minimal amount of anthracotic pigment within the sections of lung tissue. I definitely do not agree with the Autopsy Pathologists\u2019s diagnosis of mild simple worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis and I definitely do not agree with ... Frances H.Y. Green\u2019s diagnosis of simple coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis of mild severity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">J.A. at 189. Dr. Caffrey concluded that \u201cthe minimal amount of anthracotic pigment, coal dust, found in [Morgan\u2019s] lungs definitely did not cause him pulmonary or respiratory impairment and did not cause him any disability nor did it play any role in, or hasten, his death.\u201d J.A. 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Dr. Bush, a board-certified anatomical and clinical pathologist, likewise acknowledged the presence of coal mine dust in Morgan\u2019s lung tissue, but concluded that \u201cthe degree of change from coal mine dust in the lungs is too limited in degree and extent to have any contribution to the events leading to death.\u201d J.A. 198. He further concluded that \u201c[t]he coal dust deposited in the lungs of Mr. Morgan produced no barrier to lung function and therefore could not have hastened death by any means including a contribution to hypoxemia.\u201d J.A. 198. In reaching these conclusions, Dr. Bush noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">[t]he reports of the autopsy prosector [Dr. Racadag] and Dr. Green exaggerate the microscopic changes in the lung related to dust deposition. In addition, they exaggerate the effects of these proposed changes on lung function. They incorrectly force a theory of causation. Mr. Morgan died as a result of carcinoma and its complications, a straightforward and unfortunately common event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5GO\">J.A. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Finally, Dr. Spagnolo, a board-certified physician in internal medicine and pulmonary disease, concluded that Morgan\u2019s death was \u201ca direct result of his invasive and metastatic cancer in association with complications related to cancer chemotherapy, i.e. bronchopneumonia, lung fibrosis and probable sepsis.\u201d J.A. 128. While Dr. Spagnolo acknowledged that Morgan experienced symptoms of \u201ccoughing, wheezing and sputum production,\u201d he attributed these symptoms to Morgan\u2019s long-term cigarette smoking. <em>Id. </em>He also attributed Morgan\u2019s \u201cexertional chest pain, two-pillow orthopnea and ankle edema\u201d to his underlying coronary artery disease. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Spagnolo concluded that Morgan had no \u201cpulmonary/respiratory impairment attributable to pneumoconiosis or related to his prior coalmine employment\u201d and that \u201c[n]one of his symptoms, complaints, or medical conditions is related to his coal dust exposure or coalmine employment.\u201d J.A. 129. He further found that there was \u201cnot sufficient evidence in the lung tissue to justify a diagnosis of coal workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>pneumoconiosis.\u201d J.A. 134. On the basis of his review, Dr. Spagnolo concluded that \u201cMorgan\u2019s death was unrelated to and not hastened, even briefly, by pneumoconiosis nor was pneumoconiosis a contributing factor in his death.\u201d J.A. 129. Alternatively, Dr. Spagnolo opined that even assuming Morgan had some degree of pneumoconiosis, any such \u201cdust-related lung disease was far too limited to have contributed to or hastened ... death.\u201d J.A. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Based primarily on the causation opinions of Drs. Oesterling, Caffrey, Bush and Spagnolo, the ALJ concluded that while Morgan\u2019s legal pneumoconiosis had been established for purposes of the Act, petitioner had not sustained her burden of proving this condition caused or hastened Morgan\u2019s death as required for petitioner to be entitled to black lung survivor\u2019s benefits. J.A. 410. Petitioner\u2019s claim was therefore denied by the ALJ on remand, by Order dated February 12, 2004. J.A. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Following the ALJ\u2019s second denial of petitioner\u2019s claim for black lung survivor\u2019s benefits, petitioner again appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Board. This time, the Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits, finding specifically that the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cis supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.\u201d J.A. 449. Petitioner then filed a timely appeal of the Board\u2019s March 30, 2005 Decision and Order to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">We review the Board\u2019s decision upholding the ALJ\u2019s denial of survivor\u2019s benefits to petitioner to determine whether the Board correctly found that the ALJ\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Bill Branch Coal Corp. v. Sparks, </em>213 F.3d 186, 190 (4th Cir.2000). To do so, we review the record independently, assessing the ALJ\u2019s findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 267. In this regard, \u201c[s]ubstantial evidence consists of sufficient relevant evidence to convince a reasonable mind that the evidence is adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Thus, applying this standard, \u201cwe must affirm the Board if it properly determined that the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Doss v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>53 F.3d 654, 659 (4th Cir.1995). We review the ALJ\u2019s and the Board\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo. See Scott v. Mason Coal Co., </em>60 F.3d 1138, 1140 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">The regulatory standards applicable to petitioner\u2019s claim are clear. Specifically, to be entitled to survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act, a petitioner must establish that the coal miner\u2019s death was \u201cdue to pneumoconiosis\u201d in accordance with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205. In this regard, for purposes of adjudicating survivors\u2019 claims filed, as here, on or after January 1, 1982, death is considered to be \u201cdue to pneumoconiosis\u201d if any of the following criteria are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">(1) Where competent medical evidence establishes that pneumoconiosis was the cause of the miner\u2019s death, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">(2) Where pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to the miner\u2019s death or where the death was caused by complications of pneumoconiosis, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">(3) Where the presumption set forth at \u00a7 718.304 is applicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c). Thus, the regulations expressly provide that \u201csurvivors are not eligible for benefits where the miner\u2019s death was caused by a traumatic injury or the principal cause of death was a medical condition not related to pneumoconiosis, unless the evidence establishes that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of death,\u201d that is, if the pneumoconiosis \u201chasten[ed] the miner\u2019s death.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">For purposes of the Act, \u201cpneumoconiosis\u201d means \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a). This definition includes both the medical, or \u201cclinical\u201d definition of pneumoconiosis, as well as the broader statutory definition of \u201clegal\u201d pneumoconiosis. <em>Id.; see also Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 210 (4th Cir.2000). In this regard, the term \u201clegal pneumoconiosis\u201d includes, but is not limited to, \u201cany chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the phrase \u201carising out of coal mine employment\u201d includes \u201cany chronic pulmonary disease or respiratory or pulmonary impairment significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(b). Given this, it is clear, for example, that \u201ca medical diagnosis finding no coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis is not equivalent to a legal finding of no pneumoconiosis,\u201d as the legal definition of pneumoconiosis set forth in \u00a7 718.201 is significantly broader than the medical definition of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. <em>Hobbs v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>45 F.3d 819, 821 (4th Cir.1995). Indeed, legal pneumoconiosis, unlike medical or clinical pneumoconiosis, \u201calso encompasses \u2018diseases whose etiology is not the inhalation of coal dust, but whose respiratory and pulmonary symptomatology have nonetheless been made worse by coal dust exposure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>373 F.3d 570, 577 (4th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Fuller, </em>180 F.3d 622, 625 (4th Cir.1999)). In other words, legal pneumoconiosis has \u201ca broad definition, one that effectively allows for the compensation of miners suffering from a variety of respiratory problems that may bear a relationship to their employment in the coal mines.\u201d <em>Rose v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>614 F.2d 936, 938 (4th Cir.1980). Legal pneumoconiosis \u201cincludes, for example, emphysema, asthma, and chronic bronchitis, if triggered by coal mine employment.\u201d <em>Dante Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>164 Fed.Appx. 338, 341 n. 2 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">These principles, applied to the administrative record at issue here, compel the conclusion that the ALJ\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s claim for survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act' was supported by substantial evidence and must be affirmed. And, significantly, although petitioner contends the ALJ erred in relying on the opinions of Drs. Oesterling, Caffrey, Bush and Spag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>nolo, given that these physicians did not explicitly diagnose Morgan with pneumoconiosis\u2014legal or otherwise\u2014it is clear the ALJ\u2019s reliance on these opinions was entirely proper and consistent with <em>Scott </em>and its progeny. Indeed, unlike the situation contemplated in <em>Scott, </em>this is not a case where the doctors relied on by the ALJ \u201copined that [Morgan] did not have legal or medical pneumoconiosis, did not diagnose any condition aggravated by coal dust, <em>and found no symptoms related to coal dust </em>exposure.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 269 (emphasis added). Instead, all four of these physicians \u201cfound symptoms consistent with legal pneumoconiosis,\u201d including, for example, emphysema, coughing, wheezing, and the undisputed presence of coal dust in Morgan\u2019s lung tissue. <em>Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 269; <em>see supra </em>Part I. Thus, because Drs. Oesterling, Caffrey, Bush and Spagnolo did not premise their causation opinions on an \u201cerroneous finding\u201d contrary to the ALJ\u2019s finding of legal pneumoconiosis, and because them respective medical findings did not necessarily contradict the ALJ\u2019s finding of legal pneumoconiosis, the ALJ did not err in relying on those physicians\u2019 opinions with respect to the issue of causation. <em>See Hobbs, </em>45 F.3d at 821; <em>Dehue Coal Co. v. Ballard, </em>65 F.3d 1189, 1195 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In the end, the medical opinions relied on by the ALJ provide more than substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Morgan\u2019s legal pneumoconiosis did not contribute to or hasten his death in accordance with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c). <em>Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 267. Put differently, the opinions of Drs. Oesterling, Caffrey, Bush and Spagnolo constitute \u201csufficient relevant evidence to convince a reasonable mind that the evidence is adequate to support\u201d the ALJ\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s claim for black lung survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act. <em>Id. </em>For this reason, the ALJ\u2019s February 12, 2004 decision must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\">. The ALJ either discounted or rejected the opinions of several other physicians, including Dr. Racadag, Dr. Francis H.Y. Green, Dr. Richard Naeye, Dr. Erika Crouch, Dr. Gregoiy Fino, Dr. James R. Castle, Dr. Mohammed Ranavaya, Dr. D.L. Rasmussen and Dr. Edward Velasco.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\">. It is undisputed that this presumption does not apply here.
