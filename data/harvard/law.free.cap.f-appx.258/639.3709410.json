De La Vega appeals following a jury verdict in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-20\">De La Vega argues that the district court erred in refusing to allow him to introduce at trial a grievance form he submitted following the attack by his cellmate. He contends that defendant Jesus Rodriguez responded to the grievance in a way that would tend to impeach his trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-21\">A review of the record shows that De La Vega did not make a proffer of what the grievance would have shown. Because De La Vega failed to make an offer of proof as to the excluded evidence, he cannot show error. <em>See Young v. City of New Orleans, </em>751 F.2d 794, 797 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Mills v. Levy, </em>537 F.2d 1331, 1333 (5th Cir.1976); Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
