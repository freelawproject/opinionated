Pfeilmeier pled guilty to one count of bank robbery by force and violence, or by intimidation, and placing the life of another person in jeopardy through the use of a dangerous weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d) (2000). Pfeilmeier was sentenced to ninety months\u2019 incarceration. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-20\">On appeal, Pfeilmeier challenges the presumption of reasonableness this court affords <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentences imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), however, forecloses this argument. <em>See also United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-42 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-24\">While Pfeilmeier concedes that his sentencing guidelines range was correctly calculated, he contends that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence within the guidelines range was still unreasonable. First, Pfeilmeier-asserts that the presumptively reasonable nature of the Sentencing Guidelines forced the district court to give the guidelines undue weight in comparison to the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007). However, the district court followed the appropriate sentencing procedure, as the court first calculated the proper guidelines range and then considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Furthermore, this court has noted that sentences within the guidelines range are presumptively reasonable because most of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are already incorporated into their calculation. <em>See Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 342-43. Accordingly, Pfeilmeier\u2019s claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Pfeilmeier also argues that application of the guidelines in his case is unreasonable in light of his severe and chronic health problems, as he suffers from depression, substance abuse, and a degenerative spinal condition. However, the district court heard argument on this issue and explicitly noted that it had considered Pfeilmeier\u2019s personal history and characteristics, including his substance abuse issues, and that the sentence took into account the defendant\u2019s need for medical care. Therefore, because the district court properly calculated and considered the advisory guidelines range and weighed the relevant \u00a7 8558(a) factors, we conclude Pfeilmeier\u2019s sentence, which was below the statutory maximum and within the advisory guidelines range, is reasonable. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 455-56; <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Pfeilmeier\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-19\"><em> United States v.
