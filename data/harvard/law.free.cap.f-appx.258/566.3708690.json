In No. 06-2312, he challenges the Board\u2019s decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In No. 07-1137, he challenges the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider. We deny both petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-23\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for asylum relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Essalam fails to show the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-24\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Essalam\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>holding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [ (2000) ].\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Essalam fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In No. 07-1137, we have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Essalam\u2019s motion to reopen and reconsider. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2007); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (standard of review of denial of motion to reopen); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481, 482-83 (4th Cir.2006) (standard of review of denial of motion to reconsider). We therefore deny this petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>In re Essalam, </em>No. A96-451-623 (B.I.A. Jan. 30, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-17\"> Essalam does not challenge on appeal the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture. We therefore find that he has waived appellate review of this claim. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
