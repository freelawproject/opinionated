Gena was named in a forty-four count indictment arising out of his operation of a tax return preparation business called \u201cTax Doctors,\u201d in Columbia, South Carolina.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The indictment charged that, between 2000 and 2004, Gena aided and assisted in the preparation of fraudulent tax returns for the tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. The Government presented evidence establishing that Gena prepared at least twenty-six tax returns claiming dependent exemptions and earned income tax credits which the taxpayer/clients were not entitled to claim. Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Gena on all twenty remaining counts. The district court sentenced him to twenty-seven months imprisonment. Gena noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-22\">Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 1999, a \u201cqualifying child,\u201d for purposes of the Earned Income Tax Credit includes \u201can eligible foster child of the taxpayer.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c)(3)(B)(i)(III). An \u201celigible foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>child\u201d means an individual who \u201cis placed with the taxpayer by an authorized placement agency\u201d and \u201cthe taxpayer cares for as the taxpayer\u2019s own child.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c)(3)(B)(iii). Gena argues that the term \u201cauthorized placement agency\u201d is not defined in the relevant sections of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, the statute is unconstitutionally vague. Our review of the legislative history of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 reveals that the term \u201cauthorized placement agency\u201d means a state agency or one of its subdivisions or a tax-exempt child placement agency licensed by the state. We also find that the plain meaning of the statute would not include within its definition of \u201celigible foster child\u201d a taxpayer\u2019s fianc\u00e9, boyfriend, girlfriend, roommate, siblings, parents or grandparents\u2014each of which were claimed as foster children on the returns prepared by Gena.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Gena also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. To obtain a conviction under I.R.C. \u00a7 7206(2), the government must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: \u201c(1) the defendant aided, assisted, or otherwise caused the preparation and presentation of a return; (2) that the return was fraudulent or false as to a material matter; and (3) the act of the defendant was willful.\u201d <em>United States v. Aramony, </em>88 F.3d 1369, 1382 (4th Cir.1996) (internal citation omitted). We find that the evidence presented by the Government supported Gena\u2019s convictions. The Government established that Gena personally prepared at least twenty-six tax returns, each containing materially false information. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to support an inference of willfulness. Gena personally interviewed his clients and therefore knew, or should have known, that the individuals he listed as foster children on their returns did not qualify as such for purposes of the earned income credit. Accordingly, we affirm Gena\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-13\"> All but twenty counts were dismissed on motion of the Government prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
