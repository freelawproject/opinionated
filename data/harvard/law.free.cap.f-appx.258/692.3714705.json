After the district court dismissed her claim, Daniel filed a \u201cmotion for reconsideration,\u201d which the district court denied. Although Daniel appealed both the district court\u2019s final judgment and its denial of her motion, we are concerned now only with the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">According to Daniel, she worked for defendant Hoecht Marion Roussel (HMR) until 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, she complained to the EEOC of race and sex discrimination by HMR, and in 2001, filed a civil rights complaint against HMR, which the district court dismissed on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">Daniel eventually became concerned as to how HMR was relaying her employment history to potential employers. Therefore, she had Donald Branda, a private investigator, call HMR to verify the dates of her employment in 2004. Daniel alleges that the HMR employee with whom Branda spoke gave incorrect dates for her terms of employment and cast aspersions upon her. She also alleged that Biovail Corporation, an \u201caffiliate\u201d of HMR, conspired with HMR by conditioning a potential job on her signing a waiver of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-17\">In March 2006, Daniel sued defendants alleging civil rights violations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended. She alleged that HMR\u2019s providing inaccurate information about her employment history, and its conspiracy with Biovail, were in retaliation for pursuing her earlier civil rights case. The district court dismissed her suit for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>because, under circuit precedent, Daniel had to \u201cshow that [HMR] denied her an opportunity because of her previous complaint and that their actions prevented her from getting another job.\u201d Because Branda\u2019s phone call was not related to an actual job opportunity, the court concluded that Daniel could not meet her burden. The court also explained that the comments allegedly made by the HMR employee to Branda were not discriminatory, the individual defendants were not subject to liability because they were not her employers, and that Biovail and HMR are not generally affiliated entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The district court entered final judgment on June 21, 2006. The next day the Supreme Court decided <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which adopted a different standard for \u201cadverse employment action\u201d than was then being used in the Fifth Circuit. On July 11, Daniel filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to \u201cany and all applicable federal rules [including Rule 60(b) ],\u201d arguing that the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Burlington Northern </em>when it dismissed her claim and that the district court either misunderstood or ignored evidence that she presented. The district court denied her motion without explanation on July 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Daniel filed a notice of appeal on August 11, appealing both the district court\u2019s final judgment and its denial of her motion for reconsideration. A previous panel of this court dismissed Daniel\u2019s appeal of the final judgment because she failed to timely appeal it;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Daniel did timely appeal the court\u2019s ruling on her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">This appeal concerns only the denial of Daniel\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Because Daniel filed the motion more than ten days after the entry of judgment, it is deemed' a Rule 60(b) motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is unclear under which provision of Rule 60(b) Daniel believes she is entitled relief; however, liberally construing her motion and brief, we perceive enough of an argument that we cannot say she abandoned her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cBy its very nature, the rule seeks to strike a delicate balance between two countervailing impulses: the desire to preserve the finality of judgments and the \u2018incessant command of the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in light of all the facts.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This, though, \u201cis not to say that final judgments should be lightly reopened. The desirability of order and predictability in the judicial process calls for the exercise of caution in such matters.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-16\">As to her evidentiary arguments, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion. The district court\u2019s decision turned not on a decision as to which of the factual scenarios were true, but only on the grounds that the allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>discriminatory acts of defendants could not support a legally viable claim. The court properly assumed all relevant facts to be true, and the court did not err by explaining some of the factual allegations defendants contested. To the extent Daniel alleges newly discovered evidence under Rule 60(b)(2), that provision is not applicable because the evidence could have been timely discovered or was already alleged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And, to the extent Daniel argues that defendants\u2019 recitation of the evidence was inaccurate and thus fraud upon the court,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that is not fraud but only a factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Nor can we say that the district court abused its discretion in declining to revisit the judgment in light of <em>Burlington Northern. </em>The only provision of Rule 60(b) relevant to this claim is subsection (6), which allows relief for \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d \u201cRelief under this section, however, is appropriate only in an \u2018extraordinary situation\u2019 or \u2018if extraordinary circumstances are present.\u2019 Moreover, \u2018[a] change in decisional law after entry of judgment does not constitute exceptional circumstances and is not alone grounds for relief from a final judgment.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Other than the change in decisional law, the only circumstance to foot a claim for Rule 60(b)(6) relief upon is Daniel\u2019s promptness in filing her motion. While diligence is a factor in analyzing Rule 60(b)(6) requests,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is not enough here to overcome the general rule that changes in decisional law are not exceptional circumstances. In <em>Garibaldi, </em>the district court granted Rule 60(b)(6) relief in similar circumstances\u2014a judgment was entered and the Supreme Court subsequently changed the applicable decisional law;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in other words, the district court there did what Daniel asked the district court here to do. In fact, in <em>Garibaldi, </em>the judgment from which Rule 60(b) relief was being sought gave rise to an opinion from this court that helped to create the circuit split that justified the certiorari review that led to the change in decisional law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Yet we reversed, concluding that the district court abused its discretion because those were not extraordinary circumstances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>A fortiori, </em>the district court here did not abuse its discretion in denying Daniel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
