Fowler argues that the district court erred in construing his \u00a7 2241 petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and that his claims fall within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 because <em>Zedner v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 489, 126 S.Ct. 1976, 164 L.Ed.2d 749 (2006), should apply retroactively to cases on collateral review; because he is actually innocent of possessing crack rather than powder cocaine; and because his claim was foreclosed at the time of his trial and direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">A \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be considered only where the petitioner establishes that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255; <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). To show that \u00a7 2255 was rendered inadequate or ineffective in his case, Fowler must show that his claim (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\"><em>Zedner </em>dealt with issues relating to the Speedy Trial Act. 126 S.Ct. at 1985-90. Because <em>Zedner </em>does not establish that Fowler was convicted of a nonexistent offense, we need not determine whether <em>Zedner </em>is retroactive or whether Fowler\u2019s claim was foreclosed when he filed his prior \u00a7 2255 motion or direct appeal. Fowler has not met the requirements for proceeding under the savings clause. The judgment of the district court dismissing Fowler\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
