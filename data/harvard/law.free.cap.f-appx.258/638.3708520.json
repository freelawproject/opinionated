To the extent Gilkey is attempting to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judicial review, Gilkey\u2019s appeal from that order, docketed in Case No. 06-11319, has been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Gilkey did not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s adverse ruling before the district court, and there is no evidence in the record that Gilkey consented to proceed before the magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1). Consequently, we dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. <em>See Gregg v. Linder, </em>349 F.3d 860, 862 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
