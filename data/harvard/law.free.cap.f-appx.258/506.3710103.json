For the following reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Mann filed an application for widow\u2019s insurance disability benefits and supplemental security income benefits. The applications were denied and reconsideration was denied. Mann requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). After a hearing, the ALJ denied Mann\u2019s applications and the Appeals Council denied her request for review. Mann filed a complaint in the district court against the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cCommissioner\u201d), alleging that the Commissioner\u2019s conclusions and fact findings were not supported by substantial evidence and were contrary to law and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">The magistrate judge determined that the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and recommended the ALJ\u2019s decision be affirmed. The district court declined to adopt the magistrate judge\u2019s report, determined that the ALJ failed to follow the regulations and erred in discounting the opinions of Drs. Baker and Hunter, and reversed the Commissioner\u2019s decision and remanded the case to the ALJ for further proceedings. After the case was remanded to the ALJ, Mann filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The district court denied the motion for attorney\u2019s fees, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-15\">[t]he court\u2019s decision to reverse and remand for additional proceedings was based on its finding that the ALJ failed to provide valid reasons for discrediting Dr. Hunter and Dr. Baker\u2019s opinions and failed to properly evaluate Mann\u2019s residual functional capacity. While the court found that the ALJ\u2019s analysis was incorrect, the Commissioner\u2019s position was not unreasonable or inconsistent with established authority. Because the Commissioner\u2019s position was substantially justified, the court denies Mann\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">The EAJA provides that, in actions brought by or against the United States, attorney\u2019s fees shall be awarded to the other party if it prevails, unless the United States\u2019 position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d or special circumstances make an award unjust. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1). It is the government\u2019s burden to demonstrate that its position was substantially justified. <em>Crawford v. Sullivan, </em>935 F.2d 655, 658 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>(4th Cir.1991). A district court\u2019s determination that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 557-59, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). For a position to be substantially justified, it must be \u201cmore than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness,\u201d it must be justified to a degree as to satisfy a reasonable person. <em>Id. </em>at 565-66, 108 S.Ct. 2541.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We conclude that the district court erred by not providing an explanation for its conclusion that the Commissioner\u2019s position was substantially justified. <em>See Libas, Ltd. v. United States, </em>314 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir.2003) (explaining that for appellate review of an EAJA fee award, \u201cit is imperative that the court explain its rationale supporting its conclusion that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified\u201d); <em>Kerin v. United States Postal Serv., </em>218 F.3d 185, 193 (2d Cir.2000) (vacating EAJA fee award because the \u201clack of a clear explanation of the reasons for the fee award\u201d handicapped appellate review and remanding \u201cfor a thorough explanation of the reasons\u201d); <em>United States v. Hallmark Constr. Co., </em>200 F.3d 1076, 1081 (7th Cir.2000) (remanding denial of an EAJA fee award for \u201ca thorough explanation of the reasoning behind the district court\u2019s decision\u201d); <em>United States v. Eleven Vehicles, </em>200 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir.2000) (vacating EAJA fee award and remanding \u201cto the district court for an explanation of its reasons for the fee award\u201d). While the district court may be correct in its conclusion that the Commissioner\u2019s position was substantially justified, we cannot properly review the district court\u2019s decision without an explanation of how it reached that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
