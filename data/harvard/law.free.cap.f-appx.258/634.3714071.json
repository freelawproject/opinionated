By filing a motion for leave to proceed IFP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>on appeal in this court, Harrison is challenging the district court\u2019s certification, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Fed. R.App. P. 24(a), that his appeal is frivolous and is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Harrison\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for denying his civil rights claims and for certifying that his appeal is frivolous and not taken in good faith. Accordingly, Harrison has not made a meritorious challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of IFP status and has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(a). Harrison\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Harrison has accumulated at least two other strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Harrison v. Miller, </em>No. 2:05-CV-1325 (E.D.La. Mar. 10, 2006) (unpublished); <em>Harrison v. Miller, </em>No. 2:03-CV-3194 (E.D.La. Apr. 21, 2004) (unpublished). As Harrison has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
