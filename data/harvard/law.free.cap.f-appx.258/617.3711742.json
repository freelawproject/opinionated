The district court sentenced Alan to ninety-seven months in prison. Alan timely appealed. Alan\u2019s sole contention is that his conviction is invalid because, in finding that there was a sufficient factual basis to support Alan\u2019s guilty plea, the district court improperly relied on two pounds of sham methamphetamine (\u201cflex\u201d) found in Alan\u2019s car that he contends were placed there without his knowledge by a confidential informant during a reverse sting operation. Because he failed to raise this issue in the district court, we review Alan\u2019s claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">Under Rule 11(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a district court must find a sufficient factual basis to support a defendant\u2019s guilty plea before entering judgment upon that plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 652 (4th Cir.1997). The district court may rely on \u201canything that appears on the record\u201d to conclude that a factual basis exists. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">Contrary to Alan\u2019s contention, the district court found a factual basis for Alan\u2019s guilty plea before making any rulings on the flex. The court\u2019s rulings on the flex concerned the quantity of drugs for which Alan was responsible for purposes of sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>fencing rather than for purposes of establishing a factual basis for Alan\u2019s guilty plea. Moreover, our review of the record reveals that there was sufficient evidence in the record independent of the flex to establish a factual basis for Alan\u2019s guilty plea. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not plainly err in concluding that there was a sufficient factual basis to support Alan\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">For these reasons, we affirm Alan\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
