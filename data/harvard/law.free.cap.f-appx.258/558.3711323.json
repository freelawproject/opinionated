Cutlip argues the district court erred in failing to provide her the opportunity to allocute before sentencing and that her sentence is plainly unreasonable. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-17\">Cutlip first contends she was not given an opportunity to be heard prior to sentencing. Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(E) (2000), a defendant at a revocation hearing is entitled to \u201can opportunity to make a statement and'present any information in mitigation.\u201d The court gave Cutlip the opportunity to speak, and did so before the court imposed its sentence. Although the opportunity for Cut-lip to personally address the court was not granted at the precise moment she requested it, acceding to her request when she made it would have interrupted an ongoing colloquy between the court and her counsel. We therefore find Cutlip\u2019s claim to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-18\">Cutlip next argues her sentence was unreasonable. This court will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of probation if it is within the prescribed statutory range and is not plainly unreasonable. See <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). While the district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements and statutory requirements and factors applicable to revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583 (2000), the district court ultimately has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to revoke the previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-22\">The court first considers whether the sentence imposed on revocation falls within the applicable statutory maximum and, if so, the court then considers whether the sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 438-40. A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>court considered the advisory guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that it is permitted to consider in a revocation case. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. A sentence is substantively reasonable if the district court stated a proper basis for concluding that the defendant should receive the sentence imposed up to the statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>Only if a sentence is found to be unreasonable will this court decide whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 438-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">A sentencing court is presumed to have considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, unless otherwise indicated in the record, and it need not specifically address each factor. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006) (stating district court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record\u201d) (internal quotations and citation omitted); <em>United States v. Legree, </em>205 F.3d 724, 728-29 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Cutlip\u2019s sentence was within the advisory guidelines range of three to nine months based on her Grade C violations and did not exceed the five-year statutory maximum for her original offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3)(A) (2000). In imposing Cutlip\u2019s sentence, the district court stated it had considered \u201call of the statutory factors.\u201d The court thoroughly discussed during the revocation hearing and continuation hearing its reasoning for the sentence imposed. We find the nine month sentence, which was below the statutory maximum and within the non-binding guidelines range, was not unreasonable, let alone plainly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
