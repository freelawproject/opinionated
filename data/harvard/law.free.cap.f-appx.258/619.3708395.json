Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">After receiving information from a confidential informant that Ford was distributing crack cocaine from his home, the Fayetteville Police Department conducted controlled buys from Ford on August 25th and 30th, 2005. Two days later, on September 1, 2005, a search warrant was executed at Ford\u2019s home. During the search, Ford informed the officers that he had a small amount of marijuana and a .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol hidden in a bedroom. No cocaine or paraphernalia associated with drug distribution was discovered during the search. Ford was ultimately indicted for possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Prior to Ford\u2019s sentencing, the probation office prepared a presentence report. According to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 (a)(2), Ford had a base offense level of twenty-four. Ford\u2019s base offense level was increased four points pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) because the probation officer determined that Ford possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense\u2014the sales of cocaine on August 25th and 30th.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Ford then received a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in an offense level of twenty-five. Ford\u2019s criminal history category of IV and his offense level resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 84 to 105 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">Ford appeared for sentencing on April 25, 2007. At sentencing, Ford objected to the four point enhancement for possessing the firearm in connection with another felony. The district court overruled Ford\u2019s objection and sentenced him to eighty-four months\u2019 imprisonment. Ford timely noted his appeal and now argues that: (1) the district court erred in finding that he sold crack cocaine on August 25th and 30th and (2) the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\"><em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 </em>2K2.1(b)(6) provides <em>for </em>a four level enhancement if a defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). \u201cThe purpose of this enhancement is to ensure that a defendant receives more severe punishment if, in addition to committing a firearms offense within the scope of \u00a7 2K2.1, he commits a separate felony offense that is rendered more dangerous by the presence of a firearm .... \u201d <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 406 (4th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>165 F.3d 1032, 1037 (6th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court continues to make factual findings concerning sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert </em>denied,-U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 121, 166 L.Ed.2d 91 (2006). Long-standing authority has permitted a sentencing court to consider any evidence at sentencing that \u201chas sufficient indicia of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>reliability,\u201d <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 6A1.3(a), including \u201cconduct underlying [an] acquitted charge, so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 156-57, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>262 F.3d 233, 249 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">To apply an enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6), a district court must find both that (1) a firearm was used and (2) that such use was \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(5)). The district court\u2019s decision to enhance Ford\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">On appeal, Ford argues that the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement because the Government failed to prove that the predicate \u201cother felonies,\u201d namely cocaine distribution on August 25th and 30th, actually occurred. At sentencing, the Government proffered, without objection, the testimony of the case agent. According to the agent, Ford informed officers that he had purchased the firearm for protection, that he sold crack cocaine to pay for his rent and his marijuana, and that he sold crack cocaine from his home daily. Ford also admitted that he would purchase $50 of crack cocaine, cut it into rocks, and sell it. Finally, Ford admitted that he would repeat this process several times a day and that he tended to sell more on the weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Ford\u2019s counseled brief fails to take into account the testimony of the case agent at sentencing. As described, Ford gave the officer a detailed description of his method for selling cocaine, including how much he would purchase, how he would package the drugs, how often he resupplied, and the times he tended to sell more. Ford\u2019s confession, in conjunction with the information from the confidential source that Ford sold cocaine during the two controlled buys, established by a preponderance of the evidence two prior \u201cother felonies\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Ford also argues that his \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement was improper because the Government failed to prove he possessed the firearm in connection with the cocaine sales on August 25th and 30th. This court has analogized the \u201cin connection with\u201d language in \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) to the definition of \u201cin relation to\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>Garnett, </em>243 F.3d at 828; <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1003-04 (4th Cir.1996). In <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993), \u201cthe Supreme Court determined that the \u2018in relation to\u2019 language of \u00a7 924(c) could be satisfied by proving that a weapon facilitated or potentially facilitated the offense.\u201d <em>Nale, </em>101 F.3d at 1003. Additionally, this court, in the context of \u00a7 924(c), has stated that a firearm is used \u201cin relation to\u201d another felony offense \u201cif the firearm was present for protection or to embolden the actor.\u201d <em>United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Yet again, Ford\u2019s argument is undercut by his confession. Ford\u2019s home was searched just two days after the second controlled buy. At the time of his arrest, Ford admitted both to selling crack from his home daily and that he possessed the gun found in his home for protection. Thus, Ford\u2019s admission established by a preponderance of the evidence the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement, and the district court did not commit clear error in relying on <em>Blount </em>and <em>Lipford </em>to enhance Ford\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-10\"> USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) is the successor to \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(5); the text was redesignated, without change when the guidelines were amended in November 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
