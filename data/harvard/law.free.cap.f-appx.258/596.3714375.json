L.R. 45, we originally dismissed Washington\u2019s appeal for want of prosecution. Because Washington has shown good cause to excuse the late filing of her appellate brief and joint appendix, however, we recalled the mandate and granted her petition to reinstate her appeal by separate order. We have reviewed the record and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Washington v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>No. 2:05-cv-01949-DCN (D.S.C. filed Nov. 2, 2006; entered Nov. 3, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\"> Although Washington also asserted claims against the Defendant for wrongful termination in violation of South Carolina public policy and in violation of Defendant's anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>discrimination policy, Washington does not challenge the district court's dismissal of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
