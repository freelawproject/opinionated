BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b276-18\">On August 24, 2006, the United States Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d) boarded the Frutos del Mar, a Colombian fishing vessel, in international waters. Eight crew members, including the defendant, Jorge Asprilla, were on the vessel. The USCG arrested defendant Asprilla after discovering 105 bales of cocaine, weighing approximately 2,500 kilograms. Two co-defendants, Abel Rosero and Eri Ibarra-Salas, were identified as the vessel\u2019s captain and engineer, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">Defendant Asprilla pled guilty to both counts. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned him a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(e)(1), based on the amount of cocaine found on the vessel. The PSI recommended a two-level safety-valve reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(9), and a three-level acceptance-of-responsibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ity reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b), resulting in a total adjusted offense level of 33. Using a criminal history category of I, the PSI determined that Asprilla\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Asprilla filed an objection to the PSI, arguing that he should have received a mitigating-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. At sentencing, the district court overruled Asprilla\u2019s objection. The district court explained that Asprilla was being held accountable for only the cocaine discovered onboard the vessel and that, with the exception of the captain, Asprilla was as culpable as the rest of the vessel\u2019s crew. The district court noted that Asprilla\u2019s responsibilities included loading and unloading the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The district court sentenced Asprilla to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. Asprilla filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">On appeal, Asprilla argues that he should have received a mitigating-role reduction because he was merely a crew member on the vessel with no interest in or control over the cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The Guidelines provide for a downward adjustment of two to four levels based on a defendant\u2019s mitigating role in an offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. There is a \u201crange of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n.3. A defendant who is a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity is entitled to a two-level reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n.5. A defendant who is a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the criminal activity is entitled to a four-level reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a). A minimal participant is one who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable ... of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n.4. The defendant has the burden to establish his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction applies, the district court is guided by two principles: (1) the defendant\u2019s role in the offense compared to the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level; and (2) the defendant\u2019s role compared to that of other participants in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. \u201c[I]n the drug courier context ... the amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct ... [and] may be dispositive\u2014in and of itself\u2014in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. Additionally, \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">Here, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s refusal to give Asprilla a mitigating-role reduction was clear error. In calculating Asprilla\u2019s offense level, the district court held Asprilla accountable for only the cocaine found on the vessel. Thus, Asprilla\u2019s relevant conduct and his actual conduct are identical. Furthermore, the 2,500 kilograms of cocaine found on the vessel is a substantial amount of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">In addition, we cannot say Asprilla was substantially less culpable than the aver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>age participant in the importation scheme. Although Asprilla, as a member of the crew, may have been less culpable than the captain and perhaps the engineer, Asprilla was as culpable as the other five members of the crew, all of whom engaged in the same conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (explaining that it is possible that some conspiracies will have no minor or minimal participants). Asprilla\u2019s emphasis on his limited involvement in the larger drug smuggling operation is unavailing because he was held accountable only for the cocaine shipment found on the vessel on this one trip. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that the district court should compare the defendant\u2019s role only to the other identifiable participants in the relevant conduct and that \u201c[t]he conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in denying Asprilla\u2019s request for a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-13\">.
