Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984), he did not delay in filing his withdrawal motion, he did not have close assistance of counsel, and his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he erroneously thought he was going to be sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. However, although Zuniga did quickly file his withdrawal motion, none of the remaining <em>Carr </em>factors weighed in his favor. <em>See Carr, </em>740 F.2d at 343-44. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 370 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b685-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
