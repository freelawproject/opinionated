In that \u00a7 2241 petition, Morris argued that because her state and federal sentences should have run concurrently, she was entitled to a full credit against her federal sentence, and her supervised release term constituted an illegal extension of her sentence. Morris was released from Bureau of Prisons custody in July 2004 and completed her concurrent, three-year terms of supervised release during the pendency of this appeal. As a result, Morris\u2019s claims have been rendered moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278-79 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, this appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-21\">Morris has filed several habeas applications challenging her federal and state convictions and sentences, as well as numerous civil rights suits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In 2000, Morris was barred from proceeding in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). In 2006, Morris was barred from filing any documents or pleadings in the Western District of Texas without prior written consent of a United States District Judge or Magistrate Judge. Morris is warned that future repetitive or frivolous filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and further restrictions on her ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS MOOT; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
