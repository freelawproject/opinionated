Because the district court dismissed Bendavid\u2019s complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and also for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), our review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). Given Bendavid\u2019s failure to plead any injury arising out of the alleged denial of adequate pens and library time, as well as his demonstrated ability to file pleadings in this matter, the district court did not err in dismissing Bendavid\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373; <em>see Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">As Bendavid\u2019s brief fails to address the district court\u2019s dismissal of his other claims as improperly joined, those issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Thus, Bendavid\u2019s brief fails to raise any issue of arguable merit, and we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Bendavid\u2019s request for appointment of counsel is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The dismissal by the district court of Bendavid\u2019s suit and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387-88. In addition, Bendavid previously accumulated two strikes in <em>Molin v. Harris County Jail, </em>159 F. App\u2019x 584 (5th Cir.2005). As Bendavid has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\"> <em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
