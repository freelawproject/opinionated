Flores filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition to challenge his convictions and sentences, and the district court dismissed his petition. Flores fails to address the district court\u2019s determination that he was not entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241. Consequently, he has failed to show any error in connection with the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
