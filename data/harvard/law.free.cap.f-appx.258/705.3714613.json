Lewis argues that the district court abused its discretion in not allowing him to withdraw his plea and that, notwithstanding the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion to withdraw his plea, his conviction should be reversed because his plea was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">\u201cA district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 370 (5th Cir.2003). When determining whether to allow a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea, the district court should consider whether: (1) the defendant has asserted his innocence, (2) withdrawal would prejudice the Government, (3) the defendant has delayed in filing his withdrawal motion, (4) withdrawal would substantially inconvenience the court, (5) close assistance of counsel was available, (6) the original plea was knowing and voluntary, and (7) withdrawal would waste judicial resources. <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-22\">To enter a knowing and intelligent plea, the defendant must have \u201ca full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 244, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). \u201c[A]s long as the defendant understands the length of time he might possibly receive, he is fully aware of his plea\u2019s consequences.\u201d <em>James v. Cain, </em>56 F.3d 662, 666 (5th Cir.1995). A defendant\u2019s solemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of truth. <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">Lewis concedes that the first, second, third, fourth, and seventh Can* factors are either \u201cneutral\u201d in the <em>Carr </em>analysis or weigh against his being allowed to withdraw his plea. Moreover, contrary to Lewis\u2019s assertions, the record establishes that the fifth and sixth <em>Carr </em>factors weigh against his being allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lewis\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. <em>See Powell, </em>354 F.3d at 370. In addition, Lewis has not shown that his guilty plea was unknowing and involuntary such that his conviction should be reversed. <em>See James, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>56 F.3d at 666. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
