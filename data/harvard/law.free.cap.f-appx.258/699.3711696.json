Before ruling on the merits of the application, the district court issued an order construing the petition as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and transferring the case to another section within the court. Coleman appealed to this court from the denial of his motion for reconsideration of the order construing his petition as arising under \u00a7 2254; he moves this court for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the ruling on this interlocutory issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-20\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). The order denying Coleman\u2019s motion to reconsider the order construing his petition as arising under \u00a7 2254 and transferring the case to another section of the district court is a nonappealable interlocutory order. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1292(a), (b); <em>Brinar v. Williamson, </em>245 F.3d 515, 516-18 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Thomas v. Scott, </em>47 F.3d 713, 714-16 (5th Cir.1995). This court is without jurisdiction to consider Coleman\u2019s request for a COA. Accordingly, the motion for a COA is denied, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>COA DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
