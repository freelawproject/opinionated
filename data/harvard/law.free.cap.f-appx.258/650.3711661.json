The district court denied Martin\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Martin is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Martin\u2019s appellate pleadings address only his financial status and do not identify any error in the district court\u2019s rejection of his claims as frivolous. Therefore, Martin has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his appeal would be frivolous. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Martin\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Martin\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Martin also accumulated a strike in <em>Martin v. Good, </em>No. 95-CV-669 (W.D.Tex. Nov. 16, 1995). As Martin has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
