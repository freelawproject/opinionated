The Commission asserts that the district court erred when it denied its motions for judgment as a matter of law, as well as when it denied in part its motion in limine and overruled its evidentiary objections to exclude Dillon\u2019s post-termination evidence regarding her qualification for FMLA protection. Dillon has cross-appealed and asserts that the district court erred when it granted, in part, the Commission\u2019s summary judgment motion and dismissed her liquidated damages claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>and when it reduced the jury\u2019s backpay award. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We find that the district court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a thorough memorandum opinion explaining its denial of the Commission\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, properly determined that substantial evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict in Dillon\u2019s favor. <em>See Bryant v. Aiken Reg\u2019l Med. Ctrs. Inc., </em>333 F.3d 536, 543 (4th Cir.2003). Moreover, because it was Dillon\u2019s burden to establish that her leave qualified for FMLA protection, <em>see Yashenko v. Harrah\u2019s NC Casino Co., LLC, </em>446 F.3d 541, 549 (4th Cir.2006), the district court correctly found Dillon\u2019s post-termination evidence of which the Commission was unaware to be relevant under Fed. R.Evid. 401. The Commission\u2019s assertions to the contrary, we find that any prejudicial effect that this evidence may have had was significantly reduced by the district court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury to consider the post-termination evidence only in the context of determining whether Dillon\u2019s leave qualified for FMLA protection, and not whether the Commission violated the Act. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 603 (4th Cir.1998) (holding that we will not overturn a district court\u2019s Fed.R.Evid. 403 judgment \u201cexcept under the most extraordinary of circumstances, where a trial court\u2019s discretion has been plainly abused\u201d) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Francisco, </em>35 F.3d 116, 119 (4th Cir.1994) (\u2018We generally follow the presumption that the jury obeyed the limiting instructions of the district court\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the Commission summary judgment on Dillon\u2019s liquidated damages claim. <em>See Taylor v. Progress Energy, Inc., </em>493 F.3d 454, 459-60 (4th Cir.2007) (analogizing FMLA claims to Fair Labor Standards Act claims); <em>Mayhew v. Wells, </em>125 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir.1997) (holding that this court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of liquidated damages under the Fair Labor Standards Act for abuse of discretion). The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Commission considered the possibility that Dillon\u2019s request for leave constituted a request for FMLA leave and gave her several opportunities to clarify her relationship with her grandmother. Although the jury later found the Commission\u2019s determination that Dillon\u2019s leave was not FMLA-protected to be incorrect, the record establishes that the Commission reasonably believed Dillon\u2019s leave did not qualify for FMLA protection. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dillon\u2019s request for liquidated damages. <em>Cf. Roy v. County of Lexington, SC, </em>141 F.3d 533, 548-49 (4th Cir.1998) (upholding district court\u2019s denial of liquidated damages claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act where there was no evidence the defendant\u2019s actions were designed to circumvent the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Last, we find that the district court did not err when it amended the judgment reducing Dillon\u2019s backpay award to reflect the evidence presented by Dillon. <em>See State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Barton, </em>897 F.2d 729, 733 (4th Cir.1990) (\u201cNeither the existence, causation nor amount of damages can be left to conjecture, guess or speculation.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s final amended judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\">. The parties consented to the exercise of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction by a U.S. Magistrate Judge. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">. The Commission also summarily asserts that the district court erred in refusing to answer the jury\u2019s post-instruction question as to whether violating the Commission's merit rules constituted \"insubordination.\" We find that the district court appropriately directed the jury to make its own determination by relying on the district court\u2019s jury instruction defining \"insubordination.\u201d <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106. S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (\"Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
