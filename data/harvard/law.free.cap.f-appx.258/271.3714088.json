Gomez contends that his complaints about the performance of his court-appointed attorney, Mr. Julio Gutierrez, Esq., and Gomez\u2019s requests for substitute counsel created a conflict of interests for Gutierrez that prevented Gutierrez from adequately representing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). A defendant attempting to show a conflict of interest resulting in ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cmust show first, that his attorney had an actual conflict of interest, and second, that the conflict adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Pegg v. United States, </em>253 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis omitted). The conflict cannot be merely possible, speculative, or hypothetical. <em>Reynolds v. Chapman, </em>253 F.3d 1337, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2001). We will not find an actual conflict of interest unless a petitioner \u201ccan point to specific instances in the record to suggest an actual conflict or impairment of [his] interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1343 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Several evidentiary hearings were held on this matter and based on the record, we find no reversible error. We find merit-less Gomez\u2019s second argument that the district court improperly relied on two Second Circuit cases as binding authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
