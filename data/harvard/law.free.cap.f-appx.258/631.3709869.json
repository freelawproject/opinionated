Barnes contends that the defendants violated his right of access to the courts by denying him use of the prison law library, resulting in prejudice because he was unable to file a motion based on the Texas Speedy Trial Act, TexCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 (Vernon 1989), <em>declared unconstitutional by Meshell v. State, </em>739 S.W.2d 246, 257-58 (Tex.Crim. App.1987). Barnes also contends that he suffered actual injury because he was unable to litigate matters pertaining to a void bail jumping indictment and his other criminal proceedings. Barnes\u2019s motion for production of a transcript at government expense is denied. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-19\">Barnes has not demonstrated actual injury in connection with the defendants\u2019 actions. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Article 32A.02 was held unconstitutional by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. <em>Meshell, </em>739 S.W.2d at 257-58. Moreover, Barnes has not shown why a speedy trial challenge could not have been filed by his appointed counsel. Barnes was also represented by counsel in his other proceedings. A prisoner\u2019s constitutional right of access to courts may be satisfied through representation by counsel. <em>See Degrate v. Godwin, </em>84 F.3d 768, 768-69 (5th Cir.1996) (emphasizing that \u201cadequate assistance from persons trained in the law\u201d is sufficient). The dismissal of his complaint was not error. <em>See Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-20\">The dismissal of Barnes\u2019s complaint and the instant dismissal each count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Barnes is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
