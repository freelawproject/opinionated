Houston, for unemployment benefits under The Indiana Employment Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">The issue in this proceeding is whether or not the claimant\u2019s discharge was for misconduct in connection with his work. If it was, the claimant would be subjected to the limitations of unemployment benefits under the terms of Section 1501 of The Indiana Employment Security Act (Chapter 208, Acts of 1947, as amended by Chapter 261, Acts of 1957; Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes \u00a752-1539 (1964 Repl.)) which provides that an individual shall be ineligible for a portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>his benefit rights if he was \u201cdischarged for misconduct in connection with his work.\u201d The claimant received six written reprimands between August 3, 1965, and January 20, 1966, and was discharged for violation of the appellant\u2019s rule forbidding receipt of five or more written reprimands within one year on pain of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The claimant\u2019s application for unemployment benefits was heard by a deputy of The Indiana Employment Security Division. The deputy determined that the claimant was discharged for misconduct in connection with his work. The claimant requested a hearing before an appeals referee. The referee reversed the above determination, holding that the claimant was discharged, but not for misconduct in connection with his work, and that, if otherwise qualified, the claimant was entitled to benefits from the date of discharge. The appellant, American Steel Foundries, Inc., then appealed to the appellee Review Board, which affirmed the referee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The pertinent part of The Review Board\u2019s decision is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u201cIt further finds that the receiving of five reprimands cannot be held to be misconduct per se and it is incumbent on the employer, who has the burden of proof, to show that these reprimands were justified, i.e., to show that claimant\u2019s actions were in disregard of the best interests of the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">\u201cIt further finds that the employer failed to present any <em>firsthand evidence </em>concerning the validity of the charges contained in the reprimands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">\u201cThe Review Board concludes that the employer failed to sustain its burd\u00e9n of proof and show that claimant was discharged for misconduct in connection with his work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-10\">\u201cDECISION: The decision of the referee is hereby affirmed this 19th day of September, 1966\u201d. (Emphasis supplied) .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">The appellant asserts that the decision of The Review Board is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>At the hearing before the referee, the only evidence offered by the appellant was its Exhibit #1. This exhibit was a xerox copy of a letter that was issued to Mr. Houston on January 21, 1966, the date he was suspended, setting out the six reprimands for violation of various plant rules. The letter was signed by Mr. R. L. Duncan, Personnel Supervisor for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The appellant argues that The Review Board ignored this letter simply because it was not firsthand evidence; that the letter was competent evidence under the hearsay rule because its introduction was not objected to, that it comes within the \u201cbusiness records\u201d exception to the hearsay rule, and because The Review Board is not governed by the statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The appellant\u2019s main argument is that The Review Board completely failed to consider the letter as evidence and proof of the claimant\u2019s misconduct and that such refusal constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The appellee maintains that findings by The Review Board are ultimate findings of fact, and that this court can consider only the evidence most favorable to the decision of the Board; and that under these standards, the record fails to reveal error.</p>\n<p id=\"AHk\">We are of the opinion that the letter, standing alone and without the support of additional evidence, was not sufficient to prove misconduct on the part of the claimant, nor does the record presented to our court contain sufficient evidence upon which we could base a fair decision. Because of this fact, our court entered the following order on March 7,1968:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">\u201cCORRECTED ORDER REMANDING FOR ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">\u201cThis cause involves judicial review of a proceeding before The Review Board of The Indiana Employment Se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>curity Division to determine the eligibility of the claimant, Kenneth E. Houston, for unemployment benefits under The Indiana Employment Security Act, Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes, \u00a7 52-1539, <em>et. seq. </em>(1964 Repl.);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">\u201cAnd the Court, having heard the arguments of the parties and examined the record and briefs presented, finds that there is insufficient evidence of probative value on the issue of the alleged misconduct of appellee, Kenneth E. Houston, upon which this Court may base its decision, and this cause should be remanded for the taking of additional evidence, in accordance with Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes, \u00a7 52-1542k (1964 Repl.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201cIT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to The Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division for the taking of additional evidence before May 10,1968.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u201cSuch additional evidence shall be certified by The Review Board to the Appellate Court, to be used in the determination of this cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201cThe Clerk of this Court is directed to mail a copy of this order to counsel of record and all interested parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">\u201cDated at Indianapolis, Indiana, this, the 7th day of March, 1968.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">/s/ CHARLES W. COOK,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY7\">Presiding Justice\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">On the 8th day of May, 1968, the Employment Security Board, in accordance with the foregoing order, filed a transcript of additional evidence with our court.</p>\n<p id=\"AUF\">It is clearly demonstrated by an examination of the additional testimony given by the claimant\u2019s foreman, unit foreman, assistant general foreman, and personnel supervisor that he was guilty of repeated and direct violations of the appellant\u2019s published plant rules governing the conduct of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">From an examination of this additional evidence, and the law governing the discharge of an employee for disciplinary reasons, we are of the opinion that the decision of the Review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Board should be overruled and an order entered directing the Review Board to deny the petition for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The decision of the Review Board is overruled and the cause is remanded to The Review Board of The Indiana Employment Security Division with instructions to deny claimant\u2019s petition for benefits under The Indiana Employment Security Act pursuant to Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes, \u00a7 52-1539 (1964 Repl.).</p>\n<judges id=\"b53-6\">Cook, P.
