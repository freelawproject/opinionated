J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJMF\">This is an appeal from the Porter Circuit Court. The action below was one brought by the appellant as plaintiff against the appellees as defendants, to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien. The issues were formed by the appellant\u2019s amended complaint to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien filed for labor performed upon a certain dwelling of the appellees and the appellees\u2019 demurrer to the complaint. The court sustained the appellees\u2019 demurrer to each paragraph of the appellant\u2019s amended complaint and the appellant refused to plead over. Following such refusal, the court entered a judgment which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-12\">\u201cIT IS THEREFORE, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED by the court that the defendants, James R. Culveyhouse and Rita L. Culveyhouse, prevail in this action; that the plaintiff, Stanley Kolan, take nothing by this action; and that the costs of this action be taxed against the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Following the entering of the court\u2019s judgment, the appellant filed an assignment of errors which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201c1. That the Court erred in sustaining Appellees\u2019 Demurrer to Appellant\u2019s Amended Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That the Court erred in granting Appellees\u2019 Motion to Reconsider Ruling on Demurrer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\u201c3. That the Court erred in overruling Appellant\u2019s Motion to Strike all of Appellees\u2019 Motion to Reconsider a Ruling on Demurrer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In order for us to pass upon the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in sustaining the defendant-appellees\u2019 demurrer to the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s complaint, we must examine the language of the complaint, the demurrer and the statutes involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">A careful examination of the appellant\u2019s brief indicates that the complaint is set out therein, but it does not contain the demurrer and the memorandum in support thereof. Therefore, he has not complied with the provisions of Rule 2-17(e) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"AjaO\">It has been repeatedly held by the Supreme Court of Indiana and this court, that the appellant\u2019s brief should be sufficient so that each judge considering the brief alone, can intelligently consider each question presented. <em>Robinson v. State </em>(1916), 185 Ind. 119, 113 N. E. 306; <em>Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Mink </em>(1966), 138 Ind. App. 311 212 N. E. 2d 784; <em>Flex Let Corp. v. Vogel </em>(1962), 134 Ind. App. 495, 186 N. E. 2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"Afp\">The appellant, having failed to support Propositions 2 and 3, by cogent argument and citations of authorities, the same are waived since the brief does not comply with Rule 2-17, Rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-15\">For the reasons above set out, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-17\">Cooper, Faulconer, and Prime, J.J., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b536-18\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 241 N. E. 2d 375.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
