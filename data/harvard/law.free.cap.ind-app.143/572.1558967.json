The appellants initiated this action by filing with the Indiana Employment Security Board their individual protests to assessments and demands made upon them for payment of contributions as employers for the years 1961, through the third quarter of 1965, under the Employment Security Act. The appellants requested hearings on the protests and thereafter, by agreement of the parties, the hearings were consolidated and, held on November 26, 1966, before John C. Castelli, Liability Referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The appellants contended two points in their protests: First, that the drivers were not employees of the taxicab owners, within the meaning of the applicable statutes, but that in fact they were independent contractors; and second, that the 1961 contributions claimed were barred by the statute of limitations. .</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">The liability referee upon hearing the case, determined that each of the appellants was subject to make such contributions under the Act as assessed, and from this ruling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>appellants seek this review, asserting as error that such determination was contrary to law. The decision of the Liability Referee reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\"><em>\u201cDECISION OF THE LIABILITY REFEREE </em>Rendered on the 1st day of August, 1967</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkIp\">\u201cA protest was timely received from each of the above named parties to the Board\u2019s Notice and Demand for Payment of assessments, including interest and penalty, for the years 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Quarters of 1965 in the following amounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF3a\">\n<em>Notice &amp; Demand No. Total</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_sx\">Safety Cab, Inc. 22270 $17,206.90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnN\">Red Cab, Inc. 22271 7,323.29</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"All\">\u201cPursuant to notice to all interested parties, a hearing was set and evidence received at Indianapolis, Indiana on November 16, 1966, and by agreement of the parties thereat the above entitled matters were consolidated for the purpose of hearing such evidence and rendering a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajhq\">\u201cThe protesting employers entered an appearance by counsel, Mr. John C.

The protesting employers have a right to terminate the Lease Agreement if a driver disobeys any City Ordinance or is negligent in the performance of his duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">\u201cThe question of the status of the taxicab driver and the owner of the cab is one which was decided in Indiana by the Appellate Court in its decision <em>Carlos R. Young, d/b/a ABC Cab Company v. The Indiana Employment Security Board, </em>134 Ind. App. 263, 187 N. E. 2d 489. In that decision, which with one exception paralles [sic] the factual situation contained in the instant case, the. court recited- this language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">\u2018The statutory test to be applied to this factual situation is whether or not the drivers were \u201cfree from, control or direction over the performance of such service\u201d and whether they were \u201cengaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\u201d In applying the direction or control test we have previously stated that the common meanings should be given to such words. <em>News Publishing Co. v. Verweire </em>(1943), 113 Ind. App. 451, 49 N. E. 2d 161; <em>Alumiwall Corp. v. Ind. Emp. Sec. Board </em>(1960) 130 Ind. App. 535, 167 N. E. 2d 60. While some of the facts taken alone or in combination with some of the others might not sustain the conclusion that appellants exercised the necessary direction or control over the drivers, taken as a whole it seems plain that they did. They were required to charge according to fare schedule which was given them by the appellants, to account to the appellants at the end of each day as to the day\u2019s receipts, to furnish appellants with a trip sheet, to operate the automobile in a manner most efficient to the taxi business, and' it seems apparent that the; appellants had some direction or control over the hours of work and also as to who would be employed and the appellants further retained some direction or control over the process of discharging or firing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">***\u2018As to the provision in the lease itself that the drivers were independent contractors and not servants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>of the appellants, the. principle that such provision is \u201cineffective to overcome the legal, inference dra\\yn from the. facts\u201d, <em>Radley v. Commonwealth </em>(1944), 297 Ky. 830, 181 S. W. 417, is applicable here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\u201cThe test for determining employment under the 1 statute is .conjunctive and both conditions specified in the- law must exist. It appears, based upon the stated facts in the instant case, that the cab companies herein exercise,, or have the right to exercise, such direction, and control over the taxicab drivers in the performance of their services as is necessary to establish .the relationship of employer and employee under the usual common law rules. The company is the one who is authorized and licensed under the ordinances of the City to operate a taxicab business and it necessarily retains the right to direct and control the drivers in the performance of their services in order to protect its investment and to insure the receipt of adequate income in return for its financial risk. \u25a0 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac24\">\u201cThe only distinguishing fact in the subject case from the Young case, <em>supra, </em>is that the \u2018lease drivers\u2019 herein agree by the \u2018Agreement\u2019 to rent a taxicab and agree to pay the Lessor a flat $9.00 and $6.50, respectively, per shift and pay in addition five cents per mile for all miles driven. The protesting employers herein argue that because of the said arrangement the subject \u2018lease drivers\u2019 do not receive remuneration for employment or have a contract of hire with them, but instead receive remuneration direct from the riding public. Although argument of counsel for the employers, indicating that remuneration received by the driver was not wages, is persuasive, we feel that once an employer-employee relationship has been established by retaining direction and control, the method or manner of making remuneration for services performed is not a determining factor in establishing tax liability. We must agree with the language stated in <em>U. S. v. T. S. City Transportation Co. of Tyler, </em>293 F. 2d 953 (1961):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">\u2018Wages\u2019 means remuneration for employment. 26 U. S. C. A. (IRC 1939) \u00a7 1426(a). There being an employer-employee relationship, as the district court correctly determined, and the taxicab business being the business of the employer, it follows that the collections of fares made by the employees for the employer are of funds of the employer and received for the employer\u2019s account. If the remuneration accrues from a service rendered by the employee in the employment, that remuneration does not fall outside the category of wages mere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ly because the employee\u2019s remuneration is based upon a commission and is withheld in the employee\u2019s accounting with his employer for collections made. There is no analogy between the remuneration here involved and tips and gratuities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">\u2018That some employees may have erroneously made tax payments as self-employed individuals should be no deterrent to requiring the payment of a proper tax from those who owe it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201cThis position is also supported by the courts in Iowa in <em>Kaus, d/b/a United Cab Co. v. Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>299 N. W. 415, 230 Iowa 860. The Kaus case has held that earnings of taxicab drivers over and above a $3.00 payment required to be made to the company, iand the cost of gasoline, constitutes remuneration or wages for their services and it is not necessary they be paid directly by the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201cAfter carefully considering the evidence and carefully examining legal authority, the Referee must conclude that the drivers herein are in employment subject to contribution within the meaning of Section 801 and subsection 801 (a) of the Indiana Employment Security Act. It is further concluded the drivers are not free from direction and control over the performance of their services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201cDECISION: IT IS, THEREFORE, CONSIDERED, ORDERED AND DECIDED, that the determinations of the Indiana Employment Security Board in the matter of assessments for delinquent contributions, interest and penalties, as hereinbefore set out, against Safety Cab, Inc., Account No. 29288, and Red Cab, Inc., Account No. 3489, 2020 North Illinois Street, Indianapolis, Indiana, as set forth in the Board\u2019s Notice and Demand for Payment Nos. 22270 and 22271, respectively, as served by the Board, are hereby affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">s/ John C.

Indiana Employment Security Board, et al. </em>(1962), 134 Ind. App. 263, 187 N. E. 2d 489, which was based upon an entirely different factual situation, which we will hereinafter point out. However, we do note, and agree with the general statement set forth in said opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201cThe question of the status of the taxicab driver to the owner of the cabs is a question upon which the decisions of our courts do not appear to be in complete harmony. Apparently this is because the particular result in each instance is usually governed by a varying combination of facts and each case seems to be decided on its own set of circumstances. There is thus no hard and fast rule which can be laid down governing the question. The only distinction to be made is that which is pointed out in the Annotation at 10 A. L. R. 2d 369, where the cases on this question are collected, as to the cases decided under the Social Security Act where Congress had adopted the common law concept of the word \u2018employee\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">In the <em>Young </em>case, the operators, or taxicab drivers, paid sixty per cent of their receipts from the operation of the taxicabs to the cab company, charged the fare schedule fixed by the cab company, and \u201cfurther retained some sense of control through a loose system of seniority, although such system in turn was limited by the fact that only three of the cabs were in operation at one particular time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>In the case now before us, the factual' situation is entirely different. Only about twenty five per cent' of the cab drivers are recognized employees of the appellants. These drivers receive only commissions for compensation with social security tax, federal and state income tax withheld by the appellants, and the appellants retain full control over those drivers\u2019 duties during their working hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The other seventy five percent of the. drivers with whom we are presently concerned, lease the taxicabs they operate, pay a flat rental or lease fee, plus 5 cents per mile driven, and maintain their own hours and mode of operation as provided in the foregoing lease contract. They are not granted advances, or guaranteed minimum profit and they ar\u00e9 not eligible to earn bonuses or any other fringe benefits given to commissioned drivers and other employees. These drivers must always have a deposit with the company equal to one day\u2019s rental of the cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">On the other hand, employees of the companies (commissioned drivers) are, on occasion allowed advances against anticipated commissions, are eligible to earn bonuses based on bookings, number of days worked, promptness and other considerations, and are not required to make a deposit, with the company. All drivers are required to conform with the applicable municipal ordinances regarding the operation, fees and rates in the operation of their respective cabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Under the foregoing statutes and the factual situations appearing in the record, we are of the opinion that appellants herein are not employers within the meaning of the statute and that the lessee-drivers are not employees, but are in fact, independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">It is a well-established general rule that persons occupying the status of independent contractors are not included within the meaning of the terms \u201cemployee\u201d, \u201cworkman\u201d or others of similar import, as used in compensation or employment security acts, in the absence of any provisions requiring such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>an inclusion. See <em>Prest-O-Lite Company v. Skeel </em>(1914), 182 Ind. 593, 596, 106 N. E. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In the case of <em>Nash et al. v. Meguschar, et al. </em>(1949), 228 Ind. 216, 220, 91 N. E. 2d 361, we find the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201cOur courts have been unable accurately to define the term \u2018independent contractor\u2019 to govern in all cases. As a result, there are many definitions and frequently a new set of facts brings forth a variation from all existing definitions. A fairly accurate definition of that term as applied to the facts in the instant case is contained in 27 Am. Jur. <em>Independent Contractors </em>\u00a7 2, p. 481, thus:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVW4\">\u2018Perhaps one of the most frequently quoted is to the effect that an independent contractor is one who, in exercising an independent employment, contracts' to do certain work according to his own methods, and without being subject to the control of his employer, except as to the product or result of his work.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201cSee also <em>Prest-O-Lite Co. v. Skeel </em>(1914), 182 Ind. 593, 596, 106 N. E. 365. In that case at page 597, this Court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u2018When the person employing .may prescribe what shall be done, but not how it is to be done, or who is to do it, the person so employed is a contractor and not a servant. The fact that the work is to be done under the direction and to the satisfaction of certain persons representing the employer, does not render\u2019the person contracted with to do the work a servant\u2019 (authorities).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">\u201cAs' supporting these propositions see: <em>Standard Oil Co. v. Allen, Admr. </em>(1920), 189 Ind. 398, 404, 405, 126 N. E. 674; <em>Julius Keller Constr. Co. v. Herkless </em>(1915), 59 Ind. App. 472, 483, 109 N. E. 797; <em>McGee v. Stockton </em>(1916), 62 Ind. App. 555, 561, 113 N. E. 388; <em>Washburn-Crosby Co. v. Cook </em>(1918), 70 Ind. App. 463, 468, 120 N. E. 434; <em>Petzold v. McGregor </em>(1931), 92 Ind. App. 528, 531, 176 N. E. 640; <em>Gibbons v. Henke, et al. </em>(1940), 108 Ind. App. 481, 483, 29 N. E. 2d 995.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">It is also interesting to note in passing, that it appears from the record that the Internal Revenue Service held that the appellants are not liable for contributions under the Federal Unemployment Act under the lessee-driver contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>By reason of what we have hereinbefore stated, we are of the opinion that the determination made by the liability referee is contrary to law, and it is therefore reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-5\">Carson, C.J., concurs, Faulconer, J., concurs in results.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b622-6\">Prime, J., not participating.</judges>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Note.; \u2014 Reported in 242 N.
