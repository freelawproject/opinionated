The expiration date for the filing of appellants\u2019 brief was therefore May 25, 1968. The record shows that the clerk of the Supreme and Appellate Court stamped appellants\u2019 brief \u201cReceived\u201d on May 31, 1968; thus the filing of said brief was five days late.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Therefore, since the appellants have failed to perfect the filing of their brief within the prescribed period of time in accordance with Rule 2-15 and Rule 2-16, <em>supra, </em>this appeal must be dismissed. <em>DeBeck v.
