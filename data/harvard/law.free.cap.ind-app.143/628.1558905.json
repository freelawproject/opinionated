The hearing officer ruled that the death arose out of and in the course of decedent\u2019s employment. The full Board reversed this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Louis Piani, Appellant\u2019s decedent, was employed by the United Mine Workers as a field representative. His duties included attending meetings, conferences, assisting on dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>putes and grievances, wage agreement negotiations, and attending conferences and conventions.'</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">For many years the decedent had been afflicted with silicosis, which resulted in pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of lung tissue) and chronic corpulmonali (thickening of the right side of the heart-hypertrophy). He succumbed to acute heart failure and respiratory failure while attending a convention in Washington, D. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">To resolve the dispute over compensability, we follow a rather clear test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As2g\">\u201cIs the evidence competent to show that decedent died as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment or that there was a causal connection between his heart attack and his employment? The causal question here is: Was the inability of of decedent\u2019s heart to meet the demands, i.e., the \u2018coronary insufficiency\u2019 caused by a change, i.e., an increase in the work load beyond the heart\u2019s ability to function, or by a decrease in the heart\u2019s ability to meet an unchanged demand? The \u2018cause\u2019 is that which has changed, not that which remains constant.\u201d <em>U. S. Steel v. Dykes </em>(1958), 238 Ind. 599, 608, 154 N. E. 2d 111, 116.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac4b\">The only evidence of extraordinary exertion by decedent was testimony that he had walked up a hill the equivalent of several stories in height. Implicit in the full Board\u2019s reversal is a finding that this is not such an increase in work load as is contemplated by the <em>Dykes, </em>test. We will not disturb the Board\u2019s ruling unless appellant shows that the evidence leads inescapably to one conclusion and the Board ruled contrary. <em>Bundy v. Concrete Ready-Mix </em>(1960), 130 Ind. App. 542, 167 N. E. 2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Stated conversely, if there is some competent evidence to support the full Board\u2019s decision, that decision, is binding upon this Court. <em>E. Rauh &amp; Sons v. Adkins </em>(1955), 126 Ind. App. 251, 129 N. E. 2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The decision of the full Board is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b666-5\">Carson, C.
