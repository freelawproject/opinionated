The issues were formed by the appellants\u2019 amended complaint and the appellee\u2019s answer thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">At the conclusion of appellants\u2019 evidence the appellee filed a motion requesting a directed verdict, which the court sustained, and directed the jury to return a verdict for the appellee. Upon such directed verdict judgment was entered accordingly. Appellants filed a motion for new trial, the pertinent parts of which appellants urge and argue as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW5\">\u201ce. The Court erred in ordering, directing and instructing the jury to return a verdict for the defendant at the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">\u201cf. The Court erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s motion, made at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, to instruct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201c7. The order of the Court directing the jury to return a verdict for the defendant was contrary to the evi- \u25a0 dence-and should not have been given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Such motion was subsequently overruled and appellants, now assign as error to this court the overruling of said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The evidence discloses that the appellants were owners as tenants in common of a parcel of real estate which they had leased to one George W. Early, and upon which was located a gasoline service station. It further discloses that on. January 20, 1958, an explosion occurred which completely destroyed the aforementioned property. Prior to and at the time of the explosion the appellee maintained gas lines near \u00e1ppellants\u2019 property. In their complaint appellants alleged that the appellee was negligent in the construction and maintenance of said gas lines and in permitting gas to leak from the lines. Appellants contend that these acts and omissions by the appellee were the cause of the explosion in question.</p>\n<p id=\"A8s\">There are numerous cases which set forth the legal principles which govern the consideration of a motion for a directed verdict and peremptory instruction. These principles were cogently enunciated in <em>Whitaker, Admr. v. Borntrager </em>(1954), 233 Ind. 678, 680, 122 N. E. 2d 734, where the court stated that a trial court may properly give the trial jury a peremptory instruction to find for the defendant in the following instances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">\u201cWhen there is a total absence of evidence or legitimate inference in favor of the plaintiff upon an essential issue; or where the evidence is without conflict and is susceptible of but one inference and that inference is in favor of the defendant. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">\u201cWhen there is some evidence or legitimate inference supporting each material allegation of the complaint, the court will not weigh the conflicting evidence or inferences but will consider only the evidence and inferences that are most favorable to the party against whom the motion for a premptory verdict is directed. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u201cIn determining whether a peremptory instruction should be given the court must accept as true all facts which the evidence tends to prove and draw, against the party requesting such instruction, all inferences which the jury might reasonably draw.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">See also: <em>Rush v. Clinger </em>(1968), 142 Ind. App. 677, 286 N. E. 2d 840; <em>Thompson v. Owen </em>(1966), 141 Ind. App. 190, 218 N. E. 2d 351; <em>Huttinger v. G. C. Murphy Company </em>(1961), 131 Ind. App. 642, 172 N. E. 2d 74 (transfer denied).</p>\n<p id=\"ADdh\">In the case at bar the record fails to disclose any evidence which supports the presence of a leak in appellee\u2019s gas lines. The record also fails to contain any evidence which tends to support appellants\u2019 proposition that the actual cause of the explosion might be attributed to the acts of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">This court is of the opinion that the material allegations of appellants\u2019 complaint are not supported by evidence which reasonable minds could accept as adequate to support the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Based on the authorities cited above, and the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-8\">Cook, P.J., Bierly and Smith, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 238 N. E. 2d 676.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
