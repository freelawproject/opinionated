J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANH\">This appeal comes to us from the Clay Circuit Court. The action was instituted by appellant, Pan American World Airways, Incorporated, against appellee, Local Readers Service, Incorporated, for the recovery of sums alleged to be due as the result of credit card purchases of airline transportation. It is alleged that the credit cards were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>issued pursuant to a contract executed by appellee\u2019s agent, E. J. Moyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The pleadings consisted of appellant\u2019s amended complaint in five (5) paragraphs and appellee\u2019s amended answer in five (5) paragraphs pursuant to Rule 1-3 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana. Appellee, by amended answer, denied the allegations of appellant\u2019s complaint relating to execution of the contract; the indebtedness; and, particularly the alleged agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Appellee filed its motion for summary judgment pursuant to Acts of 1965, ch. 90, \u00a7 1; being Burns\u2019 Anno. Stat., section 2-2524.- Said motion was based upon the premise that the-signatory to the contract in question, E. J. Moyers, was not the agent of Local Readers Service, Incorporated, and had no actual or apparent authority to commit its credit by the execution of a contract; that there was no genuine issue on the allegations of agency; and, that appellee was entitled to judgment as .a matter of law. Appellant did not file counter-affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Subsequent to oral argument upon appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court sustained the motion and rendered judgment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A31\">\u201cIt is, therefore, now ordered, adjudged and decreed that the motion of the defendant, Local Readers Service, Inc., be and the same is sustained and granted, and that judgment be and the same is hereby rendered in favor of the said defendant on plaintiff\u2019s complaint herein, with costs to be assessed and taxed against the plaintiff herein in the sum of $-.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj4f\">^Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">\u201c1. The Court erred in sustaining the Appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was supported by' answers to written interrogatories propounded by appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>lee, to William J. Leippert, Credit and Collection Supervisor of Pan American World Airways, Incorporated. Question and answer No. 16 of said interrogatories, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">\u201cQUESTION NO. 16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">State in detail what documents and/or written or oral representations were relied upon by Pan American World Airways, Inc., in issuing the air travel card to E. J. Moyers in the name of Local Readers Service, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201cANSWER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">At the time of the application for air travel cards executed by E. J. Moyers, he represented himself to be Managing Director of Local Readers Service, Inc., and in the request he listed W. A. Jones as Accountant and Office Manager for Local Readers Service, Inc., who were to be the card holders for the subscribers Local Readers Service, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">\u201cBy inquiry with the Registrar of Companies in London, England, it was found that under the Companies Act of 1948, Local Readers Service, Inc., was duly authorized to transact business in the United Kingdom on April 6, 1960; that Elwood J. Moyers was authorized to accept on behalf of the Company, service of process and other notices required to be served on Local Readers Service, Inc., an American Corporation; that among the documents delivered to the Registrar of Companies in obtaining admission to transact business in the United Kingdom were photo copy of Certificate of Incorporation of Local Readers Service parent Company Local Readers Service, Inc., issued by the State of Illinois on February 11, 1959; Articles of Incorporation for Local Readers Service, Inc., filed with the Secretary of State in the State of Illinois on February 11, 1959, together with certified copies of a special meeting of shareholders November 24, 1959, and a special meeting of directors on the same date. Pan American World Airways, Inc., also caused an investigation to be made by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Ltd., which report was dated August 23, 1960, and although the contents of which are confidential, said report verified the information obtained from other sources with respect to the authority of Mr. Moyers, and the relationship of his operation in the United Kingdom to the parent Company, Loc\u00e1l Readers Service, Inc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Thereupon, pursuant to Acts of 1881, (Spec. Session), ch. 38, \u00a7353 and Acts of 1881, (Spec. Session), ch. 38, \u00a7 354; being, Burns\u2019 Anno. Stat., \u00a7\u00a7 2-1644, 2-1645, resp., appellee filed a motion to produce those papers and documents which appellant stated as being relied upon in issuing an air travel card to E. J. Moyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">These documents and papers, as well as the answers to the written interrogatories and oral deposition of Mr. Leippert, were filed in support of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">. From a review of the documents, stated, by Mr. Leippert, as being relied upon in ascertaining the authority of E. J. Moyers to bind the credit of Local Readers Service, Inc., we find the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">1. <em>Universal Air Travel Plan Subscribers Contract.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">This document contains the underlying contract being sued upon, herein. The contract signifies the subscriber as \u201cLocal Readers Service, Inc.\u201d and was executed on August 17, 1960, by Mr. Moyers, as \u201cE. J. Moyers Managing Director\u201d. The contract was signed for Pan American Airways, Inc., by the Passenger Sales Manager on September 14, 1960.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">2. <em>The Dun and Bradstreet Report.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">This report was issued by Dun and Bradstreet on August 23, 1960, at the request of Pan American Airways, Inc. That report, in pertinent portion, stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">\u201cPeter Yates 16, John Dalton Street, Manchester, 2 and Elwood J. Moyers 18, Wilbraham Road, Manchester, 21, are authorised (sic) to accept service and notices. Moyer acts in the capacity of Manager, Yates being Solicitor for the company in this country\u201d (England).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">3. <em>Articles of Incorporation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">These were the articles filed with the Secretary of State of Illinois on February 11, 1959, pursuant to which, a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tificate of incorporation was issued to Local Readers Service, Inc. The document lists the incorporators as \u201cM. \u00c9. Petty\u201d, \u201cG. Gold\u201d and \u201cE. S. Roberts\u201d. There is no mention of E. J. Moyers in the document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah0E\">4. <em>Certified copy of Special Meeting of Shareholders.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">In this document, the secretary certified the directors of Local Readers Service, Inc., as of November 24, 1959, to be: \u201cRichard Y. Long\u201d, \u201cRichard L. Harrington\u201d, and \u201cIrwin J. Waxier\u201d. There is no mention of E. J. Moyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">5. <em>Certified copy of Special Meeting of Directors.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">This document is dated November 24, 1959, and contains the minutes of the election of officers. It lists the names of the officers elected at the meeting, and their respective capacities; E. J. Moyers was not mentioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Although, there may be some question as to the admissibility of the Dun and Bradstreet report, it is not raised and will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">In the argument portion of its brief, appellant states general principles of law concerning the efficacies and inefficacies of granting summary judgment. We find, however, only two propositions raised therein which warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Firstly, appellant maintains that the allegations of the complaint and the formal denials thereof, set forth in appellee\u2019s answer, cannot establish sufficient basis for determining the non-existence of a genuine factual issue. Appellant further asserts that the documents (referred to <em>supra), </em>filed in support of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u201c. . . can only be classified as \u2018background\u2019 to the sufficiency of the investigation appellant made concerning the existence of the agency prior to issuing the air travel card in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">We would point out that the purpose of a motion for summary judgment is not to test the sufficiency of the plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ings, this is done by demurrer. The function of the material filed in support of a motion for summary judgment, is not to constitute. \u201cbackground\u201d as appellant asserts, but it. enables the court, by piercing the pleadings, to establish the existence, or conversely, the non-existence of a genuine issue of <em>tact..Christianson et al. v. Gaines </em>(1949), D. C. Cir. 174 F. 2d 534; <em>Carter v. Williams </em>(1966), 7th Cir., 361 F. 2d 189; <em>Albert Dickinson Co. v. Mellos Peanut </em>Co. <em>of Illinois </em>(1950), 7th Cir., 179 F. 2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Secondly, appellant maintains that the supporting documents constitute only a portion of all the elements which must be considered in establishing the agency relationship. Appellant further contends that it was not afforded the opportunity to present evidence which it could have presented at a trial on the merits. In conjunction, appellant asserts that it had no duty to reveal evidence prior to the trial and should, not be forced, by empty maneuvers, to disclose its entire case.</p>\n<p id=\"AqP\">We agree with appellant\u2019s contention that summary judgment procedure should not be used as an instrument for forcing, by empty maneuver, the disclosure of a party\u2019s entire case. This appears to be a shallow statement of the principle that where a genuine issue of fact is established, summary judgment should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"AoW\">Although appellant was under no duty to divulge his entire case, he was obliged to disgorge sufficient evidence to show the existence of a genuine triable issue. 6 Moores Federal Practice \u00b656.11[3], p. 2174; \u00b656.15[3], p. 2348. As stated in <em>Engel v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(CCA 2d 1943), 139 F. 2d 469, at p. 473:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">\u201cIf one may thus reserve one\u2019s evidence (until trial) when faced with a motion for summary judgment there would be little opportunity \u2018to pierce the allegations of fact in the pleadings\u2019 or to determine that the issues formally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>raised were in fact sham or otherwise unsubstantial.\u201d (\u00d3ur parenthetical emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The general rule of law relating to the authority of an agent to bind his principal for credit purchases, is stated in 2 C.J.S. <em>Agency, </em>\u00a7 114, p. 1313:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201c. . . the nature and character of the service to be rendered by the agent will carry with it, as an incident to his agency, implies authority to bind the credit of his principal whenever purchasing in such a fashion is a necessary and appropriate means, under the circumstances, to accomplish the purposes of the agency, or is the well established and customary method of dealing in that connection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac4j\">It is a well established rule that agency cannot be proven by the declarations of the agent, alone. <em>Lester V. Hinkle </em>(1923), 193 Ind. 605, 141 N. E. 463; <em>Holland v. Farrier </em>(1921), 75 Ind. App. 368, 130 N. E. 823; <em>W. T. Rawleigh Medical Co. v. Van Winkle et. al. </em>(1918), 67 Ind. App. 24, 118 N. E. 834. Likewise, we feel that the authority of an agent cannot be proven by the representations of the agent, alone, especially as in the case at bar, where the documents stated as relied upon, failed to support Moyer\u2019s representation. <em>Blair-Baker Horse Co. v. First Nat. Bank </em>(1905), 164 Ind. 77, 72 N. E. 1027. When the representation of E. J. Moyers is eliminated, nothing remains to establish authority to purchase on credit.</p>\n<p id=\"A7L_\">The fact that Mr. Moyers signed the contract as \u201cManaging Director\u201d, a declaration which was unsupported by the remainder of material at the disposal of Pan American World Airways, Incorporated, should have placed it on notice of inquiry. It had at hand the names of the officers and directors of Local Readers Service, Incorporated, and was extremely negligent, if not careless, in failing to check the authority of E. J. Moyers. As no genuine triable issue was shown on authority, the remainder of any controverted allegations were rendered moot. We, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>feel that the trial court conducted itself properly in finding that, as a matter of law, defendant-appellee was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The judgment below, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-6\">Cooper, and Prime, J.J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b414-7\">Faulconer, J., concurs in result only.</judges>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 240 N. E. 2d 552.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
