Plaintiff in the underlying suit is a woman who claims injury as a result of her mother\u2019s ingesting the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) while plaintiff was <em>in \u00fatero. </em>Named as defendants are a number of pharmaceutical companies who are alleged to have manufactured and distributed the drug, and against whom plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>tiff seeks recovery on various grounds including strict products liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, and enterprise liability. <em>(Sindell </em>v. <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 588 [163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924].) The issue in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>is whether or to what extent petitioner in that case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who is plaintiff\u2019s <em>mother, </em>can be compelled to reveal information concerning <em>her </em>medical history\u2014information which defendants say is relevant to the preparation of their defense, but which plaintiff\u2019s mother claims is protected both by the statutory physician-patient privilege (Evid. Code, \u00a7 990 et seq.) and by the federal and state Constitutions. The issue in <em>Benny </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>is whether <em>plaintiff </em>can be compelled to seek information from her mother, concerning her mother\u2019s medical history, in order to respond to interrogatories propounded by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\n<em>Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The issue in <em>Jones </em>arose when one of the named defendants, Eli Lilly &amp; Company (Lilly), took petitioner\u2019s deposition. She answered questions about her medical history before and up to the time of plaintiff\u2019s birth, recounting conversations with her physician, pharmacist, husband, and others regarding her pregnancy and the administration of DES, but she initially refused to give the names of the physicians, pharmacists, and the hospitals she had utilized during her pregnancy, and she refused to answer any questions relating to her medical history after the birth of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Lilly then moved to compel answers, and appended to its motion a copy of an affidavit from Ralph M. Richart, M.D., which had been filed in an apparently similar action against Lilly in New Jersey. Dr. Richart\u2019s affidavit, after stating his qualifications in the field of obstetrics, asserts that where a mother took DES, her \u201centire medical history,\u201d and especially her obstetrical and gynecological history, would be \u201cextremely important in determining whether the [DES] she took had any effect on the plaintiff, and whether this pharmaceutical was properly prescribed.\u201d According to the affidavit it would be important for these purposes to know, in addition to facts relating to the mother\u2019s pregnancy with the plaintiff, whether the mother\u2019s history reflects any genetic defects which could cause obstetrical problems; all details sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>rounding her miscarriages and/or abortions; any symptoms presented during subsequent pregnancies and the pharmaceuticals which were prescribed for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel, in response to the motion to compel answers, represented to the court that petitioner would be willing to respond to questions about her medical history prior to plaintiff\u2019s birth, including the names of the doctors, pharmacists, and hospitals, but she continued to resist discovery directed toward the postpartum period on grounds of statutory privilege, constitutional right of privacy, and relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">After hearing on the motion, the trial court ordered petitioner to respond to 14 certified questions, including 11 questions relating to the period prior to plaintiff\u2019s birth (which petitioner is apparently willing to answer) and 3 questions relating to the subsequent period. These latter three questions asked: \u201cWho was your obstetrician for [plaintiff\u2019s younger brother] Steven?\u201d; \u201cWere all your children born in the same hospital?\u201d; and \u201cYou lost one of your twins. Was that at birth?\u201d In addition, respondent court ordered generally that petitioner \u201canswer questions at her deposition regarding her medical history subsequent to the date of birth of plaintiff.\u201d These directives were accompanied by a protective order to the effect that the information disclosed was to be used solely for the purposes of the litigation, and was to be disclosed only to the parties, their counsel, and consultants and experts retained by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The issue in <em>Benny </em>arose when plaintiff responded to interrogatories dealing with her mother\u2019s medical history by saying she either did not know the requested information or knew only vague details.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court ordered further response, apparently on the ground that she was obligated to seek such information from her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Plaintiff and her mother then filed with this court petitions for writ of prohibition or mandate to block enforcement of the respondent court\u2019s discovery orders. Considering that the issues raised were of general importance to the trial court and to the profession (see Henderson, <em>DES Litigation: The Tidal Wave Approaching Shore </em>(1980) 3 Corp. L.Rev. 143, 148), that useful guidelines might emerge, and that appeal was not an adequate remedy <em>(Oceanside Union School Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 180, 185-186 [23 Cal.Rptr. 375, 373 P.2d 439]; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 330, 336 [107 Cal.Rptr. 309, 508 P.2d 309]; <em>Rudnick </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 924, 928 [114 Cal.Rptr. 603, 523 P.2d 643]), we granted alternative writs of prohibition and a stay of the discovery orders pending our decision. Defendants E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc., and the Upjohn Company, who seek similar discovery, have, pursuant to stipulation, joined real party in interest Lilly in supporting the trial court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Jones <em>v. </em>Superior Court</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Jones\u2019 petition calls for consideration of both statutory and constitutional principles. We will discuss the applicability of those principles in general terms, and then bring them to focus upon the issues posed by the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\n<em>Physician-patient Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Evidence Code section 994 provides, subject to statutory exceptions, that a \u201cpatient, whether or not a party, has a privilege to refuse to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>close, and to prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication between patient and physician.\u201d  To the extent that the privilege applies, it operates as a bar to discovery of even relevant information. (Code of Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2016, subd. (b).) \u201c[T]here can be no discovery of matter which is privileged.\u201d <em>(Rudnick </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 924, 929.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Defendants assert what amounts to a threshold question concerning the statutory privilege. They rely upon three exceptions to the privilege any of which, if applicable, would mean that petitioner\u2019s privilege was automatically eliminated, or at least substantially diminished, by the action of her daughter in instituting this lawsuit and without regard to the nature of petitioner\u2019s participation in the litigation. The exceptions to which we refer provide that there is no privilege with respect to communications relevant to an issue concerning the condition of the patient \u201cin a proceeding to recover damages on account of the conduct of the patient if good cause for disclosure of the communication is shown\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 999), or where such issue \u201chas been tendered\u201d by either a \u201cparty claiming through or under the patient\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 996, subd. (b)), or a \u201cparty claiming as a beneficiary of the patient through a contract to which the patient is or was a party ...\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 996, subd. (c)). We consider each of these provisions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Prior to 1975, section 999 afforded an exception from the privilege in a proceeding to recover damages \u201con account of the conduct of the patient <em>which constitutes a crime.\u201d </em>The amendment of that year eliminated the emphasized phrase and substituted for it the present language relating to good cause for disclosure. The Law Revision Commission commentary to the amendment characterizes the former \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d exception as \u201cburdensome, difficult to administer, and ill designed to achieve the purpose of making needed evidence available.\u201d As an example of the section\u2019s new scope, the commentary refers to \u201ca personal injury action brought against an employer based on the negligent conduct of his employee who was killed in the accident.\u201d Nothing in the legislative history of the amendment, or in its common sense meaning, suggests that it applies to conduct of a patient which is neither criminal nor wrongful in any legal sense, simply because that conduct\u2014in this case the consumption of prescribed drugs\u2014is alleged to constitute the physical medium by which the defendant\u2019s tortious act is communicated to the plaintiff. Plaintiff in this case sues, not \u201con account of the conduct of\u201d her mother, but on account of the conduct of defendants, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>are alleged to have acted wrongfully in relation to her. We conclude that the section 999 exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Similarly, plaintiff by her instant action is not \u201cclaiming through or under the patient\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (b) of section 996. That language is derived from rule 27(4) of the Uniform Rules of Evidence, drafted in 1953 'by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and is characterized by the California Law Revision Commission as applying to \u201ca plaintiff in the patient\u2019s shoes.\u201d (6 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1964) p. 413.) The example given is an action by a patient \u201cby guardian to set aside a deed by patient or to cancel a contract for want of capacity of the patient to execute the instrument\u201d (ibid.). Plaintiff does not stand in her mother\u2019s shoes, she stands in her own; and the injuries she complains of are to her own body. Nothing in the legislative history, and no cited authority, supports application of the \u201cthrough and under\u201d exception here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Finally, plaintiff cannot reasonably be said to be \u201cclaiming as a beneficiary of the patient through a contract to which the patient is or was a party\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (c) of section 996. Though her complaint invokes express and implied warranties, it is well established that an action based upon such theories may be maintained by an injured party against the manufacturer of biologies despite the absence of privity <em>(Gottsdanker </em>v. <em>Cutter Laboratories </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 602 [6 Cal.Rptr. 320, 79 A.L.R.2d 290]; <em>Grinnell </em>v. <em>Charles Pfizer &amp; Co. </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 424 [79 Cal.Rptr. 369]; 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Sales, \u00a7 99, p. 1163) and that this \u201cwarranty\u201d without privity is not a contractual warranty at all, but really a species of strict tort liability. (4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7 809, p. 3105; see <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 57, 63 [27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897, 13 A.L.R.3d 1049].)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">While petitioner\u2019s statutory privilege may have survived her daughter\u2019s filing of this lawsuit, it did not remain unaffected by her own actions in making partial disclosures of privileged communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>in support of her daughter\u2019s cause. We are not prepared to say, as defendants would have it, that by providing certain information of assistance to her daughter she has \u201ctendered\u201d her medical condition as an issue within the meaning of the patient-litigant exception described in Evidence Code section 996, subdivision (a), which exempts communications \u201crelevant to an issue concerning the condition of the patient if such an issue has been tendered by: (a) the patient.\u201d The history of that exception and the reasons for its existence focus upon the patient\u2019s conduct in disclosing her own ailments \u201cby bringing an action in which they are in issue.\u201d <em>(City &amp; County of S. F. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 227, 232 [231 P.2d 26, 25 A.L.R.2d 1418].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the facts may suggest that petitioner is closely allied with her daughter in this matter, nothing in the legislative background of the patient-litigant exception or in its judicial implementation support its application to a witness who is not a party to the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Petitioner\u2019s privilege is, however, subject to Evidence Code section 912, which provides (in subd. (a)) that the right of a person to claim the privilege \u201cis waived with respect to a communication protected by such privilege if any holder of the privilege, without coercion, has disclosed a significant part of the communication.\u201d By testifying freely that she ingested DES, and as to certain of the circumstances in which she did so, petitioner has disclosed a \u201csignificant part\u201d of her communications with physicians on that subject, and on the inextricably related subject of her pregnancy with plaintiff. Thus, she has waived her statutory privilege as to these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">It does not follow that petitioner, by disclosing portions of communications relating to her consumption of DES and her pregnancy with plaintiff, has waived her privilege as to all otherwise protected commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>nications during her lifetime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even the waiver which follows upon tender of a medical issue by a party to the litigation does not extend that far: \u201cthe scope of the inquiry permitted depends upon the nature of the injuries which the patient-litigant himself has brought before the court.\u201d <em>(Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 864 [143 Cal.Rptr. 695, 574 P.2d 766] (italics omitted); see also <em>In re Lifschutz </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 415, 431 [85 Cal.Rptr. 829, 467 P.2d 557, 44 A.L.R.3d 1]; <em>Hallendorf </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 553 [149 Cal.Rptr. 564].) And waiver through disclosure by a nonparty witness, proceeding from different policy premises and based on different statutory language, is presumably intended to be more limited in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Defendants observe, and we agree, that the scope of waiver is not limited to what the patient intends: \u201cAs is stated in 8 Wigmore, Evidence, section 2327 (McNaughton rev. 1961), \u2018There is always the objective consideration that when his ... conduct touches a certain point of disclosure, fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not.\u2019\u201d <em>(Kerns Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 405, 414 [72 Cal.Rptr. 74].) But section 912 prescribes waiver with respect to \u201ca communication\u201d where there has been disclosure of a \u201csignificant part of the communication.\u201d We are prepared to accept that the term \u201ccommunication\u201d deserves, in this context, a liberal construction. A patient, for example, who has disclosed her conversation with a physician on Monday ought not be permitted to claim the privilege with respect to a conversation with the same physician and relating to the same subject matter on Tuesday. Arguably, the same is true where the patient consults more than one physician concerning the same subject matter, and discloses her communication with one of them. But it would distort the statutory language beyond its apparent meaning to say that the waiver extends to all communications with any physician at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">It would seem that the scope of the waiver should be determined primarily by reference to the purpose of the privilege, which, according to the Supreme Court, is \u201cto preclude the humiliation of the patient that might follow disclosure of his ailments\u201d <em>(City &amp; County of S. F. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 37 Cal.2d 227, 232). Where the disclosure sought is so related to the disclosure already made that the patient could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>reasonably retain a privacy interest in preventing it, then the purpose of the privilege no longer exists, and it may be said that the privilege has been waived.  A patient ought not be permitted to claim the privilege merely in order to aid one of the parties to the litigation, where no legitimate claim to confidentiality exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">It may be appropriate to say, for example, that petitioner is no longer in a position to invoke the privilege with respect to communications concerning prescription of DES for subsequent pregnancies; but it does not follow that she retains no interest in the confidentiality of other portions of her medical history, even assuming that history is relevant, as defendants contend, to the resolution of the factual issues posed in the litigation.  Under the statutory scheme,' a party\u2019s need to know certain information will not overcome a nonparty\u2019s privilege under circumstances in which that privilege is otherwise properly invoked. (Cf. <em>Mavroudis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 594, 603 [162 Cal.Rptr. 724]; <em>Boddy </em>v. <em>Parker </em>(1974) 45 App.Div.2d 1000 [358 N.Y.S.2d 218]; <em>King </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>(1980) 103 Misc.2d 607 [426 N.Y.S.2d 415].) If there is need for broader discovery in a case of this sort, the remedy lies with the Legislature, and not with the courts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The statutory privilege protects only against disclosure of \u201cconfidential communications\u201d between patient and physician, and while that term is broadly defined to include any diagnosis made and advice given by the physician in the course of the physician-patient relationship (Evid. Code, \u00a7 992; see <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 844, 862, fn. 7), it does not include information which does not intrude upon that relationship. Moreover, the scope of the privilege and of waiver is itself affected by constitutional principles. We therefore move to consideration of those principles before attempting further application of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>Constitutional Right of Privacy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">There can be little doubt but that petitioner\u2019s medical history is entitled to a measure of protection under both federal and state Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>tutions. In <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1965) 381 U.S. 479, 484 [14 L.Ed.2d 510, 514, 85 S.Ct. 1678], the United States Supreme Court declared that \u201c[vjarious guarantees [of the Bill of Rights] create zones of privacy,\u201d and in <em>In re Lifschutz, supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d 415, 431-432, the California Supreme Court held that the confidentiality of the psycho-therapeutic session falls within one such zone. Since that decision, the California Constitution has been amended to include among the inalienable rights of all people the right to pursue and obtain privacy (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1); and while \u201cthe full contours of the new constitutional provision have as yet not even tentatively been sketched ...\u201d <em>(White </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 757, 773 [120 Cal.Rptr. 94, 533 P.2d 222]), it has been observed that \u201celevation of the right to be free from invasions of privacy to constitutional stature was apparently intended to be an expansion of the privacy right.\u201d <em>(Porten </em>v. <em>University of San Francisco </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 825, 829 [134 Cal.Rptr. 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>v. <em>Gherardini </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 669 [156 Cal.Rptr. 55] involved an attempt by a state licensing agency to obtain the complete medical-hospital records of five named patients of a San Diego doctor under investigation by the board for alleged incompetence or gross negligence. The court opined: \u201cA person\u2019s medical profile is an area of privacy infinitely more intimate, more personal in quality and nature than many areas already judicially recognized and protected.... [II] The individual\u2019s right to privacy encompasses not only the state of his mind, but also his viscera, detailed complaints of physical ills, and their emotional overtones. The state of a person\u2019s gastro-intestinal tract is as much entitled to privacy from unauthorized public or bureaucratic snooping as is that person\u2019s bank account, the contents of his library or his membership in the NAACP. We conclude the specie of privacy here sought to be invaded falls squarely within the protected ambit, the expressed objectives of article I, section 1.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 678-679. See also <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 844, 863-864.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Surely no aspect of a woman\u2019s medical profile is more sensitive in terms of privacy interests than her obstetrical-gynecological history. It is precisely in the areas of marriage <em>(Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1967) 388 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>U.S. 1, 12 [18 L.Ed.2d 1010, 1018, 87 S.Ct. 1817]), procreation <em>(Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1942) 316 U.S. 535, 541-542 [86 L.Ed. 1655, 1660-1661, 62 S.Ct. 1110]), sexual relations and contraception <em>(Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>Baird </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 438, 453-454 [31 L.Ed.2d 349, 362-363, 92 S.Ct. 1029]), family relationships <em>(Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>(1944) 321 U.S. 158, 166 [88 L.Ed. 645, 652-653, 64 S.Ct. 438]), along with child rearing and education <em>(Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters </em>(1925) 268 U.S. 510, 535 [69 L.Ed. 1070, 1078, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468]) that the United States Supreme Court has recognized a federally protected guarantee of personal privacy (see <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 113, 153 [35 L.Ed.2d 147, 177, 93 S.Ct. 705]), and a concomitant privacy interest in \u201cthe intimate medical problems of family, marriage, and motherhood\u201d (cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>12 200-Ft. Reels of Film </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 123, 127, fn. 4 [37 L.Ed.2d 500, 505, 93 S.Ct. 2665]). Whether that intimacy is invaded through intrusion upon communications between the woman and her physician or more directly through demands upon the woman for disclosure of symptoms or conditions relating to her pregnancy would not appear to be critical for constitutional purposes. In other words, the right of privacy under federal and state Constitutions extends beyond the \u201cconfidential communications\u201d protected by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The constitutional right is by no means absolute. The state\u2019s interest in facilitating the ascertainment of truth in connection with legal proceedings is substantial enough to compel disclosure of a great variety of confidential material, including even communications between a psychotherapist and his patient. <em>(In re Lifschutz, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 415, 432-433.) But intrusion upon constitutionally protected areas of privacy requires a \u201cbalancing of the juxtaposed rights, and the finding of a compelling state interest.\u201d <em>(Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>v. <em>Gherardini, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d at p. 681; <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 844; <em>Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 657 [125 Cal.Rptr. 553, 542 P.2d 977].) Thus, petitioner\u2019s privacy interests must be carefully weighed against the legitimate interests of real parties in preparing their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The 11 specific questions which the trial court ordered petitioner to answer relating to the period prior to plaintiff\u2019s birth (and which petitioner is apparently willing to answer) seek information concerning the physician who prescribed DES, the pharmacy which filled the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>scription, and where plaintiff\u2019s delivery took place. None of these call for communications within the physician-patient privilege. (See <em>Henard </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 129, 133 [102 Cal.Rptr. 721].) Moreover, whatever minimal privacy interest petitioner might have had with respect to such information was waived by petitioner\u2019s disclosures concerning the subject matter. Thus, there is no statutory or constitutional obstacle to this portion of the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The three specific questions which the trial court ordered petitioner to answer relating to the period <em>after </em>petitioner\u2019s birth (and which petitioner is unwilling to answer) likewise do not call for communications within the statutory privilege. And, in our opinion, the trial court was justified in concluding that such questions did not unreasonably intrude upon petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to privacy. We conclude, therefore, that this portion of the trial court\u2019s order was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">There remains for consideration the propriety of the trial court\u2019s order directing petitioner generally to answer questions regarding her medical history subsequent to plaintiff\u2019s birth. If this order were interpreted to require petitioner to respond to all such questions, upon penalty of sanctions, the order would be invalid under the tests we have discussed. Petitioner\u2019s waiver of her statutory patient-physician privilege does not extend to her lifetime medical history, but only to those matters as to which, based upon her disclosures, it can reasonably be said she no longer retains a privacy interest. And, while defendants have arguably demonstrated in general terms through Dr. Richart\u2019s declaration that some matters relating to that medical history might be relevant to determination of issues in the litigation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the record does not reflect the sort of specificity and careful balancing of interests which the Constitution requires for such a broad-scale invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Defendants contend, however, and we agree, that this portion of the ' court\u2019s order was not intended, and ought not be interpreted, as a blanket directive but rather as a denial by the trial court of petitioner\u2019s blanket claim of immunity from obligation to answer <em>any </em>questions relating to the period after plaintiff\u2019s birth. Viewed in that light, the order does not offend petitioner\u2019s rights, since questions may be asked con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>cerning matters which are neither statutorily privileged nor constitutionally protected. As further issues of privilege and privacy arise through implementation of the court\u2019s order, the trial court will be in the best position to assess the competing interests and to exercise its broad discretion in discovery matters in accordance with applicable principles. <em>(Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 652, 658.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Subject to these observations, and to the preceding analysis, we find no reason to disturb the rulings which the trial court has made.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Benny v. Superior Court</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The issue posed by the order which plaintiff Benny complains of\u2014requiring her, in effect, to attempt to obtain certain information from her mother in order to respond to certain interrogatories\u2014calls, we believe, for similar deference to the trial court\u2019s discretion. \u201cA party may not refuse to admit or deny matters set forth in a request for admissions of fact . .. merely because he lacks personal knowledge of those facts if the means of knowledge are reasonably within his power. In <em>Chodos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>[1963] 215 Cal.App.2d 318 [30 Cal.Rptr. 303], it was held ... that a party without personal knowledge would be required to make a reasonable investigation to ascertain the facts when it affirmatively appeared that he had available to him sources of information as to the facts or matters involved in the request for admissions.\u201d <em>(Lindgren </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 743, 746 [47 Cal.Rptr. 298, 20 A.L.R.3d 748]; accord, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Circle P Ranch Co. </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 267, 275 [150 Cal.Rptr. 828].) While these cases involved requests for admissions, there appears to be no reason for a different rule in the case of interrogatories. (See Powers, <em>A Guide to Interrogatories in California Practice </em>(1975) 48 So.Cal.L. Rev. 1221, 1268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">We, of course, do not suggest that a mother\u2019s information is necessarily or even typically within the power of her daughter to obtain for the asking. The relationship of mothers and daughters is undoubtedly as varied as human beings upon the earth, and certainly beyond the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>of courts to predict, much less to control. Nor are we impressed with the fact that plaintiff\u2019s complaint originally contained allegations to the effect that her mother acted as her \u201cagent\u201d in taking DES. (Cf. <em>Pantzalas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 499 [77 Cal.Rptr. 354].) But from the record before the court, it appears that plaintiff\u2019s mother has been cooperating closely in her daughter\u2019s lawsuit; the making of inquiry posed no discernible burden upon the plaintiff (cf. <em>Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 720 [62 Cal.Rptr. 458]); and while her mother was accessible to defendants through deposition, responses to interrogatories, if they could be obtained, might provide a useful basis for more focused questioning. Of course, her mother was and is free to say no for privacy reasons or any reasons. Under the circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by directing plaintiff, in effect, to make a good faith inquiry of her mother regarding the subject matter of the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Both petitions for peremptory writ are denied, and the alternative writs are discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Racanelli, P. J., and Elkington, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We will use the term \u201cpetitioner\" to refer to Jones throughout this opinion. We will refer to her daughter as \u201cplaintiff,\u201d and to the other real parties in interest as \u201cdefendants.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Examples of these questions with petitioner\u2019s responses are as follows: \u201c7.
