The Town Court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs to recover possession of the premises, and the defendant appealed to the Court of Common Pleas in New Haven County, which rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. Her appeal to this court is from that judgment. For some reason which does not appear, the caption in the Court of Common Pleas judgment designates the defendant, Mary Proch, as plaintiff, and the other three parties as defendants. To avoid confusion, we refer to the former as the appellant and the latter as the appellees. In the Court of Common Pleas, the appellant filed a motion that the case be placed on the jury docket. In disposing of this motion, the court held that the appellant\u2019s remedy in this case was by writ of error instead of appeal and therefore dismissed the appeal and denied the motion. Whether the court was warranted in so holding is the question for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The appellees\u2019 complaint contained the allegations usual in a summary process complaint, and then continued : \u201cThe plaintiff claims: 1. Judgment for immediate possession of said leased premises. 2. $100.00 damages.\u201d The appellant by her answer admitted the allegations of the complaint except to deny that Decho had served in the armed services of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the United States during the war emergency and in good faith sought possession of the premises for his own use and occupancy as housing accommodations. The Town Court\u2019s judgment was, without more, that the appellees recover \u201cimmediate possession of the premises.\u201d Aside from the second prayer for relief quoted above, the complaint alleged a cause of action of summary process only, whereunder the plaintiff\u2019s right to the recovery of possession would be the sole issue. General Statutes \u00a7 5974. See Practice Book, p. 340; <em>Politser </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, Inc., </em>133 Conn. 605, 607, 53 A. 2d 201. Section 5974 expressly provides that no appeal shall be allowed from any judgment rendered in any such action. This is because of the summary nature of the proceeding, the purpose being to prevent a retrial of questions of fact in another court with consequent delay. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Ambler, </em>125 Conn. 543, 546, 7 A. 2d 228. Section 5980, however, does provide for a writ of error, which is the only method of procuring a review of proceedings in an action strictly of summary process. Practice Book \u00a7 267. The foregoing is the procedure prescribed because the proceeding to obtain possession is intended not only to be summary but also conclusive. <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>39 Conn. 307, 308; <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Burhans, </em>79 Conn. 306, 308, 64 A. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">What we have said emphasizes the radical change wrought in the summary process statute by the amendment incorporated in \u00a7 1429e. Under it, a lessor, if he so elects, is no longer restricted in his action to recovery of possession of the premises but may also seek damages for any cause arising from their use and occupancy by the lessee. Where a lessor elects to sue for damages as well as possession, it may fairly be inferred that his eagerness for immediate possession is tempered by a coexisting de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>sire for damages. The statute recognizes this by retaining the accelerated procedure where no damages are claimed but dispensing with it where they are. Accordingly, it provides that \u201cif, in such complaint, the relief demanded be confined to possession of the leased premises and costs of such action, it may be made returnable six. days, inclusive, after service upon the defendant,\u201d instead of being \u201creturnable in accordance with the established rules and procedure of civil process,\u201d as is required where a claim for damages is included; and, further, it expressly states that where possession only is demanded the provision of \u00a7 5974 concerning \u201cno appeal,\u201d and of \u00a7 5980 as to a writ of error, shall apply, but that, if \u201cin addition to the demand for possession of premises . . . damages shall be demanded, the complaint\u201d shall fall within the category of civil process, \u201cincluding the right of appeal.\u201d These changes in the statute make clear that, where a plaintiff\u2019s complaint includes in its prayers for relief a claim for damages as well as a demand for possession of the premises, a right of appeal instead of a right to a writ of error is given the defendant, and they also manifest the r.eason why this change in remedies has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">It is contended by the appellees, however, that, in any event, since the record fails to show that a claim for damages was actually asserted by them at the trial in the Town Court, the amendment in the statute does not apply, and that therefore this case must be regarded as a summary process proceeding solely. This contention disregards the express language of the statute, which makes \u201cthe relief demanded\u201d in the complaint the determinative factor as to the applicability of the amendment. This provision is similar in nature to the usual legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>enactment prescribing tbe amount of \u201cthe matter in demand\u201d as a determinative jurisdictional requirement. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5437, 5443; Sup. 1941, \u00a7\u00a7 808f, 813f; Sup. 1947, \u00a7 1420i; <em>Walkinshaw </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>130 Conn. 122, 136, 32 A. 2d 547. The claim for damages set forth in the complaint brings the case within the provision as to an appeal. This gives the appellees no reason to complain, since they voluntarily inserted the claim in their complaint and did not seek to withdraw it before judgment. The court erred in dismissing the appeal. As was expressly conceded by the appellees in oral argument before us, a right in the appellant to appeal carries with it the right to a jury trial in the Court of Common Pleas. The court therefore also erred in denying the motion to place the case on the jury docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to grant the motion to place it upon the jury docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
