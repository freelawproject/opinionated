It was there erased on the ground that it could be made returnable only to the Supreme Court of Errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">General Statutes, Cum. Sup. 1935, \u00a7 1667c, as amended, reads in part: \u201cWrits of error for errors in matters of law only may be brought from the judgments of the superior court, any court of common pleas and any city court to the supreme court of errors.\u201d Section 1665c reads in part: \u201cA writ of error may be brought from an original judgment in summary process rendered by a justice of the peace or by any town or borough court to the court of common pleas.\u201d These statutes are neither ambiguous nor contradictory. The word \u201cmay\u201d in both obviously means that any writ of error brought shall be brought to the court named. <em>Lake Garda Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number><em>LeWitt, </em>126 Conn. 588, 590, 13 A. 2d 510. Writs of error from city courts are returnable to the Supreme Court of Errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The claim of the amicus curiae that these acts are modified by \u00a7 736f of the 1941 Supplement is with - out merit. It reads: \u201cDefinition. Where used in this chapter, the term \u2018municipal courts\u2019 shall mean town, city, borough, city and police, police and traffic courts.\u201d This section is in chapter 281b, entitled \u201cMunicipal Courts,\u201d and the definition applies only in this chapter. Sections 1665c and 1667c are in chapter 296, entitled \u201cNew Trials and Writs of Error,\u201d and the classification of courts therein is definite. The intention of the General Assembly to maintain the distinction is manifested by its amendment of both the latter sections, at the same session during which \u00a7 736f was enacted, by \u00a7\u00a7 843f and 844f, where, although other verbal changes were made, the language quoted was not modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">There is nothing in <em>Webb </em>v. Ambler, 125 Conn. 543, 7 A. 2d 228, which militates against this conclusion. As far as the point under discussion is concerned, that case decided that there is an appeal to this court from a judgment on a writ of error by the Superior or Common Pleas Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
