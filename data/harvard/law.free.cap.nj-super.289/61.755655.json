In a separate indictment, defendant was charged with possession of heroin, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(l). Defendant entered into a plea agreement with the State. In accordance with the plea agreement defendant pled guilty to aggravated manslaughter, a lesser included offense of murder, and possession of heroin. He also pled guilty to an accusation charging him with employment of a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-6. The State, for its part of the agreement, recommended that counts two and three of the indictment be dismissed. The trial judge accepted defendant\u2019s pleas, and imposed a thirty year term of imprisonment with fifteen years of parole ineligibility for the manslaughter charge, a concurrent five year term for the possession of heroin charge, and a consecutive ten-year term with five years of parole ineligibility for employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme. Defendant\u2019s aggregate sentence was forty years in prison with twenty years of parole ineligibility. The remaining counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Defendant filed a notice of appeal and the matter was placed on our sentencing calendar pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:9-11. Following argument, we requested that the issues raised be fully briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On appeal, defendant essentially claims: (-1) there was an insufficient factual basis for the plea to using a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme; (2) the remaining sentences imposed cannot be disturbed without violating principles of double jeopardy; and (3) the sentence was excessive. We find no basis to disturb defendant\u2019s guilty plea and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">It is not necessary to set forth the facts in detail. Briefly, on September 25, 1991, defendant took three year old E.N., his fiancee\u2019s son, with him on a trip from their home in Milton, Delaware to New Jersey and New York. Defendant took the trip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>to purchase heroin in New York for his personal use and for the use of his fiancee upon his return to Delaware. During the trip defendant purchased and consumed heroin in New Jersey and New York. Defendant and E.N. stayed with defendant\u2019s family in Irvington one night, spent several nights in various motels, and stayed at least one night in defendant\u2019s car. He disciplined E.N. by hitting him, sometimes with his hand or fist. According to defendant, he beat E.N. because he \u201cwas angry [that E.N.] kept messing up his clothes, messing on himself and messing on the floor in the motel room.\u201d Defendant acknowledged that by mistreating E.N. in this manner, he was creating a \u201csubstantial risk of causing him harm or death____\u201d On the final night of E.N.\u2019s life, defendant beat E.N., who then \u201cmessed\u201d his pants again. Defendant washed E.N. and put him to bed. E.N. began vomiting. Defendant merely placed the covers over E.N. and sat on the foot of the bed. The next morning E.N. did not respond when defendant tried to wake him. Defendant drove to his mother\u2019s house and told his mother and sister that he thought E.N. was dead. Defendant\u2019s sister returned to the motel with him where she confirmed that E.N. was dead. The police were contacted and defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Defendant contends that his conviction and sentence for employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme must be vacated because there was not an adequate factual basis to support his guilty plea to the charge. The State disputes this contention and cites <em>R. </em>3:9-3(f) in support of its argument that defendant\u2019s unconditional guilty plea bars him from raising the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Initially, we are satisfied that defendant may challenge this conviction despite his failure to enter a conditional plea pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:9~3(f), or otherwise move to dismiss the accusation. The challenge to the existence of a factual basis for a plea is not waived by a guilty plea. <em>See State v. Lightner, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>313, 315-16, 491 A.2d 1273 (1985); <em>State v. Butler, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>220, 224, 445 A.2d 399 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>At the plea hearing, defendant gave the following sworn testimony that formed the basis of his plea of guilty to employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">THE COURT: All right. Let us go to the employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">Q. Mr. [C], referring back to your statement with regard to picking up [E.N.] in Delaware and bringing him into New Jersey. Did there come a point in time from September the 25th through September the 30th that you drove into New York and you purchased an amount of narcotics?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">Q. And, in fact, you purchased what you understood to be heroin; is that right? A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">Q. And you bought several decks of heroin; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">A. Several bundles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">Q. Several bundles of heroin. Mr. [C], at some point in time, is it true you were then going to return to Delaware so that you and [S.N.] would be able to use drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">Q. And the purpose of having [E.N.] in the car at that time, was it so that the police would not stop you along the highway, seeing [you] had a small child in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-16\">Q. And [E.N.] was placed in the car for that purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-17\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-18\">Q. So that you could go buy the drugs and then bring them down to [S.N.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-19\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-20\">THE COURT: Mr. Kolano, any questions in that regard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-21\">EXAMINATION BY MR. KOLANO:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-22\">Q. When you returned to Delaware you were going to share the drugs you had purchased with [S.N.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-23\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-24\">Defendant contends that he did not \u201cuse\u201d E.N. to facilitate the distribution of drugs and that the passive presence of a child does not meet the active role in the scheme that the legislature intended. Further, he contends that a three year old is not within the class of children protected by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:85-6 as demonstrated by the legislature\u2019s use of the term juvenile rather than a word such as minor. Finally, defendant contends that there was no evidence of a drug distribution scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>N.J.S.A. 2C:35-6, Employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">Any person being at least 18 years of age who knowingly uses, solicits, directs, hires or employs a person 17 years of age or younger to violate <em>N.J.S. </em>20:35-4 or subsection a. of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:35-5, is guilty of a crime of the second degree ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">It shall be no defense to a prosecution under this section that the actor mistakenly believed that the person which the actor used, solicited, directed, hired or employed was 18 years of age or older, even if such mistaken belief was reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Defendant urges that the presence of the word \u201cuses\u201d in the statute makes it ambiguous. He argues that the other verbs \u201csolicits, directs, hires or employs\u201d ail signify some active participation by the juvenile and that the juvenile must do something which \u201cif he possessed guilty knowledge\u201d would constitute a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a or 2C:35-4. Therefore, defendant concludes that since the four other verbs are all active, the Legislature must have intended the juvenile to play an active role, rather than merely a passive one in the violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-4 or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The State argues that courts have not hesitated to give \u201cuse\u201d a broad interpretation consistent with its ordinary meaning and cites <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>223, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993), in support of its argument. <em>Smith </em>held that the exchange of a gun for narcotics constituted the \u201cuse\u201d of a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to ... [a] drug trafficking crime\u201d within the meaning of 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 229, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2054. The Court rejected the argument that Congress intended the statute to apply only when a firearm is used as a weapon. <em>Ibid.; cf. Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S.--, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) (use denotes active employment under \u00a7 924(c)(1) and a firearm inside a bag in a locked car trunk is not an active use of the firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">We reject defendant\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cuse\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-6 and agree with the State\u2019s contention that the word \u201cuse\u201d is to be given a broad interpretation consistent with its ordinary meaning. First, we find no ambiguity in the statute as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the statutory language is clear. Thus, we must \u201cenforce [the language] according to its terms.\u201d <em>State v. Maguire, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>508, 528, 423 A.2d 294 (1980). \u201cAbsent any explicit indications of specific meanings, the words used in a statute carry their ordinary and well-understood meanings.\u201d <em>State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 532, 641 A.2d 257 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440, 130 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>351 (1994); <em>State v. Afanador, 134 N.J. 162, </em>171, 631 A.2d 946 (1993). <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2523-24 (16th ed. 1971), defines the verb \u201cto use\u201d as \u201cto put into action or service; ... employ\u201d or \u201cto carry out a purpose or action by means of; make instrumental to an end or process; apply to advantage; turn to account; utilize.\u201d As such, the word \u201cuse\u201d has a broad meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The official commentary to the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act of 1986, <em>L. </em>1987, c. 106, adopted July 1987, states the following as the legislative intent for the adoption of N.J.S.A 2C:35-6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">This section specifically prohibits an adult from using or employing a juvenile in a scheme to illegally manufacture or distribute controlled substances. In many cases, drug traffickers use children to infiltrate schools and playgrounds. These children are used to distribute drugs to their schoolmates, and essentially become intermediaries between adult drug dealers and juvenile users. This section, which creates an offense similar to those previously set forth at N.J.S.A. 2A:96-5 and 96-5.1, provides that any adult who uses children <em>in any way to facilitate the distribution of drugs is </em>guilty of a second degree crime. Because this offense focuses on the dangers posed by the insidious act of employing children in any drug distribution scheme, the degree of the offense does not depend on the nature, quantity or purity of the controlled substance involved. Unlike current provisions in Title 2A, moreover, punishment for this offense does not depend on whether the adult defendant is an addict, since this chapter contains other provisions with respect to sentencing alternatives which are available for certain drug dependent persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">[9 <em>Criminal Justice Quarterly </em>149, 156 (Fall 1987) (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The commentary indicates that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-6 \u201ccreates an <em>offense </em>similar to those previously set forth at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A.-96-5 and 96-5.1.... \u201d If this alone were considered, defendant\u2019s argument that he cannot be charged under 2C:35-6 because he was not using E.N. to \u201cinfiltrate schools and playgrounds,\u201d \u201cdistribute drugs,\u201d \u201cbecome [an] intermediar[y] between adult drug dealers and juvenile users,\u201d or the like, might have some appeal. Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>sections, the former dealing with the conduct of an addict and the latter with a non-addict, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">A person ... who hires, employs or uses any child under the age of 18 years to transport, carry, sell, prepare for sale or offer for sale any of such drugs for any unlawful purpose, is guilty of a high misdemeanor____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The language of those statutes required some action or conduct by the juvenile, as distinct from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-6 which relates only to the conduct of the adult offender. The distinction is significant because it shows that the Legislature had previously, and could have again if it so chose, used language which required knowing conduct or involvement by the juvenile. Moreover, the commentary also provides \u201cthat any adult who uses children in any way to facilitate the distribution of drugs is guilty of a second degree crime.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The focus of the statute, as evident by the commentary, is directed to the \u201cdangers posed by the insidious act of employing children in any drug distribution scheme----\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In the present case, the child was quite visible in the car and was used by the defendant to reduce the chances that he would be stopped by the police. In our view, by employing the word \u201cuse\u201d, the Legislature intended that the statute cover the conduct of a defendant, where, such as here, the child was used to ward off detection of criminal activity. The dangers to which the child are exposed are the same. Consequently, the plain language employed by the Legislature must control resolution of the issue before us. <em>See State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 101, <em>557 </em>A.2d 277 (1989); <em>Kimmelman v. Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>123, 128, 527 A.2d 1368 (1987). Simply put, defendant may not use a child \u201cin any way to facilitate the distribution of drugs.\u201d <em>See </em>Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment on <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-6 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Further, we find no justification to restrict the language based on the child\u2019s young age. As the 1987 Legislative Commentary makes clear, the statute is designed to protect all children. <em>See </em>Cannel, <em>supra. </em>The plain words of the statute follow this purpose by providing that it is the use of \u201ca person 17 years of age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>or younger\u201d that is a necessary element. It is not the intent of the child, but the intent of the adult in using the child and the exposing of the child to danger, that the statute attempts to discourage by the enhanced penalty. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-6. Thus, the child\u2019s age should be of no significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that there was no evidence of a drug distribution scheme. Defendant testified that one of his purposes in purchasing the drugs was to share them with his fiancee in Delaware. That is sufficient to meet the element of a drug distribution scheme. <em>See State v. Heitzman, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>617, 620-21, 508 A.2d 1161 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>603, 527 A.2d 439 (1987) (defendant\u2019s admission that in addition to personal use, he intended to share the marijuana with friends was adequate basis for charge of possession with intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Finally, the sentence imposed was unexceptionable. Defendant challenges only the consecutive nature of his sentence for employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme. He urges that his violation of that statute was a nominal one and that he does not deserve a consecutive sentence which mandates the imposition of a five year parole disqualification. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Defendant pled guilty to three offenses that occurred over a period of one week. The manslaughter charge and the employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme charge were clearly separate offenses independent of one another, and committed at different times. While the crimes did not involve multiple victims, defendant pled guilty to three offenses. Although the trial judge did not expressly articulate the reasons for imposing consecutive sentences, the consecutive sentences are consistent with the guidelines adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 L.Ed.2d 308 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Just as important, the sentence imposed was pursuant to a plea agreement. Defendant faced a murder indictment with the possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>bility of a mandatory parole ineligibility term of thirty years upon conviction. In exchange for defendant\u2019s guilty pleas to the charges as noted, the State agreed to dismiss the remaining counts and to recommend a consecutive sentence which would aggregate forty years, with twenty years of parole disqualification. Consequently, the negotiated agreement reduced defendant\u2019s exposure from the possibility of life imprisonment with thirty years before parole eligibility on the murder, together with the possibility of a consecutive sentence at least for the independent heroin charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The plea agreement can appropriately be considered and weighed in the decision to impose consecutive sentences. <em>See State v. Balfour, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>30, 37-40, 637 A.2d 1249 (1994) (plea agreement may be used and weighed as a material factor in the decision to downgrade). As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201cfpjlea bargaining has become institutionalized as a legitimate, respectable, and practical tool in the efficient and fair administration of criminal justice.\u201d <em>State v. Barboza, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>415, 420, 558 A.2d 1303 (1989). While the sentence imposed must be a lawful one, the court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence in accordance with the plea agreement should be given great respect, since a \u201cpresumption of reasonableness ... attaches to criminal sentences imposed on plea bargain defendants.\u201d <em>State v. Sainz, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>283, 294, 526 A.2d 1015 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We find no abuse of the sentencing court\u2019s discretionary power. The sentence imposed was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b101-9\">STERN, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Defendant argues that his plea to employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme must be vacated. He also contends that the concurrent sentences imposed on the other offenses to which he pled guilty must stand and that the charges dismissed incident to the negotiated disposition may not be resurrected. I do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>believe that defendant would be entitled to the relief he seeks even in the absence of a factual basis for his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">As the majority points out, defendant was indicted for murder, distribution of cocaine to a minor, and endangering the welfare of a child in one indictment, and was charged with possession of heroin on a separate day in another. Following plea discussions, defendant entered into a negotiated disposition with the prosecutor. As a result defendant pled guilty to the accusation charging him with employment of a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme and to aggravated manslaughter as a lesser offense to murder and to possession of heroin, as charged in the indictments. Under the negotiated disposition, the remaining charges were to be dismissed. The State further recommended that the sentence on the heroin charge be made concurrent with the other terms and that defendant receive a maximum custodial sentence of forty years with twenty years before parole eligibility on the other offenses. In other words, defendant entered into a negotiated disposition which considerably reduced his sentence exposure. He was sentenced in accordance with the negotiated disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">If defendant prevails on his claim of an inadequate factual basis, it seems to me in these circumstances that the plea must be rejected and all charges resurrected. <em>See State v. Barboza, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>415, 420, 558 A.2d 1303 (1989); <em>State v. Rhein, </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>112, 283 A.2d 759 (App.Div.1971). It is true (as defendant argues) that in <em>State v. Lightner, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>313, 491 A.2d 1273 (1985), the Supreme Court held \u2014 based on \u201cthe singular facts of the case,\u201d 99 <em>N.J. </em>at 316, 491 A.2d 1273 \u2014 that the State could not resurrect charges dismissed as part of a negotiated plea when there was an inadequate factual basis to sustain one of the two counts to which defendant pled guilty and defendant had fully executed the sentence imposed on the other. In that case the Supreme Court held that under the circumstances this court correctly determined that defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the guilty plea to the offense should have been granted and remanded to permit vacation of the guilty plea. 99 <em>N.J. </em>at 316-17, 491 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>1273. However, the Supreme Court did not hold that defendant could not be tried for the offense on which the plea was being vacated, as would be the consequence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In <em>Barboza, </em>where there was no factual basis for the plea to aggravated manslaughter as a lesser offense to murder, defendant originally argued that she was entitled to withdraw her plea and later asserted that she had the right to have it downgraded on appellate review to an offense she had admitted on the record. The Supreme Court concluded \u201cthat if an appellate court subsequently determines that a plea has been accepted without an adequate factual basis, the plea, the judgment of conviction, and the sentence must be vacated, the dismissed charges reinstated, and defendant allowed to re-plead or to proceed to trial.\u201d 115 <em>N.J. </em>at 420, 558 A.2d 1303. Citing <em>Lightner, supra, </em>the <em>Barboza </em>Court stated that \u201c[m]ost New Jersey appellate courts, finding an insufficient factual basis to support a guilty plea, have simply vacated the conviction and allowed withdrawal of the guilty plea without any further discussion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 558 A.2d 1303. The Court concluded that \u201c[b]ecause there is an insufficient factual basis to support defendant\u2019s plea of aggravated manslaughter defendant may replead. Her conviction and sentence are vacated and the dismissed counts reinstated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 558 A.2d 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">It is true that <em>Barboza </em>involved a one count indictment, or the plea to only one charge, and does not concern the resurrection of other charges, but its language is clear. In the context of a murder prosecution where the negotiated disposition was structured in such a way as to achieve a \u201creal time\u201d consequence (eliminating exposure to the thirty real years of parole ineligibility related to a murder conviction, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b), all charges must be resurrected upon the withdrawal of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">This case is not one involving a traditional claim of an insufficient factual basis for the plea. Defendant in essence claims he cannot be found guilty of the offense as alleged. Such a claim is traditionally addressed on a motion to dismiss the indictment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>But here defendant waived indictment and trial by jury and pled guilty to an accusation filed as part of the negotiated disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Moreover, defendant has attacked the factual basis of his plea to the \u201cemploying a juvenile\u201d charge without moving to withdraw his plea or seeking relief in the trial court. <em>But see e.g., R. </em>3:21-1; <em>State v. Smullen, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>408, 416-17, 571 A.2d 1305 (1990). And his appellate argument is premised on the belief that no dismissed charges could be resurrected and \u201cthe remaining sentences imposed cannot be disturbed without violation of the double jeopardy clauses of the Fifth Amendment [and] New Jersey Constitution.\u201d The absence of any motion in the trial court is of significance to me because the record does not suggest that defendant would be entitled to the relief he seeks even if he was permitted to withdraw his plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, the record reflects that defendant entered a negotiated disposition, which took into account his intoxication and diminished capacity \u201cdefenses\u201d and the \u201cdifficulty of proving\u201d the distribution charge as alleged in the indictment (which defendant had unsuccessfully moved to dismiss), in exchange for a maximum sentence recommendation including a consecutive term for the offense defendant now seeks to have dismissed. He could have reasonably expected nothing less than the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">I do not believe a defendant can enter into a negotiated disposition to avoid a murder prosecution, advise the prosecutor of his \u201cuse\u201d of a child in a drug distribution scheme as part of the disposition, enter pleas including that offense to reduce his criminal exposure, and then be able to withdraw one of the pleas on which the entire disposition was premised without resurrecting all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>charges against him. As I understand defendant\u2019s argument, that is what he asks this court to permit, and I would reject that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">I therefore concur in the judgment of the court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\"> It is arguable that, given his argument on this appeal, defendant had no expectation of finality in the concurrent sentences imposed and that he can, therefore, be resentenced on the surviving convictions. <em>See State v. Haliski, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>1, 656 A.2d 1246 (1995). <em>See also State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>263, 478 A.2d 408 (1984). But given the maximum sentence imposed on the aggravated manslaughter and the third degree heroin conviction, the same aggregate sentence could not be achieved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
