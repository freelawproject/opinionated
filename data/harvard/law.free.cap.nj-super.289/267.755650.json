Plaintiff, a registered pharmacist, contends she suffered unlawful gender and age discrimination because she was paid less than younger male pharmacists performing comparable work. The appeal presents issues under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A, </em>10:5-1 to -42 (LAD), concerning the proper methodology for determining gender and age discrimination claims based on unequal pay when brought in the same litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">The jury rendered a verdict in favor of defendants on both the age and gender discrimination claims. The jury found \u201cby the preponderance of the evidence\u201d that plaintiff was paid less than the younger, male pharmacists \u201cwith substantially similar job descriptions,\u201d but concluded that defendants had \u201ca legitimate non-discriminatory reason\u201d for the wage disparity. On this appeal, plaintiff maintains the trial judge should have granted a directed verdict in her favor as a matter of law at the close of plaintiffs proofs, because defendants\u2019 purportedly \u201clegitimate nondiscriminatory reasons\u201d amounted to no more than subjective evaluations of plaintiffs performance which, she argues, are legal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>ly insufficient as a basis for exempting defendants from the equal pay requirements under the LAD. Plaintiff further asserts that the judge\u2019s rejection of her motion for a directed verdict inevitably led to further error in the form of improper evidentiary rulings, jury instructions, and verdict sheets and, ultimately, to the wrongful denial of her motions for judgment n.o.v. or a new trial, from which she now appeals. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In <em>Grigoletti v. Ortho Pharmaceutical, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>89, 109-10, 570 A.2d 903 (1990), our Supreme Court held that in a wage disparity case brought under the LAD on the basis of gender-discrimination, the methodology and standards of the Equal Pay Act, 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 206(d) (EPA), should be followed rather than the methodology and standards established under Title VII of the CM Rights Act of 1964, 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2000e-2 (Title VII). Hence, to make out a prima facie case of. unequal pay based on <em>gender </em>discrimination under the LAD, a complainant \u201cmust show that an employer pays different wages to employees of opposite sexes \u2018for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, </em>417 <em>U.S. </em>188, 195, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2223, 2228, 41 L.Ed.2d 1, 10 (1974) (quoting 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 206(d)(1)). <em>See Grigoletti, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 102, 570 A.2d 903. Once a complainant makes out such a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the employer to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that the difference in pay is justified by one of four affirmative defenses under the EPA: \u201c(i) a seniority system, (ii) a merit system, (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or (iv) a differential based on any factor other than sex.\u201d <em>Grigoletti, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 102-03, 570 A.2d 903 (quoting the EPA, 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 206(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">By contrast, an ape-discrimination case involving unequal pay for equal work asserted under the LAD is governed by the \u201cbroader approach\u201d of Title VII, <em>id. </em>at 98, 570 A.2d 903; <em>see Shaner v. Horizon Bancorp, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>433, 437, 561 A.2d 1130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>(1989), and imposes a \u201cless exacting\u201d burden on the complainant to prove a prima facie case of job similarity. <em>Grigoletti, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 101, 570 A.2d 903. On the other hand, the defense of an age discrimination case based on allegations of unequal pay for equal work under Title VII is less onerous for the employer than under the EPA because, under Title VII, the employer need only come forward, without \u201cany particular evidential showing,\u201d and \u201carticulate a legitimate reason\u201d for the disparate treatment, <em>id. </em>at 103, 570 A.2d 903, leaving the ultimate burden of proof on the complainant to show age discrimination by the preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 98, 570 A.2d 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In this case, it is undisputed that plaintiff established a prima facie case of unequal pay for comparable work based on age and gender under the LAD. Accordingly, the burden shifted to defendants to demonstrate they were exempt from paying plaintiff an equal wage. On appeal, as below, defendants claim they met their burden under the EPA, as to plaintiffs gender-based claim, by showing by the preponderance of the evidence that the pay differential was based on \u201cfactor[s] other than sex\u201d (the fourth affirmative defense). Likewise, as to plaintiffs age-based claim under Title VII, defendants claim they met their burden of coming forward to articulate legitimate reasons for the disparity. Implicit in defendant\u2019s position is the assertion that factors other than sex under the EPA are substantially equivalent to \u201clegitimate reasons\u201d under Title VII and that the evidence presented was sufficiently objective to overcome plaintiffs motion for a directed verdict and to support the jury\u2019s ultimate verdict in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">These are the relevant facts. Plaintiff Blodwen Bitsko, a registered pharmacist, filed a complaint against defendant Main Pharmacy, Inc. and Denis Campbell, the manager and sole shareholder of the company, alleging that the younger, male pharmacists earned higher salaries than she did for the same work in violation of the LAD and that defendants\u2019 conduct amounted to a constructive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Plaintiff began her employment at Main Pharmacy as a part-time pharmacist in September 1977 at age forty-eight shortly before her former employer, Squan Drugs, closed and defendants acquired its prescription files. Plaintiff had been a pharmacist since 1958. In 1979, Campbell hired a full-time male pharmacist and, one year later, in August 1980, plaintiff assumed full-time duties as a pharmacist at Main Pharmacy. Between 1988 and 1988, Campbell added two more full-time male pharmacists, Nicholas DiBenedetto and Glen Rassas, and three additional part-time female pharmacists, and expanded the operation such that the pharmacy employed a total of forty to fifty employees, including clerical and sales help. All the pharmacists had the same duties, which included dispensing prescribed medications, advising customers about medications, and performing other necessary duties. Campbell, as the sole owner of Main Pharmacy, made all employment decisions and worked in the pharmacy approximately sixty hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In November 1988, the plaintiff learned that she was paid less than the full-time, younger, male pharmacists. It would appear that in 1988, plaintiff earned $34,881.20 in wages whereas DiBenedetto earned $39,331.20.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff testified that upon learning of the disparity, she felt \u201cshocked, hurt, ... and betrayed,\u201d because she had considered Campbell a friend. Plaintiff also testified that she was particularly shocked by the disparity because she had never received any criticism of her work from Campbell, only compliments. She further testified that she was never put on any type of probation, reprimanded, or disciplined, nor was she ever given advice or comments on improving productivity or care during her tenure at Main Pharmacy. After learning of the salary differential between herself and the younger, male pharmacists, plaintiff d\u00e9cided to seek other employment and obtained a pharmacist position at Thrift Drug, earning an additional $10,000 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>year. On February 10, 1989, she left her employment at Main Pharmacy, claiming constructive discharge. Thereafter, plaintiff filed the complaint culminating in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">At trial, Campbell testified that his criteria in assessing employees for salary increases consisted of his personal impression of their economic benefit to the store at that time and in the future. His testimony was drastically different than plaintiffs concerning the value of her work. Campbell testified that plaintiffs performance was not equal to that of her peers in customer service or general speed. He further testified that he often helped her and later was forced to keep a part-time pharmacist on duty to assist at times because of the backlogs created when she was working. While he conceded he did not ever specifically reprimand her about her performance, he did make comments to her suggesting that she needed to increase the pace.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Campbell worked long hours in the store, frequently side-by-side with plaintiff and the other pharmacists, and thus had an ample basis upon which to compare their performances. While the results of Campbell\u2019s assessment of plaintiff were not communicated to her, Campbell testified that this was because he believed confrontation was not beneficial and that plaintiff was working to the best of her ability. Explaining his management style, he stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">[W]hen people are chastised, \u201cget that work out,\u201d or \u201cdo this,\u201d or \u201cdo that\u201d it just winds up getting worse after a while. It doesn\u2019t make them feel any better; and quite frankly, I don\u2019t really feel any better doing it either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Defendants presented a series of witnesses consisting of plaintiffs co-workers at the time of her employment to corroborate Campbell\u2019s assertions about plaintiffs lesser performance. Then-collective criticism related to five general areas: (1) that plaintiff was much slower at filling prescriptions than the other pharmacists; (2) that she filled less prescriptions than the other pharmacists; (3) that she consulted with customers far less than the other pharmacists; (4) that she failed to acknowledge or interact with the customers of the store as did the other pharmacists; and (5) that she demonstrated no management potential. Over objection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Campbell presented a random sample of prescription totals for the week of March 7, 1988 to illustrate plaintiffs lack of productivity as compared with the other two full-time, male pharmacists. The evidence showed plaintiff prepared only 328 prescriptions while DiBenedetto and Rassas prepared 527 and 455 prescriptions, respectively, working the same number of hours over the same period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Campbell also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">[S]he worked in a way that she wasn\u2019t aware of ... the other things that were going on around her____ I mean the phone could ring, and if she was doing a prescription ... she just didn\u2019t answer it. People would ask her from the front, did you do one for Mr. Jones? And there would be no response. She did one thing at a time____ Sh\u00e9 was not aware of the other things around her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">At trial, Campbell admitted he did not employ a seniority or merit system and that payment was not based upon the number of paid prescriptions, essentially conceding he had no formal written or oral policy for determining pay scales. In terms of determining what to pay his pharmacists, Campbell testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">The most important consideration would be the overall performance of that individual, and how that ... performance affected the economic benefit of Main Pharmacy today, when we were doing it, and also my perception of what that effect would be down the road, a year, two years, ten years, twenty years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">When asked about the impact that speed and quantity of filling prescriptions had on his salary determinations, Campbell testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">Well, the number of prescriptions that are filled certainly have an economic benefit ... that was one of the factors in deciding pay raises____ It was just one of many factors that went into the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-16\">[The time it took to fill a prescription] ... mattered as far as the customer service aspect and the benefit of the store was concerned____ [I]t was 10 \u00f3r 15 minutes longer[J [C]ertainly it affected the impact on the store [b]ecause the customers would be less satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-19\">On cross-examination, Campbell had further opportunity to explain the considerations that went into his salary decisions. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-20\">[P]ay raises were granted to employees based on, but not limited to, the following factors: The financial condition of Main Pharmacy, taking into consideration the positive cash-flow from the yearly profit of the corporation; the law of supply and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>demand, with regard to regional availability of registered pharmacists; the competition for registered pharmacists!;] ... the ability of the employee to generate income and profit for the corporation, which would include their ability to develop customer relationships that provide for repeat sales and provide the corporation with an opportunity to grow and prosper; the productivity of the employee, based on his or her overall performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">In the case of a pharmacist this would include but not be limited to: filling prescriptions; individual personal counseling of customers regarding their prescriptions; telephone communication skills; development of long term customer relations, particularly on a personfal] basis, where a customer\u2019s name and face are associated; development of a good relationship with the physicians!, and] ... the long-term potential of any employee to develop ... managerial skills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The judge instructed the jury separately on the gender and age discrimination claims under the LAD, explaining that each has \u201ca different set of parameters.\u201d He properly defined \u201cequal work\u201d and adequately explained the difference in the burdens of proof on an employer depending on whether a gender-based or age-based claim is involved. Under the gender-based claim, the judge explained that \u201ca differential based upon any factor other than sexual discrimination\u201d (the fourth defense under EPA), means \u201cany other reasonable, legitimate factor that would lead him to believe that that is a credible reason, a credible decision based upon something other than sexual discrimination.\u201d There was no objection to the form of the judge\u2019s explanation. On the age-based claim, the judge explained that defendants\u2019 burden was to come forward with \u201csome reasonable articulated reason so as to justify the wage disparity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">At the conclusion of the trial, as reflected on the verdict sheets, the jury found, voting five to one in favor of defendants, that \u201cplaintiff proved by the preponderance of the evidence that she was paid less than <em>male </em>pharmacists with substantially similar job descriptions\u201d and \u201cless than younger pharmacists with similar job descriptions.\u201d The jury also found defendants had satisfied their burden of showing, on the sex-discrimination claim, that they had either a \u201clegitimate ... system\u201d or a \u201clegitimate non-discriminato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ry reason ... to justify any wage disparity,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and on the age-discrimination claim, that they had a \u201csufficiently valid business reason such as a ... system ... or other legitimate non-diseriminatory reason ... to justify any wage disparity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The essential thrust of plaintiff\u2019s argument throughout the trial and on the motions for a directed verdict, judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial, as well as on this appeal, relates to the judge\u2019s interpretation of the fourth affirmative defense, \u201ca differential based on any factor other than sex.\u201d According to plaintiff, the trial judge erred by referring to the \u201cfactor other than sex\u201d as a \u201clegitimate non-discriminatory reason\u201d and by determining that an employer can defeat liability for discriminating against an older female employee performing comparable work by merely presenting <em>\u201cex post facto </em>gut feelings of subjective merit,\u201d a defense, plaintiff argues, that is \u201cincapable of being rebutted.\u201d (emphasis omitted) According to plaintiff, the federal court decisions under the EPA reveal that the fourth affirmative defense to a gender-based discrimination claim should not be allowed to serve as \u201can escape clause ... permitting] a defense of subjective merit\u201d because such lenity will result in an evisceration of this State\u2019s strong public policy against gender discrimination in unequal pay cases, relying on <em>Grigoletti, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>89, 570 A.2d 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">On the motion for a new trial, plaintiff argued that in order for defendants to have sustained their burden of proof under the fourth affirmative defense, defendants\u2019 proofs had to be \u201ca verifiable, rebuttable factor that existed at the time the employment decision was made.\u201d \u201c[I]t has to be something that is objective at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the time that it happened,\u201d such as direct communication to the employee of the employer\u2019s dissatisfaction with some aspect of her work. Therefore, she argued, Campbell\u2019s testimony that he was not as satisfied with her work effort as compared with the male pharmacists was not legally sufficient evidence to justify an exemption from the equal pay requirement. Likewise, she argued the testimony of the co-workers was not relevant because Campbell admitted he had never discussed plaintiffs performance with them nor they with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In ruling on the motion, the judge discussed the evidence presented by Campbell concerning plaintiffs lackluster performance, and rejected plaintiffs position that only by presenting \u201carticulated,\u201d \u201cverifiable\u201d evidence could defendants satisfy their burden of proof. Likewise, the judge accepted the co-workers\u2019 testimony as competent evidence to support Campbell\u2019s reasons for the wage disparity. The judge stated that not only was it relevant, but it was \u201cnecessary\u201d because their observations of plaintiffs deficiencies corroborated Campbell\u2019s testimony as well as the fact that Campbell was present on a regular basis to observe plaintiffs performance himself. In rejecting the motion, the judge concluded plaintiff could have presented rebuttal evidence but chose not to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We have reviewed the record, the arguments and factual contentions presented, and prevailing legal principles and conclude the issues raised by plaintiff are all without merit. In analyzing the reasons for the differential salary paid to plaintiff as compared with the younger male pharmacists, for purposes of this case, we perceive the \u201cany factor other than sex\u201d exemption from the requirement of equal pay under the EPA to have substantially the same meaning as \u201ca legitimate non-diseriminatory reason\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Title VII. <em>See Grigoletti, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 110, 570 A.2d 908. In <em>Grigoletti, </em>our Supreme Court observed that \u201c[i]n the federal context, it has ... been recognized that \u2018Title VII and the Equal Pay Act are to be read in <em>pari materia </em>and neither should be interpreted in a manner that would undermine the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 570 A.2d 903 (quoting <em>Parker v. Burnley, </em>693 <em>F.Supp. </em>1138, 1150 (N.D.Ga.1988)). The Court indicated that the EPA\u2019s fourth affirmative defense had actually been incorporated through the <em>Bennett </em>Amendment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> into Title VII such that any violation of one statute is also a violation of the other. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 570 A.2d 903 (citing <em>Denny v. Westfield, </em>669 <em>F.Supp. </em>1146, 1155-56 (D.Mass. 1987); 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1620.27). In this regard, the <em>Grigoletti </em>Court acknowledged the \u201cneed to harmonize [the] LAD with Title VII and [as a result] ... borrowed heavily from the federal experience to assure some reasonable degree of symmetry and uniformity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 570 A.2d 903. <em>See Aldrich v. Randolph Cent. School Dist., </em>963 <em>F.</em>2d 520 (2d Cir.1992) (observing that \u201ccourts have required employers to provide a legitimate business reason for the purported factor-other-than-sex\u201d in applying both the EPA and Title VII); <em>EEOC v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>843 F.2d 249, 253 (6th Cir.1988) (\u201c[t]he factor other than sex defense does not include literally any other factor, but a factor that, at a minimum, was adopted for a legitimate business reason.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, we are satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>fied the trial judge\u2019s use of the term \u201clegitimate factor\u201d in the jury-charge and \u201clegitimate non-discriminatory reason\u201d on the verdict sheets instead of \u201cany factor other than sex\u201d was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We also reject plaintiffs contention that the judge erred in concluding the evidence Campbell presented as proof of his \u201clegitimate non-discriminatory reasons\u201d was legally sufficient. Plaintiffs position is that Campbell\u2019s unarticulated, personal evaluations of her job worth amounts to nothing more than pure subjective judgment and, therefore, does not support defendants\u2019 claim that the salary \u201cdifferential [is] based on a factor other than sex.\u201d We disagree and note that plaintiffs argument is not supported by legal precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>616 F.2d 719, 723, 726 (4th Cir.1980), the government expressed its concern that Aetna Insurance Company had made a subjective decision to pay an existing, female employee lower wages than a new male hire who would be performing essentially comparable work. The new employee had been brought in because of his supervisory and managerial potential with the expectation he would expand Aetna\u2019s business in a different field of insurance. Id. at 726. The Fourth Circuit concluded that substantial reasons, unrelated to gender, existed for the pay differential and, therefore, the decision \u201crested on a more solid foundation than mere subjectivity.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In so concluding, the court referred to the legislative history of the EPA, noting that the \u201cany factor other than sex\u201d defense was a \u201cbroad general exception,\u201d which included \u201cdifferences based on experience, training, or ability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 309, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. 3, <em>reprinted in </em>1963 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N., 687, 689). See also </em>Hamburg, <em>supra </em>note 7, at 1095 n. 76 (discussing legislative history of EPA). Likewise, in <em>Schwartz v. Florida, </em>954 F.2d 620, 623-24 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Cir.1991), the Eleventh Circuit recognized that \u201c[s]o long as subjective business justifications, not part of a merit system, are not overly subjective so as to render them incapable of being rebutted, they are legitimate factors to be considered.\u201d The Eleventh Circuit additionally observed in <em>Morgado v. Birmingham-Jefferson Cty. Civ. Defense Corps, </em>706 F.2d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.1983), that \u201c[t]he facts necessary to establish that a wage differential has a basis in a factor other than sex are peculiarly within the knowledge of the employer[,] ... [who] will be expected to show the necessary facts.\u201d <em>See also Brock v. Georgia Southwestern College, supra, </em>765 F.2d at 1036 (observing that for allegations of \u201csuperior qualities\u201d to qualify as \u201cfactors other than sex,\u201d employer must at least explain the qualities). The principles we glean from these cases is that an employer must explain his reasons for the wage disparity, and to qualify as objective evidence in support of those reasons, trial testimony concerning the employer\u2019s observations of the employee\u2019s performance is competent evidence upon which a factfinder may rely to determine whether or not the reasons articulated by the employer are based on \u201cfactor[s] other than sex.\u201d Objective evidence is not limited to prior articulated criteria for the business judgment resulting in unequal pay for equal work.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Applying these principles to the facts presented in this case, we conclude that the reasons Campbell furnished to justify the wage differential were legitimate business reasons and, therefore, were based on \u201cfactor[s] other than sex.\u201d We are also satisfied he presented legally sufficient evidence to support his reasons for the wage disparity. The business reasons given by Campbell relate to plaintiffs job performance, specifically, her lesser productivity and ability to develop customer relations and managerial skills. Additionally, Campbell\u2019s personal observations of plaintiffs performance, as corroborated by the testimony of the co-employees who observed her at work, constitute objective evidence to demonstrate his disparate treatment of plaintiff as based on \u201cfactor[s] other than sex.\u201d Campbell adequately explained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>importance of these skills to operating a profitable pharmacy, and we cannot say that his conclusions about plaintiffs performance were based only on his \u201cpersonal, ... ill-informed judgments.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We also conclude that the jury had adequate instructions and proper verdict sheets upon which to base its decision. The requirements for the adequacy of a civil jury charge were discussed in <em>Navarro v. George Koch &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 512 A.2d 507 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>48, 526 A.2d 138 (1986). A jury charge \u201cmust outline the function' of the jury, set forth the issues, correctly state the applicable law in understandable language, and plainly spell out how the jury should apply the legal principles to the facts as it may find them,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 570, 512 A.2d 507 (citing <em>Jurman v. Samuel Braen, Inc., </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>586, 591-92, 222 A.2d 78 (1966)), and in the last analysis, the question is whether or not the jury was confused or misled by the charge as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 222 A.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">We are satisfied from our review of the charge in its entirety that the jury was not mislead or confused,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> especially in light of the verdict sheets which focused the jurors on the applicable law and the burdens of proof in the case. These observations aside, however, we are constrained to remark that although pattern charges are often helpful to trial courts in explaining to the jury how it should apply the legal principles to the facts of a case, it is not always sufficient to merely read the principles and define the relevant terms. Here, it would have been better had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>judge related the law to the facts. We recognize, of course, that a judge is not obligated to comment on the evidence, <em>Borowicz v. Hood, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 428-24, 209 A.2d 655 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>298, 212 A.2d 170 (1965). Nonetheless, the better practice in complex cases is to discuss the law in the context of the material facts of the case, reviewing the evidence, where appropriate. <em>See State v. Concepcion, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>373, 379, 545 A.2d 119 (1988). Such comments can assist the jury in reaching correct results and are appropriate provided they are not made to control the jury\u2019s findings. <em>Borowicz v. Hood, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 423, 209 A.2d 655. Notwithstanding, in the circumstances of this case, the omission of judicial comment on the evidence neither denied plaintiff a fair trial nor resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Ultimately, it was for the jury to determine the credibility of Campbell\u2019s testimony regarding his reasons for. the wage disparity, and it clearly resolved that issue in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Finally, we reject plaintiffs challenge to' the trial judge\u2019s decision not to allow her to admit the profit and loss statements of Main Pharmacy and a magazine article discussing wages paid to pharmacists. The judge determined the evidence was not relevant to the issues raised in the case. The trial judge\u2019s discretion in excluding evidence is broad and should stand unless so wide of the mark that it results in a manifest denial of justice. <em>Ratner v. General Motors Corp., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197, 202, 574 A.2d 541 (App.Div.1990). We perceive no mistake in the exercise of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">For the reasons expressed, we decline to interfere with the jury\u2019s verdict. We conclude that the verdict represents a rational resolution of the dispute between the parties supported by a fair analysis of the record. We find no miscarriage of justice under the law. <em>R. </em>2:10-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\"> The record is unclear concerning the exact wage differentials for the period in question.
