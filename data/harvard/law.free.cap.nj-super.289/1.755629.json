At issue is whether <em>State v. Coyle, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>194, 574 A.2d 951 (1990), which prohibits sequential jury charges in murder cases where there is evidence of passion/provocation, should be applied retroactively to convictions that had become final prior to the date the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was rendered. We hold that defendant and others similarly situated who had exhausted all avenues of direct review before <em>Coyle </em>was decided may not obtain post-conviction relief on the ground that sequential jury instructions were given at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Following a lengthy jury trial, defendant was convicted of murder (N.J.S.A 2C:ll-3a) and was sentenced to a term of thirty years without parole eligibility. We affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence in an unpublished opinion. The Supreme Court denied certification on September 6,1989. <em>State v. Cupe, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>635, 569 A.2d 1336 (1989). Two years later, defendant filed her first petition for post-conviction relief. The Law Division summarily dismissed the petition on the prosecutor\u2019s motion. We reversed on the ground that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel in the post-conviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">On remand, defendant contended for the first time that she was denied due process because the trial court had given sequential instructions that had the potential to foreclose jury consideration of whether passion/provocation reduced the otherwise purposeful killing from murder to manslaughter. The trial transcript disclosed that after the initial charge on purposeful murder, the court had instructed the jury that it need not consider the lesser-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>included offense of manslaughter unless it determined that the State had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the offense of murder. Although later in its instructions the trial court had told the jury emphatically to return a verdict of manslaughter if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was purposeful but harbored a reasonable doubt as to whether defendant acted in the heat of passion under reasonable provocation, defense counsel argued that the charge suffered from the same infirmity as that present in <em>Coyle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The trial court in the post-conviction proceeding agreed that the instruction given at trial violated <em>Coyle\u2019s </em>prohibition against sequential charges. The court noted, however, that <em>Coyle </em>was decided long after the trial and that the instructions given essentially mirrored the model jury charges in effect at the time. Because it had relied upon settled law in formulating the jury instructions, the trial court determined that it would be unfair to permit defendant to rely on the <em>Coyle </em>decision to obtain post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">As we noted, defendant exhausted all avenues of direct review on September 6, 1989. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coyle </em>was rendered on June 11, 1990. The question of Coyle\u2019s retroactive application is thus squarely presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Before addressing that issue, we quickly reject the State\u2019s three-pronged argument that defendant\u2019s petition was proeedurally barred because the claim of <em>Coyle </em>error (1) was raised, litigated and decided in the direct appeal, or (2) could have been raised in prior proceedings, but was not, and (3) in any event, was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Initially, we are satisfied that the claim of error advanced in defendant\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief was neither raised nor decided in prior proceedings. In the direct appeal, we dealt with defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s charge was deficient because it failed to convey to the jury the State\u2019s burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of disproving passion/provocation beyond a reasonable doubt. We concluded that the trial court\u2019s instructions comported with our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Grunow, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>133, 506 A.2d 708 (1986). <em>See also State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 419 A.2d 406 (1980). We are convinced that the issue raised and decided in defendant\u2019s direct appeal and that advanced in her petition for post-conviction relief are not \u201cidentical\u201d or \u201csubstantially equivalent.\u201d <em>State v. Bontempo, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>220, 234, 406 A.2d 203 (Law Div.1979); <em>see also Picard v. Connor, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>270, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>509, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971). While we deplore the practice of couching essentially the same argument in different constitutional verbiage in order to evade the prohibition against relitigating issues already decided, <em>see R. </em>3:22-5; <em>State v. Trantino, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>176, 180, 287 A.2d 177 (1972); <em>State v. Smith, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>67, 74, 202 A.2d 669 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 <em>U.S. </em>1005, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>731, 13 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>706 (1965), we find no abuse of the post-conviction relief procedure in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We are also unpersuaded by the State\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s claim is barred by <em>R. </em>3:22-4. Under that rule, any ground for relief not raised in a prior proceeding may not be advanced by way of a petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Ibid. </em>The general rule is that an issue which could have been raised upon direct appeal, but was not, will not be cognizable in a post-conviction relief proceeding. <em>State v. Cerbo, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>595, 605, 397 A.2d 671 (1979); <em>State v. Levine, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 155, 601 A.2d 249 (App.Div.1992). However, the rule is subject to several exceptions. If, for example, the alleged error arguably deprived defendant of his fundamental right to a fair trial or possibly infringed a constitutional requirement, the bar does not apply. <em>See State v. Reynolds, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>597, 602, 206 A.2d 750 (1965). Against this backdrop, it is at least arguable that defendant\u2019s petition advanced a claim of constitutional dimension. While \u201c[c]loaking [a] claim in constitutional language will not guarantee relief],]\u201d a genuinely alleged serious defect in the jury charges will circumvent the procedural prohibition. <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>565, 584-85, 601 A.2d 198 (1992); <em>see also State v. Sloan, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 612, 545 A.2d 230 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>647, 552 A.2d 171 (1988); <em>State v. Koch, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>421, 429-30, 288 A.2d 295 (App.Div.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Equally devoid of merit is the claim that defendant\u2019s petition was untimely. <em>R. </em>3:22-12 provides that, except to correct an illegal sentence, a petition for post-conviction relief must be filed not more than five years after rendition of the judgment. Defendant\u2019s original petition was filed within the prescribed period. Following our reversal, the petition was amended to raise the sequential charge argument. We are satisfied that the amended petition related back to the original filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">We now address the issue of whether <em>Coyle </em>should be applied retroactively. The threshold question is whether federal or State law governs resolution of this issue. To the extent that retroactivity issues arise in the context of criminal procedural decisions implicating rights guaranteed by the federal constitution, United States Supreme Court decisions control the scope of retroactive application of a particular case. <em>See State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>331, 335, 567 A.2d 197 (1989); <em>State v. Stever, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>543, 550-52, 527 A.2d 408, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>954, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>348, 98 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>373 (1987). However, our courts have the inherent power to decide the retroactive scope of their own case holdings relating to New Jersey law. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 334, 567 A.2d 197; <em>Coons v. American Honda Motor Co., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>419, 476 A.2d 763 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>1123, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>808, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>800 (1985); <em>State v. Hunt, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>338, 450 A.2d 952 (1982); <em>State v. Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>394, 427 A.2d 525 (1981); <em>State v. Czachor, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>392, 413 A.2d 593 (1980); <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127, 386 A.2d 378 (1978); <em>State v. Nash, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>464, 317 A.2d 689 (1974); <em>Darrow v. Hanover Tp., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>410, 278 A.2d 200 (1971); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>572, 206 A.2d 737 (1965), <em>aff'd, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>719, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1772, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>882 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Within this analytical framework, it is apparent that defendant\u2019s due process argument implicates federal constitutional principles. <em>See Boyde v. California, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>370, 380, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1190, 1197-98, 108 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>316, 329 (1990) (jury instruction is unconstitutional if it prevents the consideration of relevant evidence). Nevertheless, her claim is essentially predicated on New Jersey law. As noted in <em>Coyle, </em>a number of jurisdictions' condone the use of sequential charges, 119 <em>N.J. </em>at 223, 574 A.2d 951, and it is not altogether clear that \u201cacquittal first\u201d instructions, even when given in murder cases where there is evidence of passion/provocation, are so erroneous under state law as to rise to the level of a federal constitutional violation. <em>See Gilmore v. Taylor, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>333, 349, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2112, 2121, 124 L.Ed.2d 306, 322 (1993) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment). Given the underpinnings of the decision in <em>Coyle, </em>which are steeped in New Jersey\u2019s historical treatment of lesser-included offenses, <em>see State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 318, 419 A.2d 406, we are satisfied that this State\u2019s retroactivity rules should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In reaching that conclusion, we note one additional consideration. While it has been said that our rules on retroactivity are generally consistent with the most recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court, <em>State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 567 A.2d 197, federal standards tend to be more restrictive in allowing defendants to rely on new holdings when collaterally attacking criminal judgments. <em>See, e.g., Gilmore v. Taylor, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>333, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2112, 124 L.Ed.2d 306; <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>364, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>838, 122 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>180 (1993); <em>Graham v. Collins, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>461, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>892, 122 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>260 (1993); <em>Wright v. West, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>277, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2482, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 (1992); <em>Stringer v. Black, </em>503 <em>U.S. 222, </em>112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1130, 117 L.Ed.2d 367 (1992); <em>Sawyer v. Smith, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>227, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2822, 111 L.Ed.2d 193 (1990); <em>Saffle v. Parks, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>484, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1257, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990); <em>Butler v. McKellar, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>407, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>1212, 108 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>347 (1990); <em>Penry v. Lynaugh, </em>492 <em>U.S. </em>302, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989); <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>288, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1060, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>334 (1989). Because we believe defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>dant\u2019s claim implicates both federal and State constitutional principles, we conclude that if we are to err, we should err on the side of caution by applying the more liberal New Jersey standards in determining retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Subject to the weighing process we will describe shortly, a case decided after a defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence has become final may not provide the basis for post-conviction relief if it announces a new rale of law. The threshold issue in a retroactivity analysis under our law is whether the case to be applied retroactively announced a new rule of law. <em>State v. Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 403, 427 A.2d 525. \u201cThe issue of retroactivity \u2018never arises absent a new rule of <em>law...State v. Harvey, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>407, 421, 581 A.2d 483 (1990) (quoting <em>State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 344, 567 A.2d 197 (Clifford, J., concurring in the judgment)), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>931, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1336, 113 L.Ed.2d 268 (1991). \u201cNew rule\u201d status does not turn on whether the .case overruled a prior decision or whether it was a logical outgrowth of a prior holding. <em>State v. DeSanto, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 458, 384 A.2d 1169 (Cty.Ct.1978). New rules \u201c \u2018clear[ly] break with the past,\u2019 \u201d and tend to \u201c \u2018disrupt[ ] a practice long accepted and widely relied upon____\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 338, 567 A.2d 197 (quoting <em>Milton v. Wainwright, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>371, 381-82 n. 2, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2174, 2179 n. 2, 33 L.Ed.2d 1, 9 n. 2 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Focusing on these characteristics, we recognize that <em>Coyle </em>is doctrinally consistent with prior decisions holding that trial courts should submit the question of passion/provocation manslaughter to the jury on request if an examination of the record discloses evidence satisfying the rational basis test, <em>State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 418, 568 A.2d 879 (1990); <em>State v. Crisantos, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>265, 278, 508 A.2d 167 (1986); <em>State v. Sinclair, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>525, 540, 231 A.2d 565 (1967), and even absent a request when the appropriateness of such an instruction is clearly indicated by the proofs, <em>State v. Robinson, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>476, 489-92, 643 A.2d 591 (1994); <em>State v. Choice, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>295, 299, 486 A.2d 833 (1985); <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 318, 419 A.2d 406. .At least from the vantage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>point of twenty-twenty hindsight, it cannot fairly be said that these decisions were unlikely progenitors of <em>Coyle </em>or that they did not foreshadow a prohibition against sequential charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Equally clear, however, is the fact that <em>Coyle </em>was not dictated by precedent existing at the time of defendant\u2019s conviction. As the trial court properly noted, the model charge contained sequential instructions. <em>Coyle </em>plainly represents a sudden and generally unanticipated repudiation of a long-standing practice. In determining whether and to what extent <em>Coyle </em>is to be applied retroactively, we are influenced by \u201cthe degree of reliance placed on the old rule by those who administered it....\u201d <em>State v. Nash, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 471, 317 A.2d 689. This analysis leads to the conclusion that <em>Coyle </em>was sufficiently novel and unanticipated to justify limiting the scope of the decision\u2019s retroactive application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Obviously, the Supreme Court is the final arbiter as to the reach of its decisions. However, the issue is before us. We do not write upon a blank slate. The Supreme Court has categorized available options for retroactivity in the following terms.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">[W]e note that this Court has four options open to it in any decision involving retroactivity: (1) make the new rule of law purely prospective, applying it only to cases whose operative facts arise after the new rule is announced; (2) apply the new rule to future cases and to the parties in the case announcing the new rule, while applying the old rule to all other pending and past litigation; (3) grant the new rule limited retroactivity, applying it to cases in (1) and (2) as well as to pending cases where the parties have not yet exhausted all avenues of direct review; and, finally, (4) give the new rule complete retroactive effect, applying it to all cases, even those where final judgments have been entered and all avenues of direct review exhausted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\"><em>[State v. Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 402-03, 427 A.2d 525; <em>see also State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 339, 567 A.2d 197; <em>State v. Nash, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 468-70, 317 A.2d 689.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The Court has weighed the following factors in determining which option to choose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">(1) the purpose of the rule and whether it would be furthered by a retroactive application, (2) the degree of reliance placed on the old rule by those who administered it, and (3) the effect a retroactive application would have on the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\"><em>[State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 339-40, 567 A.2d 197 (quoting <em>State v. Nash, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 471, 317 A.2d 689); <em>cf. Fischer v. Canario, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>235, 244-245, 670 A.2d 516 (1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Applying these factors, we are satisfied that a defendant who had exhausted all avenues of direct review prior to the announcement of <em>Coyle </em>should not receive the benefit of that decision in a collateral attack upon a final judgment of conviction. The purpose of the <em>Coyle </em>decision is to ensure that a jury fairly considers the lesser-included offense of passion/provocation manslaughter. While we recognize that sequential charges have the potential to foreclose such consideration, that danger is substantially diminished where the trial court has unequivocally instructed the jury to convict the defendant of passion/provocation manslaughter if it harbors a reasonable doubt the murder was committed in the heat of passion upon reasonable provocation. Given the degree of reliance placed by trial judges on the model charges, the duty of the jury to consider the instructions in their entirety, <em>see, e.g., State v. Zola, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>384, 405-06, 548 A.2d 1022 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1022, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1146, 103 L.Ed.2d 205 (1989), and the potentially disruptive effect of full retroactivity, we are satisfied that the interests of finality outweigh any benefit that would be realized by application of <em>Coyle </em>to convictions affirmed on appeal prior to its announcement. <em>State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 343, 567 A.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">We previously noted that New Jersey\u2019s rules of retroactivity are more liberal than those applied by the federal courts. The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201ca case announces a new rule if the result was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.\u201d <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>at 301, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1070, 103 L.Ed.2d at 349. The Court has also concluded that, subject to two narrow exceptions, a case that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>decided after a defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence became final may not provide a basis for federal <em>habeas corpus </em>relief if it announces a new rule. <em>Id. </em>at 305-11, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1073-76, 103 L.Ed.2d at 352-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Although the analogy between federal <em>habeas </em>proceedings and our post-conviction relief remedy is imperfect, <em>State v. Lark, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 343, 567 A.2d 197, we add that our decision is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gilmore v. Taylor, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>333, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2112, 124 L.Ed.2d 306. There, the petitioner was convicted of murder by an Illinois jury. After his conviction became final, the petitioner sought federal <em>habeas corpus </em>relief on the grounds that the sequential instructions given by the trial court violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted relief on the basis of its decision in <em>Falconer v. Lane, </em>905 F.2d 1129 (7th Cir.1990), which was decided eleven days after the petitioner filed his <em>habeas </em>petition and which held that the Illinois pattern jury instructions were unconstitutional because they allowed a jury to return a murder verdict without considering whether the defendant possessed a mental state supportive of a voluntary manslaughter verdict. <em>Gilmore v. Taylor, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>at 335-39, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2114-16, 124 L.Ed.2d at 313-16. The Supreme Court reversed on the ground that <em>Falconer </em>announced a \u201cnew rule\u201d that should not have been applied to convictions that had become final prior to the date that decision was rendered. <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2119, 124 L.Ed.2d at 319-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">We find <em>Gilmore </em>highly persuasive. In doing so, we do not diminish the importance of <em>Coyle. </em>The prohibition against sequential charges eradicates any potential that the jury might fail to consider a lesser-included offense supported by the evidence. Nevertheless, <em>Coyle </em>does not represent a \u201c \u2018watershed rule[ ] of criminal procedure\u2019 implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Saffle v. Parks, </em>494 <em>U.S. </em>at 495, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1264, 108 L.Ed.2d at 429 (quoting <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>at 311, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1076, 103 L.Ed.2d at 356); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Gilmore v. Taylor, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>at 345, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2119, 124 L.Ed.2d at 320. Although <em>Coyle </em>expressed concern that sequential instructions might have some tendency to confuse a jury, its holding does not fall into that limited core of rules \u201c \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019\u201d <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>at 311, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1076, 103 L.Ed.2d at 356 (quoting <em>Mackey v. United States, </em>401 <em>U.S. </em>667, 693, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1171, 1180, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Accordingly, the Law Division\u2019s order denying post-conviction relief is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-10\"> The novelty of the <em>Coyle </em>holding also leads us to reject defendant\u2019s argument that she was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to the failure of her trial and appellate attorneys to raise the <em>Coyle </em>issue at trial and on direct appeal. It cannot fairly be said that failure to anticipate the development of the rule announced in <em>Coyle </em>rendered the performance of defendant\u2019s attorneys objectively unreasonable. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 688-89, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 2064-65, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674, 693-94 (1984); <em>State v. Savage, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>594, 614, 577 A.2d 455 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 52, 519 A.2d 336 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
