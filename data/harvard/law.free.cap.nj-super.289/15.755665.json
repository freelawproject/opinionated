On March 13,1987, the court sentenced defendant as a persistent offender to an extended term of life imprisonment, with twenty years of parole ineligibility, for the armed robbery. On June 5,1987, the court also sentenced defendant as a persistent offender to an extended term of ten years imprisonment, with five years of parole ineligibility, for receiving stolen property, to be served consecutively to his sentence for armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">On appeal, we affirmed both of defendant\u2019s convictions but vacated the sentences and remanded for resentencing. <em>State v. Dugan, </em>A-5392-86T4 (decided Nov. 6, 1989); <em>State v. Dugan, </em>A-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>5709-86T4 (decided Dec. 7, 1989). The Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s petition for certification of our decision affirming his conviction for armed robbery. 121 <em>N.J. </em>620, 583 A.2d 319 (1990). On January 31, 1990, the trial court resentenced defendant to an extended term of fifty years imprisonment, with fifteen years of parole ineligibility, for armed robbery and to a consecutive term of five years imprisonment, with one year of parole ineligibility, for receiving stolen property. On appeal from the amended judgments of convictions entered upon resentencing, we affirmed, <em>State v. Dugan, </em>A-3788-89T4 (decided July 29, 1992), and the Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s petition for certification. 133 <em>N.J. </em>429, 627 A.2d 1136 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On January 25, 1994, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court denied this petition on the ground that, with the exception of a challenge to the legality of defendant\u2019s sentence which is not being pursued on this appeal, defendant\u2019s claims were foreclosed by <em>Rule </em>3:22-12, which bars a petition for post-conviction relief filed \u201cmore than 5 years after rendition of the judgment or sentence sought to be attacked\u201d unless defendant shows \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">On appeal, defendant makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING THAT ALL POST-CONVICTION RELIEF ISSUES, OTHER THAN ILLEGAL SENTENCE WERE TIME-BARRED (Partially Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">A. The Petition for Post-Conviction Relief was Timely, Since it was Filed Within Five Years of the Last Judgments of Conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">B. The Petition for PosL-Conviction Relief Was Timely, Since Appellate Remedies Had Not Been Exhausted Until January 1,1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-11\">II. EVEN IF DEFENDANT\u2019S PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF WAS UNTIMELY, HIS RELIANCE ON COUNSEL, HIS PLAIN READING OF <em>R. </em>3:22-3 AND CASE-LAW CONSTITUTES EXCUSABLE NEGLECT (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-12\">III. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES, BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE AND THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE REQUIRE GRANTING THIS PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF <em>U.S. CONST. </em>AMEND. VI; <em>N.J. CONST. </em>(1947) ART. I, PAR. 10 (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-13\">IV. DEFENDANT IS ENTITLED TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING ON HIS PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>We reject defendant\u2019s arguments and affirm the denial of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\"><em>Rule </em>8:22-12 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">No ... petition shall be filed pursuant to this rule more than 5 years after rendition of the judgment or sentence sought to be attacked unless it alleges facts showing that the delay beyond said time was due to defendant\u2019s excusable neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The five year period for filing a petition for post-conviction relief allowed by this rule commences with the entry of a judgment of conviction. <em>State v. Riley, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 389, 523 A.2d 1089 (App.Div.1987). Although <em>Rule </em>3:22-3 provides that a petition \u201cmay not be filed while [an appeal from the conviction] is available,\u201d the pendency of a direct appeal does not toll the running of the five year limitations period imposed by <em>Rule </em>3:22-12. <em>State v. Dillard, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>722, 727, 506 A.2d 848 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>527, 523 A.2d 169 (1986). The essential objective of this limitations period is \u201cthe need for achieving finality of judgments and to allay the uncertainty associated with an unlimited possibility of relitigation.\u201d <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>565, 576, 601 A.2d 198 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Although defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction for armed robbery was entered on March 13, 1987, and his judgment of conviction for receiving stolen property was entered on June 5, 1987, he filed his petition for post-conviction relief more than six and a half years later on January 25, 1994. Therefore, if defendant\u2019s time for filing a petition ran from the entry of the original judgments, his petition was barred by <em>Rule </em>3:22-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">However, defendant argues that the five-year period for filing a petition for post-conviction relief did not commence until the entry of the amended judgments of conviction reflecting his resentencings pursuant to remands from this court. We reject this argument as being inconsistent with both the language and the essential objective of <em>Rule </em>3:22-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\"><em>Rule </em>3:22-12 requires a petition for post-conviction relief to be filed within five years \u201cafter rendition of the judgment <em>or </em>sentence sought to be attacked.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, the rule distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>guishes between a petition attacking a judgment of conviction and a petition attacking a sentence, requiring a defendant to file a petition for post-conviction relief within five years of whatever judicial action he is attacking. A defendant may be resentenced not only, as in these cases, pursuant to a remand from an appellate court which has affirmed his conviction but also on any one of the grounds set forth in <em>Rule </em>3:21-10(b). <em>Rule </em>3:22-12 authorizes a defendant to file a petition attacking any resentencing proceedings within five years thereafter, but by distinguishing between a judgment of conviction and a sentencing, the rule indicates that resentencing does not extend the time for filing a petition attacking the conviction. Similarly, <em>Rule </em>3:22-3 prohibits the filing of a petition for post-conviction relief while \u201cappellate review\u201d of a \u201cconviction\u201d is' \u201cavailable,\u201d but it does not bar a petition for post-conviction relief attacking a conviction simply because a defendant is seeking sentencing relief in a trial or appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Our conclusion that a petition for post-conviction relief must be filed within five years of entry of the judgment memorializing the conviction even if further trial proceedings relating to the sentence are conducted during the interim period is also supported by the underlying objective of <em>Rule </em>3:22-12 to \u201cstrongly encourag[e] those believing they have grounds for post-conviction relief to bring their claims swiftly, and [to] diseourag[e] them from sitting on their rights until it is too late for a court to render justice.\u201d <em>State v. Mitchell, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 601 A.2d 198. As previously noted, a defendant may be resentenced not only pursuant to a remand from an appellate court which has affirmed his conviction but also on any one of the grounds set forth in <em>Rule </em>3:21-10(b), which include a change of sentence to permit entry into a drug treatment program, <em>R. </em>3:21 \u2014 10(b)(1), or release from custody because of illness or infirmity, <em>R. </em>3:21 \u2014 10(b)(2). Such resentencing proceedings may occur many years after a defendant\u2019s conviction and an affirmance on appeal. Thus, if <em>Rule </em>3:22-12 were construed to re-trigger the five-year period for filing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>petition for post-conviction relief any time the court entered an amended judgment of conviction memorializing a resentencing, a defendant would be able to pursue a petition for post-conviction relief many years after his trial, when witnesses and counsel may have died or disappeared and memories of both the crime and the trial proceedings inevitably will have dimmed. We decline to give <em>Rule </em>3:22-12 an interpretation which is so clearly contrary to its underlying objective. See <em>State v. Mitchell, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 575, 601 A.2d 198. Therefore, we conclude that defendant\u2019s petition, insofar as it was directed at his 1987 convictions, was filed beyond the five-year period allowed under <em>Rule </em>3:22-12.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We further conclude that defendant failed to show \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d for the late filing of the petition attacking his conviction. In <em>State v. Mitchell, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 580, 601 A.2d 198, the Court indicated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">[A] court should relax <em>Rule </em>3:22-12\u2019s bar only under exceptional circumstances. The court should consider the extent and cause of the delay, the prejudice to the State, and the importance of the petitioner\u2019s claim in determining whether there has been an \u201cinjustice\u201d sufficient to relax the time limits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Defendant delayed more than a year and a half after expiration of the five year period allowed by <em>Rule </em>3:22-12 before filing his petition, and the primary claim raised by the petition \u2014 that defendant received ineffective assistance of trial counsel \u2014 -rests on factual allegations outside the trial record that would require an evidentiary hearing relating to the conduct of his trial held more than nine years ago. Consequently, defendant\u2019s delay in filing his petition was significant, and the State would be substantially prejudiced if it were required to oppose defendant\u2019s petition and, if he were successful, to retry him for the underlying crimes this many years after the events in question. Furthermore, defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims relate essentially to matters of trial strategy which would have been unlikely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>succeed even if pursued in a timely manner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the denial of defendant\u2019s petition as untimely does not result in an \u201cinjustice\u201d sufficient to warrant a relaxation of <em>Rule </em>3:22-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that his delay was \u201cexcusable\u201d because he relied on his view that <em>Rule </em>3:22-12 gave him five years after entry of the amended judgments of conviction to file his petition. There is no evidence in the trial record that this was the real reason for defendant\u2019s delay. In any event, such a misunderstanding of the meaning of the rule would not constitute \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under the circumstances of this ease. <em>Cf. State v. D.D.M., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>83, 100-01, 657 A.2d 837 (1995) (rejecting defendant\u2019s claim that his \u201cpsychological treatment\u201d while incarcerated provided a basis for finding of \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d within the intent of <em>Rule </em>3:22-12); <em>see also State v. Miller, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>122, 129, 649 A.2d 94 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>449, 663 A.2d 1356 (1995); <em>State v. White, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>531, 538-41, 617 A.2d 272 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>436, 627 A.2d 1141 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\"> Insofar as defendant\u2019s petition may be read to attack his 1990 resentencings, it is timely but clearly without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\"> We note that defendant alleges Bernadette Bates and John Hosley could have provided testimony supporting a defense that the robbery victims consented to his taking properly from the gas station where they worked as part of a drug transaction. However, these individuals were initially listed as defense witnesses at trial, and defense counsel subsequently informed the court that \"the initial strategy of this case ... has changed in the middle of the case\" and that, with defendant\u2019s consent, he had decided not to call either Bates or Hosley.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
