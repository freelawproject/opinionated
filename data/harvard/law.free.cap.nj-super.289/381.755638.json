As part of its plan to rehabilitate blighted areas along its northern waterfront, Jersey City authorized Newport Associates Development Company (Newport) to acquire properties within the boundaries of the project. With respect to properties Newport could not purchase, Jersey City authorized JCRA to institute condemnation proceedings. Newport thus joined JCRA\u2019s actions against COM and Florence. Following initial skirmishes, the parties entered into a settlement agreement that was incorporated in a consent judgment. Unfor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>tunately, the consent judgment was not the end, nor the beginning of the end, nor even the end of the beginning of the parties\u2019 disputes. Instead, it spawned an explosion of fragmented and protracted litigation over which four different judges presided and which occupies literally thousands of pages of transcript. Despite the diversity of the claims and counterclaims advanced, we discern two common threads \u2014 the valuation of COM\u2019s property and the claims among the parties concerning the transfer of the owners\u2019 interests to Newport and JCRA. A jury fixed just compensation for the taking of COM\u2019s property in the amount of $2,200,000. COM was also awarded approximately $175,000 in relocation expenses and prejudgment interest at the judgment rate rather than at its mortgage rate. However, its claim for counsel fees was denied. Newport lost its action to compel Florence to specifically perform extensive renovations required by the consent judgment. Newport was also denied damages arising from COM\u2019s delay in vacating its property but was granted attorneys\u2019 fees expended in pursuing this claim. The parties filed separate appeals and cross-appeals, which we now consolidate. We affirm the judgments and orders from which these appeals and cross-appeals are taken with the exception of the order awarding Newport counsel fees respecting its unsuccessful claim for delay damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Although this case has a lengthy and tortured procedural history, we recite only those facts critical to our disposition of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">This litigation concerns two properties included in Jersey City\u2019s northern waterfront redevelopment project known as \u201cNewport City.\u201d The properties in question were COM\u2019s, located at 606 Henderson Street in Jersey City, and Florence\u2019s, located at 574-88 Henderson Street. Jerry Mecca was the sole shareholder of both COM and Florence. Jersey City\u2019s governing body defined the borders of the redevelopment area and passed an ordinance containing a redevelopment plan, which the developer, Newport, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>would follow. As we noted, the plan called for Newport to purchase all necessary property interests within the project area, but the City authorized JCRA to acquire through condemnation those properties Newport could not otherwise obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">On March 8,1985, JCRA filed a condemnation complaint against COM, setting the value of COM\u2019s property at $500,000, reflecting $34,550 for the land and $465,450 for the \u201cimprovements.\u201d The complaint named Florence as a tenant in COM\u2019s property, as well as other defendants not involved in this appeal. On the same day, JCRA filed a separate condemnation complaint against Florence, fixing the value of Florence\u2019s property at $1,200,000 based on a land value of $115,000 and improvements worth $1,085,000. COM and Florence answered jointly, alleging that JCRA had engaged in various illegalities and conspiracies, had abused its authority by including their properties in the redevelopment project, and had failed to negotiate in good faith as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">On November 4, 1987, the parties executed a settlement agreement which was incorporated in a consent judgment. The agreement declared that certain significant renovations to the Florence structures and grounds would make the property compatible with the redevelopment plan, thus obviating the need for condemnation. Florence was to submit detailed plans and specifications to Newport for its review. Upon Newport\u2019s approval, Florence was to complete the renovations in accordance with the plans. Florence also agreed to maintain the buildings as a warehouse for a ten year period and not to lease them without Newport\u2019s consent. Finally, it was agreed that trial of the condemnation complaint would be held in abeyance for six to nine months, during which time Florence was to make \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in performing the renovations. If \u201csubstantial progress\u201d was not made within this period, or if the renovations were not completed within two years, JCRA was authorized to condemn the property and transfer it to Newport.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The future of the COM property was also contingent, but in a different way. COM was required to \u201cdeliver possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>[property], free of debris and in good order\u201d to Newport by January 15, 1988. COM could extend that date by two months upon the condition that it cooperate with Newport in determining whether Newport\u2019s contiguous building could be demolished without unreasonably affecting occupancy of COM\u2019s building. The parties were not confident of that possibility, however, as evidenced by the fact that valuation of the COM property was to \u201cforthwith proceed to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">It soon became apparent that the settlement agreement was merely a lull in the gathering storm, a false armistice between the warring parties. In May 1988, Newport moved to enforce the agreement. Following an evidentiary hearing, the Law Division rendered an oral opinion in which it found that COM had \u201cwillfully\u201d failed to vacate its property and that Florence had failed to submit construction plans and specifications as required by the consent judgment. The court ordered COM to vacate its property within five days and directed Florence to submit the required renovation plans within twenty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Both COM and Florence moved for reconsideration. Following hearings on that motion, the parties entered into a consent order on July 29, 1988. The order required COM to deliver possession of its property to Newport in \u201cbroom clean condition\u201d by September 1, 1988. Newport was to be awarded <em>$10,000 </em>for each day COM failed to \u201cdeliver actual possession of the premises and building.\u201d The order further provided that Newport\u2019s claim for damages arising from COM\u2019s prior failure to vacate was to be tried by another judge. Under the order, COM agreed to accept $119,200 from JCRA for relocation expenses and to submit any further disputes regarding \u201cloading costs\u201d for resolution by administrative proceedings pursuant to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Uniform Relocation Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On September 1, 1988, COM physically vacated its premises, and on September 7, 1988, Newport received a deed to the property from JCRA. However, on September 8, 1988, Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>City\u2019s municipal council approved a resolution revising the redevelopment plan by removing COM\u2019s and Florence\u2019s properties as well as several others from the redevelopment area. On September 9, 1988, the council instructed Jersey City\u2019s construction officer not to issue \u201cany demolition or other permits related to\u201d the properties that might be eliminated from the project, including those belonging to COM and Florence. That same day, defendants\u2019 attorney sent a letter to Public Service Electric &amp; Gas, advising it to \u201ccontact [its] legal department before attempting to remove or alter\u201d the utility connections to either the COM or Florence buildings. On September 22, 1988, the council adopted an ordinance eliminating COM\u2019s and Florence\u2019s properties from the redevelopment project.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Newport then filed a motion with the Law Division seeking to invalidate the ordinance revising the redevelopment plan and to hold COM, Florence, and Jersey City in contempt. The court did not immediately act upon these applications but instead directed Jersey City\u2019s building inspector to \u201cgrant or deny Newport\u2019s application for a demolition permit ... on or before 4:00 p.m. on October 5, 1988.\u201d Appeals to this court and the Supreme Court were rejected on October 7, 1988, and demolition of COM\u2019s building began that day. Thereafter, the Law Division invalidated Jersey City\u2019s ordinance revising the redevelopment plan on the grounds that it conflicted with the consent judgment entered on November 4, 1987, and was not enacted in accordance with statutorily mandated procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">It will be recalled that the July 1988 consent order reserved Newport\u2019s right to damages based upon COM\u2019s failure to vacate its property as required by the November 1987 consent judgment. The trial on that issue was conducted in January 1990. We need not describe the evidence in detail. Suffice it to say, Newport\u2019s project manager testified that as a result of COM\u2019s delay the development could not proceed as planned, and demolition of COM\u2019s neighboring building, which shared a common wall with COM\u2019s building, had to be accomplished in pieces rather than by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>wrecking ball, which he testified \u201cis the least expensive and the quickest way.\u201d He further asserted that other design and construction changes also became necessary. In contrast, COM\u2019s expert testified that, although demolition costs might have increased because of COM\u2019s delay in delivering possession of the premises, Newport was not otherwise inconvenienced in a substantial way. Mecca testified that he was not involved in introducing the ordinance to revise the redevelopment plan and took no improper action to persuade the Jersey City council to eliminate COM\u2019s and Florence\u2019s properties from the project, although he conceded that he supported the ordinance and made several members of the council aware of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The Law Division denied Newport\u2019s claim for delay damages, finding that the actual costs attributable to COM\u2019s failure to vacate the property had not been established. The court further denied Newport\u2019s claim for liquidated damages under the July 1988 consent order. The court noted that COM\u2019s post-surrender litigation concerning Jersey City\u2019s project revision ordinance was not \u201cwithout some basis,\u201d and, therefore, there was no sound reason to impose the consent order\u2019s $10,000 per-day liquidated damages provision. Notwithstanding its denial of the damages claims, the court granted Newport\u2019s application for counsel fees in the amount of $125,525.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Other issues were later raised relating to the July 1988 consent order. We have no occasion to recount the Byzantine maneuverings of the parties or the twists and turns in the court\u2019s disposition of many of these issues. It is enough to say that the court increased COM\u2019s recovery of relocation expenses beyond the $119,200 awarded in the consent order and denied Newport\u2019s request for specific performance of Florence\u2019s obligation to make the renovations called for by the 1987 agreement. Relocation expenses in the sum of $175,406 were granted to COM in accordance with an administrative decision that had been rendered under the Uniform Relocation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>We next describe the condemnation proceedings against COM. On August 10,1990, the Law Division appointed commissioners to determine the value of COM\u2019s property. In December 1992, the commissioners issued their report valuing COM\u2019s \u201clands and premises\u201d at $1,455,000. Both JCRA and COM appealed the award to the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The trial was conducted in March 1994. The parties presented appraisal reports as well as expert testimony and agreed that the highest and best use of the building was as a refrigerated warehouse. Three approaches to determining the value of the land and building were examined by the expert witnesses \u2014 \u201ccapitalization of income,\u201d \u201csummation or reproduction cost,\u201d and \u201ccomparable sales.\u201d The real estate appraisal experts for each side agreed that there were no comparable sales of similarly improved buildings, <em>i.e., </em>no sales of refrigerated warehouse facilities. For this reason, neither appraisal expert relied upon the comparable sales approach to determine the overall value of the property. Instead, each relied upon the income capitalization and reproduction cost approaches to value. Utilizing the income capitalization and reproduction cost approaches, JCRA contended that the property\u2019s fair market value as of the date of the taking was $1,450,000. COM asserted that the fair market value as of the taking was $2,850,000. Thus, the dispute was over a difference in value of $1,400,000. For the purpose of these appeals and cross-appeals, we need discuss only the evidence dealing with the \u201csummation or reproduction cost\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Joseph Rusciano, a professional engineer, testified as an expert for JCRA. He testified about his report on the value of the COM property, which he determined by \u201creproduction cost new\u201d as of March 1985, the date of taking. He explained that reproduction cost assumed a perfect duplication of the building in design and materials, plus construction-related expenses. Rusciano worked from the original building plans and inspected the structure to verify that the designs had been followed. Once he had computed a figure for the value of the building, he consulted a real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>appraiser who \u201cadjusted [the] value upward for entrepreneurial return\u201d and \u201cthen depreciated [the] building because of physical and functional obsolescence----\u201d The total value of the property was then determined by adding the adjusted figure for the value of the building to the value of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Rusciano emphasized that the building had only one interior stairway, a steel spiral staircase that was not sectioned off from the rest of the interior and was not \u201cfire rated.\u201d The witness testified that the structure would not satisfy the building codes in effect in March 1985, which required two enclosed, straight stairways at opposite ends of the building. The codes also would have required toilet facilities and the attendant sinks, plumbing, and sanitary sewer connection, all of which the building lacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">William Stack, a real estate appraiser, also testified for JCRA. Stack explained that under the reproduction cost approach, after determining the value of the land and the cost of rebuilding the property \u201cin exactly the same way as it existed or was originally constructed at whatever time,\u201d the appraiser would subtract for depreciation and obsolescence. The witness observed that obsolescence may be functional, meaning that it is related to the building itself and possibly curable, or economic, meaning that some outside factor eliminates all demand for the service in question. The absence of toilet facilities and other features required by current codes was considered a curable aspect of functional obsolescence, but the fact that the building was four stories, when the state of the art for refrigerated warehouses was single-story construction, was considered an incurable functional obsolescence. Stack noted that a decrease in the building\u2019s value due to functional obsolescence is a matter of \u201copinion.\u201d Based primarily on his view that the structure of the building contained an incurable functional obsolescence, Stack reduced the \u201cvalue\u201d of COM\u2019s building by twenty percent. Stack also found a depreciation factor of 31.25 percent. Utilizing Rusciano\u2019s itemization of costs, increasing it by the value of paving on the site and by ten percent for \u201centrepreneur\u2019s profit,\u201d and reducing the total by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>51.25 percent, Stack estimated that the fair market value for COM\u2019s building was $1,314,400. To this amount, Stack added $91,000, which he believed to be the fair value of the land based on comparable sales. Stack concluded that the property\u2019s total fair market value as of March 1985 was $1,405,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Philip Falcone, a professional engineer, testified for COM. He essentially agreed with Rusciano\u2019s methodology in determining reproduction cost. However, over JCRA\u2019s vigorous objection, Falcone also included in his reproduction cost valuation \u201ccertain items which would allow the building to comply with [the] code\u201d in effect in 1985. Those items included a \u201cpre-action fire sprinkler\u201d for $115,011, a locker and toilet room with plumbing for $14,350, two fire-escape stairways for $29,400, and emergency lights in those stairways for $1,520. The total cost was $160,281. Falcone\u2019s total reconstruction cost was $3,337,481, plus 10% for general contractor overhead and profit, and 5.6% of the cost-plus-profit for the fees of an architect and an engineer. The final figure was $3,876,818.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Other \u201cadd-ons\u201d which Falcone conceded on cross-examination were necessary to cure items of arguable functional obsolescence included $34,288 for fireproofing columns and beams, $2,400 for loading dock bumpers, and $11,125 for doors that were power-operated instead of manual. The materials-and-labor cost of adding those items raised the cost of meeting the 1985 code from $160,281 to $208,094. The witness noted that with a location adjustment increase, a contractor\u2019s profit, and a higher architect\u2019s and engineer\u2019s fee for alterations, the additional reproduction costs would total \u201cabout a quarter of a million dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Stanley Jay, a real estate appraiser, also testified for COM. Based on the building\u2019s condition and functionality, Jay calculated a depreciation factor of thirty percent. Jay noted that he subtracted only physical depreciation, whereas Stack subtracted both physical depreciation and functional obsolescence. Jay added that he did not find any functional or economic obsolescence, given the building\u2019s continuing serviceability and its \u201cstrategic location.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>He also did not subtract the cost of adding the items that a building constructed in 1985 would have needed to meet the building codes then in effect.. Applying the thirty percent depreciation factor to Falcone\u2019s reproduction cost estimate of $8,876,818 which, as we noted, included the cost of some (but not all) items necessary to satisfy current codes, Jay arrived at a figure of $2,713,772. From that amount, Jay deducted the cost of installing state-of-the-art freezer equipment and of tenant retrofit, thus appraising the fair market value of the building at $2,580,320. With a land value of $285,000, Jay\u2019s final valuation figure was $2,865,320, which he rounded down to $2,850,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">As we noted at the outset of our opinion, the jury returned a verdict of $2,200,000. Following the denial of motions for a new trial and a hearing to determine appropriate prejudgment interest, the parties filed these appeals and cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We first consider JCRA\u2019s appeal and COM\u2019s cross-appeal from the condemnation judgment. In the principal appeal, JCRA argues that the Law Division erred by admitting evidence relating to the cost of features necessary to comply with current codes. JCRA also contends that the court improperly denied its motion to set aside the jury verdict. We examine these issues <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">While we agree with JCRA that COM\u2019s reproduction cost evidence was unsound in part, we find no error capable of producing an unjust result. We begin with the constitutional principle that an owner whose property is taken for a public use must receive just compensation. <em>State v. Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>507, 513-14, 457 A.2d 463 (1983); <em>State v. Gorga, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>113, 115, 138 A.2d 833 (1958); <em>State v. Burnett, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>280, 287, 131 A.2d 765 (1957). The measure of just compensation is \u201c \u2018the fair market value of the property as of the date of the taking, determined by what a willing buyer and a willing seller would agree to, neither being under any compulsion to act.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Caoili, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>252, 260, 639 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>275 (1994) (quoting <em>State v. Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 513, 457 A.2d 468). \u201cIt is the Value that would be assigned to the acquired property by knowledgeable parties freely negotiating for its sale under normal market conditions based on all surrounding circumstances at the time of the taking.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 457 A.2d 463).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u201cRecognizing that nearly all things may, if offered, create purchasing demand, the criterion of market value has been the gravitational pole for just compensation.\u201d <em>State v. Burnett, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>at 288, 131 A.2d 765. While just compensation has been said to require a \u201cfull and perfect equivalent for the property taken,\u201d <em>Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, </em>148 <em>U.S. </em>312, 326, 13 <em>S.Ct. </em>622, 626, 37 <em>L.Ed. </em>463, 468 (1893), this does not necessarily equate to total indemnity for the owner\u2019s loss because often the value to the owner differs from the value to the purchaser. <em>City of Trenton v. Lenzner, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>465, 476, 109 A.2d 409 (1954), <em>cert. denied, </em>348 <em>U.S. </em>972, 75 <em>S.Ct. </em>534, 99 <em>L.Ed. </em>757 (1955). Instead, \u201cthe constitutional requirement is satisfied by a sum of money which fairly represents the transferable value of the property in the market place.\u201d <em>State v. Burnett, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>at 288, 131 A.2d 765. \u201cWe deal, then, in most valuation problems, in an evidential construction of a hypothetical sale between a willing and uncoerced seller and a like-minded buyer.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u201cThe various formulas fashioned to determine fair market value in a condemnation case attempt to ascertain the value that would be assigned to the acquired property by knowledgeable parties freely negotiating for its sale under normal market conditions____\u201d <em>State v. Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 457 A.2d 463. In light of the fluid and complex nature of market conditions, our courts \u201c\u2018have shown considerable liberality in admitting evidence of market value, particularly in terms of the highest and best use of the subject property.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Caoili </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 261, 639 A.2d 275 (quoting <em>State v. Silver, 92 N.J. </em>at 515, 457 A.2d 463).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>At least where comparable sales to indicate comparable values are absent, evidence of reproduction cost is admissible. <em>State v.

New Jersey Highway Auth. v. Johnson, </em>35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 213-14, 113 A.2d 831 (App.Div.1955). Stated somewhat differently, \u201c[i]f there is economic justification for the present reproduction of ... a structure on the land it may fairly be supposed that a prospective purchaser would take the factor of cost of reproduction (less depreciation and obsolescence) into consideration in deciding what to pay [for the property].\u201d <em>New Jersey Highway Auth. v.

Caoili, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 270-71, 639 A.2d 275; <em>State v. Burnett, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>at 288-89, 131 A.2d 765. Mere citation of the reproduction cost approach does not open the door to admission of evidence pertaining to all expenses necessary to duplicate the condemned building at the time of the taking. In the context of the facts here, it cannot fairly be argued that the condemning authority was bound to expend public monies to indemnify the property owner for features the building did not have. To the contrary, costs reasonably necessary to comply with current building codes would tend to reduce the value of the building in the eyes of a prospective purchaser, not increase it. Indeed, the cost of reproduction necessarily \u201cembodpes] all of the deficiencies, superadequacies, and obsolescence of the subject building.\u201d American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, <em>The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal </em>254 (2nd ed. 1989). We thus have said, albeit in another context, that functional obsolescence in the form of outmoded characteristics associated with age or a failure to keep pace with advancing technology diminishes market value and must be deducted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>reproduction cost. <em>N.J. Highway Auth. v. Ackerson, </em>73 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 185, 179 A.2d 521; <em>see also Bostian v. Franklin State Bank, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>564, 567, 401 A.2d 549 (App.Div.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">To that extent, we find the testimony of COM\u2019s experts to be substantially flawed. We, nevertheless, discern no prejudice to JCRA arising from this deficiency. When COM first introduced evidence of the costs necessary to bring its building into compliance with current building codes, JCRA\u2019s attorney interposed a timely objection. The court initially indicated that it was \u201cinclined\u201d to exclude the evidence. However, JCRA\u2019s lawyer noted that \u201c[tjhese [cost] items [were] not out of the case,\u201d because he intended to cross-examine COM\u2019s witnesses and present additional evidence respecting functional obsolescence. More specifically, JCRA\u2019s attorney stated that these cost items were \u201cimportant,\u201d because \u201cthey ha[d] to be deducted from [the] value [of the building] as curable ... obsolescence.\u201d The court then decided to admit the evidence subject to a limiting instruction to be given at the conclusion of the case. As we noted in our recital of the facts, JCRA\u2019s experts described the concept of functional obsolescence in considerable detail. At the charge conference, JCRA\u2019s attorney requested an instruction on the effect of functional obsolescence on the value of a structure. In accordance with this request, the court later charged the jury that \u201c[tjhe cost of reproduction is what it cost[s] to build a similar structure less depreciation and obsolescence.\u201d JCRA\u2019s attorney noted that he was \u201c[ajbsolutely\u201d satisfied with this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Perhaps in retrospect it would have been preferable had the court given a more particularized charge pertaining to the costs of complying with current codes and how they were to be considered in determining market value. However, we are satisfied that the instruction as given conveyed the correct legal principle and sufficiently alerted the jury to the problem. We merely add it may be fair to infer from the failure of counsel to object to the instruction that in the context of the trial the error he now perceives was actually of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>JCRA\u2019s contention that the court incorrectly denied its motion for a new trial does not require extended discussion. The trial court is obliged to grant such a motion only \u201cif, having given due regard to the opportunity of the jury to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses, it clearly and convincingly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:49-l(a). Our scope of review is essentially the same. <em>R. </em>2:10-1. We recognize that some of the expert testimony presented by COM might have been mistaken. We acknowledge, for example, that Jay appears to have overstated the amount of refrigerated space in COM\u2019s building. It is nonetheless abundantly plain that the jury verdict did not constitute a manifest denial of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We now turn to the issues raised in COM\u2019s cross-appeal. Although phrasing its claims in a variety of ways, COM contends that it was constitutionally entitled to prejudgment interest at the mortgage rate \u2014 one percent above prime \u2014 rather than the judgment rate, and to counsel fees. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Initially, we acknowledge that interest is \u201ca requirement of constitutional magnitude where the actual taking of the property is not contemporaneous with payment....\u201d <em>Township of Wayne v. Cassatly, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>464, 471, 349 A.2d 545 (App.Div.1975), <em>certif. denied, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>137, 358 A.2d 184 (1976); <em>see also State v. Seaway, Inc., </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>376, 381, 217 A.2d 313 (1966); <em>New Jersey Highway Auth. v. Ellis, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7, 130 A.2d 601 (1957). This right has been implemented by statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-32, which requires the judge, rather than the jury, to fix the amount of interest whenever the parties are unable to agree. <em>Ibid.; see also N.J.S.A </em>20:3-31. Where, as here, the action has been pending for a substantial.period of time during which the level of interest rates has been a changing phenomenon, we have mandated plenary hearings for the presentation of expert evidence as to the prevailing commercial and legal rates of interest. <em>Township of Wayne v. Cassatly, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 474, 349 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Pursuant to that mandate, a hearing was conducted in this case. Although COM presented expert testimony concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the rates of return available to a prudent investor, we find no abuse of the Law Division\u2019s discretion in relying on the rates provided by <em>R. </em>4:42-11. The principle of restoring the condemnee to its position on the date of the taking recognizes the time value of money as a general economic fact. It does not prevent the trial court from applying the legal judgment rates. We discern no error requiring our intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Equally without merit is COM\u2019s claim that the Law Division erred by denying its application for attorneys\u2019 fees. We find no basis for COM\u2019s contention that attorneys\u2019 fees are constitutionally compelled as an element of just compensation, \u201c[indirect costs to the property owner caused by the taking of his land\u201d generally are not included in determining just compensation, and, thus, \u201c \u2018[attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses are not embraced within\u2019 \u201d that term. <em>United States v. Bodcaw Co., </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>202, 203, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1066, 1066-67, 59 L.Ed.2d 257, 259 (1979) (quoting <em>Dohany v. Rogers, 281 U.S. </em>362, 368, 50 <em>S.Ct. </em>299, 302, 74 <em>L.Ed. </em>904 (1930)). Perhaps, it would be fair or efficient to compensate a land owner for all costs he or she incurs as a result of a condemnation action, but the United States Supreme Court has said that \u201csuch compensation is a matter of legislative grace rather than constitutional command.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1067, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 260. We know of no statute or rule providing for the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees in condemnation cases. <em>See R. </em>4:42-9. Absent express authorization, we see nothing in this case requiring us to engraft an exception to the general principle that \u201csound judicial administration [is] best ... advanced by having each litigant bear his own counsel fee.... \u201d <em>Gerhardt v. Continental Ins. Cos., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>291, 301, 225 A.2d 328 (1966); <em>see also McGuire v. City of Jersey City, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>310, 326, 593 A.2d 309 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">We next address the questions raised in Newport\u2019s appeal and defendants\u2019 cross-appeals from the precondemnation orders we described in our recitation of the facts. As noted earlier, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>uphold all of the Law Division\u2019s orders excfept that allowing Newport counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We reject Newport\u2019s contention that the Law Division erred by denying its claim for delay damages. Newport\u2019s project manager testified that COM\u2019s delay forced Newport to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d rather than \u201cdemolish\u201d the adjacent building, to build an extra, temporary exterior wall on the partially constructed strip shopping center, to install temporary curbing, a sidewalk and two grades of paving, to construct a temporary sanitary sewer and two temporary storm sewers, and to make other alterations of its design plan. However, his testimony was devoid of any itemization of specific expenses. In common parlance, nothing in the record linked the items described by the project manager to specific dollar amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Although Newport did introduce through the project manager an \u201cestimate\u201d of these incurred costs totalling $150,793 and accompanied by various documents, we note that upon receiving the estimate into evidence the trial judge expressed \u201creservation\u201d about its probative weight. Apparently, the judge determined upon further reflection that the estimate was insufficiently supported to provide much guidance in ascertaining the quantum of increased costs incurred by Newport. We will not second-guess this determination. While we acknowledge that where a breach of a binding agreement has been committed, \u201c \u2018and it is certain that damages have resulted, mere uncertainty as to the amount will not preclude recovery,\u2019 \u201d <em>Wolpaw v. General Accident Ins. Co., </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 46, 639 A.2d 338 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Kozlowski v. Kozlowski, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>378, 388, 403 A.2d 902 (1979)), <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>316, 645 A.2d 143 (1994), it is also well settled that the evidence presented must afford \u201c \u2018a basis for estimating damages with some reasonable degree of certainty____\u2019 \u201d <em>American Sanitary Sales Co. v. State, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 435, 429 A.2d 403 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Paolicelli v. Wojciechowski </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>274, 278-79, 333 A.2d 532 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>153, 343 A.2d 441 (1975)), <em>certif. denied, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>420, 434 A.2d 1094 (1981). Our independent review of the oral and documentary evidence submitted by Newport leads us to agree with the trial judge that Newport failed to provide the basis for a reliable estimate of the increased costs it was required to pay as a result of COM\u2019s tardy departure from the premises. We thus perceive ample support in the record for the court\u2019s conclusion that Newport failed to establish actual costs incurred by reason of COM\u2019s delay in vacating its building. <em>Meshinsky v. Nichols Yacht Sales, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>464, 475, 541 A.2d 1063 (1988); <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">More troublesome is the court\u2019s finding that the liquidated damages provision contained in the July 29, 1988 consent order was inapplicable because, at least to some extent, COM was justified in failing to vacate its property on a timely basis. As we understand the court\u2019s decision, the judge concluded that the parties had not intended the damages provision to encompass delays caused by litigation grounded in a plausible understanding of the changing conditions. We cannot say that the court\u2019s conclusion was \u201c \u2018so wholly unsupportable as to result in a denial of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meshinsky v. Nichols Yacht Sales, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 475, 541 A.2d 1063 (quoting <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 483-84, 323 A.2d 495).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">We are unpersuaded by Newport\u2019s argument that the court awarded excessive relocation expenses. While it is true that the consent order provided only $119,200 for relocation and loading costs, it expressly provided that any further dispute was to be resolved by an administrative hearing under the Uniform Relocation Act. Although the truncated record is not entirely informative, it appears that additional relocation costs were awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>under the Uniform Relocation Act following an administrative hearing. The court\u2019s subsequent award of $175,406 encompassed the additional relocation expenses granted. We perceive no repudiation of the prior consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We find no sound basis to disturb the court\u2019s denial of Newport\u2019s claim for specific performance of Florence\u2019s agreement to renovate its building. We note that the November 1987 consent judgment did not refer to specific performance as a remedy in the event Florence failed to perform. The judgment required Florence to submit plans and make renovations, and provided that if Florence defaulted in its obligations, JCRA would condemn the property. More importantly, monetary damages, if demanded, would have been adequate to compensate Newport for Florence\u2019s alleged breach. The principle underlying the specific performance remedy is equity\u2019s jurisdiction to grant relief where monetary damages would not make the non-breaching party whole. <em>See Dover Shopping Center v. Cushman\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>384, 394, 164 A.2d 785 (App.Div.1960); <em>Centex Homes Corp. v. Boag, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 389, 320 A.2d 194 (Ch.Div.1974). We recognize that there may be special considerations warranting specific performance of a consent judgment, <em>see generally R. </em>1:10-3, and that there are strong public policy considerations favoring enforcement of settlement agreements. <em>See, e.g., Pascarella v. Bruck, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, 124-25, 462 A.2d 186 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>600, 468 A.2d 233 (1983). Here, however, the renovations called for by the consent judgment had no especially unique qualities. Damages resulting from the alleged breach were readily measurable. We discern no compelling reasons for a grant of specific performance under these circumstances. In addition, we note that, in light of the highly disputatious nature of the parties\u2019 relationship and the fractious manner in which this litigation was conducted, a grant of specific performance would likely require near constant judicial supervision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>ensure the renovations were planned and completed within a reasonable period of time. Specific performance generally is an inappropriate remedy in such circumstances. <em>See Dover Shopping Center v. Cushman\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 394, 164 A.2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">For defendants\u2019 final point, we return to the question of counsel fees, this time in the context of the Law Division\u2019s award of such fees to Newport on its unsuccessful claim for delay damages. As we noted earlier, <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a) states the general rule that \u201c[n]o fee for legal services shall be allowed in the taxed costs or otherwise____\u201d The Rule provides eight exceptions. <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(1) to (8). It is undisputed that none of these exceptions is applicable in the present case. We add that <em>R. </em>1:10-3 (formerly <em>R. </em>1:10-5), which pertains to enforcement of litigant\u2019s rights, permits a court \u201cin its discretion [to] make an allowance for counsel fees ... to a <em>party accorded </em>relief____\u201d We have underscored the phrase \u201cparty accorded relief\u2019 because it clearly confines the right to award counsel fees to \u201csuccessful movant[s].\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>It </em>1:10-3 (1996). New Jersey\u2019s general prohibition against the award of counsel fees \u201cwas adopted to eliminate the abuses of the pre-1948 chancery practice of granting excessive fees to favored members of the bar.\u201d <em>Satellite Gateway Communications v. Musi Dining Car Co., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>280, 285, 540 A.2d 1267 (1988). Although the original source rule was adopted in 1947 and has been modified on numerous occasions, its basic approach and philosophy remain the same. <em>Ibid.; see also State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection v. Ventron Corp., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>473, 504, 468 A.2d 150 (1983); <em>Right to Choose v. Byrne, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>287, 316, 450 A.2d 925 (1982); <em>Gerhardt v. Continental Ins. Cos., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>at 301, 225 A.2d 328. We need not determine whether the courts have the inherent power to award fees, and if so, the parameters of such authority. <em>See Red Devil Tools v. Tip Top Brush Co., </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>563, 574-76, 236 A.2d 861 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>(1967); <em>Oliviero v. Porter Hayden Co., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>381, 387, 575 A.2d 50 (App.Div.1990). Assuming such authority exists, we find that no \u201cinjustice would occur if counsel fees [were] not awarded in this action.\u201d <em>Satellite Gateway Communications v. Musi Dining Car Co., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 288, 540 A.2d 1267. We thus adhere to the general rule barring the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Accordingly, the order granting counsel fees to Newport is .reversed. The remaining judgment and orders appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
