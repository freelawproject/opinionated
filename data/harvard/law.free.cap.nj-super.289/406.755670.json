She had demanded extended income continuation and essential services benefits when her husband, a pedestrian, was killed in an automobile accident. State Farm denied the benefits because, under <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-10, extended \u201cincome continuation and essential services benefits shall cease upon the death of the claimant.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The narrow question on appeal is whether this legal issue of entitlement to PIP benefits may be submitted to arbitration pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5c. The Law Division judge concluded that State Farm\u2019s refusal to pay created a \u201cdispute\u201d which triggered defendant\u2019s right to demand binding arbitration under the statute. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Defendant and her deceased husband were covered by a State Farm automobile policy which provided extended income continuation and essential services PIP benefits. State Farm denied payment of these benefits because the decedent did not survive the accident. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-10. Defendant thereupon demanded arbitration under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5c.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">In response, State Farm filed a declaratory judgment action in the Law Division and moved to stay the arbitration, arguing that the issue presented was \u201ca legal one involving interpretation of the policy and statute rather than a factual dispute.\u201d Judge Kennedy held that the dispute was arbitrable and denied the motion; Judge Arnone later dismissed State Farm\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\"><em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-5c provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ll automobile insurers shall provide any claimant with the option of submitting a dispute under this section to binding arbitration.\u201d State Farm\u2019s policy essentially incorporates this statutory language. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The thrust of State Farm\u2019s argument is that, because the statute refers to disputes \u201cunder this section,\u201d only those PIP issues arising \u201cunder\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5, such as notice and timeliness of payment, may be arbitrated. It describes the present dispute as a question of \u201ccoverage,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and reasons that the Law Division must therefore determine whether defendant is entitled to the extended income continuation and essential services benefits which are defined at <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-4 and -10.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">State Farm reads <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5c too narrowly. It relies upon the flawed premise that Section 5 may be divorced from the larger statutory scheme in which it exists. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Crocker, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 256-57, 672 A.2d 226 (App.Div.1996); 2A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 46.05 (5th ed. 1992); <em>see Kimmelman v. Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>123, 129, 527 A.2d 1368 (1987). Section 5 is entitled \u201cPayment of personal injury protection coverage benefits.\u201d Its evident purpose is to provide a mechanism by which the \u201cpayment\u201d of all PIP benefits is to be made, including extended income continuation and essential services benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5a, for example, permits insurers to require written notice \u201cas soon as practicable after an accident involving an automobile with respect to which the policy affords [PIP] coverage benefits <em>pursuant to this act </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Likewise, <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-5c, the arbitration provision, necessarily must be construed <em>in pari materia </em>with other pertinent PIP Sections, including <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-4 and -10. <em>See </em>2B <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction, supra, </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 51.02 and 51.03; <em>see also Plemmons v. New Jersey Auto. Full Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>151, 156, 622 A.2d 275 (App.Div.1993) (noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4a must be read <em>in para materia </em>with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2e). Thus, any \u201cdispute\u201d concerning a \u201cpayment\u201d of PIP benefits due \u201cpursuant to this act\u201d is subject to binding arbitration at the claimant\u2019s option. It is therefore clear that <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-5c compels State Farm to submit to binding arbitration this dispute over defendant\u2019s entitlement to certain PIP benefits, notwithstanding that those benefits are defined elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Moreover, the word \u201cdispute\u201d is unqualified. <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-5. Consequently, it denotes not only disputes concerning notice and timeliness of payments, but also disputes concerning one\u2019s entitlement to a type of PIP benefit afforded by other provisions of the statute. <em>Olivero by Olivero v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>191, 201, 488 A.2d 1071 (App.Div.1985) <em>(\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-5 ... [grants] insureds an option to submit <em>any </em>disputes concerning benefits claimed to arbitration in lieu of court proceedings\u201d (emphasis added)). This represents the only sensible approach because the arbitrator must necessarily decide whether the disputed benefits are due by considering the claimant\u2019s entitlement before he or she may determine whether payment is \u201coverdue\u201d under <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Finally, to the extent that the phrase \u201cdispute under the section\u201d creates any ambiguity, we must construe it liberally to harmonize the arbitration provision with our firm policy favoring prompt and efficient resolution of PIP disputes without resort to the judicial process. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-16; <em>see Roig v. Kelsey, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>500, 516, 641 A.2d 248 (1994) (noting that the reduction of court congestion is one of \u201cthe overwhelming goals\u201d of our no-fault scheme); <em>Gambino v. Royal Globe Ins. Cos., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>100, 107, 429 A.2d 1039 (1981) (same); <em>Crocker, supra, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 257-58, 672 A.2d 226 (same). This construction also comports with New Jersey\u2019s long-standing and strong public policy favoring arbitration in general. <em>See Barcon </em>Assocs. <em>v. Tri-County Asphalt Corp., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>179, 186, 430 A.2d 214 (1981). State Farm\u2019s proposed reading of <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-5c obviously frustrates these salutary policies. Clearly, to ensure the viability of arbitration as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>a forum for the resolution of PIP disputes is to foster these goals; many if not most claimants will choose to arbitrate rather than to litigate. Carriers should not be empowered to avoid arbitration simply by characterizing PIP disputes as questions of \u201centitlement\u201d or \u201ccoverage\u201d and then seeking judicial resolution of those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">It is true, as State Farm points out, that the issue of defendant\u2019s entitlement to extended income continuation and essential services benefits is a legal question involving statutory interpretation. Arbitrators, however, generally \u201chave broad discretion in determining legal issues,\u201d so long as they do not \u201cdisregard terms and conditions set forth in the agreement [to arbitrate].\u201d <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, Div. of State Police v. State Troopers Fraternal Ass\u2019n, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>464, 469, 453 A.2d 176 (1982); <em>see Grover v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>221, 228-29, 403 A.2d 448 (1979); <em>Daly v. Komline-Sanderson Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>175, 178, 191 A.2d 37 (1963) (\u201cThe essence of arbitration is, of course, that the arbitrators decide both the facts and the law.\u201d). As previously noted, the Legislature failed to distinguish between legal and factual disputes when it mandated PIP arbitration. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-5c. The statutory directive is that arbitration proceedings shall \u201cbe administered and subject to procedures established by the American Arbitration Association\u201d (AAA). <em>Ibid. AAA PIP Arbitration Rule </em>30 states: \u201cThe arbitrator shall render a decision in accordance with the statute and the applicable policy provisions.\u201d Craig &amp; Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law, </em>App. C-18 (1996). The arbitrator is thus charged with applying the PIP statute as a whole, guided by pertinent case law, and deciding both legal and factual questions in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">We reject State Farm\u2019s argument that <em>New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co. v. Franklin, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 389 A.2d 980 (App.Div.1978), is dispositive. There we held that, under a standard uninsured motorist (UM) arbitration provision, an arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to decide a \u201ccoverage\u201d issue concerning whether the driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>who struck the claimant was \u201cuninsured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297, 301-02, 389 A.2d 980; <em>see also Grover, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 228-30, 403 A.2d 448. <em>Franklin </em>is clearly distinguishable because UM arbitration is entirely a creature of contract, Craig &amp; Pomeroy, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 23:1, and therefore the policy defines the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s power. The standard UM endorsement provides for arbitration only as to the claimant\u2019s entitlement to recover against the uninsured tortfeasor and the quantum of damages. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 23:1 and 23:2-1, and App. C-l, Part C; <em>Franklin, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 297, 389 A.2d 980 (describing the liability of the uninsured tortfeasor and the quantum of damages as the only arbitrable issues). Thus, absent a stipulation to submit a UM coverage issue to arbitration, the arbitrator has \u201cno primary jurisdiction to determine that question.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>PIP arbitration, by contrast, is a creation of the Legislature and the arbitrator\u2019s powers are therefore not so circumscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\"> We do not address the underlying question of entitlement to these benefits because it is not properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> We do not necessarily agree with State Farm's characterization of the issue as one of coverage. It is undisputed that the Molinos were covered by the policy and therefore entitled to PIP benefits. There is also no question that the policy included extended income continuation and essential services benefits. Thus, the question was not whether coverage existed but whether defendant was entitled to those benefits as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\"> In Point II of defendant's appellate brief, she argues that attorneys\u2019 fees \"should be granted to [her] for responding to the declaratory judgment action and for responding to this appeal.\u201d We find no indication in the record that she ever applied for fees in the Law Division or that her application was denied. If no order was entered from which she could have cross-appealed, no appellate relief may be granted to her. <em>Valenti v. Planning Bd., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 82, 581 A.2d 878 (App.Div.1990). In any event, if an order denying defendant counsel fees was entered, her failure to cross-appeal would preclude the granting of appellate relief in her favor. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>2:3-4 (1996).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">With regard to defendant\u2019s request for counsel fees on appeal, she must move for such relief in accordance with <em>R. </em>2:11-4.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
