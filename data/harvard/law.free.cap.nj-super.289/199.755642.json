Their motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On their way to go food shopping, Liptak and her young daughter stopped to purchase panty hose at a local pharmacy owned and operated by Rite Aid. Liptak selected seven packages from a panty hose display, two of which exhibited coupons entitling the customer to a discount of thirty-five cents at the register. Liptak, a \u201cconsistent\u201d coupon user, asked a store employee whether Rite Aid would honor the coupons. When the employee responded affirmatively, Liptak took a place at the end of a long line and began preparing her purchases for check-out by removing the coupons and putting them in her basket, which she had placed on the front counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">During her search for additional coupons, Liptak noticed that some of the packages had been opened, and she became concerned that the contents differed from the description on the labels. Liptak checked that the garments matched the labels and placed the packages back in her basket along with a forty-cent coupon that she had found inside one of the packages. Recalling other items that she needed to purchase, Liptak left the check-out line and proceeded to an end aisle.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Liptak stated that her \u201ccoupon caddy,\u201d an expandable folder in which she filed her coupons, had not left her hand, and that her purse had not left her shoulder as she removed three Band-Aid coupons and two toothpaste coupons from the caddy. She compared them with the products that she had selected while in the aisle and placed the coupons in her basket. At this time, Liptak contended, Rite Aid Store Manager Mello called to her as he approached from the front of the store with a uniformed Clifton police officer. Mello told Liptak that he had witnessed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>stealing coupons from panty hose packages and repeatedly asked her to come to his office despite her denials of theft. Mello allegedly grabbed Liptak\u2019s shoulder, but was rebuffed in his effort to push her toward his office. Liptak asserted that she went to the office only after Mello threatened to have the officer handcuff her. Liptak indicated on cross-examination that she had spent five to eight minutes speaking with Mello and about ten minutes in the aisle before going to his small office near the store entrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">At Mello\u2019s office, Liptak maintained her entitlement to \u201csave 35 cents today\u201d as the coupons attached to the panty hose packages stated. Mello retorted that she should have purchased the items and used the coupons that she had taken from the packages with a later purchase.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He wanted \u201cto book her\u201d because he considered her to be as guilty as \u201cteenage girls that come into this store and steal makeup.\u201d Mello unsuccessfully attempted to telephone his superiors. He confirmed with the officer that Rite Aid had one year to prefer charges against Liptak for theft of the three coupons. Neither Liptak\u2019s purse nor her person was searched despite her consent to permit it. Although Liptak was then allowed to leave, she took ten more minutes to purchase the items in her basket, using in the process the three coupons that Rite Aid had accused her of stealing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She left the store at about 5:00 p.m., went home, and was upset for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Liptak testified that she grew more fearful the following day upon realizing that Rite Aid could have her arrested at any time during the ensuing one-year period. She asserted that this affected her work performance and created friction with her husband because \u201cI just kept badgering him with this incident____\u201d She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>became reclusive, as well as obsessed and paranoid, refusing to go shopping without her husband. The incident allegedly caused her to experience depression, hair loss, and facial lesions within two weeks of the incident. Her doctor prescribed a tranquilizer for the depression and ointment for the lesions. Her daughter apparently rebounded from her own depression, but Liptak suffered nightmares that prompted her to seek counseling from a psychiatrist and from Clifton Mental Health Services (Clinic). There was conflicting medical testimony concerning her condition and its cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The judge ruled on Rite Aid\u2019s motion at the end of plaintiffs\u2019 case that Liptak had established a prima facie case of unlawful detention. He commented, however, that she also could have been charged with shoplifting if she had left the store without purchasing the item after removing a coupon from within one of the panty hose packages because he considered coupons to be \u201cgoods within the term merchandise\u201d under the merchant defense to the shoplifting law. The judge rejected Rite Aid\u2019s application for a ruling that, as a matter of law, it had probable cause to stop and detain Liptak and that its detention of Liptak was reasonable. Notwithstanding Liptak\u2019s argument that Mello\u2019s reliance on \u201cpolice presence,\u201d his threat \u201cto cuff her,\u201d and his instigation of a police report evidenced malice toward her, the judge granted Rite Aid\u2019s motion to dismiss her punitive damages claim for lack of proof of malicious or wanton conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Over plaintiffs\u2019 objection following a Rule 104 hearing, the judge admitted into evidence as a business record a Clinic \u201cDiagnostic Intake Evaluation\u201d form completed by Liptak\u2019s therapist, Arlene Bondy. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6). The form indicated that Liptak had told Bondy that her husband was an alcoholic and unsupportive of her during her incident. Bondy had written that Liptak was using the incident \u201cto bring out [her] marital problem of alcohol.\u201d Rite Aid proffered the Clinic record to rebut Liptak\u2019s claim that the incident had caused her psychological problems. Because Bondy had since moved to Arizona, her supervisor, Pamela Noblin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>authenticated the record by identifying her own and Bondy\u2019s signatures on Liptak\u2019s diagnostic intake evaluation form. Finding the records to be reliable based upon Noblin\u2019s testimony, the judge admitted them into evidence. In rebuttal, Liptak asserted that Bondy had made the marital problem comment to her and denied referring to her husband as an alcoholic.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Mello testified for the defense that he had watched Liptak twice look into an open panty hose package, remove an item, place it in her purse, and return the package to the panty hose display. Mello stated that he had asked a police officer who was shopping in the store if he would observe Liptak, at which time they approached her in a non-threatening manner without touching her. Mello twice requested that Liptak come to his office. When he inquired what she had taken, Liptak produced three coupons. In response, Mello said they were store property until purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Mello asserted that the coupons had a face redemption value to the customer and a store credit value if they went unused. Mello claimed that Liptak did not indicate her intention to use the coupons with her purchase, although he did not look to see whether they were \u201csame-day\u201d coupons. At the officer\u2019s request, Mello attempted unsuccessfully to contact his supervisor. Mello denied threatening Liptak with arrest or abusing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">At the end of the case, Rite Aid moved for a directed verdict on the probable cause and reasonable duration issues. The judge concluded from Liptak\u2019s testimony, which he assumed to be true for purposes of the motion, that Mello might have perceived that she had removed a coupon and placed it in her basket without intending to purchase the package from which it had come. Liptak\u2019s attorney questioned how Mello could have formed such a reasonable belief if the jury rejected his testimony that he had seen Liptak place the coupon in her purse rather than in her basket. The judge nevertheless ruled that, as a matter of law, Rite Aid had probable cause to detain Liptak, and that it did so for a reasonable period of time. His decision left the jury to decide only whether Rite Aid had detained Liptak in a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>manner. The judge instructed the jury on the reasonableness issue by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">If you find that the plaintiff was intentionally restrained or confined and that the defendant took the plaintiff into custody in an unreasonable manner then you should conclude that the detention was unlawful and you should find that there was false imprisonment. If you believe that the plaintiff, <em>and I have found </em>as a <em>matter of law, willfully concealed unpurchased merchandise </em>and that the defendant could attempt to recover that merchandise by ... taking the plaintiff into custody and that the defendant took the plaintiff into custody for this purpose and detained the plaintiff in a ... reasonable manner then you should find that the detention was lawful. ... [emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The jury returned a unanimous verdict of no cause of action against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Our standard of review of the dismissal of the punitive damages claim, <em>see R. 4:87~2(b), </em>and the rulings <em>on the </em>probable cause and reasonable time issues, <em>see R. </em>4:40-1, is \u201cwhether \u2018the evidence, together with the legitimate inferences therefrom, could sustain a judgment in ... favor\u2019 of the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5, 258 A.2d 706 (1969) (quoting <em>R. </em>4:37-2); <em>see also Brill v. The Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 536, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Accordingly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">[i]f accepting as true all the evidence which supports the position of the party defending against the motion and according [her] the benefit of all inferences which can reasonably and legitimately be deduced therefrom, reasonable minds could differ, the motion must be denied. <em>[Dolson, supra </em>(55 <em>N.J. </em>at 5, 258 A.2d 706) (citations omitted) ]. ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">A merchant\u2019s detention of a customer in a false imprisonment action is subject to N.J.S.A 20:20-11, \u201cthe Shoplifting Act\u201d (Act). <em>Cooke v. J.J. Newberry &amp; Co., </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>9, 12, 232 A.2d 425 (App.Div.1967). The Act grants an affirmative defense to liability for false imprisonment by providing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">a merchant, who has probable cause for believing that a person has willfully concealed unpurchased merchandise and that he can recover the merchandise by taking the person into custody, may, for the purpose of attempting to effect recovery thereof, take the person into custody and detain him in a reasonable manner for not more than a reasonable time, and the taking into custody ... shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>not render such person criminally or civilly liable in any manner or to any extent whatsoever. <em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:20-lle].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u201cBecause of the seriousness of the shoplifting problem, this court has concluded that [the Act] must be construed in a manner reasonably calculated to carry out its objective of protecting the merchant from shoplifting and safeguarding the innocent customer.\u201d <em>Henry v. Shopper\u2019s World, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>14, 17, 490 A.2d 320 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">While it is undisputed that Liptak removed a coupon from the inside of one package of panty hose and from the outside of two other packages, the parties disagree as to whether those coupons qualify as \u201cmerchandise\u201d under the Act. The determination of that question resolves the issue of whether Rite Aid is entitled to assert the affirmative defense in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:20-lle. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:20-lla(3) defines \u201cmerchandise\u201d as \u201cany goods, chattels, foodstuffs or wares of any type and description, regardless of the value thereof____\u201d The judge concluded that coupons are goods within the statutory definition of \u201cmerchandise\u201d by analogizing a coupon to a piece of candy or a toy in a cereal box. He reasoned that the Act protects merchants from the loss of value of products containing coupons that would result if consumers could remove them without purchasing the products.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Although this particular classification issue appears to be one of first impression in New Jersey, we have drawn upon prior discussions of the nature of coupons in rendering our decision. The Chancery Division identified the difference between trading stamps and \u201cpremiums or rebates in the form of coupons\u201d in <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. v. Sills, </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 349, 225 A.2d 728 (Ch.Div.1966). <em>Sills </em>noted that a statute discriminating against the use of rebates and premiums by pharmacists \u201capparently was distinguishing between a form of cash discount [stamps] and what otherwise would comprise premiums or inducements to buy [coupons].\u201d If a coupon is recognized as a \u201cprice-cutting device,\u201d <em>State by Richman v. The Sperry and Hutchinson Co., </em>56 <em>N.J.Super. </em>589, 603, 153 A.2d 691 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>385, 157 A.2d 505 (1960), then it follows that it may possess some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>inherent value if used with the purchase of merchandise and before <em>any </em>expiration date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In fact, the Tax Court has differentiated between two types of coupons that reduce prices. <em>See Burger King Corp. v. Taxation Div. Dir., </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>251, 255 n. 2 (Tax Ct.987), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>628, 541 A.2d 241 (App.Div.1988). The Tax Court explained that a manufacturer\u2019s coupon (of the type Liptak removed from inside the panty hose package) \u201centitl[es] a purchaser to purchase at a price less than as advertised,\u201d in exchange for which \u201c[t]he manufacturer reimburses the retailer-seller for the face amount of the coupon.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We agreed with the Tax Court that the State could not levy a sales tax on revenues generated by Burger King\u2019s \u201ctwo for the price of one\u201d coupons inasmuch as they did not have a market value in money because they were not reimbursable. <em>Burger King, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 630, 541 A.2d 241, <em>aff'g, </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 255, 258. Our opinion observed that \u201c[w]e were not concerned ... with a coupon entitling a purchaser to buy at a reduced rate, where the manufacturer or a third party ultimately reimburses the retailer-seller.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Despite the fact that <em>Burger King </em>did not decide whether manufacturer\u2019s coupons possess independent market value, we are mindful that \u201c[t]he common denominator [of the Act] is preventing the loss of merchandise without full payment \u2014 the protection of inventory.\u201d <em>De Angelis v. Jamesway Dept. Store, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 526, 501 A.2d 561 (App.Div.1985). The trial judge here felt that removal of manufacturer\u2019s coupons from their packages without legal sanction would impair the value of those goods because those coupons are regarded as having value, a criterion of \u201cmerchandise\u201d to which <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-lla(3) expressly refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>In light of the remedial and pragmatic interpretation given to the Act, <em>see Henry, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 17-18, 490 A.2d 320, an interpretation of the statutory language of goods or chattels \u201cof any type and description, regardless of the value thereof\u2019 that excludes coupons would \u201cimpermissibly limit the protection afforded by the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 18, 490 A.2d 320. Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in finding that coupons function as an important component of goods so as to qualify as \u201cmerchandise\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-lla(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The issue of probable cause has been described as \u201c \u2018something less than proof needed to convict and something more than a raw, unsupported suspicion\u2019 in essence, \u201c \u2018[i]t is a suspicion (or belief) of guilt that is well grounded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pantalone v. Bally\u2019s Park Place, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 127, 549 A.2d 55 (App.Div.1988) (quoting <em>State v. Davis, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>16, 23-24, 231 A.2d 793 (1967)). In <em>Pantalone, </em>judgment had been granted to a casino in a false imprisonment case under the Casino Control Act, <em>see N.J.SA </em>5:12-121(b). The casino had detained a customer based upon a comparison of a videotape that showed his resemblance to a photograph of a wanted forger. <em>Id. </em>at 124-127, 549 A.2d 55. We held that the trial judge should have performed his own independent assessment by compelling the production of the evidence upon which the casino justified its detention. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 549 A.2d 55. Rite Aid thus argues that <em>Pantalone </em>established that the decision as to whether probable cause exists is one for the trial judge alone to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In <em>Horn v. Village Supermarkets, Inc., </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 615 A.2d 663 (App.Div.1992), a jury awarded damages to an alleged shoplifter for malicious prosecution, but rejected his false arrest and false imprisonment claims. A supermarket security officer testified that he had observed the plaintiff place vitamins into his jacket pockets and proceed to the check-out line. When the officer made eye-contact with him, the suspect left the line and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>removed the vitamins from his person shortly before security detained him. The plaintiff insisted that he had not concealed any merchandise, but had only returned to a store aisle because he had forgotten to purchase something.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The Court surmised from the verdict that the jury had acquitted the supermarket of the false arrest and imprisonment charges because it had probable cause to believe that the plaintiff had attempted to \u201c\u2018willfully eonceal unpurchased merchandise\u2019\u201d that the supermarket was attempting to recover by detaining him. <em>I'd. </em>at 171, 615 A.2d 663 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-lle). Contrary to Rite Aid\u2019s position, <em>Horn </em>indicates that the issue of probable cause is for the jury where the facts are in dispute. <em>See Prostick v. Vroom, </em>128 <em>N.J.L. </em>383, 386, 26 A.2d 268 (Sup.Ct.1942), <em>aff'd, </em>129 <em>N.J.L. </em>465, 467, 29 A.2d 857 (E. &amp; A. 1943) (Probable cause is question of law when facts are undisputed). <em>Cf. Jorgensen v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>38 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 349, 118 A.2d 854 (App.Div.1955), <em>certif. denied, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>308, 119 A.2d 791 (1956) (defense prejudiced on probable cause determination where there was a factual dispute and jury was instructed that truth of charge was irrelevant to determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Liptak and Mello gave contradictory versions of the June 25, 1988 incident. The trial judge concluded that probable cause existed under either version and decided the issue as a matter of law. In fact, if the jury had accepted Mello\u2019s version as true, then he had probable cause under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-lle because there were grounds upon which a reasonable belief that Liptak had been shoplifting would have existed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">If the jury believed Liptak\u2019s version, however, it does not follow, as the trial judge concluded, that <em>Henry v. Shopper\u2019s World, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 19, 490 A.2d 320, supports a finding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>this case of probable cause as a matter of law. In <em>Henry, </em>a department store security guard had noticed a customer attempting to leave the store while \u201cwearing a coat with a tag fastened to its back.\u201d The guard detained the customer, who maintained that she had purchased the coat at the store the previous day. The tag did not verify the purchase because it only listed factual information about the jacket. We disagreed that the store lacked probable cause to detain her and rejected the plaintiffs argument that she had not hidden the coat within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:20-lle. We explained that the remedial purpose of the Act would best be served by reading the language \u201cas applying to items in plain view but worn or carried as though they had been purchased,\u201d as well as to \u201cmerchandise which is hidden or out of sight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-19, 490 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><em>Henry </em>is somewhat analogous to the instant appeal in that Liptak admitted removing a coupon from the inside of a panty hose package and placing the coupon and the merchandise in her basket, thereby ostensibly exhibiting the coupons as hers while in plain view. Nevertheless, unlike <em>Henry, </em>there is a factual dispute between what Liptak claimed that she did and what Mello contended that he saw her do. If the jury had believed Liptak, then there would have been no factual basis for probable cause to believe that she had been shoplifting. Mello had not testified, however, that he had observed Liptak act in the manner to which she had admitted. <em>Cf. Cooke, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 14, 232 A.2d 425, (implying that if anyone has seen shoplifting occur, then merchant has probable cause even if merchant did not see act). Because Rite Aid bears the burden of proving probable cause, an objective view of Liptak\u2019s actions could have afforded probable cause to detain her only if Mello had asserted that he had observed actions which would have supported a reasonable belief that shoplifting had occurred. <em>Cf. Carollo v. Supermarkets General Corp., </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 267-268, 597 A.2d 1105 (App.Div.1991) (supermarket security officer had reason to believe that suspect was shoplifting, and thus had probable cause to detain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>him, based upon her observation of suspect transferring pack of cigarettes from shopping cart to his jacket pocket). Accepting Liptak\u2019s version as true, we find that the trial judge erred in deciding probable cause as a matter of law. It was for the jury to resolve the factual dispute underlying the probable cause issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Liptak also argues on this appeal that the trial judge erred in holding that Rite Aid detained her for a reasonable period of time as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In <em>Cooke, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 12-14, 232 A.2d 425, a customer detained by a department store for allegedly shoplifting a pair of stretch pants appealed from a directed verdict dismissing her false imprisonment action on the ground that the jury should have decided whether she had been detained for \u201cmore than a reasonable time.\u201d We concluded that the Act approved a detention for the recovery of goods and the summoning of the police. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15, 232 A.2d 425. Under the circumstances of that case, we held (one judge dissented) that the twenty-seven minute interval between her detention and the arrival of police was not unreasonable as a matter of law. <em>Ibid. Cf. Henry, supra, 200 N.J.Super. </em>at 18-19, 490 A.2d 320, (thirty to forty-five minutes held not unreasonable detention period). Likewise, even relying on Liptak\u2019s testimony, Rite Aid\u2019s detention of her in order to discuss, report, and evaluate the incident was not for an unreasonable period of time. The trial judge did not err in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\"> Similarly, we find no error in the dismissal of Liptak\u2019s punitive damages claim. Punitive damages serve the \u201c \u2018admonitory function\u2019\u201d of \u201cexpressing society\u2019s disapproval of intolerable conduct and deterring such conduct where no other remedy would suffice.\u201d <em>Fischer v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>643, 657, 512 A.2d 466 (1986). Punitive damages do not apply to a situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>where a person has a legal right to do what was done and did so legally. <em>O\u2019Connor v. Harms, </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 30, 266 A.2d 605 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>137, 270 A.2d 40 (1970). Punitive damages are available in a false imprisonment case where the circumstances indicate \u201c \u2018an intentional and deliberate act imbued with the character of outrage.\u2019 \u201d <em>De Angelis, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 527, 501 A.2d 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Liptak complained that Mello had engaged in malicious conduct toward her, including: accusing her of theft; grabbing her shoulder and threatening her with arrest in order to bring her to his office; using a loud voice; threatening to \u201cbook her\u201d; and, clarifying with the police officer in her presence that Rite Aid had one year to prosecute her. Assuming these facts to be true, the trial judge correctly concluded that they did not support a prima facie case of egregious conduct so, as to allow recovery of punitive damages. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 524-527, 501 A.2d 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Liptak additionally contends that the judge erred in admitting into evidence the three-page patient intake evaluation form that therapist Bondy had completed during her first therapy session with Liptak at the Clinic. Liptak asserts that the form was both vague hearsay and prejudicial to her case because it informed the jury of Bondy\u2019s conclusion that Liptak was using the Rite Aid incident to deal with a marital problem of her husband\u2019s alleged alcoholism. The crux of Liptak\u2019s contention is that the records lacked reliability because Bondy was not qualified at trial as an expert and her diagnosis concerned a complex medical condition. Rite Aid simply responds that the record at issue satisfied the traditional standards established for the admissibility of business records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The purpose of the business records exception is to \u201cbroaden the area of admissibility of relevant evidence where there is necessity and sufficient guarantee of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>State v. Hudes, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>589, 599, 321 A.2d 275 (Cty.Ct. 1974). The rationale for the exception is \u201cfounded upon the theory \u2018that records which are properly shown to have been kept as required normally possess a circumstantial probability of trustworthiness, and therefore ought to be received in evidence.\u201d\u2019 <em>State v. Matulewicz, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>27, 30, 499 A.2d 1363 (1985) (quoting <em>Mahoney v. Minsky, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>208, 218, 188 A.2d 161 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\"><em>Feldman v. Lederle Labs, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>339, 354, 625 A.2d 1066 (1993), has identified three \u201crequisites for admissibility\u201d under the exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">First, the writing must be made in the regular course of business. Second, it must be prepared within a short time of the act, condition or event being described. Finally, the source of the information and the method and circumstances of the preparation of the writing must justify allowing it into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Contrary to Liptak\u2019s position, although an element of the common law exception, \u201c[t]he requirement of unavailability of the recorder has been eliminated\u201d from the modern exception. <em>Hudes, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 600, 321 A.2d 275. Nevertheless, the \u201cgeneral acceptance of reliability\u201d accorded to business records \u201cwill not attach if \u2018the trial court, after examining them ... and hearing the manner of their preparation explained, entertains serious doubt as to whether they are dependable or worthy of confidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matulewicz, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 30, 499 A.2d 1363 (quoting <em>Mahoney, supra, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>at 218, 188 A.2d 161); <em>see N.J.R.E. </em>808 (authorizing admissibility of hearsay statement containing <em>expert opinion </em>in absence of expert for cross-examination where circumstances \u201ctend to establish its trustworthiness\u201d). The determination of admissibility rests within the discretion of the trial judge, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>final decision as to trustworthiness or credibility is for the jury. <em>Mahoney, supra, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>at 218-219, 188 A.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">During the admissibility hearing, <em>see N.J.R.E. </em>104(a), former Clinic <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> supervisor Noblin testified that the patient intake evaluation form routinely served as the predicate for treatment by providing staff members with a \u201cstandardized record\u201d of patient history. The therapists supervised by Noblin completed this form contemporaneously with client meetings, after which she reviewed it for accuracy. Noblin buttressed the reliability of the completed form as a business record by testifying that it shared the characteristics of a hospital record in that Clinic therapists and doctors often relied upon the information contained therein for diagnostic treatment. <em>Cf. Webber v. McCormick, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 164 A.2d 813 (App.Div.1960) (admitting hospital record into evidence based upon testimony of hospital records custodian whose position afforded her sufficient knowledge of hospital recordkeeping to vouchsafe its reliability).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In <em>Falcone v. N.J. Bell Tel. Co., </em>98 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138, 146, 236 A.2d 394 (App.Div.1967), <em>certif. denied, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>190, 238 A.2d 475 (1968), we considered the admissibility of a patient record that contained the diagnosis made by the patient\u2019s deceased physician. Although concurring with the admission of the record into evidence under the exception, we found that the trial judge had abused his discretion in excising the diagnosis from the record. <em>See id. </em>at 147-150, 236 A.2d 394. The doctor\u2019s diagnosis was analogized to laboratory and X-ray reports as \u201cthe opinion of a scientific expert ... who has examined the patient, heard his statement and observed his symptoms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, 236 A.2d 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>While <em>Webber </em>supports the reliability of Liptak\u2019s patient intake evaluation form as a source of mental health treatment on the basis of Noblin\u2019s testimony, <em>Falcone </em>militates against the admissibility of Bondy\u2019s comment. The trial judge did not consider Bondy\u2019s qualifications, and he erred in admitting the record by not determining whether she was an expert in her field before accepting her opinion as a trustworthy segment of the Clinic record. <em>See Nowacki v. Community Med. Center, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 281-282, 652 A.2d 758 (App.Div.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Furthermore, in <em>State v. Martorelli, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 454, 346 A.2d 618, we noted \u201cthat not all diagnostic findings are admissible.\u201d Although \u201croutine observations, findings and conclusions clearly are admissible,\u201d an \u201cexpert opinion contained in business records may be excluded if it relates to diagnoses of complex medical conditions difficult to determine or substantiate.\u201d <em>Gunter v. Fischer Scientific Amer., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>688, 694, 475 A.2d 671 (App.Div.1984) (citing <em>Martorelli, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 453-454, 346 A.2d 618). The Supreme Court has acknowledged that \u201c[g]iven the complexity of the many diagnostic procedures involved, expert medical testimony is required to establish the fact of ... alcoholism.\u201d <em>Clowes v. Terminix Intern., Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 597, 538 A.2d 794 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The approach taken in <em>Nowacki </em>controls the applicability of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6), as qualified by <em>N.J.R.E. </em>808, to the Clinic form in the present appeal. In <em>Nowacki, </em>we held that, absent the opportunity to cross-examine, medical records should not be admitted where they concern \u201ca critical issue such as the basis for the diagnosis or cause of the condition in question.\u201d 279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 282-283, 652 A.2d 758. Bondy, a non-testifying \u201cexpert,\u201d concluded here that Mr. Liptak was an alcoholic, and that Liptak \u201c[was] using [the Rite Aid] incident to bring out [her] marital problem of alcoholism].\u201d The diagnosis of alcoholism, a complex medical condition, comprises the basis of Bondy\u2019s conclusion that Liptak was relying on the Rite Aid incident to deal with marital problems caused by her husband\u2019s alleged condition. That finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>was, therefore, a complex diagnosis concerning the psychological impact of cohabitating with an individual afflicted with alcoholism. Liptak was deprived, however, of the opportunity through cross-examination of testing the accuracy of Bondy\u2019s determination that Liptak\u2019s concern about her husband\u2019s alleged alcoholism had caused her emotional problems. The failure to afford Liptak her right to confront Bondy was critical to her cause because Bondy\u2019s conclusion directly contradicted Liptak\u2019s contention that Mello\u2019s actions had resulted in those difficulties. Accordingly, we find that the trial judge mistakenly exercised his discretion in admitting the Clinic records into evidence under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>808 (citing as factors dispositive of evaluation of trustworthiness of expert opinion contained in hearsay statement \u201cthe complexity of the subject matter\u201d and \u201cthe likelihood of accuracy of the opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In addition, given the aforementioned erroneous admission, it was a mistaken exercise of discretion under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 for the trial judge to admit this potentially prejudicial evidence. <em>See State v. Loftin, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>76, 96-97, 670 A.2d 557 (App.Div.1996). \u201cThe question ... is not merely whether the treating [therapist\u2019s opinion] will be prejudicial to the plaintiff[ ], but whether it will be unfairly so.\u201d <em>Stigliano by Stigliano v. Connaught Labs., Inc., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>305, 317 (1995). The Bondy opinion might have persuaded the jury as to the alternative cause of Liptak\u2019s injuries based upon a complex diagnosis the reliability of which was never established at trial. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>808. Under these circumstances, the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit the Clinic record was \u201cso wide of the mark that a manifest denial of justice resulted.\u201d <em>Loftin, supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 97, 670 A.2d 557 (quoting <em>State v. Carter, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>86, 106, 449 A.2d 1280 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We are also satisfied that plaintiffs new trial motion should have been granted. A motion for a new trial after a jury verdict should only be granted if \u201cit clearly appears that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-1; <em>see Dolson, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 7, 258 A.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">A new trial is warranted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">[wjhere a charge has [had] a natural tendency to interfere with the exercise of the jurors\u2019 unbiased judgment by reason of strong overemphasis of the court\u2019s opinion on the evidence, [because] the inference of false direction and undue influence is entirely reasonable, if not, ... irresistible. <em>[Morie v. New Jersey Manuf. Indem. Ins. Co., </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>70, 83, 137 A.2d 41 (App.Div.1957)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The trial judge advised the jury that he had considered Liptak guilty of shoplifting. This had the likely effect of misleading the jury in its deliberation on the only issue submitted to it: the reasonableness of the duration of Liptak\u2019s detention. The judge charged the jury that \u201cin your deliberations you are required to accept and be controlled by the law as stated and explained by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The judge informed the jury that he had decided the issues of probable cause and reasonable duration in Rite Aid\u2019s favor as a matter of law, and that its sole \u201cfunction will be to determine whether or not the manner in which the defendant was detained [was] reasonable____\u201d In analyzing the issue of reasonable manner, however, the judge also instructed the jury that he had found that Liptak had \u201cwillfully concealed unpurchased merchandise\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Through this charge, the judge usurped the jury\u2019s function by essentially telling the jurors to decide whether Rite Aid had acted reasonably in detaining an individual whom the judge regarded as a shoplifter as a matter of law. Under this state of affairs, it is likely that the jury viewed Rite Aid\u2019s actions as an inherently reasonable effort to recover merchandise from a shoplifter. <em>See Fitzmaurice v. Van Vlaanderen Mach. Co., </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 165, 264 A.2d 740 (App.Div.1971) (\u201cWe must assume that the jury was guided by the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d). The prejudicial impact of the conclusory statement was confirmed by the judge\u2019s prior instruction that he had already determined that Rite Aid had probable cause to detain Liptak in the first place. The effect of the trial judge\u2019s characterization of Liptak as a criminal sufficient<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ly establishes a probability of a miscarriage of justice given that impact, thus warranting reversal of the denial of Liptak\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>See R. </em>2:10-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Notwithstanding our determination that reversal is required, we reject Liptak\u2019s argument that the trial judge harbored an apparent subconscious prejudice toward her claim such as to support a finding of cumulative error. <em>See Feldman, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 352, 625 A.2d 1066 (citing <em>Borowicz v. Hood, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 424, 209 A.2d 655 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>298, 212 A.2d 170 (1965)). The record reflects that the judge conscientiously attempted to deal with complex legal issues and often resolved them on the merits in favor of Rite Aid. Our review of the record satisfies us that the judge did not comment or act during the trial in a manner \u201c \u2018so prejudicial as to prove unfairly devastating and detrimental to the rights of the [plaintiffs].\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Education Ass\u2019n of Passaic, Inc., </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 260, 284 A.2d 374 (App.Div.1971) (quoting <em>State v.
