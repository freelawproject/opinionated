The State also appeals from a judgment acquitting Kenneth L. Jones (defendant) entered by the Law Division judge seventy-two days after the judge had originally found defendant guilty of possession of marijuana, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We consolidated the two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">During the execution of a search warrant on October 28, 1993, at the residence of Beverly Blight (Blight) at 318 Ash Road, Bass River Township, members of the Ocean County Narcotics Strike Force (Strike Force) found $36,560<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in cash and more than one and one-half pounds of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">On January 13,1994, the Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office filed a verified complaint for forfeiture of the $36,560, alleging that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>constituted proceeds of illegal drug activity or, alternatively, had been or was intended to be used in the furtherance of unlawful activity or was an integral part of such activity. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:64-1 to -9.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">On May 18, 1994, the Ocean County Grand Jury returned an indictment against Blight and Kenneth Jones (defendant) charging them with third degree conspiracy to distribute marijuana, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A 2C:5-2 </em>and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5b(ll) (count one); fourth degree possession of marijuana in excess of fifty grams, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-10a(3) (count four); and third degree possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(l) and 5b(ll) (count five). The indictment also charged Blight with fourth degree distribution of marijuana, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-5b(12) (counts two and three).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">This case arises from the distribution of marijuana from Blight\u2019s residence during September and October 1993. Prior to trial, the trial court accepted Blight\u2019s and defendant\u2019s waiver of a jury trial. By consent of all parties, the trial court consolidated the forfeiture and criminal actions for purposes of trial. Immediately following the opening statements of counsel, Blight entered an unconditional plea of guilty to all but count one of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Earlier that year, in an unrelated drug transaction, Richard Ashworth was arrested for drug-related activities and pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to distribute marijuana. The State agreed to recommend a probationary sentence in exchange for Ashworth\u2019s cooperation with the Strike Force with regard to an investigation of suspected drug activity at 318 Ash Road. Specifically, Ashworth was instructed to arrange and conduct controlled purchases of marijuana from Blight while wearing a wireless body transmitter and using currency furnished by investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">During the trial the State offered the following evidence. During his conversation with Blight on the afternoon of September 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>1993, Ashworth arranged to purchase marijuana at Blight\u2019s residence later that evening. After Ashworth arrived at Blight\u2019s residence, she asked him to \u201cstep into my office,\u201d referring to the master bedroom. After proceeding into the master bedroom with Blight, Ashworth asked to purchase an eighth of an ounce of marijuana and Blight provided him with a clear plastic zip-lock bag containing marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">On September 21,1993, Ashworth arranged a second controlled purchase of marijuana from Blight. Upon arriving at her house that evening, Ashworth and Blight discussed at length whether Blight\u2019s source could secure large quantities of marijuana to be purchased by Ashworth. Blight noted that with regard to her drug transactions, \u201ceverybody makes a buck.\u201d During the conversation, Blight walked into the master bedroom while Ashworth remained in the living room. That evening Ashworth purchased sixth-eighth\u2019s of an ounce of marijuana from Blight.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">On September 30, 1993, Ashworth again arrived at Blight\u2019s house and was greeted at the door by defendant. Defendant, Ashworth and Blight then proceeded to the master bedroom where Ashworth and Blight again discussed the possibility of her source obtaining a large quantity of marijuana and the appropriate price for it. At one point, defendant noted that Blight\u2019s source was \u201cvery shaky to say the least.\u201d As Ashworth and Blight continued to discuss the price of the marijuana, defendant, while sitting on a platform bed, interjected, \u201cYou almost feel better about it when somebody is gonna do it for nothin\u2019, if somebody is gonna go it for nothin\u2019, ya know what I mean,\u201d and observed that, \u201cNobody is doin\u2019 dick for nothin\u2019.\u201d While in the bedroom, Ash-worth observed various quantities of marijuana in a gray strongbox which Blight removed from underneath the bed and then unlocked. Ashworth could see that the box contained various papers, including a piece of paper with his name written on it that reflected the amount of money he owed to Blight for the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>On October 7, 1993, Ashworth returned to Blight\u2019s house. Again defendant was present. As Ashworth, Blight and defendant stood together in the kitchen, Blight extolled the virtues of the marijuana she possessed and indicated that she and defendant had just smoked a thin joint and gotten high. Defendant added that \u201cIt\u2019s good pot,\u201d and stated that he was surprised by its potency. When Ashworth asked Blight if she was willing to sell marijuana in the amount of \u201ceight-eighths,\u201d defendant repeated \u201ceight-eighths.\u201d Defendant later asked Blight if her source had \u201ccome here to personally\u201d sell her the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Based upon the information gathered by Ashworth, investigators obtained a search warrant for Blight\u2019s residence, which they executed at approximately 7:00 p.m. on October 28, 1993. During a search of the bottom drawer of an unlocked filing cabinet located in the master bedroom, Investigator Jeffrey Vogt discovered a one-pound bag of marijuana. The investigator then uncovered a locked strongbox located directly underneath the bag of marijuana. He did not recall that any of the interior doors of the residence were locked when the search warrant was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">While searching the master bedroom, Investigator Michael Franzoso observed in plain view a second plastic bag of marijuana, later found to weigh one-half pound, atop the bed\u2019s headboard. He also found a triple-beam scale on the floor of the bedroom. In addition, the investigator recovered from the master bedroom a film container filled with foil-wrapped marijuana, a bag of marijuana cigarettes and assorted narcotics paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Investigators then attempted to locate the key to the locked strongbox. Keys obtained from Blight and defendant did not fit the lock. While searching underneath the cushions of a couch in the living room, Sergeant Jeffrey Bissey located keys. Blight, who was observing the search, exclaimed, \u201cOh, you found my keys. They\u2019ve been lost for approximately two months,\u201d and thanked him. The sergeant opened the locked box with one of the keys and discovered bank envelopes containing $36,000 in currency. Each envelope was marked with a figure that corresponded with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the amount of currency contained therein. Another $610 was recovered from Blight\u2019s purse during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">On November 5, 1993, Investigator Scott Haemmerle examined each envelope found in the strongbox to ascertain whether the serial numbers of the currency seized matched those on the currency previously furnished to Ashworth to conduct the controlled buys. Of the nineteen $20 bills, two $10 bills, and one $50 bill provided to Ashworth for the controlled buys on September 7 and 21, the investigator discovered the same $50 bill in an envelope numbered \u201csixteen.\u201d The investigator contemporaneously noted the match on the confidential fund expense voucher he was required to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Sergeant Jeffrey Harper of the Strike Force, an expert in narcotics and narcotics trafficking, testified that given the facts of this case, the marijuana found in Blight\u2019s bedroom was possessed for distribution purposes and not for personal use. With respect to the $36,000 found underneath the one-pound bag of marijuana in Blight\u2019s filing cabinet, Sergeant Harper stated that in his sixteen years of experience, he frequently observed that drug dealers hide their proceeds to avoid detection by police and customers intent on robbing them. According to Sergeant Harper, drug dealers rarely deposit the proceeds of their illegal activities in banks or other financial institutions in their effort to avoid creating a \u201cpaper trail\u201d from which authorities could be alerted to their illicit conduct. Lastly, Sergeant Harper testified that the price of one pound of marijuana was generally $1,200 to $1,600 and that a dealer could readily generate a net profit of $4,540 by selling the marijuana in one-eighth ounce quantities for $30.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Blight and defendant elected to testify at their joint trial. According to Blight, she first became acquainted with defendant in 1980 when she moved to 318 Ash Road and became his neighbor. She and defendant became \u201cemotionally dependent on each other\u201d and intimate in their relationship after defendant\u2019s wife left him in 1983. Defendant briefly moved in with her at 318 Ash Road for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>several weeks in the mid-1980\u2019s. Blight also claimed that prior to October 28, 1998, although defendant would frequently visit her house, his visits were short and he stayed overnight no more than once or twice a month. According to Blight, even though they had been engaged for six years, defendant was living in a bedroom of a next-door neighbor, Charles Suit, when investigators conducted the search of her house on October 28,1993.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Blight also claimed that she was drug dependent and that defendant had attempted unsuccessfully to secure her admission into various substance-abuse treatment programs prior to the search of her home. She denied that defendant sold drugs, although she acknowledged that he would occasionally smoke a joint with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Blight further maintained that her only source of subsistence, aside from dealing drugs, was public and emergency assistance, food stamps, and the occasional sale of puppies and candles. She also claimed that the $610 found in her pocketbook by investigators constituted profits from the sale of candles. Blight acknowledged that defendant \u201ccontributed substantial amounts\u201d to her \u201cfinancial position\u201d and had established a trust account for her containing approximately $7,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">She further claimed that when she was not home, she would lock the door to her master bedroom with a heavy dead-bolt lock for which she possessed the only key. Blight explained that the strongbox discovered by investigators belonged to defendant, who left the box at her house that morning because they were scheduled to meet with a lawyer to discuss purchasing a house. Although she acknowledged that she, too, possessed a key to the strongbox, Blight maintained that it contained only defendant\u2019s money derived from an inheritance. Blight claimed that she had lost her key to the strongbox for two months and did not have access to the strongbox \u201call the time.\u201d She adamantly denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>however, ever taking money from the box. She later claimed, though, that she would occasionally give defendant her paperwork to keep for her in the box.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Finally, Blight claimed that defendant had no knowledge of the large quantities of marijuana in her bedroom on October 28, 1993, and that she had placed the strongbox in the filing cabinet after visiting the lawyer. She further contended that she told the investigators during the search that the box belonged to defendant and that it contained only his money. Blight also denied profiting from the sale of marijuana, claiming that she turned over all proceeds to her source, whom she identified as her brother, in exchange for marijuana for her personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">During cross-examination, Blight acknowledged that defendant had applied for and obtained a credit card for which they were both jointly liable. Blight also conceded that defendant was aware that she was selling marijuana but asserted that he disliked Ashworth because defendant \u201cpretty much caught on to what was going on\u201d and \u201cnever discussed marijuana\u201d with her or Ashworth \u201cever.\u201d She further stated that defendant would only smoke marijuana when \u201centiced\u201d by her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Blight claimed that defendant usually carried the strongbox with him and would entrust it to her only when he stayed at her house or \u201cfor some reason,\u201d which was \u201chardly ever.\u201d Later, however, she testified that she kept her son\u2019s bonds in the box as well as her passport and birth certificate and \u201cpossibly\u201d those of her children. She denied stating to an investigator, \u201cThat\u2019s my money, I\u2019ve been saving that for a long time,\u201d when the strongbox was opened in the living room during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">When asked by the trial court whether she or defendant dominated their relationship, Blight asserted that she did and \u201cstill do[es].\u201d Immediately thereafter, she denied having any control whatsoever over defendant\u2019s strongbox. Blight further explained that defendant did not possess the key to her bedroom because \u201cnothing of his was in there\u201d and he was not permitted there without her permission. She admitted, however, that she and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>defendant had been engaged for six years and that defendant purchased an interest in her residence at 318 Ash Road in May 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Blight acknowledged misrepresenting information on her application for public assistance in September 1992 by failing to disclose her trust account established by defendant. Blight also reluctantly conceded that defendant would occasionally deposit personal checks and paychecks into her bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">According to defendant, from 1982 to 1987, he resided at 321 Ash Road before selling the house for a profit of $1,264, which he kept in his strongbox. He also identified a deposited check in the amount $9,897.02 which he claimed was given to him by his mother following his father\u2019s death in February 1987. He said he withdrew the entire amount from the bank and kept it in his strongbox. He further identified a letter dated December 11,1987, from an estate attorney which reflected a $2,310.46 advance on his inheritance following the death of his mother. Defendant claimed that he deposited that check, waited until it cleared, then withdrew the entire balance and added it to the money in his strongbox. When presented with his bank records obtained from Southern Ocean State Bank, he indicated that an initial deposit of $20,000 reflected in a statement constituted the bulk of his inheritance, which he gradually withdrew and kept in his strongbox. Finally, defendant testified that in July 1990 he established a trust account for Blight using $5,410.68 he had withdrawn from a pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">He further maintained that the funds he had accumulated remained in his strongbox and that he would take the box with him wherever he went. Although he \u201cnever really completely felt safe\u201d when he carried the box, he nonetheless believed it was \u201cvery safe\u201d at Blight\u2019s house because, according to defendant, she was always home and never went out.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Defendant acknowledged his long-standing engagement to Blight but asserted that prior to and during the search of her residence he had resided in a single bedroom rented from Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Suit at 320 Ash Road. He admitted that he did not pay rent but did perform services for Suit and bought food. However, defendant conceded that he listed 318. Ash Road as his place of residence when applying for employment with the Taj Mahal Casino prior to the search of Blight\u2019s home. He provided that same address to the Casino Control Commission when applying for employment with a casino. Defendant also claimed that he received mail at both 318 and 320 Ash Road, as well as at a post office box.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Defendant knew that Blight customarily kept her supply of marijuana in the master bedroom, but he disavowed any knowledge of the exact location. He also denied ever witnessing Blight selling marijuana to Ashworth. According to defendant, whenever he expressed his disapproval of Blight\u2019s drug dealing activities, she told him not to worry about it and to mind his own business. Although defendant claimed that he had previously contacted various agencies regarding possible substance-abuse treatment for Blight, he admitted that he occasionally smoked marijuana with her and acknowledged sharing a joint with her just before Ash-worth\u2019s visit on October 7,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On October 28, 1993, defendant took the day off as a security guard at the Taj Mahal Casino to perform some errands with Blight. He claimed that when he arrived at her house that morning, he gave her his strongbox to lock up before visiting Suit\u2019s attorney to discuss the purchase of Suit\u2019s home. Defendant maintained that he did not have a key to the master bedroom of Blight\u2019s house, nor did he enter the bedroom at any time the preceding week.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">On cross-examination, defendant conceded that Blight possessed the key to the strongbox for approximately one year before the search of her home. With respect to the $1,264 realized from the sale of defendant\u2019s first home, defendant claimed to have forgotten that $500 of the proceeds was paid to his former wife and the remaining amount was held in escrow to be paid to the Burlington County Welfare Board. Defendant further claimed that he earned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>between $200 and $225 per week net plus tips from 1987 to 1989 when he pumped gas before being hired by the Taj Mahal Casino in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">When questioned as to why he allegedly withdrew his inheritance from the bank and kept it in the strongbox, defendant claimed that he distrusted financial institutions after encountering legal difficulties with the distribution of his parents\u2019 estate in 1987. However, when confronted with a bank statement dated September 30, 1988, showing numerous deposits and withdrawals made by him from July through September 1988, defendant claimed that he \u201cwasn\u2019t certain why\u201d he continued to patronize the bank. Indeed, defendant acknowledged opening up both a personal checking account for himself and a trust account for Blight in 1990. Defendant asserted that he had no idea how much money he removed from the box between 1987 and 1990 and claimed that during this period he made no major purchases. He conceded, however, having purchased several used cars, one of them costing over $2,000, paid for with money obtained from the strongbox. He also said that he had paid \u201cfrom the money that [he] had\u201d the sum of $1,500 to attend school in Atlantic City in order to obtain temporary employment with a casino in Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Defendant further maintained that despite his fear that his car would be stolen, he nonetheless would leave the strongbox containing approximately $30,000 in the trunk wherever he went. Moreover, although he and Blight were engaged to be married, defendant claimed that he slept in the den area as often as four times a week and only rarely slept in the master bedroom. He also acknowledged receiving mail at Blight\u2019s address at least once a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Defendant also acknowledged being sentenced in federal district court on August 9,1990, following his plea of guilty to the crime of making fraudulent demands against the United States for cashing his deceased mother\u2019s social security checks. Although ordered to pay restitution to the Social Security Administration as a condition of probation, defendant conceded that he had not paid $4,000 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>outstanding restitution nor had he notified the Social Security Administration that he possessed the money contained in the strongbox. Furthermore, defendant obtained a mortgage for 318 Ash Road on March 29,1994, despite having had his money seized four months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">When shown various personnel forms pertaining to his employment at the Taj Mahal Casino which he had personally completed and signed in 1990, defendant admitted that he had misrepresented information concerning his address by listing both Blight\u2019s address and telephone number as his own. In a notarized letter to the Casino Control Commission dated December 1,1989, defendant again listed his permanent place of residence since September 1989 as 318 Ash Road. Defendant also listed Blight\u2019s telephone number and address on various banking forms when he opened accounts with Collective Federal Savings Bank in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Lastly, defendant indicated that at the time Blight\u2019s house was searched, only the television in the master bedroom worked. He asserted, however, that the master bedroom was \u201cpretty much off limits\u201d and that most of his papers were in his room at 320 Ash Street. Defendant maintained that he would not keep anything important in Blight\u2019s master bedroom because he lacked access to it but, nonetheless, would readily leave his strongbox there.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Defendant\u2019s daughter, Kelly Hamilton, testified that the strongbox contained money and her father frequently carried it with him. Brenda Molosky, Blight\u2019s daughter, testified that she never observed defendant sleeping at her mother\u2019s house and she occasionally observed him carrying an off-white or cream-colored box containing envelopes filled with money.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor called Investigator Krista Emerson, who participated in the search of Blight\u2019s house. She testified that when investigators opened the strongbox in Blight\u2019s presence, Blight stated, \u201cI have been saving that money for a long time.\u201d Postman Michael Dibb testified that his postal route included 318 Ash Road and that he had been delivering mail to defendant since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>1989. Dibb testified that he had <em>never </em>delivered mail to defendant at any address other than 318 Ash Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">At the close of the State\u2019s case in the joint trial, the trial court denied both Blight and defendant\u2019s motions for judgments of acquittal. At the conclusion of the trial on December 22,1994, the trial court found defendant guilty of fourth-degree possession of marijuana (count four). Defendant was acquitted of the remaining counts of the indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The trial court further ruled that the State had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the money seized during the execution of the search warrant constituted proceeds of illegal drug activity. The trial court concluded that the $36,000 seized from the strongbox and the $610 seized from Blight\u2019s purse during the search of her home were not the proceeds of illegal narcotics activity and were not used in the furtherance of unlawful activity; therefore, the money was not subject to forfeiture pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:64-1 to -9. Accordingly, the trial court ordered that the money be returned to defendant. However, because of fraud committed by defendant against the Social Security Administration, the trial court earmarked a portion of the currency for satisfaction of the amount defendant owed to the Social Security Administration. A written order memorializing the court\u2019s ruling was filed on February 28,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">On February 17, 1995, defendant filed a motion for reconsideration with respect to the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt as to count four. Following a hearing on March 3, 1995, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and set aside the verdict because it \u201cwasn\u2019t convinced beyond a reasonable doubt ... that [defendant] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ever intended to control that stuff.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The State filed notices of appeal from the order entered in the forfeiture action and the order of reconsideration of the finding of defendant\u2019s guilt on count four and granting a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The State contends that there was not sufficient credible evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the $36,560 seized by investigators was not subject to forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">After the presentation of evidence, the trial court explicitly rejected the claim by defendant and Blight that defendant carried the strongbox with him at all times. The trial court further dismissed defendant\u2019s thoroughly repudiated assertion that he distrusted banks and therefore never utilized them. Nonetheless, the trial court accepted as credible defendant\u2019s claim that the money in the strongbox belonged to him rather than Blight, and further concluded, without elaboration, that defendant had accurately identified legitimate sources of the money through his financial records.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Significantly, the trial court never distinguished the $610 found in Blight\u2019s purse from the $36,000 discovered in the strongbox. Nor did the trial court address the fact that since Blight pleaded guilty to two counts of distribution of marijuana at the onset of the proceedings, there existed a rebuttable presumption that the $610 was utilized in furtherance of an unlawful activity and therefore subject to forfeiture under N.J.S.A.-2C:64-3j.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Notwithstanding its acknowledgement that investigators had seized a considerable quantity of marijuana at Blight\u2019s residence, the trial court characterized her sale of marijuana as a \u201cham and egg operation.\u201d Based on Blight\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that her distribution of marijuana was confined \u201cto people across the street,\u201d the trial court further concluded that the size of her trafficking operation was inconsistent with the scale necessary to generate the $36,000 recovered from the strongbox.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s finding that possession of one and one-half pounds of marijuana equated to a \u201ctwo-bit operation\u201d appears to have derived from the undue emphasis it placed upon the alleged dominance of Blight over the defendant. For example, the trial court repeatedly remarked that Blight was \u201cthe dominant personality,\u201d who \u201csought to drag [defendant] down with her under the circumstances.\u201d In disregarding persuasive evidence that defendant, in fact, resided with Blight when her house was searched, the trial court stated: \u201cAgain, I\u2019ll say, believe it or not \u2014 I believe it in this case \u2014 she is so dominant, I\u2019m convinced, that he roomed next door. He wasn\u2019t living there.\u201d After assessing defendant as \u201cgenerally a productive person\u201d who meekly acquiesced in Blight\u2019s criminal activities, the trial court once more emphasized that Blight \u201cdominated\u201d their relationship. Based upon these findings, the trial court refused to order forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">An appellate court is bound by a trial judge\u2019s determination of credibility and those findings of fact which are reasonably supported by sufficient and credible evidence. <em>State v. Seven Thousand Dollars, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>223, 243, 642 A.2d 967 (1994) (O\u2019Hern J., dissenting); <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins.

When, however, the focus of the contested evidence is on the judge\u2019s evaluation of the underlying facts and implications to be drawn therefrom, this court has held that the appellate function \u201cbroadens somewhat.\u201d <em>C.B. Snyder Realty Inc. v. BMW of N. Am. Inc., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 69, 558 A.2d 28 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>165, 564 A.2d 883 (1989). Where an evaluation of the record leaves the reviewing court \u201c \u2018with the definite conviction that the judge went so wide of the mark that a mistake must have been made,\u2019 \u201d that court may \u201c \u2018appraise the record as if [it] were deciding the matter at inception and make [its] own findings and conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Pioneer Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co. v. Lucas, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332, 338, 382 A.2d 933 (App.Div.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Applying this standard, the trial court\u2019s decision denying forfeiture was totally unsupported by the facts and will be given no deference. The decision ignored the overwhelming evidence by the State, including defendant\u2019s own certification to State authorities as to his residence, and the trial court chose to accept testimony \u2014 bordering on the incredible \u2014 of witnesses who were either interested in the proceeding or so close to the interested parties as to have a clear capacity to be biased. We believe that the logical conclusion that can be drawn from the credible evidence is that on October 28, 1993, defendant lived with his long time fianc\u00e9e at 318 Ash Road; and, therefore, there was a direct causal relationship between the $36,000 and the sales of marijuana sufficient to render the money subject to forfeiture. By ruling otherwise, the trial court clearly missed \u201cthe mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The provision of the Code of Criminal Justice authorizing the civil forfeiture of property, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:64-la, provides that property is forfeitable if it consists of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">(1) Controlled dangerous substances, firearms which are unlawfully possessed, carried, acquired or used, illegally possessed gambling devices, untaxed cigarettes and untaxed special fuel. These shall be designated prima facie contraband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">(2) All property which has been, or is intended to be, utilized in furtherance of an unlawful activity, including, but not limited to, conveyances intended to facili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>tate the perpetration of illegal acts, or buildings or premises maintained for the purpose of committing offenses against the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">(3) Property which has become or is intended to become an integral part of illegal activity, including, but not limited to, money which is earmarked for use as financing for an illegal gambling enterprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">(4) Proceeds of illegal activities, including, but not limited to, property or money obtained as a result of the sale of prima facie contraband as defined by subsection a.(l), proceeds of illegal gambling, prostitution, bribery and extortion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">When non-prima facie contraband, also known as derivative contraband, is involved, the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the seized property, here the $36,560, was subject to forfeiture because it was used \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 or \u201cto facilitate the perpetration of\u2019 or as \u201can integral part of\u2019 the illegal act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:64-la. <em>State v. Seven Thousand Dollars, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 233-34, 642 A.2d 967. The State must therefore demonstrate a direct causal relationship between the use of the property and the illegal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 234, 642 A.2d 967; <em>State v. One 1986 Subaru, </em>120 <em>N.J </em>310, 320, 576 A.2d 859 (1990). \u201cThe connection connotes a sense of dependency; a merely casual relationship will not suffice.\u201d <em>State v. Seven Thousand Dollars, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 234-35, 642 A.2d 967. In those cases in which currency has been forfeited as derivative contraband, \u201cthe connection to illegal activity is often grounded in the money\u2019s proximity to prima facie contraband, such as controlled dangerous substances, or admitted past or planned illegal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 642 A.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The currency seized by investigators in the present case obviously could not have been in closer proximity to the marijuana: the strongbox containing the $36,000 was discovered resting directly underneath a one-pound bag of marijuana in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet in Blight\u2019s master bedroom, the same room where she conducted her transactions with Ashworth approximately one month before the search. Authorities also discovered in that same room an Ohaus triple-beam scale commonly used to measure narcotics, assorted narcotics paraphernalia and an additional one-half pound bag of marijuana. In rejecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>inescapable inference that the money, in fact, constituted proceeds from Blight\u2019s sale of marijuana or, alternatively, was utilized in some manner in the furtherance of her distribution operation, the trial court disregarded ample evidence that established Blight\u2019s control and use of the strongbox and its contents. For instance, she had the key to the strongbox which she kept in her locked bedroom, and she refused to give defendant the key to her bedroom or the right to enter it without her permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Most significantly, the trial court entirely discounted the testimony of Investigator Haemmerle who testified that a $50 bill given to Ashworth to conduct a controlled purchase of marijuana from Blight was discovered in an envelope in the strongbox during the search of her home. This testimony alone established that Blight controlled the box and utilized it during the course of her criminal endeavors. Similarly, the trial court disregarded without comment Ashworth\u2019s testimony that Blight opened an unlocked strongbox in his presence while in the master bedroom and removed a piece of paper reflecting the amount of money he owed Blight for the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Blight\u2019s utilization of the box was further established by the testimony of investigators who executed the search of Blight\u2019s residence on October 28, 1993. Sergeant Bissey testified without contradiction that when he attempted to unlock the strongbox using keys found in the residence, <em>including keys removed from defendant\u2019s person, </em>none fit the lock. However, when Bissey discovered the key ring in the couch, Blight stated, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve been looking for those keys.\u201d Investigator Emerson testified that when the box was opened in her presence, Blight exclaimed that she had been saving that money \u201cfor a long time.\u201d Moreover, it is uncontroverted that when opened, the strongbox was bereft of any personal papers or effects, although Blight and defendant each testified that such documents were usually kept in the strongbox.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In thoroughly insulating defendant from Blight\u2019s drug dealing, the trial court apparently disregarded the uncontested fact that Blight and defendant had been engaged for six years prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>search and, as evidenced by their joint credit card and the establishment of Blight\u2019s trust account, obviously commingled their assets. Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary, the State conclusively established that, at a minimum, defendant construed Blight\u2019s house as his permanent place of residence prior to and during the period in which Blight sold the marijuana to Ashworth. Defendant\u2019s financial and employment records, including a signed and notarized letter to the Casino Control Commission, all disclosed that defendant listed Blight\u2019s address and telephone number as his own. Aside from the testimony of defendant\u2019s and Blight\u2019s family members, defendant presented no corroboration whatsoever that he lived someplace other than at 318 Ash Road from 1989 through 1993. The court chose to ignore the best evidence of residence, that of the United States postman who, since 1989, delivered defendant\u2019s mail only to 318 Ash Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The transcripts of Ashworth\u2019s conversation with Blight and defendant on September 21, 1993, and October 7, 1993, belie defendant\u2019s assertion, accepted by the trial court, that he objected to Blight\u2019s illegal activities and her frequent use of marijuana. Defendant did not present any corroborative evidence that he had endeavored to secure substance-abuse treatment for Blight. Defendant\u2019s own admitted use of marijuana with her renders any such claim highly suspect. Moreover, if, as the trial court concluded, Blight so thoroughly dominated defendant, it necessarily follows that she also asserted control over his strongbox and the currency therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The trial court also ignored the fact that although defendant had deposited and then withdrawn his alleged inheritance from Southern Ocean Bank in 1988, the envelopes recovered from the strongbox were from Collective Federal Savings Bank. In addition, five of the envelopes were dated January 1992 and two were dated March 1993. Even the $610 recovered from Blight\u2019s purse was contained in Collective Federal Savings Bank envelopes.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The cross-examination by the prosecutor clearly demonstrated that neither Blight nor defendant were reluctant to dissembling when it suited their interests. The trial court itself dismissed as undeserving of belief several significant assertions made repeatedly by defendant, a convicted felon, and Blight, an admitted liar, relating to the strongbox. Although both also admitted defrauding government agencies, the trial court stated that \u201cI cannot permit that to affect my judgment.\u201d We are at a loss to understand how the trial court nevertheless credited defendant\u2019s self-serving claim of sole ownership of the strongbox and currency therein. Moreover, it is not credible that someone such as defendant would keep $36,000 in cash in a room to which he did not have ready access.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The trial court\u2019s finding that the strongbox and currency seized by investigators were unconnected to Blight\u2019s distribution operation is clearly not supported by adequate substantial and credible evidence. By statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">[e]vidence of a conviction of a criminal offense in which seized property was either used or provided an integral part of the State\u2019s proofs in the prosecution shall be considered in the forfeiture proceeding as creating a rebuttable presumption that the property was utilized in furtherance of an unlawful activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:64-3jJ</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">A wealth of evidence convincingly established by a preponderance of the evidence that the $36,610 (including the $50 from the controlled purchase) was not acquired from legitimate sources but rather was derived from, or formed an integral part of, the sales of large quantities of marijuana conducted from Blight\u2019s residence for which she was ultimately prosecuted and pled guilty. The contradictory statements of Blight and defendant on how and when the strongbox happened to be in Blight\u2019s file cabinet on the day of the search underscores the strength of the evidence against them and undermines the credibility of both.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The factual findings which undergird the judgment denying forfeiture are not supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence and are so wholly insupportable as to result in a denial of justice. <em>In re J.T., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 188, 634 A.2d 1361 (App.Div.1993). Therefore, the State was clearly entitled to the $36,560 seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The State contends that the trial court erred in setting aside its finding of defendant\u2019s guilt because there was overwhelming credible evidence to warrant a finding of constructive possession by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">At the conclusion of the trial on December 22, 1994, the trial court found sufficient evidence that defendant was guilty of possessing marijuana discovered in Blight\u2019s master bedroom under a theory of constructive possession. Specifically, the court found that defendant \u201chad constructive possession of the marijuana, if not on this date, on dates close to it\u201d since he \u201chad the ability to exercise control over that marijuana\u201d and was not denied access to it as claimed by defendant and Blight. The court accordingly found defendant guilty of fourth degree possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Seventy-two days later, at a hearing held on March 3, 1995, the court entertained defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of its previous finding of guilt with respect to count four. What is difficult to understand is that the trial court knew, as it stated during the summations, that the principal issue was \u201cwhether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>not there was an intention [by defendant] to exercise control or dominion\u201d over the marijuana. Despite defendant\u2019s admitted use of marijuana with Blight, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">I sat and listened to all the evidence in the case, and I think there was testimony, and correct me, [prosecutor], if I\u2019m wrong, that I think there were \u2014 there was an admission that he had a joint with her on one or two occasions. And it became apparent to me from all of his testimony who is the dominant person \u2014 underline the word dominant \u2014 with regard to this whole relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">The fact that he had one or two joints, and I\u2019m convinced that, based upon what I heard, he wasn\u2019t the guy that went in there and got them and rolled them and whatever. He \u2014 this was her stuff. In plain English. This was her stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">The bottom line is, I was wrong. I kind of \u201cthunk\u201d it at the time. It was no accident where I didn\u2019t say that he intended to possess it. I don\u2019t I \u2014 was struggling with that. And I say here, for all to hear, that I, obviously, wasn\u2019t convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, and I go no further than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">I wasn\u2019t convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he ever intended to control that stuff. There was ... no credible testimony that he ever did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">That was her stuff. She was trying to really get him to be a user, user, user. And he puffed a couple of joints \u2014 not to minimize that \u2014 on a couple of occasions. And for that \u2014 for me to say \u2014 it\u2019s a broad jump from there to say he possessed a pound and a half of stuff on that other day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Thereafter, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion and set aside the verdict because it \u201cwasn\u2019t convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendant] ever intended to control that stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Criminal possession of an item signifies \u201cintentional control and dominion, the ability to affect physically and care for the item during a span of time,\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>69, 82, 342 A.2d 841 (1975), accompanied by knowledge of its character. <em>State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587, 597, 404 A.2d 1111 (1979); <em>State v. Reed, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>554, 557, 170 A.2d 419 (1961). Possession may be either actual or constructive. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a. By definition, proof of constructive possession relies almost exclusively upon circumstantial evidence. As set forth by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in <em>State v. Brown, supra, </em>physical or manual control over the item itself is not required. All that is necessary is \u201can intention to exercise control over [the item] manifested in circumstances where it is reasonable to infer that the capacity to do so exists.\u201d 80 <em>N.J. </em>at 597, 404 A.2d 1111. The concept of construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tive possession permits several persons to jointly possess an object simultaneously. <em>State v. Foreshaw, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>166, 186, 584 A.2d 832 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>327, 598 A.2d 886 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">As a general proposition, criminal possession may not be inferred from a defendant\u2019s mere presence at the location where contraband is found. <em>State v. Brown, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 593, 404 A.2d 1111. To justify such an inference, there must be \u201c \u2018other circumstances ... tending to permit such an inference to be drawn.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citation omitted); <em>State v. Shipp, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>662, 665, 524 A.2d 864 (App.Div.1987). For example, evidence that a person had actually possessed contraband prior to its discovery may be admitted to demonstrate his or her constructive possession on the occasion charged. <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 339-40, 605 A.2d 230 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In applying this standard to the facts adduced at trial, the trial court should not have set aside its finding of defendant\u2019s guilt since the evidence and available inferences amply supported its original conclusion that defendant constructively possessed the marijuana beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed, the facts adduced at trial were analogous to those examined in <em>Brown. </em>There, the Court concluded that evidence presented by the State at trial was sufficient to permit the jury to draw the inference that defendant was in constructive possession of narcotics discovered in a dress located in the bedroom closet of an apartment. Specifically, the State established at trial that defendant resided at the apartment and had permitted officers to enter it upon the execution of a search warrant. <em>State v. Brown, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 590-91, 404 A.2d 1111. Here, whether or not defendant resided at 318 Ash Road, there was ample circumstantial evidence that he constructively possessed the marijuana on October 28,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Furthermore, in <em>State v. Brown, </em>the Court noted that the presence of narcotics paraphernalia in the apartment and the observation by police officers of known and suspected narcotics users frequenting the apartment over a three-day period further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>served to strengthen the inference of defendant\u2019s knowledge and control of the concealed heroin. <em>Id. </em>at 595-97, 404 A.2d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Here, as in <em>Brown, </em>defendant was on the premises when the marijuana was discovered and \u201c[tjhere were other evidential circumstances lending distinctive color to the character of defendant\u2019s presence at the scene.\u201d Id. at 594, 404 A.2d 1111; <em>see State v. Milton, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 523, 605 A.2d 757 (App.Div.1992). For example, defendant acknowledged smoking marijuana with Blight at her residence on October 7, 1993, less than one month before the search of the residence, and on several previous occasions. Indeed, while in the presence of Ashworth on October 7, defendant characterized the marijuana he had just smoked as potent and of good quality. Moreover, defendant acknowledged his awareness of Blight\u2019s drug-dealing activities and the presence of her personal supply of marijuana in the master bedroom, the same bedroom he claimed to have slept in at least once or twice a month. He further acknowledged sleeping in the den area of Blight\u2019s house as often as four times a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">For some inexplicable reason, the court discounted the substantial and compelling evidence that defendant, in fact, resided with Blight, his long-time fianc\u00e9e, prior to and during the period in which her residence was searched and was present during two drug sales to the State\u2019s informant. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision that defendant did not constructively possess the marijuana is in startling contrast to its decision that defendant had sole possession of the strongbox lying underneath a one-pound bag of marijuana in Blight\u2019s bedroom to which he did not have a key.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Viewing the evidence in its entirety, the trial court was certainly entitled and perhaps even compelled to draw the inference of intent, knowledge and control of the marijuana by defendant at the time of execution of the search warrant on October 28, 1993. There was no insufficiency of evidence. <em>See State v. Berry, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>280, 303, 658 A.2d 702 (1995). The best evidence that there were sufficient proofs to preclude the setting aside of the verdict of guilt based upon insufficient evidence lies in the fact that if this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>matter had been tried to a jury, the judge could not have granted a motion for a judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case nor after all the evidence had been closed pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:18-1. The trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary is clearly a mistaken one and is so plainly unwarranted that the interests of justice demand our intervention and correction. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Because the trial court\u2019s setting aside of its finding of guilt was so wide of the mark, we reverse it, reinstate the finding of guilt and remand the matter for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Defendant argues that the State\u2019s appeal of his acquittal is barred by the principle of double jeopardy. The defendant misstates the issue involved herein, which is whether the State may appeal a trial court\u2019s setting aside of its finding of guilt when there was sufficient evidence to justify the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that no persons shall be \u201csubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. V. The language of its New Jersey constitutional counterpart provides that \u201c[n]o person shall, after acquittal, be tried for the same offense\u201d and has been held to be fully coextensive in scope and application with the federal prohibition against double jeopardy. <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, 1111; <em>State v. Farmer, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>145, 168, 224 A.2d 481 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>991, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1305, 18 L.Ed.2d 335 (1967); <em>State v. Ortiz, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>233, 240, 494 A.2d 822 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>300, 508 A.2d 187 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Double jeopardy protection is afforded in three distinct circumstances. \u201cThe double jeopardy guarantees protect against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal or after conviction, and against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>State v. Darby, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>432, 438, 587 A.2d 1309 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>(App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>342, 598 A.2d 898 (1991). However, when a judge rules in favor of a defendant after a verdict of guilty has been entered by the trier of fact, the State may appeal from that ruling without running afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>State v. Lynch, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>327, 341, 399 A.2d 629 (1979) (citing <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>420 <em>U.S. </em>332, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>1013, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975)); <em>State v. Tropea, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>309, 314, 394 A.2d 355 (1978). This exception to the double jeopardy bar derives from the recognition that when a verdict of conviction is improvidently set aside, appellate reversal does not expose a defendant to further proceedings because it has the automatic effect of reinstating the jury verdict. <em>State v. Lynch, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 399 A.2d 629. In short, the specific vice sought to be prevented by the Double Jeopardy Clause \u2014 successive and vexatious prosecutions for the same criminal act \u2014 is simply not implicated under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Of particular import to this case is the recognition by the United States Supreme Court that the aforementioned exception to the double jeopardy bar is equally applicable to a finding of guilt which is set aside following a bench trial. In <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>1, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>24, 50 L.Ed.2d 1 (1976), the Court explicitly construed a District Court\u2019s general finding of guilt following a bench trial as the approximation of a verdict of guilty for purposes of double jeopardy. Specifically, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201cSince the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment nowhere distinguishes between bench and jury trials, the principles given expression through that Clause apply to cases tried to a judge____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cA general finding of guilt by a judge may be analogized to a verdict of \u2018guilty\u2019 returned by a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\"><em>[Id. </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>at 3, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 26, 50 L.Ed.2d at 4 (quoting <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>420 <em>U.S. </em>358, 365-66, 95 <em>S.Ct </em>1006, 1011, 43 L.Ed.2d 250, 257 (1975))].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Likewise, the trial court\u2019s disposition of defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration in the present case, months after the finding of guilt, obviously constituted the functional equivalent of a judgment of acquittal entered in accordance with <em>R. </em>3:18-2 following a jury verdict of guilty. Consequently, the State is entitled to appeal the setting aside of the verdict since success on the appeal would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>result only \u201cin the reinstatement of the general finding of guilt, rather than in further factual proceedings relating to guilt or innocence,\u201d <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>at 3-4; 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 26, 50 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 4. <em>See R. </em>2:3 \u2014 1(b)(3); <em>State v. Lynch, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>at 341-42, 399 A.2d 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The trial court did not, as claimed by defendant, set aside its finding of guilt because of insufficient evidence. In addressing defendant\u2019s motion for judgments of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case on December 21,1994, the trial court was afforded an opportunity \u2014 contemporaneous with the elicitation of the evidence \u2014 to consider the State\u2019s proofs in light of the standard set forth in <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-59, 236 A.2d 385 (1967). Significantly, it denied the motion for judgments of acquittal as to all counts in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Furthermore, when the trial court originally found defendant guilty of possessing marijuana in Blight\u2019s master bedroom, it explicitly acknowledged that based upon the State\u2019s proofs, an inference could readily be drawn that defendant \u201chad constructive possession of the marijuana\u201d since he \u201chad the ability to exercise control over that marijuana\u201d and was not denied access to it as claimed by defendant and Blight. Months later, the trial court inexplicably based its rejection of that same inference on the interlocking and self-serving testimony of defendant and Blight, which it deemed credible. This testimony obviously was given to insulate defendant from Blight\u2019s admitted wrongdoing. Because the trial court months later apparently disagreed with its own original resolution of the conflicting evidence presented at trial, it impermissibly changed its mind in the face of amply sufficient evidence. In fact, we believe that the evidence was not only sufficient but, when considered in its entirety, it fairly reeks of defendant\u2019s guilt of constructive possession of the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Based upon the State\u2019s factual evidence and expert testimony, <em>State v. Berry, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 303, 658 A.2d 702; <em>State v. Reyes, supra, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>at 458-59, 236 A.2d 385, the defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal after presentation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>State\u2019s case; therefore, the motion for reconsideration must be considered as a motion for a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The trial court never mentioned the words \u201cagainst the weight of the evidence,\u201d but that was really the basis for setting aside the finding that defendant was guilty. In <em>Tibbs v. Florida, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>31, 44, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2211, 2219, 72 L.Ed.2d 652, 663 (1982), the United States Supreme Court unequivocally held that when a verdict is set aside by a reviewing court as being against the weight of the evidence, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial for the same offense. Therefore, the mere reinstatement of the trial court\u2019s initial and correct finding of guilt would neither violate the Double Jeopardy Clause nor implicate \u2014 much less negate \u2014 the concerns embodied therein. Accordingly, the State is not foreclosed on double jeopardy grounds from seeking review of the court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The Double Jeopardy Clause does not shield defendant from review of the trial court\u2019s patently erroneous conclusion that its earlier finding of guilt was not sustained by the weight of the evidence adduced at the trial. Therefore, we reverse and vacate the March 3,1995, judgment of acquittal, reinstate the trial court\u2019s initial finding of guilt with respect to count four and remand so that the trial court can reinstate the finding of guilt on count four, charging defendant with fourth degree possession of marijuana, and sentence defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">We also reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying forfeiture and remand to the trial court to enter an order of forfeiture of the currency in the amount of $36,560.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-11\"> The only judgment of conviction/judgment of acquittal entered (which erroneously states that the adjudication was by jury trial) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">It is, therefore, on 12/22/94 ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the defendant is acquitted of the charges contained in Counts One and Five of Indictment 94-5-00442.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-13\">It is, therefore, on 03/03/95 ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the defendant is acquitted of the charges contained in Count Four of Indictment 94-5-00442.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-14\"> The amount set forth in the forfeiture complaint is derived from the $36,000 found in a strongbox at 318 Ash Road and $610 recovered from Blight\u2019s purse, minus $50 used by investigators to conduct a controlled purchase of marijuana from Blight prior to the execution of the search warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\"> Subsequent to October 1993 defendant acquired an interest in 318 Ash Road and moved in with Blight on a permanent basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> The record does not contain any judgment of acquittal of defendant on counts one and five. Blight was acquitted ol count one of the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\"> At that point, based upon defendant's admission that he smoked marijuana with Blight, the prosecutor asked the trial court to consider the lesser-included offense of failing to deliver a controlled dangerous substance to the nearest law enforcement officer in violation of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(c). The trial court found defendant not guilty of that offense as well. The State has not appealed from that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\"> The trial court\u2019s statement on December 22, 1994, that it believed Blight\u2019s assertion that her buyers were limited to \"people across the street\" is totally insupportable given that only two days earlier, it had accepted her picas of guilty to two counts of fourth degree distribution of marijuana based on her sales of marijuana to Ashworth on September 7 and 21, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> When explaining on direct and cross-examination how the strongbox got into the file cabinet, Blight stated that she \"went in the house and put the box away\u201d after she and defendant had visited a lawyer that morning regarding a \u201ccash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>deal\" involving the purchase of a house. Defendant, however, testified that before going to visit the lawyer, he \"handed [the box] to her and asked her to lock it up for me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b289-13\"> In defendant\u2019s supporting brief, defendant\u2019s attorney improperly stressed the importance of the penalty to defendant, stating, \"In addition, he will lose his driver\u2019s license, <em>leaving both him and Mrs. Blight without transportation.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) We will never know if this had an effect, consciously or otherwise, on the trial court's decision to reverse itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
