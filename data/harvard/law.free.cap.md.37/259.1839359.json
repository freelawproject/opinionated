And if this be true, any decree which the Court might pass in the premises, could not be set up as a defence by the garnishee against condemnation of funds in his hands, of such association duly attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-11\">The District Court of the United States, sitting as a Court in bankruptcy exercises a limited, statutory, special jurisdiction. In adjudicating a party a bankrupt, the facts giving the Court jurisdiction must appear on the face of the record \u2014 -otherwise its decree is <em>coram nonjudice </em>and void. It is apparent from the record in the Dairy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Association case, that the Court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate .the Association a bankrupt, because the Act of Congress requires, that the petition shall be filed on behalf of the corporation, <em>\u201cby an officer duly authorized by a vote of a majority of the corporators present at any legal meeting called for the purpose.\u201d Bankrupt Law, sec. </em>37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">The demurrer in this case admits the fact alleged in the replication that \u201cthe said W. E. Eundenberg was not duly authorized to file (the petition) by a vote of the majority,\u201d &amp;c. Wherefore the District Court was without jurisdiction to adjudicate the Association a bankrupt; its decree to that effect was null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-6\">The plea of \u201cbankruptcy\u201d set up by the garnishee was bad \u2014 and judgment on the demurrer ought, to have been for the appellant \u2014 (the plaintiff below.) <em>Matter of Lady Bryan Mining Co., </em>2 <em>Abbott\u2019s U.

Assuming this construction to'be correct, without, however, so deciding, the question is, whether the property in the hands of the assignee in bankruptcy is liable at the instance of creditors to the attachment laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The Bankrupt Act of 1867 was passed by Congress in pursuance of Section 8, Article 1, of the Constitution of the United States. By that section full power is conferred upon Congress over the subject of bankruptcy, with the single qualification, that the laws passed in pursuance thereof shall be uniform throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The first section of the Act of 1867, provides that the several District Courts of the U. States shall have original jurisdiction in proceedings in bankruptcy, and this is followed by a general provision extending such jurisdiction to all acts, matters and things to be done under and in virtue of the bankruptcy, until the final, distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>and settlement of the bankrupt estate. The jurisdiction hereby conferred on the Federal Courts is <em>superior </em>and <em>exclusive </em>in all matters arising under the statute, and from the time proceedings in bankruptcy are begun, the District Court has jurisdiction over the bankrupt, his estate and all questions connected therewith. The bankrupt Act having been passed in pursuance of the Constitution of the United States, whenever by express words, or by necessary implication, it affects the jurisdiction of State Courts or the remedies of suitors therein, they must yield to the <em>paramount law. </em>Not only is original jurisdiction in matters of bankruptcy conferred by the Act of 1867 upon the Federal Courts, but it would be inconsistent with the plain purposes of the law, and destructive of the system itself to permit creditors, by resorting to State tribunals, to withdraw against the will of the bankrupt Court, property or cases belonging to the jurisdiction of that Court. <em>Bump\u2019s Law and Practice of Banlcruptey, </em>262. Moreover, if the contention of the appellant be correct, we should have the State Courts deciding one way and the Federal Courts another, thus inevitably leading to a conflict in jurisdiction, which it was the obvious policy of the law to avoid.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Akj\">(Decided 29th January, 1873.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The question, then, as to whether the petition in this case was filed by an officer of the corporation legally authorized by the Act of 1867, is one which belongs to the Bankrupt Court, and whilst the proceedings in bankruptcy are <em>in fieri, </em>its judgment and the grounds upon which it was rendered, are not matters of review in a State Court. The assignee holds the property by virtue of his appointment by the bankrupt Court, and to that <em>Court alone, </em>is he responsible for its custody and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">For these reasons the judgment of the Court below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ADt\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
