To this plea the plaintiffs replied, admitting the proceedings in Equity to sell the real estate of T., as stated in the plea, but averring that they were not made parties to such proceedings; They 'denied that the complainant in the Equity suit held a vendor\u2019s lien on <em>all </em>the real estate of T., and averred that their judgment recited in the <em>scire facias </em>was a lien upon his real estate which was purchased by the defendants.

Henry W.

Thomas, in the original judgment, under a decree in Equity against him .to enforce the payment to the complainant therein of a vendor\u2019s lien <em>on part </em>of the real estate of said Thomas, yet, <em>all </em>his real estate not being subject thereto, and particularly <em>a portion thereof </em>on which the plaintiffs\u2019 original judgment was a lien, that therefore the plaintiffs were entitled to a <em>\u201cfiat\u201d </em>against these \u201c <em>terre-tenants,\u201d </em>the defendants, in respect to this <em>part </em>of the real estate of Henry W.'

Thomas, which existed before the decree in the Equity suit; <em>second, </em>with the other judgment of the Court below sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 demurrer to the 3rd plea of Miles, and to the 4th plea of Elizabeth Thomas and Lyon, which thereby decided, that though the plaintiffs had notice of the proceedings in the Equity suit, and had become a party thereto after the decree and sale therein, by appearing and filing their claim as a creditor of Ilenry W. Thomas upon the judgment recited in the <em>\u201c scire facias,\u201d </em>and seeking payment thereof out of these proceeds of sale, and that although the defendants have no other land which ever was possessed by the said Henry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>except those as aforesaid purchased and paid for by them\u2014 yet, that the lien of the said original judgment of the plaintiffs on the said real estate was not wholly cleared or extinguished thereby.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUg\">The bill filed by Elizabeth Thomas against Henry W. Thomas, referred to in this cause, being simply to enforce her vendor\u2019s lien, and having no common interest with the other creditors of Henry the debtor, will not be treated as a creditor\u2019s suit, and does not implicate the rights of other creditors. <em>Ellicott vs. </em>Welch, 2 <em>Bland, </em>242; <em>Hammond vs. Hammond, </em>2 <em>Bland, </em>306.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">In the case of a creditors\u2019 bill, all creditors and others interested may be made parties \u2014 all the estate of the debtor is sold, the proceeds brought into Court and paid off to all creditors, and the estate finally settled up as to all interested ; but not so on such a bill as this, by vendor against vendee.

Thomas being seized of one-fourth of the real estate descended to him and his brothers and sister, purchased from his sister one-third of her one-fourth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>thereby holding one-third of the entire land descended ; on this one-third of one-fourth \u2014 that is, one-twelfth of the entire estate, Elizabeth Thomas had a vendor\u2019s lien when the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment was recovered against Henry W. Thomas, which became a lien on his <em>entire one-fourth which deseended-to him </em>\u2014 and this lien has never in any manner been released, nor has the judgment been paid. The proceeding instituted by Elizabeth Thomas, was to enforce <em>her vendor\u2019s lien </em>by the sale of the land she sold to Henry \u2014 nothing else. She could, therefore, obtain a decree for only what she sold him \u2014 that was, <em>one-fourth </em>of the land ; any other land he held, on which the plaintiffs had a lien, could not be sold ; the Court had no jurisdiction to sell more than that on which the <em>vendor had a lien, </em>and any such sale would be void and be set aside. <em>Johnson and Wife vs. Robertson and Pearre, </em>34 <em>Md., </em>175.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\">The Court of Equity <em>did not and could not </em>sell <em>the whole </em>of the land of Henry W.

But if such had been the decree, it would have been inoperative as against these plaintiff's.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-6\"><em>J.

The decision of a Court of competent jurisdiction, upon a matter properly within the scope of its jurisdiction, whether correct or not, is, until reversed, binding upon the Court rendering it and every other Court, and can never be attacked or im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>peached collaterally. If errors be committed, they must be corrected by appeal, bill of review or some other <em>direct </em>proceeding. The Circuit Court for Saint Mary.\u2019s County, in Equity, a Court of competent jurisdiction, having decided that the vendor\u2019s lien of Elizabeth Thomas covered the <em>tohole </em>land of Henry W. Thomas, the correctness of that decision cannot be inquired into in this proceeding. <em>Powles, et al. vs. Dilley, et al., </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>222, 241; <em>Ranoul vs. Griffie, </em>3 <em>Md., </em>54, 60; <em>Clark &amp; Jackson vs. Bryan &amp; Lunt, </em>16 <em>Md., </em>171, 176; <em>Elliott, et al. vs. Piersol, et al., </em>1 <em>Peters, S. C., </em>340; <em>Cockey vs. Cole, </em>28 <em>Md., </em>284.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">The judgment of the plaintiffs having been rendered subsequently to the attachment of the vendor\u2019s lien, it was not necessary that the plaintiffs should be made parties to the proceedings to enforce the lien. They were bound <em>to </em>seek payment out of the surplus of the proceeds of sale in the hands of the trustees, if any such existed; and they cannot follow the land into the hands of the purchasers. As at law, the sale by the sheriff, under the elder judgment, conveys the title, and the holders of the junior judgments must look to the fund, so in equity the sale to enforce the elder lien conveys the title, and the holders of the junior liens must look to the fund in the hands of the trustees. Courts of Justice guard with jealous vigilance the rights of purchasers under judicial sales, <em>Murphy vs. Cord, </em>12 <em>G. &amp;J., </em>182; <em>Elliott and Wife\u2019s lessee vs. Knott, </em>14 <em>Md., </em>134, 135; <em>Brawner vs. Watkins, </em>28 <em>Md., </em>217.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">Bills to enforce a vendor\u2019s lien are in the nature of bills for the specific performance of a contract, and only the parties to the contract are necessary parties to the proceeding. <em>Barroll\u2019s Chancery Practice, </em>78, 80; <em>Crook and Wife vs. Brown, et al., </em>11 <em>Md., </em>158; <em>Elysville Manf. Co. vs. Okisko Co., </em>5 <em>Md., </em>152.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">Admitting that the judgment of the appellants was a lien on the real estate of Henry W. Thomas, that lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>was subordinate to the vendor\u2019s lien which had existed and attached long before, and which the Circuit Court by its decree decided attached to the <em>whole </em>of the estate. And any proceeding which the appellants might have seen fit to institute to enforce their judgment lien, could-only have been prosecuted in subordination to the senior lien of the vendor. The appellants do not present the case in its proper light when they assert the priority of their judgment lien \u2014 their judgment may be older than the decree under which the property was sold, but it is junior to the vendor\u2019s lien which attached nearly twenty years ago \u2014 the decree relates back to this lien \u2014 the appellants are therefore junior incumbrancers; and the cases of <em>Duvall vs. Speed, </em>and <em>Brooks vs. Brooke, </em>relied on by the counsel for the appellants, do not apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\">Those cases held that <em>prior </em>incumbrancers, not parties to the bill, were not bound to seek payment of their claims out of the proceeds of sale ; and if not paid, might prosecute their liens \u00e1gainst the purchasers. Suppose the appellees had held a judgment of the same date as the vendor\u2019s lien, against Henry W. Thomas, or a mortgage, and the property had been sold under execution, or under a decree to foreclose, could 'the appellants have' successfully prosecuted their claim against the purchasers ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">. There is a fatal objection to the replication of the plaintiffs, and the judgment on the demurrer should be for the defendants.. The replication is <em>had for uncertainty, </em>and final judgment for .the plaintiffs could not be executed. The uncertainty consists in this, that the replication only claims that a <em>part of the real estate </em>of Henry W. Thomas in the hands of the defendants is liable to the lien of their judgment. But they do not say or claim <em>what part, </em>whether a fourth, fifth, sixth, or one hundredth part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">The plaintiffs do not claim in their replication that their lien is on the whole of the real estate of Henry W., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>now in the hands of the defendants, but only claim that it exists on part, but what part, is left entirely to conjecture. In all cases of <em>scire facias </em>against <em>ierre tenants, </em>the land must be described with sufficient certainty to enable the sheriff to levy upon it under a <em>fi. fa., </em>and sell it. The judgment of the Court against the <em>ierre tenant </em>is, that the plaintiff shall have the amount of his judgment levied upon certain land in the hands of the <em>terre-tenant, naming and describing the land with sufficient accuracy </em>to identify it. 2 <em>Evans\u2019 Harris, </em>364 <em>and </em>365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-5\">The land sought to be made liable in the hands of the terre-tenants; for the debt due the plaintiff's, must be described with reasonable certainty, either in the writ itself, the return of the sheriff to the <em>scire facias, </em>or in some of the subsequent pleadings. If there be no description whatever of the land in either the writ, return, or subsequent pleadings, how can judgment possibly be rendered for the plaintiffs ? In the case at bar, there is no description whatever of the land in either the writ, return, or pleadings; the land may be one or one thousand acres. It may be black acre, lying at Point Lookout, or white acre, lying at Charlotte Hall. <em>Mitchell vs. Williamson, </em>6 <em>Md., </em>218.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b263-6\">Robinson J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Age\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">A <em>scire facias </em>was issued against the appellees, as <em>ierre tenants </em>to revive a judgment recovered by the appellants against Henry W. Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The appellees severed, but pleaded substantially the following pleas:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">1st.- <em>Nul tiel </em>record.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">2nd. That before the issuing of the <em>scire facias, </em>the defendant, Elizabeth Thomas, filed a bill in Equity to sell the land of Henry W. Thomas, to enforce a vendor\u2019s lien, which she held against all the real estate of the said Henry ; that said lien had existed and attached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>long before the rendition of the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment, that said Henry appeared to said suit, and a decree was passed for the sale of said real estate, that the same was sold by a trustee appointed by the court, and bought, paid for, and conveyed to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">3rd Plea. That the plaintiffs had notice of the suit in Equity, and after the decree and sale thereunder, became parties by appearing and filing their claim as \"creditors of the said Henry W. Thomas, upon the judgment recited in the <em>scire </em>facias, and 'seeking payment thereof, out of the proceeds of sale, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">To this third plea of the defendant Miles, .and which is the fourth plea of the other defendants,' the plaintiffs demurred, and the Court sustained the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">To the second plea of the defendant Miles, and to the second and third pleas of the other defendants, the plaintiffs filed a replication, in which they admit the proceedings in Equity to sell the real estate of H. W. Thomas, as stated in said pleas, but say they were not made parties to said proceedings; they deny that the complainant in said Equity suit, had a vendor\u2019s lien.on <em>all </em>the real estate of the said Henry, and aver that their judgment recited in the <em>scire facias, </em>was and is a lien \u25a0 upon his real estate situate in St. Mary\u2019s County, and which was sold under said proceedings, and purchased by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">To this replication, the defendants demurrred, and it is from the judgment of the Court sustaining the demurrer, and the-general judgment entered for the defendants, that this appeal is taken. It thus appears by the pleadings, that the judgment recited in the <em>scire facias </em>was recovered against the said Henry W. Thomas, prior to the filing of the bill to enforce the vendor\u2019s lien ; that'the plaintiffs were not made parties to said proceeding, and that the said vendor\u2019s lien did not attach to all the real estate of the said Thomas, sold under the decree, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>purchased by the defendants. The question then is, whether the defendants can plead the decree of the Court passed in said cause, and the sale thereunder, as a bar to a <em>scire facias </em>on said judgment, brought by the plaintiffs against them as <em>terre tenants </em>of the said Henry W. Thomas?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The well settled rule of law, that a judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction, coming incidentally in question, or offered as evidence of title, cannot be impeached on the ground of informality in the proceedings, or mistake of the Court in the matter decided, relied on by the counsel for the appellees, we do not understand as being questioned by the other side, But there is a wide distinction between offering a judgment in evidence, as a muniment, or link in the chain of title, and pleading it as a bar or an estoppel to the right of a party to maintain his action. When offered in evidence, say the Court, in <em>Barney vs. Patterson, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>182, the judgment is not binding <em>per se, </em>it is merely evidence of title or the right to maintain the suit, but when pleaded in bar, or relied on as an estoppel, the party whom it affects, is <em>not </em>permitted to aver against it, or offer evidence to controvert it. In the latter case, the effect and operation of the judgment does not come incidentally in question, nor is it offered as evidence of title, but it is set up and relied upon as conclusive <em>per se </em>of the matter in controversy. No one questions the well settled rule, that when a case has once been fairly tried and determined, the judgment rendered therein is final and conclusive, as between the <em>parties </em>and their <em>privies </em>touching the matter in controversy, but it is equally true also, that such a judgment cannot bind or affect the rights of third parties, strangers to the record. It can hardly be necessary to say, that every man is entitled to his day in Court, and that only such persons, who in some manner recognized by the forms of law, become parties thereto, are bound by its proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>That sales of land under decrees in Equity, are not exempt from the operation of this rule, must be considered as settled in <em>Brooks vs. Brooke, et al., </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>306, <em>Cockey vs. Milne\u2019s Lessee, </em>16 <em>Md., </em>207, and other cases in this Court. We are unable to distinguish in principle the case of <em>Cockey vs. Milne\u2019s Lessee, </em>from the one before us. There the appellant offered in evidence a decree of a Corirt of Equity, on a bill to foreclose a mortgage, and sale- thereunder, prior in point of time to the proceedings in attachment, and judgment and sale under which the appellee claimed. . As against the appellee, the purchaser of the land at sheriff\u2019s sale, the mortgage was not binding, because it was defectively acknowledged. The appellant however claimed that the appellee was concluded by the decree in Equity, and sale thereunder, but the Court say : \u201cThe title of the appellee acquired under the proceedings in attachment was good against any title asserted under the mortgage, and was in no. manner affected by the proceedings in chancery under which the appellants\u2019 title was acquired. The appellee was not a party to those proceedings, and his right was not in any manner bound or affected thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">. In <em>Sugden on Vendors and Purchasers, </em>111, it is said : \u201cWhere the Court sells, it will protect the purchaser against the parties to the suit, and all persons coming in under the decree. But a person having a legal lien as a judgment creditor, not coming in under the decree, would not he bound by it, and might proceed against the purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">.As to the hardship resulting from the application of this principle to the purchasers under the decree, it may be replied that the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment was a matter of record, and notice to the world. It was a lien upon the real estate of the debtor, which could be enforced by execution and sale of the property. If the proceedings in equity were intended to affect this lien, and to sell a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>disencumbered title, the judgment creditors ought to have been parties thereto. They had a direct interest in the real estate to be sold under the proceedings, and the right to know the extent of the vendor\u2019s lien and the amount due thereon. If, however, they were not made parties, it is very clear that the purchasers under the decree .acquired only the <em>right, title and interest </em>of the <em>parties to the suit. Bolgiano vs. Cook, </em>19 Md., 375; <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank vs. Martin, </em>7 <em>Md., </em>342; <em>Sugden on Vendors and Purchasers, </em>521, <em>(Ed. 14th.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the decree relied on in this case does not operate as <em>a tar </em>to the <em>scire facias </em>issued by the plaintiffs, and made known to the defendants as <em>terre tenants </em>of Thomas, and that the Court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the replication.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The third and fourth pleas of the defendants, however, say that the plaintiffs had notice of the proceedings in Equity under which the land was sold, and became parties, by appearing therein and filing their claim, as creditors of the said Thomas, upon the judgment recited in the <em>scire facias, </em>and by seeking payment of the same out of the proceeds of sale. The question raised by these pleas is whether the facts therein stated are sufficient to constitute the plaintiffs parties to the proceedings in Equity under which the land was sold and the proceeds arising therefrom distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Ordinarily, where a person interested in a suit in Equity desires to become a party thereto, the proper course would be to file a petition setting forth the grounds upon which his claim is based. This, however, is not absolutely necessary, and it will be sufficient, if it appears from the record that he has appeared to the suit, and filed his claim, and had an opportunity of offering evidence in support of the same, and of appealing from the order of the Court in regard thereto. A party who comes into Court seeking payment of his claim out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the proceeds arising from the sale of land sold under a decree-, will not be allowed to impeach the validity of the decree in a subsequent proceeding, nor will he be permitted to enforce the payment of the same claim against the land in the hands of a purchaser. In Lanahan, <em>et al. vs. Latrobe, </em>7 <em>Md., </em>268, it was held that a creditor who participates in a proceeding in Equity for the distribution of the proceeds of property sold under a deed of trust, so far makes himself a party as to waive his right after-wards to object to the validity of the deed. As we have heretofore said, the appellants were not bound by the decree under which the land was sold, because they were not made parties to the suit. They could have stood out and have enforced the payment of their judgment as against the land in the hands of the purchasers, provided their lien was superior to that under which the property was sold. But if, instead of doing this, they voluntarily became parties to the proceedings under which the land was sold, and sought payment of their claim out of the purchase money paid by these appellees, every principle of Equity and good faith. requires that they should be estopped from afterwards enforcing payment of the same as against the land.
