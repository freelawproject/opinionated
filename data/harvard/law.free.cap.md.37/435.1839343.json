It was further proved, that A. B. McCreery, the defendant, and James McCreery, his agent, a dry-goods merchant in New York, had been in the store of Goodwin, Oliver <em>&amp; </em>Co., several times during the latter\u2019s tenancy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\">The defendant offered evidence tending to prove, that he rented a certain house on Sharp street, in the city of Baltimore, to a mercantile firm, known as Goodwin, Oliver <em>&amp; </em>Co., and that on the first day of January, 1871, there was due from them to the defendant, for rent which had accrued before the day aforesaid, the sum of $3,750, which had accrued from the first day of April, 1870, until the first day of January, 1871-, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>that the defendant distrained for the same, and among others, distrained on the goods mentioned in the declaration, which were found in the house so rented. That the said Goodwin and Oliver kept in said <em>house </em>a dry-goods store, and occasionally sold dry-goods on their own account, hut generally wheu they did so, had orders for goods which they could not get from their regular consignors, and therefore bought. And that the only sign said Goodwin <em>&amp; </em>Oliver had over the said store, was the name of the firm and the number of the store. That the said defendant had not resided in the city of Baltimore lor about eighteen or twenty years. That James McCreery was the agent for the defendant at the time of the renting of said house to Goodwin <em>&amp; </em>Oliver, and it was by him the house was rented; and at the time of the renting of said house, James McCreery resided in New York, and that the renting had been negotiated in New York, and had been concluded by a letter from him to Goodwin <em>&amp; </em>Oliver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">The plaintiffs offered the following prayer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">If the jury find from the evidence that Goodwin, Oliver &amp; Co., were dry-goods commission merchants at the time of the^ levy of the distress, and prior to the rental of the premises, and that the goods taken under the writ of replevin were consigned to them by H.

Whether' in fact the merchandise sent to Goodwin, Oliver <em>&amp; Go., </em>as factors, for sale, on account of the owners, the appellees, is exempt by law from the distress for rent due by the tenants, the factors, when they also sold goods at the same place, on their own account, and had no public sign that they were factors, and the landlord was a non-resident?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">It was urged by the counsel for the appellees, that goods found upon the premises under such circumstances, were excepted; and that the summary process for the recovery of rent, w.as a vestige of the Feudal system, and that the Court should adopt the most liberal construction to release property from its grasp.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Chief Justice Gibson, in <em>Brown vs. Simms, </em>17 <em>S. &amp; R., </em>139, speaks of it as a feudal prerogative handed down from a period when chattels were of little account, and that the most plausible argument in support of it, is, that as the landlord is supposed to have given credit to a visible stock on the premises, he ought to be allowed recourse to every thing he finds there. Chancellor Kent on the other hand, 3 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., </em>625, thinks it a necessary and useful provision, dictated by sound policy, and that the prosperity and growth of our cities, would be seriously checked if the law did not afford landlords a speedy and effectual security for their rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Chief Justice Denman, in the case of <em>Muspratt vs. Gregory, </em>3 <em>Meeson &amp; Welsby, </em>678, remarks, in regard to the argument, urging the policy of a relaxation of the rule for the promotion of trade, that all laws profess to he founded on the principle that they are for the public good, but what is or not for the public good, is a matter of speculation, upon which the wisest men may differ, and as to which the Judges are not at liberty to promul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>gate new rules of law. Such was the view of C. J. Lb Grand, in <em>Trieber vs. Knabe &amp; Betts. </em>12 Md., 491, referring the correction of any abuse to the legislative department, as the proper authority for that purpose. We find no reason to dissent from this view, and such has been the legislative interpretation, and laws have been enacted by the State modifying in some respect the rigor of the common law; and we must leave to that branch of the government to determine what public policy may dictate. Under the exceptions in favor of trade, reference of course must be had to the description of articles pertaining to that subject. Whilst the general rule holds all chattels found upon the demised premises, <em>prima facie </em>liable for the rent, it is subject to the exceptions recognized on grounds of public/policy, for the benefit of trade, or the preservation of the peace, of certain classes of articles ; and embrace all property of like character or <em>ejusdem generis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Whilst there have been differing adjudications as to what are the exceptions, and as to the extent of the exemption under the privilege of trade, so far as our researches have extended, all the adjudged cases concur that goods delivered to tradesmen, artificers, carriers, factors, wharfingers, auctioneers, and the like, without qual-</p>\n<p id=\"ABU\">ification are exempted. See <em>Muspratt vs. Gregory, </em>3 <em>Mees. &amp; Welsby, </em>678; <em>Gilman vs. Elton, </em>3 <em>Brod. &amp; Bingham, </em>75<em>; Findon vs. McLaren, </em>6 <em>Adol. &amp; Ellis, </em>(51 <em>E.

The counsel for the appellant, conceded the law, to be as stated, generally, but contended, for the distinction, sought to he made in his prayer; that as the tenants in this case, besides receiving goods for sale, as factors or commission merchants, (if there be any legal distinction between them,) also sold goods on their own individual account; that such fact made a difference \u2014 that to enable them to have the protection afforded, under the exception, in favor of trade, their vocation ought to be exclusive and notorious, by having their sign at their place of business to that effect \u2014 and further, that' as the landlord was a non-resident, and ignorant of the vocation of his tenants as factors, the goods and merchandise upon the premises were not entitled to be exempted. We find no authority to sustain such a proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The goods not belonging to the tenant, are exempt from distress for rent, whilst they are in the hands of the commission merchant or factor, not so much on account of a <em>special privilege to the tenant, </em>but for the benefit of trade and commerce, and <em>for the purpose of protecting the owner of the goods, </em>who has confided them to the tenant for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">It is not material whether the landlord is aware of the true owner of the goods or not. Such we take to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the reason of the decision in the case of <em>Gisbourn vs. Hurst, </em>1 <em>Salkeld, </em>249, where the party was not a common carrier, but occasionally brought from the country cheese to London, and on his return carried back in his wagon, such goods as he could get, for a reasonable price, and it was determined by the Court, that he was, as to this privilege a common carrier, and the goods in his custody were protected from distress for rent; not from special regard to him, but in respect of the <em>trader; </em>and such we apprehend to he the doctrine of all the cases.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b453-7\">(Decided 20th February, 1873.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We find no error in the rulings of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
