C. took out letters testamentary under the will on the 26th of January, 1865. P. returned to the State, after an absence of two years, in April, 1865; and on the 2'Tth of the same month, she and her husband made to O., a mortgage of all their estate and interest under said will. The consideration of this mortgage was a debt declared to be due by the husband of P. to C. ; the condition made the debt and interest payable on demand; and the mortgage contained the usual assent to the passing of a decree for sale. The husband of P., was' at the time insolvent, and his debt to C., was greater than the value of the property conveyed by the mortgage. On the 1st of September, 1866,'P. and her husband united with the life annuitant and the other remainderman in a deed to 0., of all their estate under 1he will <em>in trust, </em>to dispose of the same, and hold the proceeds subject to the claims of the grantors, excepting in so far as to pay to himself whatever might be due to him by P.'and her husband by virtue of the foregoing mortgage. O. died in May, 1869, and in July, \u00cdS\u00cdO, P., being then first informed of her rights, filed her bill, praying a decree annulling the mortgage and also the deed of trust so far as related thereto.

The debt was payable \u201con demand,\u201d and the covenants .were to pay -\u201con demand.\u201d 1 <em>Pars. N. &amp; B., </em>375.

And even if forbearance had been stipulated, it would have made no difference in this ease, since he was insolvent. Neither as executor nor as trustee could he lawfully convert his administration into an agency for the collection of his bad debts, by saddling them on the trust property.

So soon as Mrs. Edes died, the trust ceases, and the title vests in the parties in remainder without the performance of any act by Carson. <em>Parker vs Converse, </em>5 <em>Gray, </em>336; <em>Greenwood vs. Coleman, </em>34 <em>Ala, </em>150; <em>Churchill vs. Corker, </em>25 <em>Geo., </em>479.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-5\">But supposing that Carson was by the terms of the will a trustee for the parties in remainder, then it is admitted that purchases of the trust property by trustees at their own sales may be set aside as of course at the election of the <em>cestui que trust. </em>But this right does not exist to the same extent in cases of purchases by trustees from the <em>cestui que trust, </em>or by the consent of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>when made by the trustee at his own sale. 1 <em>Leading Cases in Equity, </em>125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">In the last cases he is not under an absolute disability to purchase, and it is not a general rule that a Court of Equity will set such purchases aside, but each case depends upon its own facts and circumstances. <em>Ayliffe vs. Murray, </em>2 <em>Atk., </em>58; Farnam <em>vs. Brooks, </em>9 <em>Pick., </em>212; Spindler <em>vs. Atkinson, </em>3 <em>Md., </em>409; <em>Ex parte Lacey, </em>6 <em>Ves., </em>626.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-7\">And when it appears that the <em>cestui que trust^ </em>intended the trustee to buy, and there is no fraud, no concealment, no advantage taken by the trustee of information acquired by him in the character of trustee, the transaction will be supported. <em>Coles vs. Trecothick, </em>9 <em>Ves., </em>234; <em>Buell vs. Buckingham, </em>16 Iowa, 286; <em>Perry on Trusts, sec. </em>195, <em>and authorities cited.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-8\">If the transaction in this case is to be treated as a purchase, the circumstances attending it as they appear upon the face of the papers, are such as to gratify the foregoing rules. Mr. Pairo becomes indebted to Mr. Carson in a very iarge amount of money, and being desirous of securing the payment thereof, his wife, with the view of aiding her husband, and with his consent, executes a conveyance by way of mortgage to Carson of all her interest in the estate of Edes. There was here no fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>no concealment, and no advantage taken by him of knowledge acquired as trustee. She had the advice and assistance of her husband in the transaction, and cannot be said to have confided in Carson. But the transaction was not in itself a purchase, hut a mortgage of her interest, which was only accessory to the principal thing \u2014 the debt. <em>Pratt vs. Van Wyck, </em>6 <em>Gill &amp; J, </em>495; <em>Dougherty vs. McColgan, </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>275; 1 <em>Hilliard on Mortgages, </em>215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-5\">Upon the payment of the debt the whole interest in the estate immediately revested in her. The rules in reference to purchases by trustees from <em>cestuis que trust </em>do not apply, because Carson could get nothing more than his debt, and all the interest in the property after the payment of the debt still remained in Mrs. Pairo, and she must derive all the advantage from its increase in value. Carson could have concealed nothing from her that would have affected the transaction, for all that was necessary to be known by her was the amount of the debt, and the fact that she desired to secure it upon her interest in the estate of Edes. She was not deceived by Carson, for she intended he should have the mortgage, and dealt with her eyes open. <em>Hylton vs. Hylton, 2 Ves. Sr., </em>549; <em>Sping vs. Pride, </em>10 Jur., <em>(N.

Eor, supposing the property to he neither more nor less than his debt, he does not buy it, and therefore gains nothing by the knowledge that he possesses of its value, nor could the <em>cestui que trust </em>he injured. Nor does the trustee by taking a mortgage place himself in a position antagonistic to the interests of the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>but on the contrary it becomes his interest to obtain the best price he can, especially where there is hut a small margin for his security, as in this case. There is no proof that the hue-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>band of the complainant was insolvent at tbe time of the execution of the mortgage, hut even if he was, and even though it encumbered all the property the appellant had, or that the mortgage contained an assent for a decree or an omission of the clause for possession, or that the debt was payable on demand, would not .alter the nature of the transaction, or turn an absolute deed into a mortgage. Nor is it so recognized in the deed of trust; on the contrary it is there referred to as a mortgage, and there are no exti-insic facts from which the Court could infer that Carson intended to possess himself of the estate ; certainly the mere facts of the execution of the deed and mortgage are not sufficient. The mortgage in this case was not intended as a bounty to Carson, but to aid the husband of the appellant, and the consideration in law is equal, whether she pledged her property to secure her own debt or the debt of her husband. 1 <em>Buck's B.

On the contrary, on account of the lapse of time and the death of the trustee, the Court will presume that if the trustee was living he would bring forward the witnesses who would establish iis perfect fairness, and that it was the voluntary act of the appellant' in order to aid and assist her husband. It would be most unjust by the application of \u00bf technical rule, to take from the creditors of Carson, some of whose debts were contracted after the date of said mortgage, and who are represented by the administrators, such a large sum of money, for their equity is stronger than hers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>About eighteen months after the execution of the mortgage, Mrs. Pairo united with her husband and the other .devisees in the execution of a deed of trust to Carson, in which*she recognizes the existence of the mortgage as a subsisting lien upon the property.

Edes made his last will; by the tenth clause of which ho devised \u201cto Thomas J. Carson, his heirs and personal representatives, all his estate, effects and property real, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>personal and mixed, wheresoever situate, in trust and confidence, for the objects and purposes in this clause of his will declared concerning the same; that is to say: that during the natural life of his mother, his estate, and property of every kind, (excepting the money and property devised and bequeathed by the preceding provisions of his will,) shall be preserved and kept together by his executor,, hereinafter appointed; who was thereby fully authorized to collect and receive all the income, rents and profits of the same; and he thereby directed that his executor, out of said income, rents and profits, should pay to \u25a0his (testator\u2019s) mother, the sum of two thousand dollars <em>per annum, </em>so long as she shall live, in quarterly instalments, &amp;c., accounting from the day of his decease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The eleventh clause of his will was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaz\">\u201cImmediately after the decease of my said mother, I will and devise all the-rest and residue of my property, real, personal, and mixed, not hereinbefore devised and bequeathed, to my brother Richard Andrew Edes, my sister Mary Jane Pairo, and my sister Elizabeth \"W. Long, in equal proportions, share and share alike, to them and each of them, their heirs and personal representatives ; excepting only, and provided, that if my said brother shall marry within three years after our mother\u2019s death, then and in that case, I bequeath to him the sum of-three thousand dollars, to he allowed to him out of the principal amount and interest'due me on certain promissory notes of my said-brother, now held by me,-(and which are not to he collected until- a general division is made of iny estate,) over and above what, by this section, is devised to my two sisters aforesaid. The property and money devised and bequeathed by this section to my said brother and sisters, are to vest in them, discharged from the trust created in item ten of this will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">He appointed Thomas J. Carson executor, who took out letters testamentary on the 26th day of January, 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>At that time Mrs. Pairo, the appellant, who was one of the devisees in remainder, was absent from the State, having been sent South by the military authorities in 1863. She returned to her home in Baltimore in April, 1885 ; and on the 27th day of the same month executed and delivered to Thomas J. Carson the mortgage which she now, by her bill of complaint, prays to have annulled and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The mortgage, in which her husband, Charles W. Pairo, united, conveyed to Thomas J. Carson, his heirs, executors, &amp;c., \u201c <em>all the estate and interest, right, title, property, </em>claim and demand, whatsoever, of Pairo and wile, and each of. them, of, in, into and out of all the estate, real, personal and mixed, whereof the late Samuel C. Edes, died seized, or possessed, or was in any manner entitled to, interested in, or could claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The consideration stated in the mortgage was a debt of $16,864.86, recited therein, to be due and owing by Chas. W. Pairo to Thomas J. Carson; and its purpose was to secure the payment thereof with interest from the 24th day of April, 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">By the condition in the mortgage the debt and interest were payable on demand; and the instrument contained an assent to the passing of a decree for the sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The appellant charges in her bill of complaint that the mortgage was extorted from her by Carson, by cruelty, and by means of threats that, unless his demands were complied with, he would dismiss her husband from his place in his (Carson\u2019s) banking house; and destroy his business position and prospects. These grave charges have not been supported by legal proof; the testimony of Mrs. Long on that subject, being merely a repetition of the statements made to her by the appellant herself, are of course, inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">We do not consider it necessary to advert to the state of mental excitement under which Mrs. Pairo was suffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>ing at the time the mortgage was executed, as described in the testimony of Mrs. Long; and which has been referred'to by her counsel as furnishing ground for impeaching the mortgage. In our opinion, there is a fatal objection to its validity, growing out of the fiduciary relation of Carson, with respect to the mortgagor, and to the property conveyed, which existed at the time of the mortgage, and which, under the circumstances of this case, entitles the appellant to equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Under the will of Samuel O. Edes, Carson was charged with the two-fold duty of trustee and executor. The will vested in him the legal estate for the purposes of the trusts; it required him to keep the property together during the life of testator\u2019s mother, to collect the income, rents and profits, and out of them to pay Mrs.'Edes her annuity of $2,000 per annum ; and at her death, to turn over the whole estate, real and personal, to the legatees and devisees in remainder, with the accumulations unim-. paired, except by the payment of the annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The appellant, as one of.the devisees in remainder, had a vested interest or .equitable estate under the will, which could not come into possession until after the death of Mrs. Edes, the life annuitant. During her life the legal estate was held by Carson, as trustee both for the life annuitant and the devisees in remainder, who were interested in the faithful performance of his duties, both as trustee and executor,</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">When the mortgage was executed Mrs. Edes was living, and Carson held the property as trustee. The transaction, therefore, falls within the established rules of equity, which govern dealings between trustees and <em>cestuis que trust, </em>with respect to the trust property, and conveyances of the same to the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"AVF\">Upon principles of public policy, for the prevention of fraud, and to remove from trustees all temptation to violate their duties, by securing to themselves profit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>advantage at the expense of those whose property and interests are confided to their charge, they are not allowed to purchase the property from the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>or acquire rights therein which may bring their personal interests in conflict with the discharge of their official duties. It has been held in numerous cases, and is well settled, that while such transactions are not absolutely void, they are discountenanced by Courts,of Equity; the presumption is against their validity, and they are never-upheld unless it clearly appear .that they are free from all taint or suspicion of unfairness. The <em>onus </em>of showing their perfect <em>bona Jides </em>is cast upon the party who sets them up, and not upon the <em>cestuis que trust </em>who assails them. In support of this proposition many authorities might be cited; but it is sufficient to refer to <em>Smith vs. Townsend, </em>27 <em>Md., </em>388, and the authorities there cited, and those collected in <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>247, <em>note </em>2, <em>(4th Ed.,) </em>and in 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. secs. </em>321, 322, <em>and notes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In view of this well settled rule, it seems to us that the mortgage in this case cannot be supported. It has been argu\u00e9d by the appellees\u2019 counsel, that being amere charge or security, and not an absolute conveyance of the property, it does not fall within the rule above stated. But we think, when we look at the facts and circumstances as disclosed by the record, and apparent on the face of the mortgage, that there is no ground for such a'distinction. The effect of the instrument was to divest Mrs. Pairo of her whole interest in the trust estate as completely as if., it had been an absolute conveyance. It is stated in the answer that the whole property conveyed is insufficient to pay the debt it was intended to secure ; the equity of redemption therefore was of no substantial value. Pairo, the debtor, was insolvent; the debt was by the terms of the mortgage payable on demand, and was liable to be foreclosed immediately. Certainly no more effectual instrument could have been devised to divest the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>lant of her whole trust estate. It is, therefore, obnoxious to the same objection, as if it had been an absolute conveyance ; and under the rule we have stated will not be supported as valid in a Court of Equity, in the absence of complete and satisfactory proof on the part of the mortgagee, or those.claiming under him, that it was freely and voluntarily made by the appellant, with full information as to her rights, and that no unfair advantage was taken of her condition and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We consider it perfectly clear upon the authorities and for the reasons stated, that if this bill had been filed during the life-time of Carson, a Court of Equity could not hesitate, upon the state of facts disclosed by the record, to set aside the 'mortgage, without any imputation of actual fraud, or fraudulent intent on the part of the trustee in procuring it. It would be declared invalid upon the high ground of public policy, which we have before stated is the foundation of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">It remains to be considered whether anything has occurred since the mortgage was executed, to deprive the appellant of equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">It has been contended that the deed of trust, executed by the appellant and others on the first day of September, 1866, operated as a confirmation of the mortgage. This \u2022point was not much pressed by the appellees in\u2019the argument, and we think it very clear that the deed can have no such operation or effect. It was not intended as a confirmation, it simply refers to the mortgage as existing, and recognizes the right of Carson to pay to himself the \u25a0 mortgage debt out of Mrs. Pairo\u2019s share of the money arising from the sale of the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u201cIn order to constitute a valid confirmation, a person must be aware that the act he is doing will have the effect of confirming an impeachable transaction.\u201d 1 <em>Lead. Ca., in Equity, </em>117 m, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">In 16 <em>Md., </em>456, and 20 <em>Md., </em>151, it was said, \u201c to make an act of ratification effective the <em>cestui que trust </em>must not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u00a1only have been acquainted with the facts, but apprised of the law, how those facts would be dealt with if brought before a Court of Equity.\u201d The deed of trust has none of the essential qualities, to give it the force and effect of a ratification of the mortgage. The main ground of defence relied on by the appellees, is the lapse of time since the mortgage was executed, and <em>the death </em>of Carson before the bill was filed. It was upon this ground that the Judge of the Circuit Oourt refused to grant relief, at the same time expressing his want of entire satisfaction with the conclusion to -which he came.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We have had the benefit of a most full and elaborate argument, and have been referred to a great number of authorities bearing upon this, as well as the other questions in the case; all of which we have examined; and have found none which we think would justify us in refusing to the appellant relief in this case, on account of supposed <em>laches </em>on her part, or lapse of time in filing her bill, or by reason of the death of Carson.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">This we think will be manifest by reference to the cases cited and relied upon by the appellees\u2019 counsel in support of the fourth point of their brief. In some of them, lapse of time, and the death of parties have been considered as circumstances affecting the equitable rights of the complainant to relief; and when the delay has been for along period of time, without excuse or explanation; it has been sometimes regarded as sufficient ground for refusing relief, especially where, in the meantime, other parties have acquired rights; or there have been other facts and circumstances from which the Court could see that injustice might be done by annulling a transaction, which had been long acquiesced in by the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">On the other hand, a great many cases have been cited in which relief has been granted after the lapse of a much longer time, than has occurred in this; and where too the party, upon whom the law casts the <em>onus </em>of explaining the transaction, had died before the bill was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>To refer to the cases particularly, and to point out the special circumstances in each, which controlled the judgment of the Court, would require this opinion to be extended to too great length.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">While we recognize it as a salutary rule, that Courts of Equity will refuse their aid to parties who have \u201cslept upon their rights, and acquiesced for a great length of time,\u201d before seeking relief, yet in dealing with a question of this kind, each case must necessarily depend very much on its own circumstances, and looking at this case in the light of the authorities, we do not find that there has been any such laches and delay on the part of the appellant as ought, in equity, to deprive her of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The bill was filed in 1870, five years, after the execution of the mortgage. Carson died in 1869. We lay less stress upon the circumstance of his death, because the invalidity of the transaction impeached, depends mainly on the relations of the parties to each other, and the intrinsic nature of the transaction itself, as disclosed on the face of the mortgage, rather than upon any extrinsic cirouinstances; -and besides, the law has in some measure equalized the parties, by making the appellant an incompetent witness; because Carson is not living to testify. <em>{Act </em>0/I868, <em>ch. </em>116).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The delay in filing the bill is explained by the fact appearing from the testimony of Mrs. Long, in her answer to the 13th interrogatory, (to which no exception was taken,) that the appellant was not informed of her legal right to impeach the mortgage until in May, 1870 ; when for the first time she had the benefit of legal advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Her delay therefore could not he construed into acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The principles upon which Courts of Equity proceed in determining the effect of length of time upon the rights of a party in a suit of this kind, are laid down in <em>Hatch vs. Hatch, </em>9 <em>Ves., </em>292; <em>Morse vs. Royal, </em>12 <em>Ves., </em>355; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>and <em>Wright vs. Vanderplank, </em>8 <em>DeG., McN. &amp; G., </em>133; cited by appellees\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In <em>Hatch vs. Hatch, </em>where the bill was filed in 1800 to impeach a transaction which took place in 1780, Lord Eldon said : \u201cI do not deny, that length of time is of groat consequence in all these cases of fraud, breach of the policy of the law, &amp;c. But in all cases it is some evidence, that the transaction was understood at the time not to be fraudulent; and that there might have been some circumstances of the possibility of which the party ought to have the advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">He then adds: \u201cBut.the evidence in this case is the answer,\u201d &amp;c. In that case the transaction was set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">In <em>Morse vs. Royal, </em>Ld. Ch. Erskine said, \u201cAs to the effect of length of time, where there is no bar by the Statute of Limitations, a Court of Equity will never lay-down as a general proposition, that though the fact, that imposition has been practiced, is established, the party is too late; and by the accident of the death of the person who might have contradicted him, shall be deprived of his right to relief. The true operation of length of time is by way of evidence.\u201d ****** ** And in the same case he says: \u201c The point upon the length of time is put thus : that I must shift the proof from the one to the other. I do not know, that I am to go to that length. I am to see that the transaction was fair; that no advantage was taken ; that there was no concealment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">These decisions were followed in <em>Wright vs. Vanderplank, </em>where the Ld. J. Turner after quoting the language of Ld. Eldon in <em>Hatch vs. Hatch, </em>says of the case before him, which was a bill to set aside a deed of gift from a daughter to her father: \u201c The parties knew of their right to impeach the gift, and left the defendant to live on the income, and after ten years come to make him account. Looking at the lapse of time, and to the fixed, unbiased and deliberate intention of not impeaching the deed, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>in. my opinion must be attributed to the daughter, I think the bill was rightly dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b500-9\">(Decided 21st February, 1873.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We do not find any thing in the principles established by these decisions, or cited in the argument, which, in our judgment, ought to deprive the appellant of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">There are no facts or circumstances disclosed by the record, from which it can be inferred, that she ratified the mortgage, or acquiesced in it with a knowledge of her rights to impeach it. The mere lapse of time, and the death of Carson, are not of themselves sufficient to bar her claim; and having instituted her suit without delay after being informed of her rights, we ar\u00e9 of opinion, that she is entitled to relief. The decree of the Circuit Court will therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded, in order that a decree may be passed annulling and setting aside the'deed of mortgage of the 27th day of April, 1865, and so much of the deed of trust of the first day of September, 1866, as relates to the 'said mortgage, in so far as the rights of the appellant are concerned; reserving, however, the rights of the appellees, under said mortgage and deed of trust, in so far as they may operate to convey any interest or estate in the property therein mentioned of Charles W. Pairo, the husband of the appellant. And under the prayer for general'relief, the appellant is entitled to a decree requiring an account of the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>Decree reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
