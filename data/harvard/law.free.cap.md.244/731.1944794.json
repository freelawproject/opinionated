Hall appealed that judgment and sentence to this Court. <em>Hall v. State, </em>233 Md. 378, 196 A. 2d 874 (1964). For purposes of that appeal, we assumed that the initial detention of Hall by the police was illegal, but held that such illegal detention did not vitiate a warrant sworn out subsequent to and based upon admissions voluntarily made by Hall during the time he was held without legal cause. We found, therefore, that Hall\u2019s fingerprints, obtained following service of the warrant, were taken when he was in lawful custody, did not constitute the fruit of an illegal arrest, and thus were properly admitted into evidence at his trial. We also ruled that, the fingerprints being admissible, \u201cthere was sufficient evidence, if believed by the trier of fact, to convict Hall of robbery with a deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Five of the applicant\u2019s six contentions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in this petition ask us, in effect, to review what we have already decided. Despite undisputed testimony at Hall\u2019s original trial that his fingerprints, were obtained following service of the warrant, Hall offered evidence in his post conviction hearing, tending to show that the fingerprints were obtained before the warrant was issued. The short answer to these allegations is that the applicant has no. right to raise them in a post conviction hearing. Code, Article 27, sec. 645 A (Supp. 1965) denies the right to post conviction relief when the alleged error has been \u201cpreviously and finally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>litigated or waived in the proceedings resulting in the conviction * * Subsection (b) of section 645 A further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201c(b) <em>When, allegation of error deemed to he finally </em>litigated\u2014For the purposes of this subtitle, an allegation of error shall be deemed to be finally litigated when the Court of Appeals has rendered a decision on the merits thereof, either upon direct appeal or upon any consideration of an application for leave to appeal filed pursuant to \u00a7 645-1 of this subtitle; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">We have previously reviewed five of the applicant\u2019s contentions and have either rendered a decision on their merits or assumed their truth upon direct appeal. We will not consider them again. <em>Farrow v. Warden, </em>241 Md. 724, 217 A. 2d 270 (1966); <em>Buettner v. Superintendent, </em>239 Md. 710, 212 A. 2d 464 (1965); <em>Ralph v. Warden, </em>230 Md. 616, 185 A. 2d 366 (1962); <em>Tillet v. Warden, 220 </em>Md. 677, 154 A. 2d 808 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The sole remaining allegation in Hall\u2019s application is that the prosecuting attorney at the trial of this case had previously represented one Robert Lee Simms <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in an unrelated matter \u201cand may therefore have information relative to the said Robert Lee Simms which could have been prejudicial to the defendant in the trial of this case.\u201d Judge Powers, in the court below, found this contention lacking in merit, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">\u201c[Tjhere was no testimony whatever adduced today [at the post conviction hearing] to indicate any knowledge whatever on the part of the prosecuting attorney, or that the prosecuting attorney had any information whatever concerning this case which he obtained in any way other than entirely properly from the police <em>who </em>had investigated the <em>case.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>We have carefully reviewed all the testimony taken at Hall\u2019s post conviction hearing and agree with Judge Powers on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\">. These allegations are: \u201c1. That he [Hall] was unlawfully detained by the investigating officers; 2. That this illegal detention vitiates the warrants; 3. That the petitioner was at all times illegally held by the police prior to the taking of his fingerprints; 4. That the admission of the petitioner\u2019s fingerprints into evidence was a violation of due process of law, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.\u201d By amended petition, Hall\u2019s attorney alleged: 5. \u201cThere was insufficient competent evidence to identify the defendant as a participant in the alleged crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\">. The only connection between the applicant and Robert Lee Simms appears to be the following: The applicant was originally taken to police headquarters for questioning about the escape of Mr. Simms from a prison hospital. The applicant was present at the scene when Simms was involved in an accident on the Baltimore-Washington Expressway soon after his escape. See <em>Hall v. State, supra. </em>Appendix to Brief of Appellant, No. 161, September Term, 1963, E. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
