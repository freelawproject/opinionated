Muhly, Jr., to Patuxent Institution after a determination by the court, sitting without a jury, that he was still a defective delinquent within the meaning of \u00a7 5 of Art. 31B of the Code (1965 Cum. Sup.).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">The applicant had previously been convicted of burglary and sentenced on August 4, 1961, to a term of not more than three years in the Reformatory for Males. Subsequently, on July 19, 1963, the applicant was found to be a defective delinquent and was committed to Patuxent. The application for leave to appeal from that finding was denied. See <em>Muhly v. Director, </em>234 Md. 624. The petition for a redetermination of the status of the applicant was filed on June 16, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">In this application for leave to appeal filed by his attorney, the applicant contends: (1) that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a finding of defective delinquency; (2) that Dr. Harold M. Boslow testified contrary to the contents of his written records; and (3) that the interval notes made by staff members at Patuxent were full of errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">The first contention concerns the legal sufficiency of the evidence. In this circumstance, when the case has been tried by the court without a jury, the judgment of the court will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and the record indicates that it was not. <em>Bisesi v. Director, </em>243 Md. 605, and cases cited. Since both the second and third contentions merely state the conclusions of the applicant neither constitutes a basis for the grant of leave to appeal. <em>Muhly v. Director, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
