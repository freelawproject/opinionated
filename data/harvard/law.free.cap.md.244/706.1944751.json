Cardin, sitting without a jury. Johnson\u2019s only contention in this application for leave to appeal is that no jury was prayed or empanelled for the proceeding. This claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-14\">Johnson\u2019s statement of facts admits that his court-appointed attorney advised him of his right to a jury trial and that he told his counsel that he wanted his case heard by a judge. Johnson further admits that he testified at trial that he wanted a judge to hear his case and that he never requested that it be tried by a jury. By his admissions, the applicant has clearly waived his right, granted by Art. 31B, sec. 8(c), to elect a jury determination. Cf. <em>Dickerson v. Director, </em>235 Md. 668, 202 A. 2d 765 (1964). Accordingly, leave to appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
