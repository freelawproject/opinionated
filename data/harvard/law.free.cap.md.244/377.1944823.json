J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A82\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">Benco Vending, Inc., the appellant, sells cigarettes at retail from vending machines which it has placed at 173 locations in Baltimore City and four counties. It has a headquarters, consisting of a warehouse, a shop for servicing the vending machines, and offices, on Cat\u00f3n Avenue in Baltimore. Benco decided that it needed but one trader\u2019s license (for its headquarters location) \u201cor at most, one license for each political subdivision\u201d in which it had a vending machine. The alert and zealous guardians of the revenues immediately took a dim view of what they regarded as this novel interpretation of the law and adhered to the \u201cone-license-one-location\u201d construction of the statutes, which they had followed over a period of many years. Benco filed a bill of complaint against the comptroller and the several sheriffs of the political subdivisions in which it had ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>chines, alleging that at the instance o! the comptroller the various clerks of court in the State have interpreted \u00a7\u00a763 and 64 of Art. 56 of the Code (1964 Replacement Vol.) as requiring the purchase of one trader\u2019s license for each \u201clocation\u201d or premise upon which Benco has a cigarette vending machine, and further alleging its contrary position. It proffered a cash bond of $4,498, the amount the comptroller claimed it owed for 173 trader\u2019s licenses (173 times $26\u2014the $25 license fee per cigarette trader\u2019s license imposed by \u00a7 64 of Art. 56 and the $1.00 filing fee per license), and prayed (a) a temporary injunction against the collection of any sums which may be due under \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 64 of Art. 56 and against enforcement of the criminal sanctions of \u00a7 64 (which makes it a misdemeanor not to procure a trader\u2019s license, with a fine of $100 upon conviction), and (b) a declaration that \u00a7\u00a763 and 64 of Art. 56 mean that \u201ceach retail seller of cigarettes through vending machines is required to obtain one * * * trader\u2019s license, and not one license for each location at which he has vending machines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Judge Raine heard the case on the allegations of fact in the bill admitted by the answers of the respondents and a stipulation (1) that for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1964, the <em>net </em>proceeds from trader\u2019s licenses (gross less 5% <em>to </em>the clerks of court and <em>3% to </em>the State of Maryland) issued pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 64 of Art. 56 was $446,194.52, which went to the various political subdivisions, and (2) that Edward J. Dyas, the Chief Inspector of the State License Bureau, would testify that during his association with the Bureau which began in 1954 the trader\u2019s license law has been construed and applied to require one license for each location at which there was a cigarette vending machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Judge Raine decreed that the intent and meaning of the statutes is to require a separate license for each location at which there is a vending machine. We think that he was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Trader\u2019s licenses are required by Code (1964 Replacement Vol.), Art. 56, \u00a7\u00a7 32-74. Section 32 specifies that no one, \u201cother than the grower, maker or manufacturer,\u201d shall sell or offer to sell any goods or merchandise without obtaining a license in the manner prescribed by the subtitle of Art. 56 headed \u201cTraders.\u201d Section 33 provides that one who proposes to sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>or offer for sale \u201canything mentioned in \u00a7 32, except spiritous or fermented liquors\u201d shall apply to the clerk of the court in the political subdivision in which he proposes to \u201ccarry on such selling\u201d for a license therefor. Section 33 then provides that a license:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\u201cshall be good and sufficient as a license * * * in every part of the State; provided that such license shall not authorize the holder thereof to open or carry on any store or fixed place of business * * * other than in the place of business designated in said license and in the application therefor, it being intended hereby that a separate trader\u2019s license shall be obtained for each store or fixed place of business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">(\u00a7\u00a7 35 through 55 specify the amount of the license fee based on the value of the stock in trade at the location involved.) The language last quoted as to a separate license for each place of business first became law as part of Ch. 36 of the Laws of 1929. A separate license has been required for each separate location at which general merchandise is sold, and the fee for each license for general merchandise has been based on the value of the stock in trade at the particular location which the license covers. See <em>Brown v. State, </em>177 Md. 321, 332; <em>Plantabbs Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>225 Md. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Chapter 91 of the Laws of 1890 amended Art. 56 of the Code \u201ctitle \u2018Licenses,\u2019 sub-title \u2018Traders\u2019 \u201d by adding \u00a7\u00a7 54A and 54B to require by \u00a7 54A that one intending to sell cigarettes shall apply to the clerk of the court authorized to issue trader\u2019s licenses, and by \u00a7 54B that the applicant state on oath to the clerk that the cigarettes intended to be sold \u201ccontain no injurious drug or narcotic,\u201d pay a fee of $50 and be granted a license. Sections 54A and 54B were codified in the Code of 1912' as \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59, respectively, of Art. 56. Chapter 704 of the Laws of 1916 repealed and reenacted \u00a7 59 to read that \u201cupon such application, the said Clerk shall demand and receive from said applicant the sum of fifteen dollars before granting said license, and in all cases the said trader shall post the said license-in a conspicuous place in his place of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In 1922 Attorney General Armstrong ruled in 7 Op. A. G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>252, 253, that under these quoted words a person who operated two separate mercantile establishments at which cigarettes were sold must obtain a separate trader\u2019s cigarette license for each location. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201cThe positive requirement contained in Section 59 of Article 56 of the Code that \u2018in all cases said trader shall post said license (cigarette license) in a conspicuous place in his place of business\u2019 cannot be complied with unless there is a separate license for each place of business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In 1939 the Legislature by Ch. 647 of the Laws of that year amended the cigarette trader\u2019s license section to provide that in the event the sale of cigarettes is made through vending machines the clerk should furnish the licensee, in addition to the license, a metal tag or stamp to be affixed to the machine \u201cin accordance with regulations of the State Comptroller.\u201d It was made a crime to fail to obtain the license or to obey the regulations of the Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The language of what is now \u00a7 64 of Art. 56 of the Code was adopted by the Legislature in enacting Ch. 351 of the Laws of 1959. That enactment struck out the provisions for metal tags and stamps and made \u00a7 64 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201cUpon such application, the said clerk shall demand and receive from said applicant the sum of twenty-five dollars before granting said license, and in all cases the said trader shall post the said license in a conspicuous place in his place of business; and in the event the sale of cigarettes is made through vending machines, the clerk shall issue the license in the name of the owner of the machines, who shall display said license on the premises where the machines are located. The license must show the address of the premises where the machines are to be located.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">It is apparent that traders both of merchandise generally and of cigarettes in particular have consistently and unbrokenly been required to procure a separate license for each fixed location from which sales are offered or made. In the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>general merchandise this is by reason of the clear and imperative demands of \u00a7 33 of Art. 56 of the Code and the cases such as <em>Brown v. State, supra, </em>recognizing this imperative clarity. In the case of cigarettes, whether sold over the counter or by means of vending machines, this has been so from 1922, at least, under Attorney General Armstrong\u2019s opinion, since the Legislature not only acquiesced in his construction of then \u00a7 59, now \u00a7 64, but since has twice\u2014in 1939 and 1959\u2014repealed and reenacted the section and in so doing has used the words he had ruled required a separate license for each fixed location for sales\u2014\u201cIn all cases said trader shall post said license [cigarette license] in a conspicuous place in his place of business.\u201d The testimony of the Chief Inspector of the State License Bureau that the 1939 statute had received the same construction and application, from 1954 to 1959, as had the 1916 statute, at least from 1922 on, and as has the present 1959 statute from 1959 to date, indicates that the construction and application of the statutes involved to require a license for each place of business has been unbroken and unchallenged from 1922 until Benco challenged their meaning in 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We think the language of \u00a7 63\u2014that one intending to sell cigarettes shall apply for a trader\u2019s license, and of \u00a7 64\u2014that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201c* * * in all cases the said trader shall post the said license in a conspicuous place in his place of business; and in the event the sale of cigarettes is made through vending machines, the clerk shall issue the license in the name of the owner of the machines, who shall display said license on the premises where the machines are located,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">buttressed by additional language added to \u00a7 64 in 1959, that \u201cthe license must show the address of the premises where the machines are to be located,\u201d leaves little doubt that Mr. Armstrong\u2019s view as to the need for a separate license for each location for over the counter sales of cigarettes applies to sales of cigarettes from vending machines. The words of the applicable sections seem definitely to mean this and such a construction is in harmony with the unmistakable requirement of \u00a7 33 that there must be a separate trader\u2019s license for each location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>at which merchandise is sold. If the statutes left doubt on the point, their legislative history would dispel it. Not only was there legislative acquiescence in the views of the Attorney General from 1922 to 1939, but also there was in 1939 and 1959 in connection with the licenses required for cigarette vending machines use of the very words which had on them the gloss of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, a gloss which could leave no reasonable doubt that a separate license was intended for each location at which a vending machine dispensed cigarettes. In <em>Read Drug &amp; Chemical Co. v. </em>Claypoole, 165 Md. 250, 257-58, the Court said of an Attorney General\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201cThis was an official interpretation and the adoption of an administrative construction in a case very analogous to, if not identical with, the one now being considered ; and, while courts are not bound by an Attorney General\u2019s opinion, or an administrative construction in conformity therewith, yet, when the meaning of the legislative language is not entirely clear, such legal interpretation and administrative construction should be given great consideration in determining the legislative intent. The Legislature knew, or must be presumed to have known, of this interpretation and administrative construction at the time of the passage of the act of 1933, and must be held to have employed the language it did with that interpretation in view.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">This principle was similarly applied in <em>Leitch v. Gaither, </em>151 Md. 167. See also <em>Comptroller </em>v. <em>American Cyanamid Co., </em>240 Md. 491, 504-05, where the principle outlined in the <em>Read Drug &amp; Chemical Co. </em>case was recognized and reiterated but found not there to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
