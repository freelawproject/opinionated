On February 23, 1965, after delays caused by changes in court-appointed counsel, Miller was adjudged by a jury in the Circuit Court for Frederick County (Robert E. Clapp, Jr., J.) to be a defective delinquent. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>seeks leave to appeal from this determination, urging in support of his application (1) that his constitutional rights were violated at the defective delinquency hearing, (2) that the verdict of the jury was against the weight of the evidence, and (3) that the members of the jury were required to affirm a belief in God.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">As to the applicant\u2019s first contention, \u201ca bald allegation of a denial of constitutional rights is not a ground for appeal * * <em>=?\u201d Fraley v. Director, </em>243 Md. 693, 694, 221 A. 2d 907 (1966), and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The second contention is likewise without merit. It has consistently been held that questions as to the weight of the evidence in jury cases are not proper for consideration in applications for leave to appeal. <em>Caplin v. Director, </em>244 Md. 103, 223 A. 2d 166 (1966); <em>West v. Director, </em>243 Md. 715, 222 A. 2d 639 (1966); <em>Jefferson v. Director, </em>243 Md. 607, 221 A. 2d 660 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Applicant\u2019s final contention has been fully considered and rejected in <em>Mastromarino v. Director, </em>244 Md. 645, 224 A. 2d 674 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
