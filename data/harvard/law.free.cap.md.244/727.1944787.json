His conviction and sentence were affirmed by this Court in <em>Howard v. State, </em>234 Md. 410. In this, his second application for leave to appeal under the Maryland Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, he contends that the Court should set aside his indictment and conviction under the ruling of <em>Schowgurow v. State, </em>240 Md. 121, decided October 11, 1965. The Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Howard County, by Judge T. Hunt Mayfield, denied his application. We affirm the dismissal of the application for the reasons given in <em>Young v. Warden, </em>245 Md. 76, 224 A. 2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
