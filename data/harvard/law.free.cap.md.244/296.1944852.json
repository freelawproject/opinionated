Of the defendants named therein we need be concerned only with appellees (Beltway). Twelve weeks later Beltway filed a petition [Code, Art. 63, \u00a7 28 (1964 Repl. Vol.) and Maryland Rule BG 75 a] to compel Travelstead to prove the validity of its lien. Travelstead demurred and answered, filing with its answer the details of its claim. Beltway, in its response, offered as a complete defense to Travelstead\u2019s lien claim, a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d (Memorandum) which it claims acquits it of any liability to Travelstead. Appended to Beltway\u2019s response is a motion for summary judgment and supporting affidavits. Travelstead, answering the motion, denied that the Memorandum was a release and attached affidavits in support of its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">At the conclusion of argument on 21 June 1965 the trial court (Raine, J.), after stating his reasons for so doing, announced that he would grant the motion for summary judgment. On 2 August he signed and filed an order to that effect. The order concluded with the words \u201csaid claim is therefore ruled null and void.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">To understand what has happened in this unusual and at times incomprehensible transaction it is necessary to look to its beginnings. Just when Iglehart and Pinkard (Beltway) first conceived this enterprise can not be ascertained from this record. However, it is clear that by September of 1963 matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>were well past the negotiation stage. On 24 September the owner of the 4.2 acre tract leased it to Beltway for 21 years with an option to renew for an additional term of 25 years and an option to purchase at any time after 10 years for $160,000. There followed a series of sub-leases obviously designed to take care of commitments already made to Sperry Rand Corporation and Thermo-Fax Sales, Incorporated for the erection of buildings appropriate for their respective uses and to be rented to them on terms already agreed upon. Although the record is silent in this regard we must assume that Beltway and Travelstead, for some months before September, engaged in discussions which resulted in Travelstead\u2019s letter of 23 September, which we have set forth in full. We have italicized passages the significance of which will be discussed later on.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">\u201cMr. Walter Pinkard, Jr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">5 E.

This is intended to be a binding letter of intent and <em>all terms </em>of this letter <em>shall be incorporated </em>in a <em>formal contract </em>based on plans and specifications <em>as soon </em>as they are <em>approved </em>by Sperry Rand Corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">\u201cThe building is to be 15,600 square feet, all on one floor, with the building dimensions of 156' by 100'. Parking is to be provided for as many cars as can be gotten on the remainder of the three-quarter acre tract. The building itself is to be of structural steel framework with non-bearing walls of block with brick facing on four sides. Roof construction will be of bar joists, metal deck, insulation board and fifteen-year roof. There will be four separate mechanical equipment rooms provided to take care of three leases plus data processing area. Ceiling will be acoustical tile, mineral fissure type, and floors, with exception of bathrooms, will be vinyl asbestos tile throughout. All in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>terior partitions, with exception of dividing partitions between the separate lease areas, will be stud and drywall, taped, spackled and painted. Bathrooms will have ceramic tile floors and wainscot and will have plastered walls and ceilings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201cThis, then, is the general outline of the building. <em>We have not included any site utility work </em>which may be required for this building but have taken all plumbing, etc., lines five feet outside of building perimeter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\"><em>\u201cAs you know, we have to get together as soon as possible with regard to utilities and letting of contracts for them. </em>We guarantee the above building and paving costs not to exceed $170,000.00.

We however reserve the right to change the amount of our fee should we feel that a subcontractor will require more supervision than is normally needed due to our doubts about his capability to perform in the time required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u201cThe costs of normal engineering and drawings plus all normal permits, etc., are included in the above. <em>We do not, however, include any permits for site utilities zoning, </em>etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201cOur payment schedule would be the following: Monthly billing\u2014payment within ten days after billing with ten percent retainer to be held back on each payment. Last payment plus all retainers to be paid within thirty days after completion of job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">\u201cOur upset price includes no bond charges. We will work out a plan with First National Bank whereby we will present our monthly requisition with a breakdown of payments to subcontractors covered by that requisition, backed up by copies of their invoices, and present our checks made out to these subcontractors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the bank. They will then release the checks as soon as our account is credited with the monthly payment. Simultaneously, with final payment of all monies due, we will provide you with complete release of liens from all subcontractors and ourselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\u201cIf this meets with your approval, please sign where indicated and return two copies to this office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">Travelstead &amp; Sons Const.

The Thermo-Fax project seems to have gotten under way early in December. Beltway, in its answer to the Mechanic\u2019s Lien Claim, stated that during the course of construction both contracts \u201cwere supplemented from time to time by certain \u2018extras\u2019 which the parties agreed were additional to the work described in the original contracts.\u201d Beltway, in said answer, alleges that \u201ccertain differences arose between the parties as to the amount \u2022of such \u2018extras,\u2019 and as to the <em>contract prices </em>of the two buildings, which differences were <em>settled </em>by the execution of\u201d the Memorandum (emphasis supplied), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">\u201cWHEREAS, Joppa Investors, Inc. and Coordinators, Inc. have entered into certain agreements with Travelstead &amp; Sons Construction Co., Inc. and with G. Ware Travelstead for the construction of certain buildings on the North Side of Bellona Avenue west of Charles Street and which buildings are at the present time substantially completed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-13\">\u201c1. It is agreed that the original contract for the construction of the building for Joppa Investors, Inc., now occupied by Sperry Rand, was for a price of $185,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-14\">\u201c2. The construction contract for the building for Coordinators, Inc., occupied by Thermo-Fax is $60,-000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201c3. These contracts were to include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">a. Sewer line to public sewer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">b. Water line and meter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">c. Paving and grading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">d. Landscaping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">e. Architects and Engineering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\"><em>\u201c4. </em>These contracts did not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">a. Storm sewer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">b. Relocating electric lines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">c. Rock removal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">d. Area connection charges and costs arising out of the Public Works Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-16\">\u201c5. While it is understood that the costs under the above contract ran in excess of the contract price, it it agreed that the extras over and above the contract for which Coordinators and Joppa Investors are responsible amount to $22,000.00 of which sum G. Ware Travelstead has personally reimbursed Joppa Investors in the amount of $6,000.00 for their losses suffered under the contract. Therefore there is due under these two contracts a total of $267,000.00 less those monies previously advanced including the above mentioned $6,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-17\">\u201c6. It is further agreed that if in the event that Travelstead is able to secure mortgages on these two properties in the total of $270,000.00 at 5 <em>Y^o </em>interest for ten years, with a 12 year 2 month level payment plan with a balloon at the end of ten years, then Joppa Investors, Inc. and Coordinators, Inc. will pay Travelstead and Sons Construction Co., Inc. an additional $9,000.00 to offset their loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-18\">\u201cATTEST:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-19\">JOPPA INVESTORS, INC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-20\">/s/ Walter D. Pinkard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afq\">Secretary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMx\">/s/ Philip C. Iglehart</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-H\">President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>COORDINATORS, INC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">/s/ E.

Travelstead</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">President</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Travelstead denies that the Memorandum constitutes a final \u201csettlement\u201d of all of the differences between the parties. It contends that the items in paragraph 4 are excluded from the operation of the Memorandum, that it has not been paid for these items and that it should be allowed to offer proof of Beltway\u2019s liability in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Judge Raine said it seemed \u201cclear to * * * [him] that it [the Memorandum] does amount to a binding written agreement between the parties which precludes the respondent from filing a lien for an additional amount.\u201d We take a somewhat different view.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">The Sperry Rand contract expressly excluded \u201cany site utility work, * * * permits for site utilities [,] zoning, etc.\u201d In the Thermo-Fax contract (first letter) the price quoted is \u201cexclusive of outside utilities and extraordinary site work.\u201d Also excluded are \u201cany applicable area charges.\u201d Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum appears to confirm what very well may be the case, namely, that the items mentioned were intended to be taken care of by some third person or, if done by Travelstead, that Travelstead would be paid for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">Beltway contends, and Judge Raine seems to have agreed, that there \u201ccould scarcely be a more clear and definitive statement of the precise amount due on the combined project.\u201d This might be so if it were possible to say that the items listed in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum are included in the \u201cextras over and above the contract for which\u201d Beltway is responsible. We think it is not at all clear that this is so. To be sure, the Memorandum does provide that \u201cthere is due under these <em>two contracts </em>a total of $267,000 * * *\u201d (emphasis supplied) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>but the items in paragraph 4 are excluded from the contracts. It occurs to us that an analysis of the \u201cextra\u201d items might be revealing although how the parties could ever determine, in the context of these \u201ccontracts,\u201d what is and what is not an \u201cextra\u201d is beyond our understanding. Nevertheless, this is a chore which the trial judge must undertake because, in our judgment, the motion for summary judgment should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">It is true perhaps that there is not much of a dispute about such material facts as have been disclosed but it is also true that those facts appear to be susceptible to more than one inference. Since Travelstead may, at trial, be able to support the inference favorable to it, the court should not have foreclosed by summary judgment any effort in that direction it (Travel-stead) may wish to undertake. In our most recent consideration of this aspect of summary judgment proceedings, <em>Reeves v. Howar, </em>244 Md. 83, <em>89-90, 222 </em>A. 2d <em>697, 701 </em>(1966), Judge Barnes, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201cWe have held that in a summary judgment proceeding even where the underlying facts are undisputed, if those facts are <em>susceptible </em>of more than one inference, the party against whom the inference was sought to be drawn is entitled to the inference most favorable to such party\u2019s contentions. <em>Roland v. Lloyd E. </em>Mitchell, <em>Inc., </em>221 Md. 11, 14, 155 A. 2d 691, 693 (1959). We cited <em>Roland </em>with approval and followed the decision in <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Allied Contractors, </em>236 Md. 534, 544, 204 A. 2d 546, 551 (1964).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">As the hearing below came to an end counsel for Travel-stead directed the court\u2019s attention to its demurrer to Beltway\u2019s original petition and asked the court to rule on it. Judge Raine was of the opinion that his granting the motion for summary judgment \u201cautomatically\u201d overruled the demurrer but he indicated that to accommodate counsel and \u201cfor the sake of the record\u201d his final order would provide, as it did, for the overruling of the demurrer. Since neither party has mentioned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>matter, either in the briefs or in argument, it will be considered abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\n<em>Order of 2 August 1965 reversed.
