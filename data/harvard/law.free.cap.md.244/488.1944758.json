Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Declaring that he was satisfied there was \u201cprobable cause to believe that narcotics\u201d were being concealed on the premises he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>commanded Sgt.

Robinson, flanked by two policemen and a policewoman, entered the tavern at 721 West Lexington around 11:00 P.M. on 16 September, showed Tucker the warrant and went immediately to the basement. After looking around for a minute or two they returned to the first floor. Sgt. Robinson pointed to a padlocked door (described by Berman) and asked Tucker if he had a key to the padlock. Tucker said the key was behind the bar. When .Sgt. Robinson told him to get the key he said the keys were not behind the bar but in his car. Tucker thereupon handed his car keys to one of the policemen and told him that he would find on the floor of the trunk a set of keys, one of which would open the padlock on the storeroom door. There was such a key and with it the lock was opened. Concealed among the bottles of liquor in the storeroom Sgt. Robinson found a supply of heroin and quinine hydrochloride (used to attenuate the heroin) worth from $10,000 to $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">At trial Tucker moved to suppress the evidence because (a) the warrant was insufficient on its face, (b) the property seized was not the property described in the warrant, (c) lack of probable cause, and (d) the warrant was illegally executed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Following the denial of his motion to suppress evidence Tucker\u2019s request to submit evidence controverting the allegations in Berman\u2019s affidavit was likewise refused, whereupon he offered to prove that Tucker\u2019s wife was the lessee of the premises (except the third floor), that she was the holder of the liquor license and the operator of the tavern and that Tucker was the manager. He offered to prove further that Berman was an addict, that he had twice been convicted of violations of the narcotic laws, that he has \u201cbeen convicted of murder,\u201d that the friendship of Tucker and Berman came to an end on 6 September 1965 after \u201ca bitter argument,\u201d that Berman was arrested on 16 September 1965 and that to avoid prosecution as a third offender of the narcotic laws he elected to give a statement implicating Tucker. He offered to prove also that the contraband seized by Sgt. Robinson was in the possession or under the control of Berman.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The State offered in evidence the warrant and the application therefor. Sgt. Robinson supplied the details of the search and seizure and the narcotics together with the chemical analyses thereof were received in evidence. He said Tucker told him there was only one key to the storeroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Juanita Barnes was the only witness produced on behalf of Tucker. She claimed to be the manager. She testified, however, that except for ordering, at regular intervals, the liquor Tucker told her to order she was really the barmaid. She said the storeroom was accessible to herself and six other employees, including Berman until his discharge on 6 September. She contradicted Sgt. Robinson\u2019s testimony that there was only one key to the storeroom. She testified there were at least three keys, her own (which she produced), Tucker\u2019s and Mrs. Tucker\u2019s. She said there were times when Berman had possession of Tucker\u2019s key.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In rebuttal the State produced the executive secretary of the Board of Liquor License Commissioners. He identified as one of his records a list of Tucker\u2019s employees furnished by Tucker\u2019s accountant. At least four of the six other employees said by Juanita Barnes to have had access to the storeroom are not shown thereon. The list describes her, not as a manager, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>as a barmaid. He testified also that Tucker told him he was the manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Tucker contends the warrant is fatally defective for a number of reasons, the first of which is that there is a variance between the place described in the application and the place authorized to be searched in the warrant. The statements intended to constitute probable cause, he argues, are directed to one room only whereas the warrant authorizes the search of the entire \u201cpremises known as 721 West Lexington Street.\u201d Assuming there is any merit in this contention the fact that the heroin was found in the room described in Berman\u2019s affidavit dissipates much of its force. We have said many times that there is no formula which can be used to measure the particularity with which premises must be described and that the adequacy of the description in every case will depend on the facts and circumstances there present. <em>Allen v. State, </em>178 Md. 269, 13 A. 2d 352 (1940); <em>Saunders v. State, </em>199 Md. 568, 87 A. 2d 619 (1952); <em>Dow v. State, </em>207 Md. 80, 113 A. 2d 423 (1955). The sufficiency of the description in the case at bar is obvious when measured against the circumstances of two of our <em>recent </em>decisions. In <em>Hall v. State, </em>232 Md. 588, 194 A. 2d 801 (1963) the probable cause set forth in the application was directed to a grocery and confectionery store located on the first floor of the premises described in the warrant. The warrant authorized a search of \u201cthe premises known as Randy\u2019s Confectionery, 1436 Holbrook Street.\u201d We held that a search of the entire premises was permissible. In <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>236 Md. 148, 202 A. 2d 758 (1964), the warrant authorized a search of 1301 E. Baltimore Street. Three connected buildings, 3, 5 and 7 S. Central Avenue, were searched. We rejected the contention that the search was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Tucker next challenges the sufficiency of the supporting affidavits. He argues that Berman did not swear to the truth of his statement and that his oath was only to the fact that he made such a statement to Sgt. Robinson. This must be dismissed as sophistry. The application, on its face, shows that Berman signed and swore to his statement not once but twice. Sgt. Robinson\u2019s affidavit is challenged because he did nothing more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>than sign his name on page 3 of the application. This also must be waved aside. Sgt. Robinson signed, on page 3, what is described as an \u201caffidavit\u201d and on the very next page, where he is described as an \u201caffiant,\u201d Judge Aaron certifies that both he and Berman subscribed and swore to their respective statements. Tucker leans heavily on <em>Howard v. State, </em>199 Md. 529, 87 A. 2d 161 (1952), but in our judgment the case at bar is clearly distinguishable. In <em>Howard </em>the warrant recited that it had been issued upon \u201cwritten information * * * signed and sworn to by Sergeant S. Ralph Warnken.\u201d The grotesque inadvertence which resulted in the use of Judge Warnken\u2019s (then a member of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City) name, rather than that of Sgt. Middleton to whom the warrant was directed, is unimportant here. There was, however, no showing that Howard knew that his accuser was Sgt. Middleton and not Judge Warnken or that he was served with all the information the issuing judge had. <em>Goodman v. State, </em>178 Md. 1, 11 A. 2d 635 (1940). In the case before us Tucker read the warrant carefully. It told him not only who his accusers were but also recited the same facts Judge Aaron had before him when he issued the warrant. Judge Hammond (now Chief Judge) for the Court, said in <em>Henderson v. State, </em>243 Md. 342, 346, 221 A. 2d 76 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">\u201cThere is force in the observations of the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 13 L. Ed. 2d 684, that the requirements of the Constitution are practical and not abstract, that search warrants must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in \u2018a commonsense and realistic fashion,\u2019 that the preference to be accorded a warrant indicates that in a doubtful or marginal case a search under a warrant may be sustainable, where without one it would fail and that \u2018a grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts towards warrants will tend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting,\u2019 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Assuming, without deciding, there is merit in Tucker\u2019s argument that Sgt. Robinson\u2019s affidavit does not contain facts with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>in his personal knowledge and that the facts therein stated do not provide a basis for determining the reliability of his sources of information, there is, nevertheless, in the affidavit of Berman enough information to justify the issuance of the warrant. Quite recently, in <em>Shrout v. </em>State, 238 Md. 170, 175, 208 A. 2d 585 (1965), Judge Oppenheimer, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201cHowever, even though the affidavit contains insufficient or even improper information which should not be considered by the court, if, in addition, it contains sufficient proper information to show probable cause, the court is justified in issuing the warrant. <em>Kapler v. State, supra </em>[194 Md. 580, 587-588, 71 A. 2d 860 (1950)]; <em>Bratburd v. State, </em>193 Md. 352, 357, 66 A. 2d 792 (1949).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Tucker\u2019s claim that Berman is an \u201cinformer\u201d whose reliability has not been established has no merit for the simple and obvious reason that Berman is an affiant; nevertheless, assuming him to be an \u201cinformer\u201d rather than an affiant, his reliability has been established by the complete corroboration of his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Tucker next argues that because the warrant authorizes the seizure of all persons in the building <em>believed </em>to be in the possession of drugs it is a general warrant and as such is proscribed by Art. 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution, Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 5 and Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 551 (1957, Cum. Supp. 1965). In reply to this argument appellee says (a) that Tucker cannot complain because the rights of others may be violated, citing <em>Saunders v. State, supra </em>and <em>Griffin v. State, </em>232 Md. 389, 194 A. 2d 80 (1963); (b) that the challenged language may be rejected as surplusage, <em>Saunders v. State, supra; </em>(c) that the command is not improper, <em>Saunders v. State, supra; Allen v. State, supra; Asner v. State, </em>193 Md. 68, 65 A. 2d 881 (1949); <em>Lucich v. State, </em>194 Md. 511, 71 A. 2d 432 (1950); <em>Smith v. State, infra, </em>and <em>Griffin v. State, supra; </em>(d) that the evidence was procured, not by the search of Tucker or <em>any </em>other person but by a search of the premises; and (e) that in any event the search would have been legal (Code, Art. 2 B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u00a7 190) without a warrant. In respect of appellee\u2019s last mentioned point (e) it is undisputed that alcoholic beverages were kept and sold on the premises under and by virtue of a license issued under the provisions of Code, Art. 2 B, \u00a7 190 of which gives any peace officer the authority to inspect and search the licensed premises without a warrant, at all hours. The only person seized was Tucker who, of course, was named in this warrant. No other persons were molested and only the licensed premises were searched.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Davids v. State, </em>208 Md. 377, 118 A. 2d 636 (1955) the defendant was convicted of bookmaking on evidence seized by police officers who entered his tavern without a warrant. We held that Code, Art. 2 B, \u00a7 179 (now \u00a7 190) authorized their entry upon his premises. Since consideration of appellee\u2019s other points would amount simply to another passing over well charted seas further discussion seems unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Tucker next contends that the trial judge\u2019s refusal to allow him to controvert Berman\u2019s affidavit by testimony of \u201cbad blood\u201d between him and Tucker, Berman\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d arrest by the Narcotics Squad and the threat to prosecute him as a third offender unless he gave a statement accusing Tucker of possessing narcotics constitutes reversible error. The trial judge, of course, was bound by our holding in <em>Smith v. State, </em>191 Md. 329, 335, 62 A. 2d 287 (1948), cert. den. 336 U.S. 925 (1949), wherein Judge Collins, speaking for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201cThe better rule seems to be that the court\u2019s consideration of the showing of probable cause should be confined solely to* the affidavit itself, and the truth of the alleged grounds stated in the affidavit cannot be controverted, as was done in the instant cases, by receiving the testimony of the accused and other witnesses. <em>Ray v. State, </em>1929, 43 Okl. Cr. 1, 276 P. 785; <em>Commonwealth v. Thacker, </em>1929, 229 Ky. 488, 17 S. W. 2d 399; <em>Piper v. State, </em>1931, 116 Tex. Cr. R. 378, 34 S. W. 2d 283; <em>Cornelius on Search and Sei</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>zure, </em>Sections 169 and 170, <em>supra </em>[1930 Edition, Chapter <em>7].\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Tucker\u2019s answer to <em>Smith v. State </em>is that however \u201clegally sound, well intentioned and theoretically perfect\u201d it may be, it has become \u201can instrument of oppression and a vehicle of perjury\u201d and that we ought to \u201cre-examine\u201d our holding \u201cin light of developments in the field of Constitutional law\u201d since it was decided in 1948. We have examined carefully all of the decisions <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of this Court and the Supreme Court cited by Tucker but we do not think any of them bear upon the question presented. In <em>Tischler v. State, </em>206 Md. 386, 390-91, 111 A. 2d 655 (1955) Judge Delaplaine, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201cAppellant urged that we should abrogate this rule because it encourages police officers to make false statements under oath. But the rule which was adopted by this Court in 1948 was reaffirmed in 1951 in <em>Goss v. State, </em>198 Md. 350, 354, 84 A. 2d 57; again in 1952 in <em>Adams v. State, </em>200 Md. 133, 139, 88 A. 2d 556; and again in 1953 in <em>Harris v. State, </em>203 Md. 165, 172, 99 A. 2d 725. Accordingly we again assert that the rule is so firmly established in Maryland that it should not be changed by a decision of this Court. We also take occasion to say that this rule has been generally followed in other States. [Citing cases.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Dess than six months later, in <em>Burrell v. State, </em>207 Md. 278, 280, 113 A. 2d 884 (1955), Judge Hammond after quoting the language of Judge Delaplaine above set forth, said for the Court: \u201cWe are not persuaded that the earlier cases were wrongly decided,\u201d and we are not now so persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Insufficiency of evidence to support the conclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>trial judge is the gist of Tucker\u2019s final contention. He argues that it was not shown he had possession or control of the contraband, that it was not on his person, that others also had access to the storeroom. He emphasizes the fact that no contraband was found in the second floor office which was under his exclusive control. The facts, he says, are as consistent with innocence as they are with guilt. Unfortunately for Tucker it is not quite that simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">It will be recalled that he told Sgt. Robinson that he had the <em>only </em>key to the storeroom, that <em>the key </em>was behind the bar, that <em>it </em>was not behind the bar but was in the trunk of his automobile. At trial he sought to show through Juanita Barnes that both she and his wife each had a key and that at least seven people had access to the storeroom. Quite apart from the fact such an arrangement is most unlikely the testimony offered to prove it is hardly persuasive. Juanita claimed to be manager but according to the records of the Board of Liquor License Commissioners Tucker was the manager and she was only the barmaid. As earlier noted at least four of the seven people she \u2022claimed had access to the storeroom are not included in the Board\u2019s list of employees. The attempt to show that Berman also had access to the storeroom was productive of a contradiction. She said \u201cthe car keys and the storage room keys\u201d were together \u201call in one set\u201d yet Tucker gave the officer the <em>car keys </em>so he could unlock the trunk and get the <em>storeroom keys.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">That the findings of fact of the trial judge will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous is a rule which has long been firmly established. Maryland Rules 886 a and 772. As Judge Horney said in <em>McCray v.
