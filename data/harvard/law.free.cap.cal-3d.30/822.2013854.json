The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 463 [63 L.Ed.2d 537, 100 S.Ct. 1244]. <em>(California </em>v. <em>Teresinski </em>(1980) 449 U.S. 914 [66 L.Ed.2d 143, 101 S.Ct. 311].)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The <em>Crews </em>decision does not affect our prior conclusion that the arresting officer lacked an objectively reasonable basis for detaining defendant; it confirms our prior ruling that the physical evidence seized as a result of. that detention and the subsequent photographic identification are inadmissible. <em>Crews, </em>however, casts doubt upon our holding that the identification testimony of the robbery victim must also be excluded. Although we reasoned that such testimony should be excluded if derived in direct causative flow, without intervening act, from the initial detention, the Supreme Court in <em>Crews </em>stated that admissibility should turn instead on whether the victim\u2019s identification testimony was the result of an independent recollection of the crime, untainted by any confrontation or identification arising from the illegal detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Upon reconsideration of this issue, pursuant to the mandate of the Supreme Court, we note first that <em>Crews </em>is virtually indistinguishable from the present case. Although recognizing the authority of this court to construe the California Constitution to provide protection beyond that afforded by parallel provisions of the federal document, we nevertheless find the reasoning of <em>Crews </em>persuasive and consistent with past California decisions; we therefore adopt <em>Crews </em>as defining the rights of the parties under the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Under the reasoning of <em>Crews, </em>a victim\u2019s identification testimony is admissible if based upon his independent recollection untainted by illegal police conduct. In the present case the trial court determined that the identification testimony was the independent product of the victim\u2019s observation of defendant during the robbery. Since that determination complies with the requirements of <em>Crews, </em>we conclude that the trial court erred in suppressing the testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">1. <em>Statement of facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">We reproduce the factual recital from our former opinion, adding a brief discussion of the views of the trial judge concerning the independent basis of the identification testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">About 2 a.m., Officer Rocha of the Dixon police force saw an unfamiliar car with three occupants proceeding through the city business district. Because of windshield glare he could not see defendant, the driver, but he thought both passengers were juveniles and surmised that the driver also was a minor. Although the car was proceeding at a lawful speed without any suspicious behavior, the officer signaled the driver to stop. He subsequently explained that he detained the car because \u201cI believed there were juveniles in the car. We have a 10:00 o\u2019clock curfew in Dixon.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">As the car slowed to a stop Officer Rocha observed defendant and the front-seat passenger glance back and reach down. Those gestures led him to believe that the occupants might be hiding alcohol or reaching for a weapon. Defendant alighted from the car, walked toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>police vehicle, and presented his driver\u2019s license. The license verified defendant\u2019s adult status, and in fact only one occupant of the car was a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Rocha told defendant to stay at the rear of the car, walked to the driver\u2019s window, and shined his light on the floorboard. He saw a pool of liquid and a beer can under the front seat. Ordering the two passengers out, he then observed a gun holster; and, after questioning, Rocha retrieved a loaded weapon from the floorboard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">A subsequent search of the car produced several beer containers, a baggie of marijuana, and a paper bag filled with bills and change. The money was traced to a Seven-Eleven store that had been robbed earlier that night in nearby Woodland. Defendant and his two passengers were arrested on suspicion of robbery. Mr. Cady, the store clerk who witnessed the robbery, identified photographs of defendant and his companions. Later at the preliminary hearing Cady identified defendant in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Defendant moved pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5 to suppress both the physical evidence seized and the identification testimony of Cady, basing his motion primarily on the testimony of Cady and Officer Rocha at the preliminary hearing. Following argument, the court requested briefing on the question whether \u201cunder circumstances where the victim is able to identify but is unable to name the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime, if the defendant\u2019s name becomes known to the victim as a result of an illegal arrest and mug pictures are taken and shown to the victim, then must the victim\u2019s identification of the defendant ... be suppressed?\u201d Clarifying its request, the court further stated that \u201cHere the Court is satisfied that Mr. Cady was able to identify the defendants. He knew their physical appearance. But he did not know their name, and their names became known to him through the mugshots which were taken as a result of . .. an illegal stop . .. . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">After receiving briefs, the trial court granted the motion to suppress. It ruled, first, that because defendant and his companions were not loitering, Officer Rocha had no basis for detaining them; the detention was therefore illegal. The illegality of the detention compels suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>of the evidence found in the car. The trial court also directed suppression of Cady\u2019s testimony, on the ground that \u201c[t]here was a direct, immediate and necessary causal connection between the illegal stop and the identifications.\u201d Since there remained no evidence linking defendant with the robbery, the court ordered the charges dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The People appealed. As we noted \"earlier, this court granted a hearing and affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling in all respects. (26 Cal.3d 457.) The Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, supra, </em>445 U.S. 463, a decision of the high court filed subsequent to our decision in <em>Teresinski.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\n<em>2. Invalidity of the detention.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Although the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate referred only to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, </em>a decision which does not relate to our earlier holding that defendant\u2019s detention was illegal, we have permitted the parties to present additional authorities and argument bearing on that issue. Upon review of the matter, however, we adhere to our prior holding, and adopt the language of the former opinion as modified to take account of additional contentions advanced and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">As we noted in our former opinion, <em>In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal. 3d 888, 893 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957] defined the constitutional standard for measuring the validity of a detention.  That decision explained that: \u201cto justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity. Not only must he subjectively entertain such a suspicion, but it must be objectively reasonable for him to do so: the facts must be such as would cause any reasonable police officer in a like position, drawing when appropriate on his training and experience [citation omitted], to suspect the same criminal activity and the same involvement by the person in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">We need only apply that standard to the facts of the present case. The detention here rested upon Officer Rocha\u2019s suspicion that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>fendant and his comrades were violating a city curfew ordinance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contrary to Officer Rocha\u2019s statement, the ordinance does not declare it a crime for minors to be found in public after 10 p.m. It provides that it is unlawful for a minor \u201cto loiter, idle, wander, stroll, or play in or upon the public streets\u201d and other public places between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These terms cannot reasonably be construed to encompass defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The word \u201cloiter\u201d in particular bears a sinister connotation: it generally connotes lingering for the purpose of committing a crime. <em>(In re Cregler </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 308, 312 [14 Cal.Rptr. 289, 363 P.2d 305]; but see <em>In re Nancy C. </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 747, 755 [105 Cal.Rptr. 113].) As the court noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Horton </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 930, 933 [92 Cal.Rptr. 666]: \u201cdriving along city streets, even at 1:15 in the morning, is not \u2018loitering.\u2019\u201d (Cf. <em>City of Seattle </em>v. <em>Pullman </em>(1973) 82 Wn.2d 794 [514 P.2d 1059].) Whether or not the terms \u201cidle, wander, stroll, or play,\u201d when used in a curfew ordinance, also carry a sinister connotation, those terms are equally inapplicable to the present case. Conceivably one may \u201cidle, wander,\u201d or \u201cplay\u201d in an automobile, but merely driving along a street in a lawful manner cannot be so described.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">In sum, Officer Rocha lacked any objectively reasonable basis to suspect that defendant or his passengers were violating the prohibi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>lory language of the ordinance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, his detention of defendant was unlawful under the standards established in <em>In re Tony C., supra, 21 </em>Cal.3d 888, 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Although it is clear that defendant\u2019s conduct did not violate the curfew ordinance, the People nevertheless argue that the detention should be upheld on the ground that the officer\u2019s action was based on a \u201creasonable mistake of law.\u201d (Cf. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>California </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 797 [28 L.Ed.2d 484, 91 S.Ct. 1106] (mistake of fact); <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Bd. of Medical Examiners </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 246 [50 Cal.Rptr. 304].) Courts on strong policy grounds have generally refused to excuse a police officer\u2019s mistake of law. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>McKelvy </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 1027, 1036-1037 [100 Cal.Rptr. 661 ].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We need not decide, however, whether under. exceptional circumstances an officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>reasonable mistake of law might validate police conduct because in this case the officer\u2019s mistake cannot be found reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The curfew ordinance did not present ah obscure or unfamiliar enactment to Officer Rocha, but one that he had enforced on numerous occasions. The plain language of the ordinance clearly does not prohibit a minor from simply being present on the streets of Dixon after 10 p.m., but only prohibits such behavior as \u201cloitering\u201d or \u201cidling\u201d on the streets; the officer\u2019s belief that Dixon had enacted a blanket curfew ordinance should have been dispelled by a simple reading of the terms of the enactment. Moreover, several years before the detention in the present case, the Court of Appeal in construing a similar ordinance explicitly held that driving a car at a normal rate of speed down a public street did not violate the ordinance. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Horton, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.3d 930.) If we were to find Officer Rocha\u2019s mistake of law reasonable under these circumstances, we would provide a strong incentive to police officers to remain ignorant of the language of the laws that they enforce and of the teachings of judicial opinions whose principal function frequently is to construe such laws and to chart the proper limits of police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">3. <em>Suppression of evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Having found defendant\u2019s detention illegal, it necessarily follows that the physical evidence found in the automobile as a result of this detention is inadmissible. (See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, supra, </em>445 U.S. 463, 472 [63 L.Ed.2d 537, 546]; <em>In re Tony C., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 888, 899; <em>Lockridge </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 166 [89 Cal.Rptr. 731, 474 P.2d 683].) Since defendant was booked and photographed following that detention as part of the investigation of the Seven-Eleven robbery, the robbery victim\u2019s identification of defendant\u2019s booking photograph\u2014a photograph taken as a direct and immediate result of that illegality\u2014is also inadmissible. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, supra, </em>445 U.S. 463, 473, fn. 18, 477 [63 L.Ed.2d 537, 547, 549]; 3 La Pave, Search and Seizure (1978) \u00a7 11.4 and cases there cited; cf. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 721 [22 L.Ed.2d 676, 89 S.Ct. 1394] (fingerprints); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sesslin </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 418 [67 Cal.Rptr. 409, 439 P.2d 321] (handwriting exemplar); <em>People </em>v. <em>McInnis </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 821, 825-826 [100 Cal.Rptr. 618, 494 P.2d 690], which admitted identification evidence based upon a routine booking photograph taken in connection with an unrelated crime, is distinguishable.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>The Attorney General offers no substantial argument to contest the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding the physical evidence seized and the photographic identification,  He contends, however, that Cady\u2019s identification of defendant was admissible, despite the illegal detention, under the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews, supra, </em>445 U.S. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In <em>Crews, </em>three women were robbed in the womens\u2019 restroom at the Washington Monument. A few days later a policeman saw defendant loitering near the Monument restrooms, observed that he matched the description given by the women, and attempted to photograph him. When the officer could not get a suitable picture, he took defendant into custody for truancy, photographed defendant at the police station, and released him. After two of the robbery victims identified the photograph, defendant was arrested and charged with robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The trial court ruled that the detention for truancy constituted an illegal arrest, and suppressed both the photographic identification and a subsequent lineup identification. The court permitted the victims to testify at trial, however, arid on the basis of that testimony defendant was found guilty of robbery of the first victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the conviction, holding that the in-court identification was the inadmissible product of the illegal detention. <em>(Crews </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C. 1978) 389 A.2d 277.) The United States Supreme Court unanimously reversed. Justice Brennan, joined by all other participating justices, held that the pretrial identifications were inadmissible, but that the robbery victim\u2019s identification testimony at trial was admissible. He noted, first, that the victim\u2019s identity was known to the police before the illegal detention, and thus her presence at trial was not traceable to any Fourth Amendment violation (445 U.S. p. 472 [63 L.Ed.2d p. 546]). Furthermore, the trial court in <em>Crews </em>specifically found that the victim\u2019s courtroom identification \u201crested on an independent recollection of her initial encounter with the assailant, uninfluenced by the pretrial identifications.\u201d (P. 473 [63 L.Ed.2d p. 547].) Justice Brennan therefore concluded that the in-court identification testimony was not tainted by the prior illegal detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The defendant in <em>Crews, </em>although acknowledging that an illegal detention in itself is not a bar to a subsequent prosecution (see <em>Frisbie </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number><em>Collins </em>(1952) 342 U.S. 519 [96 L.Ed. 541, 72 S.Ct. 509]), argued that his presence in court where he could be identified by the victim was the fruit of an illegal detention. In part D of his opinion, Justice Brennan found it unnecessary to reach that issue since \u201cin this case the record plainly discloses that prior to his illegal arrest, the police both knew [Crews\u2019] identity and had some basis to suspect his involvement in the very crimes with which he was charged.\u201d (445 U.S. p. 475 [63 L.Ed.2d p. 548].) Five justices, however, refused to join this portion of Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion since it implied that the in-court identification might be inadmissible if the police had detained Crews without any basis whatever, or had arrested him for some crime other than those with which he was later charged. Justice Powell, joined by Justice Blackmun, announced that he would \u201creject explicitly . .. the claim that a defendant\u2019s face can be a suppressible fruit of an illegal arrest.\u201d (P. 447 [63 L.Ed.2d p. 549].) Justice White, joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Rhenquist, asserted that any contention that a defendant\u2019s appearance in court for identification is suppressible was foreclosed by precedent. (P. 479 [63 L.Ed.2d pp. 550-551].)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">We find no basis to distinguish the present case from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews. </em>The victim in this case, like the victim in <em>Crews, </em>reported the crime to the police and provided them with a description of the robber before the illegal detention occurred. Although the trial court here made no formal finding that the victim\u2019s testimony at preliminary hearing was based upon his independent, untainted recollection of the crime,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court\u2019s statements at the close of the hearing imply such a determination. Judge Patton stated expressly that \u201cthe court is satisfied that Mr. Cady was able to identify the defendants. He knew their physical appearance. But he did not know their name, and their names became known to him through the mugshots which were taken as a result of the .. . illegal stop . ... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">It is clear from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews </em>that if the witness, relying upon his memory of the crime, is able to identify the defendant based upon his physical appearance, the testimony of the witness rests upon an adequate independent basis; the fact that the witness learned the defendant\u2019s name as a result of illegal police action is irrelevant. Judge Patton\u2019s determination that Cady could identify defendant\u2019s appearance apart from any information he acquired as a result of the illegal deten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>tion is therefore sufficient to establish that the identification testimony rested upon an independent and untainted source.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Defendant argues that in the present case, unlike <em>Crews, </em>the police had no grounds to suspect him of the robbery prior to the illegal detention. This distinction, however, rests on that portion of Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion which was not joined by a majority of the justices. The concurring opinions of Justices Powell and White make it clear that a majority of the high court believe that an in-court identification, based upon the independent recollection of a witness known to the police before an illegal detention, is admissible whether or not the police suspected the defendant before the detention. (See <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>State of Arkansas </em>(1981) 274 Ark. 102 [627 S.W.2d 178].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">We conclude that <em>Crews </em>is controlling with respect to any contentions based on the federal Constitution, and compels us to reject defendant\u2019s premise that the admission of Cady\u2019s courtroom identification violated the Fourth Amendment. We therefore turn to defendant\u2019s alternative claim based on article I, section 13 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">In addressing this issue, we begin by reaffirming the now settled principle that the California courts, in interpreting the Constitution of this state, are not bound by federal precedent construing the parallel federal text; as we recently stated in <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 252 [172 Cal.Rptr. 866, 625 P.2d 779], the \u201cstate courts, in interpreting constitutional guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>contained in state constitutions, are <em>\u2018independently responsible </em>for safeguarding the rights of their citizens.\u2019\u201d (P. 261, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Brisendine </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 528, 551 [119 Cal.Rptr. 315, 531 P.2d 1099].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Decisions of the United States Supreme Court, nevertheless, are entitled to respectful consideration <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bustamante </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 88, 97 [177 Cal.Rptr. 576, 634 P.2d 927]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Longwill </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 943, 951, fn. 4 [123 Cal.Rptr. 297, 538 P.2d 753]) and ought to be followed unless persuasive reasons are presented for taking a different course,  In the present case, no reasons arise to justify rejecting the teaching of the Supreme Court in <em>Crews.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">First, nothing in the language or history of the California provision suggests that the issue before us should be resolved differently than under the federal Constitution. (Compare <em>City of Santa Barbara </em>v. <em>Adamson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 123, 130 [164 Cal.Rptr. 539, 610 P.2d 436]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 628, 634-637 [100 Cal.Rptr. 152, 493 P.2d 880].)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Second, this is not a case in which the high court \u201chands down a decision which limits rights established by earlier precedent in a manner inconsistent with the spirit of the earlier opinion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bustamante, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 88, 97.) In such a case, we have stated, \u201cRespect for our Constitution as \u2018a document of independent force\u2019 [citation omitted] forbids us to abandon settled applications of its terms every time changes are announced in the interpretation of the federal charter.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pettingill </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 231, 248 [145 Cal.Rptr. 861, 578 P.2d 108].) The issue before the Supreme Court in <em>Crews, </em>however, was one of first impression for that court; the decision did not overrule past precedent or limit previously established rights under the federal charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Third, we have on occasion been influenced not to follow parallel federal decisions by the vigor of the dissenting opinions and the incisive academic criticism of those decisions. (See <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d 252, 267, fn. 17; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bustamante, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 88, 100-101.) The high court decision in <em>Crews, </em>however, was unanimous, and has not inspired extensive criti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>cism. The principles on which it rests\u2014that an illegal detention does not bar prosecution, and that proof that testimony rests on an independent source will justify its admission despite prior police illegality\u2014are well established. Indeed once courts move beyond the earlier theory that proof of a direct line of causation from an illegal search to the testimony of a witness to the crime automatically compelled suppression of the witness\u2019 testimony\u2014a point which this court reached in <em>Lockridge </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal. 3d 166\u2014the holding in <em>Crews </em>follows logically from those principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Finally, the Supreme Court decision in <em>Crews, </em>if followed by the courts of this state, would not overturn established California doctrine affording greater rights to the defendant. To the contrary, as we will explain, past California precedent is consistent with the principles set out in <em>Crews.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Prior to our first <em>Teresinski </em>opinion, the leading California decision on the <em>Crews </em>issue was <em>Lockridge </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal. 3d 166.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Lockridge, </em>police investigating a jewelry store burglary obtained a warrant and searched an apartment. The search uncovered a gun stolen two years earlier, and by tracing the serial number of the gun the police located the victims of that earlier robbery. The victims identified photographs of defendants and subsequently identified defendants at preliminary hearing. In the burglary case, however, an appellate court had already held the search warrant invalid <em>(Lockridge </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 612 [80 Cal.Rptr. 223]); defendants therefore moved to suppress the victims\u2019 testimony as the fruit of an illegal search.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">We denied the request for mandate to suppress the identification testimony. Our opinion states that \u201cThe Pesces [the witnesses] were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>already known to the police as the victims of an unsolved robbery. Their gun was found as the result of a search conducted . .. during the course of a police investigation of totally unrelated crimes. ... [I]t was pure happenstance that during an investigation of other crimes, the police came across the gun taken in the Pesce robbery. The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful police conduct. [Citations.] In the present case, that purpose was adequately served by suppressing the gun and the evidence of the other crimes that the police were seeking. That purpose would not be further advanced by suppressing the testimony of the known victims of the Pesce robbery; testimony that unquestionably would have been admissible to establish petitioners\u2019 guilt of that crime, but for the chance disclosure of their connection therewith during a wholly unrelated police investigation\u201d (3 Cal.3d at pp. 170-171.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\"><em>Lockridge </em>provides a close parallel to the present case. In both cases, an unlawful search during a police investigation of an unrelated matter (the jewelry burglary in <em>Lockridge, </em>a curfew violation in the present case) led by chance to the discovery of physical evidence linking defendants to a prior robbery. In both the victims of the robbery were not discovered as a result of the unlawful search,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but were known to the police before that search occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Thus the <em>Crews </em>decision does not threaten to overturn a settled line of California precedent but, to the contrary, leads to results consistent with the leading California cases. Thus, those decisions which rely upon independent state grounds in order to preserve consistency in California law and protect established state doctrine (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Pettingill, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 231; <em>People </em>v. <em>Longwill, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 943) are inapposite in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>We conclude that this court should adopt the reasoning of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crews </em>to define the rights of a defendant under article I, section 13 of the California Constitution. As we said in <em>Lockridge </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal. 3d 166, 171, the purpose of the exclusionary rule is adequately served by suppressing the physical evidence seized by the officer as a result of the illegal detention. That purpose would not be significantly furthered by additionally suppressing the testimony of a witness who was not discovered as a result of unlawful police conduct, and whose testimony rests upon his independent memory of the robbery.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In accord with that conclusion, we hold that the superior court correctly suppressed both the physical evidence seized at the time of the illegal detention and the testimonial evidence that Cady, the robbery victim, identified defendant\u2019s photograph the morning after the robbery. The court erred, however, in suppressing Cady\u2019s testimony identifying defendant at the preliminary hearing. Since that testimony was sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that defendant committed the charged robbery, the court also erred in dismissing the action against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The judgment (order of dismissal) is reversed, and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Bird, C. J., Mosk, J., Newman, J., Kaus, J., and Tobriner, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Citing testimony from a proceeding involving defendant\u2019s juvenile companion, the Attorney General asserts that the record in this case presents an incomplete and inaccurate account of defendant\u2019s activities and Officer Rocha\u2019s reasons for detaining defendant.

We cannot take judicial notice of the truth of testimony presented in a different action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The issues in this case concern the legality of the initial detention.

(See generally <em>Curfew Ordinances and the Control of Nocturnal Juvenile Crime </em>(1958) 107 U.Pa.L.Rev. 66, 73; <em>In re Nancy </em>C, <em>supra, </em>28 Cal.App.3d 747, 755.) Apparently Officer Rocha mistakenly thought the Dixon ordinance was of the type which prohibited mere presence upon the city streets after 10 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Seeking to transform the officer\u2019s misconception into reality, the People argue that we should construe the Dixon ordinance to prohibit juveniles from being present on the streets after curfew. Their argument, which is not entirely clear, appears to be that the language of the ordinance, which declares it illegal to \u201cloiter, idle, wander, stroll or play,\u201d is so broad as to indicate the city\u2019s intention to ban all activity whatsoever, even activity which does not fall within those specific terms. Even if such was the intention of the city council\u2014and the People present no support for that claim\u2014the language of the ordinance cannot reasonably be construed to ban conduct that does not fall within its specific terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The Attorney General calls our attention to the en banc decision of the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1980) 622 F.2d 830, in which 13 of 24 judges announced in dictum their view that the exclusionary rule should not bar admission of evidence obtained by police officers acting \u201cin good faith\u201d even if its seizure involved a technical violation of the Fourth Amendment. The United States Supreme Court, however, has never endorsed that view, and has frequently required the suppression of evidence in cases in which the police arguably were acting in good faith. (See, e.g., <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>California </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 420 [69 L.Ed.2d 744, 101 S.Ct. 2841]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick </em>(1977) 433 U.S. 1 [53 L.Ed.2d 538, 97 S.Ct. 2476].) Adoption by this court Of a doctrine limiting the exclusionary rule to searches and seizures conducted \u201cin bad faith,\u201d as urged by the Attorney General, would appear barred by <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 643 [6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 84 A.L.R.2d 933] in which the Supreme Court ruled that \u201call evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the [United States] Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court\u201d (367 U.S. 643, 655 [6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 1090]), and subsequent decisions applying that rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Findings are not required in a hearing to suppress evidence under section 1538.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Substantial evidence supports the determination that Cady\u2019s trial identification rested upon his independent recollection of the robbery. Cady observed the robbers at close range for several minutes in a well-lighted store; he then identified defendant and his companion from an array of eight photographs shown him the morning after the robbery. Defendant does not claim that the photographic lineup was suggestive.

Accordingly on remand of this matter defendant should be afforded the opportunity to renew his motion to suppress.

The witness identified defendant in the lineup and again at trial. Holding the trial testimony admissible, we stated that: \u201c[T]he fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine has not been invoked when the alleged fruit is testimony of a witness to a crime whose identity was not learned through police misconduct.... Even if Greeley\u2019s courtroom identification was dependent in part on his viewing defendant in illegally obtained clothing at the showup, it was \u201c\u2018sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019\u201d <em>(Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>[371 U.S. 471] at p. 488 [9 L.Ed.2d 441, 83 S.Ct. 407], quoting J.

Although we endorsed that distinction in our prior opinion, its validity is open to question. The illegal police conduct in the present case, which gave rise to the suppression motion, concerns the initial detention, not the arrest or subsequent booking and photographing. That detention occurred during an investigation of a suspected curfew violation before the detaining officer was even aware of the Seven-Eleven robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The <em>Crews </em>decision, in noting that the arrest in that case was not a sham or pretext (see 445 U.S. 464, 468, fn. 5 [63 L.Ed.2d 537, 543-544]), implied a limit to the admissibility of evidence under that decision.

For the reasons well expressed by Justice Manuel in his dissenting opinion in this case (26 Cal. 3d at pp. 465-466), in which I concurred, the detention was proper. As Justice Manuel explained: \u201cCircumstances short of probable cause to make an arrest may justify an officer stopping pedestrians or motorists for questioning. <em>(In re Tony C. </em>(1978) <em>21 </em>Cal.3d 888, 892 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 384, 388-389 [124 Cal.Rptr. 536, 540 P.2d 632]; <em>Cunha </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 352, 355 [85 Cal.Rptr. 160, 466 P.2d 704]; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 423, 426-427 [82 Cal.Rptr. 484, 462 P.2d 12]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mickelson </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 448, 450 [30 Cal.Rptr. 18, 380 P.2d 658]; <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1960 Cadillac Coupe </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 92, 95-96 [41 Cal.Rptr. 290, 396 P.2d 706].) As stated in <em>Tony C, </em>the application of the rules is based on a determination of \u2018\u201cthe reasonableness <em>in all the circumstances </em>of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>[1968] 392 U.S. at p. 19 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 904]).\u2019 (21 Cal.3d at p. 892; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">\u201cIn the present case there was an abundance of objective facts that justified Officer Rocha\u2019s honest and strong belief that the occupants of the vehicle might be in violation of the curfew and ordinance.

He observed a car he did not recognize, apparently occupied by juveniles, driving between 2 and 3 a.m. in the business district of a relatively small town. Although he knew that the curfew law contained a provision exempting juveniles traveling to or from \u2018some lawful business or place or dance,\u2019 he had no way of determining whether the exception applied without detaining and questioning the occupants of the vehicle. In light of the strong possibility that the exception did not apply, such detention and questioning was fully justified. In my opinion, there can be no question of \u2018the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied April 15, 1982.
