Past cases have upheld the constitutionality of section 13353 against claims that the statute (1) violates the driver\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) authorizes an unreasonable search or seizure,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) denies equal protection to variously defined classes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (4) fails to satisfy procedural due process requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Undaunted by this wealth of authority confirming the validity of the statute, plaintiff in the instant case urges our court to strike down the statute as, in essence, a violation of \u201csubstantive due process.\u201d In support of his argument, plaintiff maintains that the \u201cright to drive\u201d is a \u201cfundamental constitutional right\u201d under the California Constitution, comparable in status, for example, to the constitutional right of free speech or freedom of religion, so that legislative enactments which limit an individual\u2019s freedom to drive are to be subjected to \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d by the judiciary. Relying on precedents arising primarily in the context of legislation limiting freedom of speech or privacy, plaintiff asserts that our court should invalidate section 13353 on the ground that the Legislature could have achieved the purposes of the legislation through the adoption of an alternative sanction \u201cless restrictive\u201d of an individual\u2019s right to drive than the six-month license suspension provided by the current provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">As we shall, explain, we find plaintiff\u2019s constitutional contention totally lacking in merit. Although automobile travel is without question an important aspect of life in contemporary California society and an individual\u2019s substantial interest in retaining his driver\u2019s license has properly been accorded a variety of legal protections, plaintiff has cited absolutely no authority, from California or elsewhere, which suggests that legislative regulation of either automobile driving or automobile drivers is in any manner constitutionally \u201csuspect\u201d or involves any of the considerations which in past cases have been viewed as justifying the extraordinary invocation of \u201cstrict judicial scrutiny\u201d of the Legislature\u2019s substantive policy decisions. On the contrary, as we shall see, past authorities \u2014while fully cognizant of the practical importance of an individual\u2019s \u201cright to drive\u201d\u2014have uniformly recognized that the area of driving is particularly appropriate for extensive legislative regulation, and that the state\u2019s traditionally broad police power authority to enact any measure which reasonably relates to public health or safety operates with full force in this domain,  Because, as plaintiff concedes, section 13353 bears a reasonable relation to the preservation of safety on California highways, we reject plaintiff\u2019s constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">1. <em>The facts and proceedings below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">At approximately 11 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve, 1977, Officer DuVal of the Culver City Police Department observed plaintiff Ernesto Hernandez driving erratically on a public street. The officer turned on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>emergency light and directed Hernandez to pull his van over to the side of the road. When Hernandez did so and then got out of his van, he staggered against it and the officer assisted him to the sidewalk. The officer detected a strong odor of alcohol on Hernandez\u2019s breath, and noticed that his eyes were red and watery and that his speech was thick and slurred. After administering field sobriety tests and concluding that Hernandez was under the influence of alcohol, the officer placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Immediately thereafter, the officer advised Hernandez of the requirements of California\u2019s implied consent law, reading verbatim from a laminated card which the officer carried for this purpose. The officer informed plaintiff: \u201cYou are required by state law to submit to a chemical test to determine the alcoholic content of your blood. You have a choice of whether the test is to be of your blood, breath or urine. If you refuse to submit to a test, your driving privilege will be suspended for a period of six months. You do not have the right to talk to an attorney or to have an attorney present before stating whether you will submit to a test, before deciding which test to take, or during the administration of the test chosen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">At the subsequent administrative hearing, the officer described plaintiff s response to the proffered choice: \u201cI asked Mr. Hernandez if he understood the statement. He answered, \u2018Yeah, I understand.\u2019 I then asked him which test he would like to take and he said T won\u2019t take no test at all.\u2019 I then asked him if he understood that he would automatically lose his driver\u2019s license for six months, to which he stated, T don\u2019t give a damn. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to take no tests.\u2019 I then asked subject Hernandez, \u2018You mean you don\u2019t want to take a blood test?\u2019 He answered, \u2018No.\u2019 I asked him, \u2018And you don\u2019t want to take a breath test?\u2019 He answered, \u2018No.\u2019 I asked him, \u2018And you don\u2019t want to take a urine test?\u2019 He answered \u2018Man, leave me alone. I don\u2019t want to take no tests, all I want to do is go home.\u2019\u201d Hernandez was then taken to the Culver City jail and booked on the drunk driving charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">On January 30, 1978, defendant Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) informed Hernandez of the imminent suspension of his driver\u2019s license pursuant to section 13353. At Hernandez\u2019s request, an administrative hearing on the suspension was conducted on March 20, 1978, and on June 16, 1978, the DMV notified Hernandez that the validity of the suspension had been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Hernandez then filed the present mandate proceeding, challenging the validity of his license suspension on the ground that section 13353, subdivision (b) is unconstitutional. The points and authorities accompanying the petition recognized that the statutory sanction of section 13353, subdivision (b)\u2014a six-month suspension of a driver\u2019s license for refusing to submit to a chemical test\u2014bears a rational and reasonable relation to the state\u2019s legitimate interest in highway safety. The petition argued, however, that because of the importance of the right to drive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> any legislative measure restricting this right\u2014such as section 13353\u2014must be subjected to \u201cstrict judicial scrutiny\u201d and must be struck down if a court concludes that the Legislature could have accomplished the purposes of the legislation through the adoption of an alternative measure less restrictive of the right to drive. Asserting that instead of imposing a six-month suspension of one\u2019s driver\u2019s license for refusing to submit to a chemical test, the Legislature could have achieved the purposes of section 13353, subdivision (b) by providing that such a refusal would automatically give rise to a presumption of intoxication in any subsequent criminal proceeding, Hernandez maintained that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court rejected Hernandez\u2019s constitutional claim and denied the requested writ of mandate. Hernandez now appeals from the adverse judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">2. <em>The normal presumption of constitutionality applies to legislative measures regulating an individual's right to drive an automobile and such a measure is valid so long as its provisions reasonably relate to any legitimate state interest, such as the preservation of the health or safety of the public.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Section 13353, subdivision (b)\u2014the statute at issue here\u2014is perhaps a paradigm example of a classic \u201chealth and safety\u201d police power measure, clearly enacted by the Legislature to foster the safety of the public in the use of the state\u2019s highways.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n                   As we noted shortly after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>statute\u2019s enactment 15 years ago: \u201cOur implied consent statute, including section 13353, was enacted to fulfill the need for a fair, efficient and accurate system of detection and prevention of drunken driving.\u201d <em>(Kesler </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 74, 77 [81 Cal.Rptr. 348, 459 P.2d 900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Prior to the enactment of the statute, both this court and the United States Supreme Court had explicitly held that when a person has been lawfully arrested for drunk driving the police, utilizing appropriate medical procedures, may <em>forcibly </em>remove a blood sample from the driver without his consent. (See <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>384 U.S. 757; <em>People </em>v. <em>Duroncelay </em>(1952) 48 Cal.2d 766, 771-772 [312 P.2d 690].) Despite the legality of such a coercive procedure, however, the Legislature recognized that \u201csuch an episode remains an unpleasant, undignified and undesirable one.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Hawkins) </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 757, 764 [100 Cal.Rptr. 281, 493 P.2d 1145].) In enacting section 13353, the Legislature sought to obviate these consequences for the driver and \u201cavoid the possible violence which could erupt if forcible tests were made upon a recalcitrant and belligerent inebriate\u201d (An<em>derson </em>v. <em>Cozens, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.3d 130, 143), while at the same time preserving the state\u2019s strong interest in obtaining the best evidence of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of the arrest. Thus, \u201cthe Legislature devised an additional or alternative method of compelling a person arrested for drunk driving to submit to a test for intoxication, by providing that such person will lose his automobile driver\u2019s license for a period of six months if he refuses to submit to a test for intoxication. The effect of this legislation is to equip peace officers with an instrument of enforcement not involving physical compulsion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Hawkins), supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 765.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Although plaintiff recognizes that the six-month suspension sanction provided by section 13353, subdivision (b) bears a rational and reasonable relation to the state\u2019s interest in enforcing its drunk driving laws, plaintiff asserts that we should nonetheless hold the statute unconstitutional as a violation of substantive due process because the Legislature assertedly could have achieved the purposes of the statute by devising an alternative \u201cless restrictive\u201d sanction when a driver refuses to consent to a chemical test. In pursuing this contention, however, plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tiff has lost sight of one of the principal lessons of the past half-century of American constitutional law.  As our court explained in <em>Wilke &amp; Holzheiser, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Alcoholic Bev. Control </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 349, 359 [55 Cal.Rptr. 23, 420 P.2d 735]: \u201cIn passing upon [a substantive due process challenge to a legislative police power measure], we exercise an extraordinary power over a coordinate branch of government and perform a correspondingly narrow function: <em>we simply determine whether the statute reasonably relates to a legitimate governmental </em>purpose.... \u2018\u201cThe doctrine.. . that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely. . .has long since been discarded.. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We reaffirmed this fundamental constitutional principle in our recent decision in <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 398 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512], emphasizing that \u201c[i]n the exercise of its police power a Legislature does not violate due process so long as an enactment is...reasonably related to a proper legislative goal. The wisdom of the legislation is not at issue in analyzing its constitutionality, and <em>neither the availability of less drastic remedial alternatives </em>nor the legislative failure to resolve all related ills at once will invalidate a statute.\u201d (Italics added.) (See also <em>Cory </em>v. <em>Shierloh </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 430, 438 [174 Cal.Rptr. 500, 629 P.2d 8].)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Plaintiff contends, however, that although this deferential substantive due process analysis may be appropriate in reviewing most police power measures, the foregoing constitutional principles should not apply to measures which impinge upon an individual\u2019s \u201cright to drive.\u201d Pointing to a number of California cases which indicate that legislative measures which significantly interfere or impinge upon \u201cfundamental constitutional rights\u201d are properly subjected to \u201cstrict judicial scrutiny\u201d (see, e.g., <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 33, 48-49 [157 Cal.Rptr. 855, 599 P.2d 46] (right to petition government); <em>People </em>v. <em>Glaze </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 841, 845-846 [166 Cal.Rptr. 859, 614 P.2d 291] (freedom of speech)), plaintiff contends that the \u201cright to drive\u201d constitutes such a \u201cfundamental constitutional right.\u201d He argues that legislative measures, such as the instant statute, which operate to limit one\u2019s right to drive are constitutional only if they pass muster under the rigorous strict scrutiny standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Past California cases, however, provide no support whatsoever for plaintiff\u2019s contention. Over 30 years ago, in <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 870 [222 P.2d 1] (overruled on other grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>in <em>Rios </em>v. <em>Cozens </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 792 [103 Cal.Rptr. 299, 499 P.2d 979]), our court\u2014while acknowledging the great importance of driving \u2014at the same time explicitly emphasized that \u201cit is...well established .. .that usage of the highways is subject to reasonable regulation for the public good.... \u2018The use of the public highways by motor vehicles, with its constant dangers, renders the reasonableness and necessity of regulation apparent.... <em>Any appropriate means adopted by the states to insure competence and care on the part of its licensees and to protect others using the highway is consonant with due process' </em>[Citations].\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Id., </em>at p. 876.) (See also <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Division of Motor Vehicles </em>(1931) 212 Cal. 279, 283 [298 P. 481]; <em>Hendrick </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1915) 235 U.S. 610, 622 [59 L.Ed. 385, 390, 35 S.Ct. 140].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">More recently, in a series of cases reaching back more than a decade, the California Courts of Appeal have uniformly rejected the application of \u201cstrict judicial scrutiny\u201d to challenges mounted against section 13353. In <em>Spurlock </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 1 Cal. App.3d 821, 830 [82 Cal.Rptr. 42], the earliest of these decisions, the court explained: \u201cThe interest which the Legislature is attempting to regulate by Vehicle Code, section 13353, is not one protected by specific guarantee of the United States Constitution; neither does it affect the integrity of the political process, nor does its impact fall most heavily upon a discrete and insular minority. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carolene Products Co. </em>[(1938)] 304 U.S. 144, [152-153,] fn. 4 ....) Thus the standard to be applied in determining its conformity with the requirements of due process is that enunicated in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical of Oklahoma </em>[(1955)] 348 U.S. 483, [487-488] [99 L.Ed. 563, 571-572, 75 S.Ct. 461]: \u2018.. .the law need not be in every respect logically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>McGlothlen </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1021 [140 Cal.Rptr. 168], reiterated <em>Spurlock's </em>conclusion: \u201cThe right to drive a motor vehicle on the public highways is not such a fundamental right as to require strict scrutiny of any law which appears to classify the driving privileges of persons otherwise similarly situated, and to necessitate a compelling state interest before such classification may be justified.\u201d (See also <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 936, 942 [130 Cal.Rptr. 311].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Although plaintiff challenges the present vitality of these established California precedents on several grounds, each of the plaintiff\u2019s arguments is manifestly flawed. Plaintiff initially relies upon a series of recent cases of both the United States Supreme Court and of our own court involving procedural due process challenges to various aspects of a state\u2019s driver\u2019s license suspension process. (See, e.g., <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 535 [29 L.Ed.2d 90, 91 S.Ct. 1586]; <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Love </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 105 [52 L.Ed.2d 172, 97 S.Ct. 1723] <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Montrym, </em>supra, 443 U.S. 1; <em>Rios </em>v. <em>Cozens, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 792.) While these cases unquestionably hold \u201c[t]hat the Due Process Clause applies to a state\u2019s suspension or revocation of a driver\u2019s license\u201d <em>(Mackey </em>v. <em>Montrym, supra, </em>443 U.S. 1, 10, fn. 7 [61 L.Ed.2d 321, 329]), none of the cases contains any suggestion whatsoever that in applying the substantive aspect of due process to such license suspension statutes, courts are to discard the normal presumption of constitutionality and to subject such statutes to strict judicial scrutiny rather than to the ordinary reasonable relationship standard.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Plaintiffs reliance on this line of procedural due process cases appears to rest upon an assumption that whenever a \u201cproperty\u201d or \u201cliberty\u201d interest is accorded the protections of procedural due process, that interest becomes a \u201cfundamental constitutional right\u201d so that legislative measures regulating such an interest are necessarily subject to strict scrutiny. This assumption is totally unfounded. Recent decisions have established that the whole panoply of ordinary property rights are generally protected from summary termination or deprivation by procedural due process (see, e.g., <em>Random </em>v. <em>Appellate Department </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 536, 547-552 [96 Cal.Rptr. 709, 488 P.2d 13]; <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 67, 88-90 [32 L.Ed.2d 556, 574-576, 92 S.Ct. 1983]) but no case has even remotely suggested that the constitutionality of substantive legislative measures regulating or restricting such \u201cprotected property\u201d rights are to be judged under a \u201cstrict scrutiny standard.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">As Justice Brennan explained in <em>New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. </em>v. <em>Orrin W. Fox Co. </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 96, 106-107 [58 L.Ed.2d 361, 373-374, 99 S.Ct. 403], in upholding the constitutionality of a California statute regulating business franchises: \u201cEven if the right to franchise had constituted a protected interest [safeguarded by procedural due process guarantees] when California enacted the Automobile Franchise Act, California\u2019s Legislature was still constitutionally empowered to enact a general scheme of business regulation that imposed reasonable restrictions upon the exercise of the right. ... At least since the demise of the concept of \u2018substantive due process\u2019 in the area of economic regulation, this court has recognized that \u2018[legislative bodies have broad scope to experiment with economic problems.. . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>As we have seen, past cases have long established that the Legislature has similarly broad authority to regulate with respect to safety hazards related to driving. The procedural due process protections that have been accorded in the license suspension process do not diminish the Legislature\u2019s substantive police power authority in this area nor justify strict judicial scrutiny of the Legislature\u2019s substantive policy decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In addition to his misguided reliance on the procedural due process cases, plaintiff attempts to draw support from a second set of cases that is equally inapposite to the constitutional claim which he asserts. In <em>McConville </em>v. <em>Alexis </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 593 [159 Cal.Rptr. 49], the Court of Appeal was faced with the question of whether a trial court should apply the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d or the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d standard of review in passing upon a challenge to a quasi-judicial administrative decision by the DMV which resulted in a six-month suspension of an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license. As the <em>McConville </em>court noted, this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242] and <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29], established that \u201c[w]hen an administrative decision affects a right which has been legitimately acquired or is otherwise \u2018vested,\u2019 and when that right is of a fundamental nature from the standpoint of its economic aspect or its \u2018effect.. .in human terms and the importance ... to the individual in the life situation,\u2019 then a full and independent <em>judicial </em>review of that decision is indicated because \u2018[t]he abrogation of the right is too important to the individual to relegate it to exclusive administrative extinction.\u2019\u201d (Strumsky, 11 Cal.3d at p. 34, quoting <em>Bixby, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Although an earlier Court of Appeal <em>decision\u2014McGue </em>v. <em>Sillas </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 799 [147 Cal.Rptr. 354]\u2014had held that the temporary loss of one\u2019s driver\u2019s license was not sufficiently grievous to warrant the application of the independent review standard, the <em>McConville </em>court rejected that conclusion and found instead that \u201cthere can be little question but that possession of a driver\u2019s license rises to the level of a fundamental right under <em>Bixby </em>in terms of both the economic implications relating thereto and \u2018the importance of the possession .\u2018to the individual in the life situation.\u2019\u201d (97 Cal.App.3d at p. 600.) Focusing only upon an excerpt of the above passage to the effect that \u201cpossession of a driver\u2019s license rises to the level of a fundamental right,\u201d plaintiff in the instant case suggests that <em>McConville </em>provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>support for his claim that driving is a \u201cfundamental constitutional right\u201d for strict scrutiny purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention is clearly specious.  We may assume without deciding that the loss of a driver\u2019s license does implicate interests sufficiently important \u201cto the individual in the life situation\u201d to warrant <em>independent review of a quasi-judicial administrative decision </em>suspending or terminating such right. It does not follow, however, that legislative measures regulating or limiting the possession of a driver\u2019s license are subject to strict judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In fact, plaintiff\u2019s argument in this regard betrays a serious misunderstanding of the basic foundation of the <em>Bixby-Strumsky </em>doctrine. As both <em>Bixby </em>and <em>Strumsky </em>explain, the standard of review question with which those cases deal relates to the appropriate relationship between <em>administrative </em>and <em>judicial </em>adjudicatory decisions, and does not concern the constitutional legitimacy or validity of legislative policy judgments at all. Thus, under <em>Bixby-Strumsky, </em>the \u201cfundamental right\u201d category does not identify areas in which substantive legislative judgments are in any manner constitutionally suspect or justify unusual judicial scrutiny; rather, that category simply encompasses those quasi-judicial administrative decisions that have \u201can impact on the individual \u2018sufficiently vital.. .to compel a full and independent review\u2019 by the court.\u201d <em>(Interstate Brands </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 770, 779 [163 Cal.Rptr. 619, 608 P.2d 707].)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Indeed, even a cursory review of the <em>Bixby-Strumsky </em>line of decisions makes it abundantly clear that the applicability of the independent judgment standard of review does not in any sense suggest that legislative measures pertaining to the individual interest at issue are properly subject to strict scrutiny review. Thus, for example, in <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Retirement Board </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 745, 750-751 [129 Cal.Rptr. 289, 548 P.2d 689], we held that the independent judgment standard should be applied in reviewing an administrative decision affecting an employee\u2019s receipt of disability payments, but we in no way intimated that the normally extensive legislative measures regulating the terms and eligibility of such disability payments were properly subject to a strict scrutiny constitutional review.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Similarly, our decision in Strumsky\u2014applying independent review to an administrative determination denying retirement benefits\u2014plainly did not contemplate that all statutory measures dealing with the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of retirement benefits are appropriate subjects for an unusually rigorous substantive due process review. Accordingly, the fact that an administrative decision suspending an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license may well affect a \u201cfundamental right\u201d within the meaning of the <em>Bixby-Strumsky </em>doctrine, does not in any manner support plaintiff\u2019s contention that the statute at issue here is properly subject to a strict scrutiny constitutional review.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In sum, past California cases clearly establish that the constitutionality of legislative measures regulating the granting and suspension of driver\u2019s licenses for the public safety is to be judged against the restrained substantive due process standard traditionally applied to ordinary police power measures. Plaintiff has demonstrated no basis whatsoever to justify a departure from that approach. Inasmuch as section 13353, subdivision (b) bears a reasonable relation to the state\u2019s interest in the effective enforcement of its drunk driving laws, we conclude that the statute is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Richardson, J., Tamura, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Ashby, J.,* concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The statute\u2019s \u201cimplied consent\u201d appellation derives from the fact that section 13353, subdivision (a) provides in part that \u201c[a]ny person who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway... <em>shall be deemed to have given his consent </em>to a chemical test of his blood, breath or urine for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his blood if lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed while the person was driving a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references in this opinion are to the Vehicle Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\">See, e.g., <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Orr </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 656, 660-663 [69 Cal.Rptr. 137]; cf. <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 757, 760-765 [16 L.Ed.2d 908, 913-916, 86 S.Ct. 1826]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sudduth </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 543 [55 Cal.Rptr. 393, 421 P.2d 401].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-11\">See, e.g., <em>Westmoreland </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 1, 4 [74 Cal.Rptr. 363]; <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Bright </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 788, 790 [71 Cal.Rptr. 123]; cf. <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>384 U.S. 757, 766-772 [16 L.Ed.2d 908, 913-920].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-12\">See, e.g., <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 793, 796 [79 Cal.Rptr. 433]; <em>Pepin </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 9, 11 [79 Cal.Rptr. 657]; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Cozens </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 130, 141-144 [131 Cal.Rptr. 256].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b101-13\">See, e.g., <em>August </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 52, 58-62 [70 Cal.Rptr. 172]; <em>Serenko </em>v. <em>Bright </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 682, 689-692 [70 Cal.Rptr. 1]; <em>Funke </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 449, 455-456 [81 Cal.Rptr. 662]; cf. <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Montrym </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 1 [61 L.Ed.2d 321, 99 S.Ct. 2612],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The petition noted that Hernandez is a bus driver and that the suspension of his driver\u2019s license would pose a particular hardship for him because it would result in at least the temporary loss of employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Section 13353, subdivision (b) presently provides in full: \u201cIf any such person refuses the officer\u2019s request to submit to, or fails to complete, a chemical test, the department, upon receipt of the officer\u2019s sworn statement that he had reasonable cause to believe such person had been driving a motor vehicle upon a highway or upon other than a highway in areas which are open to the general public while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and that the person had refused to submit to, or failed to complete, the test after being requested by the officer, shall suspend his privilege to operate a mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>tor vehicle for a period of six months.

The fact that the Commonwealth, for policy reasons of its own, elects not to summarily suspend those drivers who do take the breath-analysis test does not... in any way undermine the Commonwealth\u2019s strong interest in summarily removing from the road those who refuse to take the test. A state plainly has the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>to offer incentives for taking a test that provides the most reliable form of evidence of intoxication for use in subsequent proceedings____And, in exercising its police powers, the Commonwealth is not required by the Due Process Clause to adopt an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 approach to the acute safety hazards posed by drunk drivers.\u201d (443 U.S. at pp. 18-19 [61 L.Ed.2d at pp. 334-335].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\">We note that while the United States Supreme Court has continued to hold that the application of federal procedural due process principles is wholly dependent upon the existence of a \u201cprotected property or liberty interest\u201d or \u201centitlement\u201d (see, e.g., <em>Connecticut Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Dumschat </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 458 [69 L.Ed.2d 158, 101 S.Ct. 2460]), in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 260, 268 [158 Cal.Rptr. 316, 599 P.2d 622], our court recognized that under the California Constitution \u201cfreedom from arbitrary adjudicative procedures is a substantive element of one\u2019s liberty\u201d so that \u201cwhen an individual is subjected to deprivatory governmental action, he always has a due process liberty interest both in fair and unprejudiced decision-making and in being treated with respect and dignity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b112-7\">NEWMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">I concur in the result.

Sunday Examiner &amp; Chronicle (Mar. 29, 1981) p. A7; cf. Erwin, <em>Trial Tactics: Preparing DUI Defendants and Defense Witnesses for Cross-Examination </em>(1981) 8 Forum, No. 1, pp. 18, 23 (\u201cNot under the influence at .10\u201d); Plotkin, <em>Most Blood Testing for Alcohol Content Is in Error </em>(1978) 5 Forum, No. 5, p. 9; Fitzgerald &amp; Hume, <em>The Single Chemical Test for Intoxication: A Challenge to Admissibility </em>(1981) 66 Mass.L.Rev. 23; Alternative Sentencing Evaluation Committee for Driving under the Influence Report and Recommendations to the L.A. County Municipal Judges\u2019 Association and Presiding Judges\u2019 Association (Mar. 26, 1981).) \u201cAdded to the constitutional problems of these statutes is the very nature of the chemical tests themselves. Far from the infallibility one would expect of evidence resulting in the imposition upon a defendant of proving himself to be innocent, these tests appear to be no more reliable than any other form of scientific evidence, and very possibly considerably less reliable.\u201d (Taylor, <em>Blood-alcohol presumptions: Guilty until proved innocent </em>(1978) 53 State Bar J. 170, 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The attorney here hypothesized a presumption and argued that, under the \u201ccompelling [state] interest test,\u201d his presumption exemplifies \u201cless drastic means.\u201d He contends that California\u2019s interest in highway safety would be as well-served by a presumption that his client was under the influence of alcohol as by the six-month suspension of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">I believe that neither the federal nor the state Constitution requires that the Legislature adopt that or a similar proposal. The aim of the six-month suspension is to persuade certain drivers to take at least one of the tests. The Legislature has concluded that evidence thus obtained and utilized pursuant to rules based on varying levels of intoxication is likely to be useful and reliable at trial. Test results are treated as superior to testimonial disputes between defendants and the arresting officers. It is true that a presumption <em>might </em>jeopardize, a driver\u2019s hope for an adjudication in his favor, and that thus he might be persuaded to submit to testing. By no means, though, should that lead us to conclude that the Legislature\u2019s choice of a more powerful persuader (i.e., its threat of a six-month suspension) was unauthorized.

This, of course, is most obviously true with respect to those individuals whose occupations depend directly on the ability to drive, such as truckdrivers or delivery persons. But even for those for whom driving is merely a way to get to and from a place such as work or school, the loss of a driver\u2019s license for a six-month period can constitute a severe hardship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The United States Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 535, 539 [29 L.Ed.2d 90, 94, 91 S.Ct. 1586]: \u201c[o]nce [driver\u2019s] licenses are issued. ..their continued possession may become essential in the pursuit of a livelihood. Suspension of issued licenses thus involves state action that adjudicates important interests of the licensees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I am not prepared to declare that the instant statute fails to meet the strict scrutiny test.
