J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_\">May an individual be legally held to answer on a felony charge after successive complaints charging identical offenses were filed against him and his preliminary examination was not held within the statutory 10 court days of his in-custody arraignment on the first complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">On January 28, 1980, petitioner was arrested for a violation of Penal Code section 459 (burglary).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 31st, while still in custody, he was arraigned on a felony complaint charging him with burglary and he pleaded not guilty. The public defender was appointed to represent him and a preliminary examination was scheduled for February 14th. Petitioner, unable to post bail, remained in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">On February 14th, the date set for the preliminary examination, the prosecutor announced that he was unable to proceed. The magistrate then purported to \u201cdismiss\u201d the complaint and to \u201cdischarge\u201d the petitioner. The district attorney immediately filed a new felony complaint charging the same offense as the prior complaint. Petitioner was arrested on the new complaint before being released from custody on the \u201cdismissed\u201d complaint. The next day, February 15th, petitioner was arraigned on the second complaint and pleaded not guilty. A preliminary hearing was set for February 29th.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">On February 29th, petitioner moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to hold a preliminary examination more than 10 days after his first' arraignment and plea. That motion was denied, and the preliminary hearing was held. Petitioner was held to answer on the burglary charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">After his arraignment in superior court, petitioner moved to set aside the information pursuant to section 995 on the ground that he had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>been legally committed by a magistrate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He contended that a magistrate could not legally commit a defendant after a preliminary hearing which was held in violation of the 10-court-day time limit of section 859b,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the time limit was violated in his case when his preliminary hearing was held more than 10 court days after his first arraignment and plea. This motion was denied. Petitioner now seeks a writ of prohibition to prevent further prosecution on the burglary information.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Former section 859b, the statute in effect at the time,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provided in part that a preliminary examination must be held within 10 court days of a defendant\u2019s arraignment or plea, whichever occurred later. <em>\u201cIn no instance\u201d </em>was the preliminary examination to be continued more than 10 days after arraignment or plea when the defendant was in custody, unless the defendant personally waived the time limit. (Former \u00a7 8591), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>A violation of this time limit rendered the resulting commitment of the defendant illegal.  \u201cIt is settled that denial of a substantial right at thj preliminary examination renders the ensuing commitment illegal and entitles a defendant to dismissal of the information on timely motion. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pompa-Ortiz </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 519, 523 [165 Cal.Rptr. 851, 612 P.2d 941 ].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The language of section 859b is \u201cplain and mandatory\u201d and creates an \u201cabsolute right in favor of persons in custody charged with felonies to have the preliminary examination commenced within 10 court days . . ..\u201d <em>(Serrato </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 459, 464-465 [142 Cal.Rptr. 882].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the 10-court-day period was applicable and was violated, the commitment by the magistrate was not legal and an information based on a tardy preliminary examination had to be dismissed on the defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to section 995. <em>(Serrato, supra; Irving </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 596 [155 Cal.Rptr. 654].)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">It is conceded by the prosecution, the real party in interest in this writ proceeding, that the petitioner did not waive his right to a preliminary examination within 10 court days of his in-custody arraignment and plea. Similarly, it is clear that his preliminary examination was held more than 10 court days from his arraignment and plea on the <em>first </em>complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The issue can thus be narrowly stated.  May the starting point for calculation of the 10-court-day period be petitioner\u2019s first arraignment, or did the magistrate\u2019s dismissal of the first complaint render the arraignment on the second complaint the appropriate starting point?</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Both parties seek in their arguments to reconcile the statutory scheme for disposition of felony complaints with this court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 749. In that case, this court held that a magistrate was not authorized to dismiss a felony complaint pursuant to section 1385.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner relies upon <em>Peters </em>to contend that the magistrate had no authority to dismiss the first complaint, and that the purported dismissal was void and left the first arraignment date as the controlling date for the commencement of the 10-court-day period. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 682 [124 Cal.Rptr. 32, 539 P.2d 792]; <em>Carraway </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 150 [172 Cal.Rptr. 453].) The prosecution contends that section 871, which authorizes a magistrate to \u201cdischarge\u201d a defendant after hearing a preliminary examination in which insufficient evidence is presented, can be read to authorize a dismissal even if no evidence is presented. After this dismissal, the prosecutor claims, a new complaint can be filed and the arraignment on that complaint starts the 10-court-day period running anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Consideration of each party\u2019s contentions leads to one conclusion\u2014 that each is untenable and leads to results that cannot have been intended by the Legislature. Petitioner\u2019s rationale leads inexorably to an absurd procedure whereby once the 10-court-day limit has been exceeded, there is no procedure by which the magistrate can terminate the action without holding an untimely preliminary examination, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>which any holding order would be vulnerable to a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in superior court. The prosecution\u2019s position is premised on a strained reading of section 871, and would negate the policy of section 859b that prolonged prepreliminary examination incarceration should be prevented. To reach a construction of the several relevant statutes that permits the effectuation of policies outlined in each statute, it is necessary, as amici curiae contend, to reexamine <em>Peters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Petitioner argues that his arraignment on the first complaint is the correct date for computing whether he was afforded a preliminary examination within the time limits of section 859b. Petitioner\u2019s theory is that the magistrate\u2019s dismissal of the first action, after the prosecutor was unable to proceed on the tenth court day following arraignment, was not authorized by section 1385 or by section 871. Therefore, it was a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Petitioner assumes that a valid order of dismissal of one felony complaint is a prerequisite for a subsequent valid arraignment on a second complaint in order to begin a new ten-court-day period. In petitioner\u2019s scenario, his first arraignment is the only valid arraignment date from which to measure the 10-court-day period. Since his preliminary examination was held 19 court days after that arraignment, petitioner contends that he was denied a substantial right and is entitled to a dismissal of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">While the prosecution\u2019s counterattempt to find statutory authorization in section 871 for the magistrate\u2019s dismissal of the first complaint is unpersuasive (see discussion, <em>infra), </em>petitioner\u2019s chain of reasoning leads to an absurd and unacceptable mode of procedure in the disposition of felony complaints in situations where the 10-court-day limit has been violated. The premise that a magistrate cannot validly dismiss a felony complaint once the 10-court-day limit has been exceeded leads to the conclusion that the only remedy for violation of section 859b is a superior court dismissal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If a valid superior court dismissal is a prerequisite for the refiling of a complaint by the prosecution, then an untimely preliminary examination must be held for the purpose of obtaining a holding order, so that an information can be filed in superior court. That information would be vulnerable to a dismissal motion by defendant <em>(Serrato </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d 459), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>with the valid superior court dismissal order, the prosecution could finally recommence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">This procedure has obviously deleterious consequences. It requires a preliminary examination to be conducted in a situation where it is known that any holding order coming from the examination will be tainted and the information subsequently filed will be subject to dismissal. In short, a useless examination would be held, one that would ultimately have to be repeated if another attempt at prosecution were made. This would result in a waste of prosecutorial and judicial resources, as well as a disservice to witnesses who would be repeatedly called, and most ironically a denial of speedy justice to the incarcerated defendant. (See <em>Carraway </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at pp. 152-153.) As was said in a different context, \u201c[t]he intent to create such an illogical and confusing scheme cannot be attributed to the Legislature. In fact, it is a duty of the courts to construe statutes so as to avoid such an absurd result, if possible. .. . \u201d <em>(Interinsurance Exchange </em>v. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 142, 153 [23 Cal.Rptr. 592, 373 P.2d 640] and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Petitioner further contends that a discharge from custody must be made pursuant to section 871 once the 10-court-day period has been exceeded.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if this contention were correct, the language of section 859b still compels the conclusion that a preliminary examination afforded to a defendant released from custody after the expiration of the 10-court-day period is unlawful. (See <em>Irving </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d at p. 599; <em>Carraway </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at pp. 153-154.) Thus, even if section 871 were construed to compel the release of defendants who had not been afforded preliminary examinations within the statutory period, only by ignoring the plain language of section 859b could a later preliminary examination on the same complaint be held to be in compliance with the section 859b time limit. That mandatory limit is triggered by the custodial status of the defendant \u201cat the time of such arraignment or plea\u201d (\u00a7 859b) and not by the custodial status at the time of examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>In a review of petitioner\u2019s creative but unsuccessful attempts to effectuate the policies of section 859b in a manner consistent with the holding in <em>Peters, Simmons </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 15, is noteworthy. In that case, the Court of Appeal, recognizing that \u201c[w]ith the sudden advent of <em>Peters, </em>a legislative void has been created\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 27), held that the magistrate was unable after <em>Peters </em>to terminate the felony proceedings after a section 859b violation, but that an in-custody defendant could seek relief by way of petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court. Unacceptable consequences also accompany this mode of remedying section 859b violations. As was held in <em>In re Geer </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1007 [166 Cal.Rptr. 912], yet another case spawned by the <em>Peters </em>holding,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> placing a burden on a defendant to seek relief by way of writ is a procedure \u201cnot only time-consuming and costly to the defendant but one that sanctions delay and unnecessary restraint on the defendant\u2019s liberty pending a ruling thereon, and creates an unjustified addition to the judicial case load of already overburdened superior and appellate courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The district attorney argues that section 859b was not violated in the instant case because the preliminary examination was held within 10 court days of petitioner\u2019s arraignment on the second complaint. The dismissal of the first complaint was authorized, he claims, by section 871, which provided at the time of the purported dismissal that \u201c[i]f, after hearing the proofs, it appears either that no public offense has been committed or that there is not sufficient cause to believe the defendant guilty of a public offense, the magistrate must order the defendant to be discharged . ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Initially, it should be noted that the same argument has been considered and rejected in two Court of Appeal cases, <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 431; and <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 15.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>\n<em>Coleman </em>and <em>Simmons </em>held that the language of section 871, authorizing a discharge only \u201cafter hearing the proofs,\u201d could not reasonably be interpreted to apply to a situation in which the prosecution had not offered any proof.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at page 685, the Attorney General in fact \u201cconcede[d] that Penal Code section 871 does not authorize a discharge until after proofs have been heard. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Even more fatal to the prosecutor\u2019s argument than this questionable statutory interpretation is the practical consequence of its adoption. Quite simply, section 859b and its underlying policies would be rendered a dead letter. Under the prosecution\u2019s theory, section 859b does not place any effective limits upon prepreliminary examination incarceration. At the end of each 10-court-day period, a discharge could be obtained, a new complaint filed, and a new 10-court-day period would begin. Section 859b would be reduced to a requirement that certain paperwork formalities, in the form of dismissals and refilings, be completed while the defendant remains indefinitely incarcerated without a judicial determination as to whether evidence exists to establish probable cause to believe the defendant guilty of any felony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">This result is totally inconsistent with the legislative policies which are evident in section 859b. The fact that the 10-court-day deadline applies only to persons in custody at the time of their arraignment or plea, whichever is later, has been held to \u201cmanifest [] a legislative policy to eliminate the possibility that persons charged with felonies might suffer prolonged incarceration without a judicial determination of probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>cause merely because they are unable to post bond in order to gain their freedom.\u201d <em>(Serrato </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at p. 465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The history of the statute illustrates the strong legislative purpose which underlies it. Prior to 1970, there was no statutory time limit. A preliminary examination merely had to be held without unreasonable delay. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Du Bose </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 544, 550 [89 Cal. Rptr. 134].) In 1970, the Legislature added a specific time limit, providing that a defendant who was in custody at the time of his arraignment or plea had a right to a preliminary examination within 10 court days of such arraignment or plea. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1371, \u00a7 1, p. 2537.) The time limit was further strengthened in 1977, when the Legislature rewrote the statute to specify that the district attorney, as well as the defendant, had a right to a speedy preliminary examination. The 10-court-day rule could be violated \u201cin no instance\u201d where it was applicable. (Stats. 1977, ch. 1152, \u00a7 1, pp. 3698-3699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In construing statutes, this court is required to interpret them in a manner calculated to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruster </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 690, 696 [129 Cal.Rptr. 153, 548 P.2d 353, 80 A.L.R.3d 1269].) Section 859b reflects a clear legislative intention to prevent prolonged incarceration prior to a preliminary hearing. This legislative intent must be respected and, for that reason, the prosecution\u2019s contentions must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In a review of the contentions of both parties, contentions which have the <em>Peters </em>decision as their starting premise, one is led ineluctably to question the soundness of that decision. The comments of the Courts of Appeal that have attempted to grapple with the difficulties of effectuating section 859b while following <em>Peters </em>should not be ignored. (See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at p. 685 [\u201cthe dilemma into which magistrates and defendants have been placed by the <em>Peters </em>holding\u201d]; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 109 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 25 [\u201cthe procedural morass created by <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters\u201d]; Coleman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 431, 436 [172 Cal.Rptr. 135] [\u201cthe void created by <em>Peters\u201d]; Carraway </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at p. 152 <em>[\u201cPeters </em>created problems which have subsequently beset prosecutors, defendants and the courts\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In <em>Peters, </em>four members of this court decided that magistrates were not authorized to make dismissals in the furtherance of justice pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>to section 1385. The opinion stated that \u201c[o]ur sole concern now is the exact meaning of \u2018court. \u2019 ... because the authority conferred by section 1385 extends only to a court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peters, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 751.) In reliance on certain legislative recommendations formulated in 1949 by Judge Hartley Shaw, the opinion concluded that the term \u201ccourt\u201d was restricted to tribunals with trial jurisdiction and thus excluded magistrates.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Even without any reference to the disastrous impact of this decision upon the implementation of section 859b, Justice Mosk in dissent subjected the majority\u2019s opinion to a penetrating and unanswered critique. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peters, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 753-761 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) The dissent pointed out that conclusions drawn by the majority from Judge Shaw\u2019s study were not compelled and that there was no indication that the Legislature ever intended to adopt this hypertechnical interpretation of the word \u201ccourt.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 754-755.) The statutory history of the amendments to section 1385 was examined and it was found to demonstrate an intent to extend the section 1385 dismissal power to all stages of a criminal proceeding, including the initial stages which occur before a magistrate. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 755.) The dissent cited other Penal Code sections which use the term \u201ccourt\u201d in contexts which clearly indicate an intent to refer to magistrates as well. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 755-756, citing \u00a7\u00a7 1388, 1383, 859, 859a, 868 and 1002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">It was also noted that a series of decisions from this court and the Court of Appeal, stretching back over 25 years, had either assumed the existence of a magistrate\u2019s power to dismiss pursuant to section 1385 and section 1381 or used the term \u201ccourt\u201d to refer to a magistrate in the context of a section 1385 dismissal. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 756-758, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Orin </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 937 [120 Cal.Rptr. 65, 533 P.2d 193]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Uhlemann </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 662 [108 Cal.Rptr. 657, 511 P.2d 609]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Godlewski </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 677 [140 P.2d 381]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Mowry) (1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 684 (97 Cal. Rptr. 866]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtiss </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 123 [84 Cal.Rptr. 106]; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 193 [35 Cal.Rptr. 35]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>MacCagnan </em>(1954) 129 Cal.App.2d 100 [276 P.2d 679].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Other statutory and constitutional policies were also cited by the dissent in <em>Peters </em>in support of the magistrate\u2019s power of dismissal. The policies against prosecutorial harassment and forum shopping, embodied in the section 1387 bar against further prosecution after two dismissals, militated against the majority\u2019s construction. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 758-759; see also dis. opn. of Bird, C. J., <em>id., </em>at pp. 761-762.) The inevitable impact of the majority\u2019s decision upon constitutional and statutory speedy trial protection was also noted. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 759.) Thus, the correctness of <em>Peters, </em>even within the narrow analytical framework employed, was extremely questionable at the time the decision was announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">What makes the repudiation of <em>Peters </em>inescapable at this point is the impossibility of effectuating section 859b and reconciling it with section 871 if <em>Peters </em>is followed.  In that respect, we should follow, even if somewhat belatedly, a cardinal rule of statutory construction, that \u201cevery statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Stafford </em>v. <em>Realty Bond Service Corp. </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 797, 805 [249 P.2d 241]; <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>L. A. etc. Retirement Board </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 795, 799 [270 P.2d 12]; <em>Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruster, supra, </em>16 Cal. 3d at p. 696.) If <em>Peters </em>were reaffirmed, this court would be presented with the alternative of either rendering section 859b a dead letter or sanctioning a wasteful procedure in which a useless and untimely preliminary examination must be held.  Rather than sacrifice legislative policies or create absurd procedures, this court recognizes the error of <em>Peters </em>and overrules it.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Once the power of a magistrate to exercise section 1385 dismissal authority is acknowledged, the various statutes relevant to felony complaint disposition can be harmonized and their policies accommodated within a rational statutory framework. If the 10-court-day limit of section 859b is violated, a magistrate may terminate the action by dismissing it pursuant to section 1385. While the prosecution may then be recommenced by the filing of a new complaint, a limit to prepreliminary examination incarceration is established by the operation of section 1387, which would bar further prosecution if the prosecutor were again unable to proceed within the 10-court-day period against an incarcerated defendant who has not waived time.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Since the magistrate had the authority to dismiss the first complaint pursuant to section 1385, that dismissal effectively terminated action on the first complaint.

Service, pp. 399-403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The legislative amendments made five related sets of changes in the Penal Code. First, sections 1384, 1385 and 1387, which had formerly authorized dismissals in certain situations by the \u201ccourt,\u201d were amended to explicitly authorize such dismissals by a \u201cjudge or magistrate.\u201d (Stats. 1980, ch. 938, \u00a7\u00a7 6-8, No. 7 West\u2019s Cal. Legis. Service, pp. 3193-3194.) Second, the rule that two dismissals bar further prosecution on a felony charge was expanded to include dismissals pursuant to sections 859b, 861, 871 and 995, as well as sections 1381-1388. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 8, at pp. 3193-3194.) Third, section 871, which formerly authorized the magistrate to \u201cdischarge\u201d a defendant after hearing proofs which are insufficient, was amended to authorize discharge of the defendant <em>and </em>dismissal of the complaint. <em>{Id., </em>\u00a7 3, at p. 3192.) Fourth, the 10-day time limit of section 859b and the requirement in section 861 that a preliminary examination be held at one court session were both amended to compel the magistrate to dismiss the complaint and discharge the defendant if either section is violated, except in certain narrow situations. (I<em>d., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-2, at pp. 3191-3192.) The amendments to both sections provide that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the district attorney shows good cause, an in-custody defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing can be held outside the time limits\u2014but the defendant must be released from custody on his own recognizance, unless he is charged with a capital case in which the proof is evident and the presumption great. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Finally, the amendments add a new section to the Penal Code, section 871.5, providing a means by which the district attorney can appeal a magistrate\u2019s order to dismiss an action pursuant to sections 859b, 861, 871, or 1385. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 4, at p. 3192.)</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">This statutory reform has cleared up the procedural problems which followed this court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 749 [147 Cal.Rptr. 646, 581 P.2d 651], (See discussion, <em>infra.) </em>However, the new enactment was not in effect during the preliminary examination stage of the instant case, and therefore, the statutes must be construed and applied as they read at that time. (See \u00a7 3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b34-11\"><em>Pompa-Ortiz </em>additionally held that irregularities in the preliminary examination are properly attacked through petition for a pretrial extraordinary writ, although they do not require reversal after trial unless the errors involved \u201cfundamental jurisdiction\" or were prejudicial. (27 Cal.3d at p. 529.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b34-12\"><em>Serrato </em>was based upon a prior version of section 859b. That section formerly read that a defendant who was in custody at his arraignment or plea to the felony complaint had a right to a preliminary examination within 10 court days of arraignment or plea. In contrast, the statute in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s preliminary examination contained stronger language as a result of a 1977 amendment which added that \u201cin no instance\u201d could the examination be continued beyond 10 court days if the defendant was in custody at the arraignment or plea, unless the defendant personally waived time. (See Stats. 1977, ch. 1152, \u00a7 1, pp. 3698-3699.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In Peters, this court in a four-to-three decision held that two dismissals of a felony complaint by a magistrate did not bar further prosecution. Peters had obtained dismissals in two separate preliminary, examinations relating to the same alleged criminal transaction when the prosecutor in each had refused to comply with the magistrate\u2019s order to reveal the identity of a material witness. When the prosecutor then successfully obtained an indictment from a grand jury, Peters moved for dismissal of the indictment on the ground that further prosecution was barred by section 1387. Section 1387 then provided that a dismissal pursuant to that chapter of the Penal Code (pt. 2, tit. 10, ch. 8 (\u00a7\u00a7 1381-1388)) barred further prosecution if the offense were a felony and the action had been previously dismissed pursuant to that chapter. The majority in <em>Peters </em>held that further prosecution was not barred because section 1385, the only section in that chapter which could have authorized the magistrate\u2019s dismissals, authorized dismissals in furtherance of justice by a \u201ccourt,\u201d and a magistrate was not a court within the meaning of section 1385.

Petitioner contends, however, that \u201cdischarge\u201d means only a release from custody, not a dismissal of the complaint. In support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of the argument that the term \u201cdischarge\u201d does not include within it the power of dismissal, petitioner cites a consistent pattern of usage in various Penal Code sections in which the term \u201cdismissal\u201d is used in the same statute with \u201cdischarge\" to provide separately for, respectively, a termination of the action and a release of a prisoner from custody. (See \u00a7\u00a7 997, 1008, 1262, 1384.) For reasons detailed, <em>infra, </em>it is error to construe section 871 to authorize a discharge in a situation where no evidence has been heard. <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 431 [172 Cal.Rptr. 135]; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 15.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b38-6\"><em>In re Geer, supra, </em>involved a defendant who was charged with possession of cocaine after he had been previously convicted of misdemeanor marijuana possession stemming from the same arrest. Geer sought to demur to the felony complaint on the ground that he was being subjected to multiple prosecution, only to have the magistrate decide that there was no jurisdiction to hear the demurrer. The magistrate transferred the cause to the superior court for further proceedings on the demurrer. Geer petitioned the Court of Appeal for a writ to compel the magistrate to entertain and grant the demurrer. (See <em>Geer, supra, </em>at pp. 1009, 1013 for cogent criticism of the <em>Peters </em>decision.)

This statement ignores the well-known fact that, prior to <em>Peters, </em>magistrates routinely entered dismissals pursuant to section 1385 when section 859b time limits were violated. <em>Carraway </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at page 152 summarized this practice: \u201cThe system worked until 1978 [when <em>Peters </em>was decided]. On the widespread assumption that a magistrate was a \u2018court\u2019 within the meaning of section 1385, magistrates dismissed an action, pursuant to section 1385, when defendants were denied their right to a preliminary examination within 10 court days.\u201d When two dismissal orders were entered by magistrates pursuant to section 1385, section 1387 was held, prior to <em>Peters, </em>to bar further refilings. <em>(Horner </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 753.) Thus section 859b, in conjunction with sections 1385 and 1387, did operate to bar endless refilings prior to <em>Peters.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-10\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b43-8\">TOBRINER, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">I join the majority\u2019s holding that since defendant received a preliminary examination within 10 court days of his rearraignment, that hearing complied with the time limits of section 859b; thus the court below correctly denied his motion to dismiss. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s assertion that the power of a magistrate to discharge a defendant under section 871 is limited to a case in which the prosecution presents some but inadequate proof of probable cause. I believe that the magistrate\u2019s power under that section should extend also to a case, such as the present one, in which the prosecution presents no proof whatever at the preliminary hearing. Thus I would conclude that the magistrate did not err when he granted defendant\u2019s motion for a section 871 discharge after the prosecution announced its inability to proceed at the first preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>That discharge in itself suffices to authorize the prosecution to file a second complaint. Moreover, past cases demonstrate that when a defendant is rearraigned after a section 871 discharge, a new preliminary hearing is timely if held within 10 court days of the rearraignment. Consequently, it is not necessary for us to overrule <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 749 [147 Cal.Rptr. 646, 581 P.2d 651] in order to reach the conclusion that defendant received a timely preliminary hearing and thus to sustain the superior court\u2019s ruling denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Section 859b requires that \u201cthe preliminary hearing shall be held within 10 court days of the date defendant is arraigned.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As defendant recognizes, however, under section 859b the failure to hold a preliminary hearing within 10 days of a defendant\u2019s initial arraignment does not forever bar the prosecution from proceeding on the underlying charge against the defendant. In this regard, defendant explicitly acknowledges that if the original proceedings against him had properly been dismissed, the prosecution would have been free to refile the identical burglary charge and, in that event, the 10-day period of section 859b would have begun to run anew upon his rearraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Defendant claims, however, that the time period did not begin to run anew in this case because the original information was never lawfully dismissed. Defendant points out that whereas the current version of section 859b specifically authorizes the magistrate to dismiss an action for failure to provide a timely preliminary hearing, former section 859b contained no such explicit authority. Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 749, which held that a magistrate was not authorized to dismiss an action \u201cin the furtherance of justice\u201d under section 1385 as it then read,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant argues that prior to the 1980 statutory revisions a magistrate similarly lacked authority to dismiss an action for failure to comply with the 10-day limit of section 859b.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Defendant relies on Court of Appeal decisions which hold that a rearraignment following an invalid dismissal does not start the 10-day period of section 859b running anew. <em>(Carraway </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 150 [172 Cal.Rptr. 453]; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 15 [167 Cal.Rptr. 608]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 682 [158 Cal.Rptr. 899]; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 431, 436 [172 Cal.Rptr. 135] (dictum).) Defendant\u2019s contention, however, fails to accord proper significance to the fact that, when the prosecution indicated on February 14 that it was unable to proceed on the initial information, the magistrate entered an order which not only purported to \u201cdismiss\u201d that information but also to \u201cdischarge\u201d the defendant. As we shall see, even if the magistrate lacked formal authority to dismiss the information, he did have the authority to discharge the defendant, and numerous cases demonstrate that a rearraignment after such a discharge commences the period of section 859b anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Section 871, a provision that has been a part of California preliminary examination procedures for more than a century, explicitly grants a magistrate authority to discharge a defendant when the prosecution fails to present sufficient proof at the preliminary hearing to warrant binding him over for trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Seizing upon statutory language that the magistrate may discharge the defendant \u201cafter hearing the proofs,\u201d three Court of Appeal decisions declare that section 871 applies only to cases in which the prosecution presents some, but inadequate, proof, and is inapplicable when as in the present case the prosecutor presents no proof whatsoever. <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>116 Cal. App.3d 431, 437; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 15, 22; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d 682, 685.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In my opinion, however, such a restrictive interpretation of section 871 is inconsistent with the purpose of that section. Section 871 serves to protect a defendant against whom the prosecutor presents insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>evidence to warrant holding the defendant for trial. If the prosecutor presents no evidence at all, the prosecution evidence is, a fortiori, insufficient. It would be senseless to hold that in such a case the magistrate cannot discharge the defendant, but that he could do so if the prosecution merely presented a scintilla of inadequate or irrelevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Moreover, an expansive interpretation of section 871\u2014permitting the magistrate to discharge a defendant when the prosecution has not presented adequate proof at a timely hearing\u2014finds additional support from the consideration that the alternative view advanced by defendant would lead to an anomalous procedural quagmire. If a magistrate had no power to discharge a defendant when the prosecution refused to proceed within the 10-day limit of section 859b, there would be no means consistent with <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters, supra, </em>by which the magistrate could proceed with the case except by holding an untimely preliminary hearing in violation of section 859b. Furthermore, on the occasion of this untimely hearing the magistrate could not discharge the defendant unless the prosecution obliged him by going through the motions of attempting to prove probable cause, even though it would be clear that any finding of probable cause would be fatally tainted by the untimely nature of the hearing. As the Court of Appeal stated in <em>Guerrero </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(5 Civ. No. 5495): \u201cWe do not believe that the Legislature could have intended or that logic, reason or public policy requires such circumventing gamesmanship when the result can be accomplished more directly by simply recognizing that the magistrate has authority to discharge a defendant when no proof at all is presented by the prosecution upon the preliminary hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The majority opinion escapes this procedural quagmire by overruling <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters </em>and holding that a magistrate has the power to dismiss the complaint when the prosecution fails to comply with the 10-day limit of section 859. That quagmire was created, however, only by the majority\u2019s illogical conclusion that the magistrate cannot discharge the defendant under section 871 despite a total failure of proof by the prosecution. I would reject that conclusion, and hold that section 871 authorizes a magistrate to discharge a defendant whenever the prosecution fails to present sufficient proof, or any proof whatsoever, to justify holding the defendant for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Having reached this conclusion with respect to the application of section 871, resolution of the present case becomes clear. When the prosecutor announced on February 14, the date set for preliminary hearing following the first arraignment, that he was unable to proceed, the magistrate properly discharged the defendant under section 871. Numerous cases, both before and subsequent to <em>Peters, </em>indicate that following a section 871 discharge the People can file and prosecute a new complaint. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Backus </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 360, 396 [152 Cal.Rptr. 710, 590 P.2d 837]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Uhlemann </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 662, 665-666 [108 Cal.Rptr. 657, 511 P.2d 609]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Granderson </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 907, 910 [173 Cal.Rptr. 685].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">As the majority opinion acknowledges, when the People file a new complaint and rearraign the defendant, the 10-day period of section 859b runs anew from the date of rearraignment. That conclusion follows from the common and judicially endorsed practice of filing new charges following a section 871 discharge. Unless the 10-day period of section 859b began anew, the filing of a new information would be pointless; since the 10-day period from the first arraignment has already run, the magistrate would have to discharge the defendant on the new information. The absurd result would be that the prosecution, following a section 871 discharge, could not proceed by information at all, but only by indictment. The cited cases <em>(People </em>v. <em>Backus; People </em>v. <em>Uhlemann; People </em>v. Granderson), however, impose no such limitation on the prosecution\u2019s power, but permit the prosecution after a section 871 discharge to proceed either by new information or by indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The conclusion that the period of section 859b commences anew follows also by analogy to other statutes designed to guarantee a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. The 60-day period within which a defendant must be brought to trial (\u00a7 1382, subd. 2) begins anew with the filing of a new information or indictment. (See <em>Bellizzi </em>v. <em>Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 33, 38 [115 Cal.Rptr. 52, 524 P.2d 148].) The same rule applies to the 90-day period prescribed by section 1381. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Godlewski </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 677, 683 [140 P.2d 381].)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In summary, when the prosecutor announced on February 14 that he was unable to proceed, the magistrate properly ordered the discharge of the defendant. Following such a discharge, the prosecution filed a new complaint and rearraigned defendant. Since under settled practice the time limit of section 859b recommenced with the filing of the new complaint, defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing, held within 10 court days of rearraignment, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Richardson, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The petition of real party in interest for a rehearing was denied November 5, 1981. Tobriner, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The relevant paragraph of section 859b reads as follows: \u201cBoth the defendant and the People have the right to a preliminary examination at the earliest possible time, unless both waive that right or good cause for a continuance is found as provided for in Section 1050, the preliminary examination shall be held within 10 court days of the date the defendant is arraigned or pleads, whichever occurs later.\u201d The 1980 revision of section 859b did not amend this language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Section 1385, prior to the 1980 revisions, provided that \u201cThe court may, either of its own motion or upon the application of the prosecuting attorney, and in the furtherance of justice, order an action to be dismissed.\u201d <em>Peters </em>held that a magistrate was not a \u201ccourt\u201d within the meaning of this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">At this point the defendant becomes entangled in his own reasoning. At the preliminary hearing on February 29, defendant moved to dismiss the action on the theory that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the hearing was untimely under section 859b. Since he now claims that the magistrate lacked authority to dismiss the action, he cannot posit error on the magistrate\u2019s denial of that motion. Thus defendant must now argue that the superior court erred in failing to grant his motion under section 995 following the preliminary hearing even though he can point to no error by the magistrate in conducting that hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Section 871, prior to its revision in 1980, read as follows: \u201cIf, after hearing the proofs, it appears either that no public offense has been committed or that there is not sufficient cause to believe the defendant guilty of a public offense, the magistrate must order the defendant to be discharged.... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We granted a hearing in <em>Guerrero </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(5 Civ. 5495) because the Court of Appeal opinion in that case conflicted with the Court of Appeal opinion in the instant case. Pending argument, however, Guerrero died and we therefore dismissed the matter as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AZd\">The majority asserts that extending section 871 to a case in which the prosecutor announces his inability to proceed on the scheduled date for preliminary hearing will destroy the protective purpose of the 10-day limitation in section 859b. Nothing in the statutes, it points out, would prevent the prosecutor from filing charges, announcing an inability to proceed, filing new charges after the defendant is discharged, again announcing an inability to proceed, and so on indefinitely. The fact of the matter is that, until the 1980 legislation took effect, neither section 859b nor 871 protected defendant against multiple refiling of charges. A defendant\u2019s protection from such improper conduct lay in the judicial power to prevent harassment of the defendant by successive refiling of charges. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Uhlemann, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 662, 669; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 15, 25.) Defendant makes no claim of harassment in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
