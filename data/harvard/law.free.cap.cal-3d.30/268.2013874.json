(Vangas), as a route salesman. He was severely injured in a fire which occurred when he delivered a flammable gas to the premises of a customer\u2014Long Chemical, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">Bell brought suit, charging Vangas and Long Chemical, Inc., and others as joint tortfeasors with strict \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s\u201d liability as that term has been defined in California products liability law. (See <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 57, 63 [27 Cal. Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897, 13 A.L.R.3d 1049]; <em>Vandermark </em>v. <em>Ford Mo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>tor Co. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 256, 262 [37 Cal.Rptr. 896, 391 P.2d 168]; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 245, 251-254 [85 Cal.Rptr. 178, 466 P.2d 722]; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 103, 107 [137 Cal.Rptr. 797]; Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed. 1971) pp. 663-665.) He alleged they \u201cwere engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing, purchasing, producing, constructing, assembling, processing, preparing, testing, inspecting, maintaining, repairing, installing, endorsing, selling, leasing, bailing, licensing the use of, and otherwise marketing\u201d defective products that proximately caused his injuries. The trial court finding no triable issue of fact, granted Yangas\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground Bell\u2019s exclusive remedy against Yangas, his employer, was workers\u2019 compensation. Bell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Bell\u2019s pleading, when construed with the liberality required in motions brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, alleges a cause of action against both Yangas and Long Chemical on the basis of their being \u201cmanufacturers\u201d of a defective product. Factual issues bristle in the pleading papers before the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The finding of a triable issue of fact, however, does not ipso facto require reversal, for Yangas has a second, a legal, arrow in its quiver to support the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Yangas reasons: Bell was Yangas\u2019 employee, injured while engaged in his employer\u2019s work; he has already received a workers\u2019 compensation award and therefore is precluded from suing his employer for tort damages as a matter of law; workers\u2019 compensation is the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d; \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d will be opened, argues the employer, if Bell is permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>sue; there is a recognized statutory \u201ctradeoff\u201d embodied in the workers\u2019 compensation scheme and to whittle away at one side of that equation is to upset a delicately struck balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">To support its underlying thesis, Yangas points to judicial declarations to this effect: \u201c\u2018In the most explicit terms, [Labor Code] section 3600 declares the exclusive character of the employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation liability in lieu of any <em>other </em>liability to <em>any </em>person. Sections 3600 and 3601 form a complementary, unmistakable declaration of legislative policy ... ,\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Dixon </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 499, 503 [125 Cal.Rptr. 872], quoting <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 707, 713-714 [86 Cal.Rptr. 7].)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The 37-year history of California legal precedents\u2014buttressed by an analysis of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) and its constitutional foundations and underlying public policy considerations\u2014contradicts the employer\u2019s overbroad statement of the scope of the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">This court, as well as appellate courts of this state, has authored many opinions recognizing employees\u2019 rights to recover damages from the employer for injuries sustained in a jobsite setting in addition to those allowed by workers\u2019 compensation law. These decisions have not ignored the \u201cplain unambiguous\u201d language of sections 3600 and 3601. Rather, the courts have followed the lead of the California Legislature when, in 1937, it codified earlier statutory provisions in Labor Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>sections 3852 through 3860, inclusive, and gave unqualified<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> authority to the employee to sue for damages against <em>\u201cany person other than the </em>employer\u201d responsible to some degree for a worker\u2019s jobsite injury. (See <em>County of San Diego </em>v. <em>Sanfax Corp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 862, 873 [140 Cal.Rptr. 638, 568 P.2d 363].)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In 1944, this court in <em>Baugh </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>24 Cal.2d 200, 213, 214 [148 P.2d 633, 152 A.L.R. 1043], held an <em>employer's </em>(driver-lessee of an auto) <em>negligence </em>was to be imputed to the third party lessor in a suit by an employee injured in the scope of employment. The negligent employer-driver\u2019s liability for workers\u2019 compensation did not bar recovery from the third party by the injured employee. This court reasoned: \u201c[r]/ze <em>Labor Code does not purport to alter the correlative rights and liabilities of persons who do not occupy the reciprocal statuses of employer and employee. Our workmen's compensation laws were not designed to relieve one other than the employer from any liability imposed by statute or by common law. \u2018The claim of an employee for compensation does not affect his claim or right of action for all damages proximately resulting from such injury or death against any person other than the employer.\u2019 </em>(Lab. Code, \u00a7 3852; ....) The employee\u2019s right to recover against a third person is not affected by the fact that the \u2018person other than the employer\u2019 is not a stranger but has entered into a consensual legal relationship with the employer. [Citations.]\u201d (Id<em>., </em>at p. 214; italics added.) The dissenters in <em>Baugh </em>express the same fears and articulate reasons similar to the dissent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">What has come to be known as the \u201cdual capacity\u201d doctrine<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was first recognized and applied in the landmark case of <em>Duprey </em>v. <em>Shane </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 781 [249 P.2d 8], where Duprey, a nurse, sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>an industrial injury while employed by Shane, a chiropractor. Although he carried workers\u2019 compensation insurance, Shane and another chiropractor employed by him undertook personally to treat Duprey for the injury and, as it was found, did so negligently. This court upheld a recovery in an action for malpractice, reasoning that in treating Duprey, Shane was acting as an attending doctor rather than as an employer and that \u2018\u201cthe employer-doctor is a \u201cperson other than the employer\u201d within the meaning of section 3852 of the Labor Code ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 793.) This court reasoned: \u201cIt is true that the law is opposed to the creation of a dual personality, where to do so is unrealistic and purely legalistic. But where, as here, it is perfectly apparent that the person involved\u2014Dr. Shane\u2014bore towards his employee two relationships\u2014that of employer and that of a doctor\u2014there should be no hesitancy in recognizing this fact as a fact. Such a conclusion, in this case, is in precise accord with the facts and is realistic and not legalistic.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Since <em>Duprey, </em>California courts have applied the dual capacity concept in a variety of factual situations. The dual capacity doctrine has been recognized and applied where the employer in one capacity\u2014proprietor of a dairy produce business\u2014supplied defective products from a separate legal entity of which the employer was also a general partner. <em>(Dorado </em>v. <em>Knudsen Corp. </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 605, 612 [163 Cal. Rptr. 477].)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">And in <em>Shook </em>v. <em>Jacuzzi </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 978, 981-982 [129 Cal.Rptr. 496], the court recognized the dual capacity doctrine and its application to an employer guilty of faulty design or manufacture, etc., of equipment which caused the employee injuries but held the principle nonapplicable, stating: \u201cWe note, also, that products liability rules do not apply in the circumstances here shown. International created the machine exclusively for its own use in its own plant and premises. <em>It did not sell the machine or in any way place it in the stream of commerce. Rather, it was but an occasional or casual manufacturer, and thus not subject to strict liability </em>(see Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 402-A, com. f; 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, pp. 3126-3127). Its design and construction of this machine was but auxiliary to its principal manufacturing operation. As such, it does not subject International to products liability to its employees . . ..\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 981.) In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 116, 120 [123 Cal.Rptr. 812], the court in confronting a similar pleading posture, stated: \u201cPlaintiffs argue that in designing and manufacturing the spraying machine, Wallace Brothers assumed a dual role as employer and manufacturer, incurring common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>law liability in the latter capacity. At this point plaintiffs rely on <em>Duprey </em>v. Shane, 39 Cal.2d 781 . ...\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 121.) but held the demurrer properly sustained, explaining: <em>\u201cHere there is no allegation that Wallace Brothers manufactured spraying machines as a business enterprise separate from that employing plaintiff Williams. Rather, the complaint shows that the firm created the machine for use by its own employees in its own production or service operations. </em>Many entrepreneurs build and supply appliances and equipment exclusively for use in their own plants or premises. That sort of activity is integral and auxiliary to the firm\u2019s principal manufacturing or production operation.\u201d (Ib<em>id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In face of a claim of exclusivity of remedy under Labor Code section 3601, this court in <em>Unruh </em>v. <em>Truck Insurance Exchange </em>(1972) 7 Cal. 3d 616, 630 [102 Cal.Rptr. 815, 498 P.2d 1063], allowed an action at law against an <em>insurer </em>of the employer for assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress based upon deceitful conduct in investigating the workers\u2019 compensation action. The <em>Unruh </em>holding that the insurer could be sued as a \u201cperson other than the employer\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3852) was based upon the \u201cdual capacity\u201d principle enunciated in <em>Duprey </em>v. <em>Shane, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">This court most recently in referring to the <em>Unruh </em>holding said: \u201cBy analogy to <em>Duprey, </em>it was determined that the insurer in <em>Unruh </em>was \u2018invested with a dual personality\u2019 so that while it was performing its proper role within the compensation system it stood in the position of plaintiff\u2019s employer and was immune from suit, but when it stepped outside that role by committing an intentional tort, it \u2018became a person other than the employer\u2019 like the doctor in the <em>Duprey </em>case, and subject to liability at law.... <em>Unruh </em>involved the liability of the insurer as the alter ego of the employer . . . . \u201d <em>(Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 465, 476, fn. 10 [165 Cal.Rptr. 858, 612 P.2d 948].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Closest in point of factual application are the recent California appellate court cases in which the dual capacity doctrine has been applied to a defendant who occupied the dual positions of employer and manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>turer of a defective product sold to the public. In <em>Douglas </em>v. E. &amp; J. <em>Gallo Winery </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 103, 107 [137 Cal.Rptr. 797], the defendant\u2014both an employer and a manufacturer of scaffolds sold to the general public\u2014was held liable for damages in the latter role to an employee injured while using one of the scaffolds. And in <em>Moreno </em>v. <em>Leslie\u2019s Pool Mart </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 179 [167 Cal.Rptr. 747], an employer engaged in the selling of pools also was a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d-distributor to the public of swimming pool maintenance products. The Court of Appeal reversed a summary judgment in favor of the employer where the employees\u2019 suit for damages was based on strict liability for a defective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Most recently, this court <em>(D\u2019Angona </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 661, 666-667 [166 Cal.Rptr. 177, 613 P.2d 238]) applied the dual capacity concept, saying: \u201cUnderlying <em>Duprey </em>is the rationale that if any injury arises from a relationship which is distinct from that of employer and employee and invokes a different set of obligations than the employer\u2019s duties to its employee, there is no justification for shielding the employer from liability at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><em>\u201cLarson </em>declares that the decisive test of dual capacity is whether the nonemployer aspect of the employer\u2019s activity generates a different set of obligations by the employer toward the employee.\u201d This court then held: <em>\u201cIn treating plaintiffs disease the county owed her a duty separate and distinct from its duty as her employer, and this was the duty to provide medical care free of negligence\u2014the same duty that it owes to any member of the public who becomes a patient at its hospital.\u201d {Id., </em>at p. 669.) <em>These principles parallel and support Bell\u2019s precise legal and factual claim here.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">An analytic examination of the \u201cexclusivity\u201d language of the Labor Code sections and their constitutional foundation lends support to the 37 years of judicial interpretation which approve and apply the dual capacity doctrine. Workers\u2019 compensation laws in the United States and California had their genesis in the inability of the 19th century common law remedies to cope with modern industrialism and its inherent unfairness to injured workers. Implicit therefrom is the concept that workers\u2019 compensation statutes relate generally to the legal status or relationship between <em>employer and employee. </em>Perhaps best expressing the view that workers\u2019 compensation was one essentially of status is the comment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cudahy Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Parramore </em>(1923) 263 U.S. 418, 423 [68 L.Ed. 366, 369, 44 S.Ct. 153, 154, 30 A.L.R. 532]: <em>\u201cWorkmen\u2019s compensation legislation rests upon the idea of status, . .. that is, upon </em>the conception that the injured workman is entitled to compensation for an injury sustained in the service of an industry to whose operations he contributes his work as the owner contributes his capital,\u2014the one for the sake of the wages and the other for the sake of the profits. <em>The liability is based, not upon any act or omission of the employer, but upon the existence of the relationship which the employee bears to the employment because of and in the course of which he has been injured.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The essentiality of the \u201cstatus\u201d requirement is connoted in Labor Code sections 3600 and 3601 by the usage of the very terms \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201cemployee.\u201d Moreover, the importance of the existence of this status for the applicability of California workers\u2019 compensation is readily discernible from the multiplicity of cases addressing the issues of whether one was an \u201cemployee\u201d or whether the injury was one \u201creceived ... in the course of or arising out of,\u201d the injured employee\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The purpose of the Act was to compensate for losses resulting from the risks to which the fact of employment in the industry exposes the employee. Liability under the Act is based, not upon any act or omission of the employer, but upon the existence of the relationship which the employee bears to the employment and because the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment. If the duty flows solely from the employment relationship and the injury \u201carises out of\u201d and \u201cduring the course of\u201d that employment, then the recited policy considerations behind the exclusive remedy in workers\u2019 compensation mandating that the employer be immune from tort liability have viability. If, however, an additional concurrent duty flows from an \u201cextra\u201d employer status or a relationship that is distinct from that of employer-employee and invokes a different set of obligations, then a second capacity arises and the employer status is coincidental. The employer should then be treated as any third party tortfeasor, not immune from a common law tort action. <em>(D\u2019Angona </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 661, 666 [166 Cal.Rptr. 177, 613 P.2d 238]; Note (1979) 12 Ind.L.Rev. 553, 561; see also <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>v. <em>Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc. </em>(1975) 273 Ore. 162 [539 P.2d 1065, 1067].) To extend, to enlarge, the limitation on the injured employees\u2019 remedy beyond the purposes of the Act is to violate the spirit of the workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>compensation law. A failure to recognize the dual capacity doctrine in this case would accomplish such a wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Workers\u2019 compensation laws were adopted long before a manufacturer\u2019s strict liability in tort\u2014the <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc., supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 57, doctrine\u2014came into vogue. Thus, there is no justification whatsoever for finding any legislative intent to adopt a scheme in 1911-1917 that would withhold from an employee the protection that <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc., </em>now requires \u201cmanufacturers\u201d provide every member of the using public. The \u201chistoric tradeoff\u201d did not encompass the giving up of rights not yet in being.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Former article XX, section 21 of the California Constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> authorized the Legislature to enact laws to create and enforce liability for compensation to be paid by employers for injuries to employees. It did not, it does not now, expressly or by implication place any limitation on the amount to be recovered for injuries from parties other than the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">To accept Yangas\u2019 construction and application of these statutes would require this court to hold that employees are not entitled to maintain a products liability action against a manufacturer in circumstances where all other users of defective products could maintain such an action. By interpreting the workers\u2019 compensation law in harmony with product liability doctrine, a manufacturer will not escape liability to its employees for defective products where there would be liability to any other injured person. <em>(Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1979) 23 </em>Cal.3d 197, 207 [152 Cal.Rptr. 345, 589 P.2d 853].) As it was pithily put by the Ohio Appeals Court in <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>(1976) 49 Ohio App.2d 279 [3 Ohio Ops.3d 333, 361 N.E.2d 492, 496]: \u201cIt was only a matter of circumstance that the tire on the truck in which the plaintiff was riding was a Uniroyal [the employer\u2019s] tire rather than a Sears, Goodyear or Goodrich.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The trial court refused Bell the protection granted to every other user of manufactured products. Such result runs counter to the long term trend of California tort law and disrupts accepted loss distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>systems.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The application of this 37-year precedent to the complaint is rooted in sound public policy and is justified by societal needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The imperative of public safety, the deterrence of manufacture of shoddy products, was a powerful force motivating the establishment of product liability law. The manufacturer is held strictly liable because it \u201cis in a peculiarly strategic position to promote the safety of [its] products .... [T]he pressure of strict liability could scarcely be exerted at a better point if accident prevention is to be furthered by tort law.\u201d (James, <em>General Products\u2014Should Manufacturers Be Liable Without </em>Negligence? (1957) 24 Tenn.L.Rev. 923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Yangas, as a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d who sells its products to the public, continues to be strictly liable to nonemployee consumers; there is naught to commend a rule of the law which would encourage manufacturers to do less in the area of product safety if by chance the product is to be used by their own employees. The inherent deterrent aspect of a manufacturer\u2019s strict liability law is thwarted if the manufacturer has no responsibility to its employees (or the third party joint tortfeasors) beyond a workers\u2019 compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The obligations Yangas owed as a manufacturer-designer-seller of equipment to all users was entirely independent of those obligations imposed upon it as an employer. (Cf. 2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 72.80.) \u201cManufacturer\u201d Yangas owed a duty to <em>all </em>foreseeable users of its product not to introduce a defective product into the stream of commerce. (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 402A.) Neither law nor right reason excludes employees of a manufacturer from this broad rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The public policy goals underlying product liability doctrine should not be subverted by the mere fortuitous circumstance that the injured individual was an employee of the manufacturer whose product caused the injury. If the injured individual had not been an employee, he would have had a cause of action against the defendant. To deny Bell such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>cause of action because he is an employee, gives the employer more protection than envisioned by the 1911 Act. In effect, the trial court rule would permit a manufacturer to test new products, utilizing his employees, and limit his liability from resulting injuries from a defective product to workers\u2019 compensation remedies. This is unsound social engineering grossly unfair to the worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">One final thought germane to societal concerns with the rule selected: A most perceptive scholar has criticized those decisions refusing to apply the dual capacity rule, saying: \u201c[This view] considers the dual capacity doctrine to be antagonistic to the perpetuation of the workmen\u2019s compensation scheme. This conclusion may not necessarily be warranted because, under both workmen\u2019s compensation or a consumer rights theory, the ultimate goal is to reduce the burden of recovery faced by the employee or consumer, and to shift any loss onto the industry that created the initial risk of injury. By rejecting the dual capacity doctrine, the employer is permitted to escape full liability for the defective manufacture of goods simply by using those goods in his own plant. . .. The employee, an intended and foreseeable user, must, therefore, bear the full loss under the consumer loss-disbursement mechanism, while a non-employee party can force that loss onto the manufacturer. Thus, a smaller loss will usually be shifted onto the industry through the worker loss-disbursement mechanism of workman\u2019s compensation than that which would be shifted if the consumer loss-disbursement mechanism were to be invoked.\u201d (Note, <em>Dual Capacity Doctrine: Third-Party Liability of Employer-Manufacturer in Products Liability Litigation </em>(1979) <em>supra, </em>12 Ind.L.Rev. 553, 580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">California\u2019s historic and current preeminence in applying the dual capacity doctrine must be contrasted with prevailing\u2014weight of authority\u2014views found in sister states. Without doubt, if Bell\u2019s case is to be decided by an arithmetic head count of jurisdictions that have considered the issue, the prevailing weight of authority would hold workers\u2019 compensation to be the exclusive remedy. (See <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.3d at p. 110, fn. 5(b); 2A Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 72.80, and 1979 supp.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>A close examination of decisions which refuse to apply the dual capacity doctrine demonstrates that these decisions come from jurisdictions that (1) have wide variants in statutory \u201cexclusivity\u201d language, (2) still adhere to our abandoned contributory negligence/assumption of risk rules, (3) stubbornly refuse to allow actions against a third party tortfeasor, and (4) flatly refuse to apply equitable indemnity or contribution principles in jobsite injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Perhaps the clearest, most authoritative (outside California) exposition of the dual capacity concept is to be found in the United States Supreme Court decision of <em>Reed </em>v. <em>The Yaka </em>[1963] (373 U.S. 410 [10 L.Ed.2d 448, 83 S.Ct. 1349]). There plaintiff\u2019s employer, a stevedoring company, leased a ship under a bareboat charter; the plaintiff, a longshoreman, was injured while loading the vessel. Although the plaintiff was entitled to his compensation benefits, he brought an action against his employer as charterer alleging unseaworthiness of the vessel. The employer defended on the basis of the exclusive remedy provision in the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Without using the dual-capacity terminology, the court\u2019s holding was consistent with the reasoning behind the dual-capacity theory. The employer was liable to his employee <em>as a bareboat charterer </em>for injuries arising from the unseaworthiness of the chartered vessel. The defendant had the duty as the bareboat charterer to provide the employee a seaworthy vessel. That duty was \u201ctraditional, absolute and nondelegable\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 415 [10 L.Ed.2d at p. 452]) and could not be avoided by the exclusive remedy provision of the the Longshoremen\u2019s Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In so finding, the Supreme Court commented, at page 415 [10 L.Ed.2d at pages 452-453]: <em>\u201c[0\\nly blind adherence to the superficial meaning of a statute could prompt us to ignore the fact that Pan-Atlantic was not only an employer of longshoremen but was also a bareboat charterer and operator of a ship and, as such, was charged with the traditional, absolute, and nondelegable obligation of seaworthiness which it should not be permitted to avoid </em>.... We think it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>would produce a harsh and incongruous result, one out of keeping with the dominant intent of Congress to help longshoremen, to distinguish between liability to longshoremen injured under precisely the same circumstances because some draw their pay directly from a shipowner and others from a stevedoring company doing the ship\u2019s service. <em>Petitioner\u2019s need for protection from unseaworthiness was neither more nor less than that of a longshoreman working for a stevedoring </em>company.\u201d (Italics added; fn. omitted.) The dissent in <em>Reed </em>(parallelling Yangas\u2019 argument) decries \u201cthe violence done to the statutory scheme\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 416 [10 L.Ed.2d at p. 453]) of exclusiveness of liability under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 905).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aec\">In sum, Bell\u2019s complaint discloses injuries arising from two concurrent causes: the employment relation (for which Yangas is liable under workers\u2019 compensation law) coinciding with a defective product (for which Yangas is here sought to be held liable as the manufacturer).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The principle enunciated and approved by this court from <em>Duprey, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d 781, to <em>D\u2019Amgona, supra, </em>27 Cal. 3d 661, compels the conclusion that a coincidental employment relationship will not shield an employer from a common law liability where the concurrent cause of the injury is attributable to the employer\u2019s separate and distinct relationship to the employee and which invokes a different set of obligations than the employer\u2019s duties to its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">A refusal to apply the \u201cdual capacity\u201d principles where facts fulfilling these conditions are posited by the complaint would constitute a specie of legal wrong in the form of an unjustified abandonment of long established, well reasoned precedent. Such refusal would as well inflict \u201ca harsh and incongruous result\u201d in the form of an inadequate recovery for injuries received.

While an uncontradicted declaration submitted in support of Yangas\u2019 motion adequately refutes any suggestion that Yangas was in the business of manufacturing or marketing the delivery truck driven by Bell, the complaint also refers to numerous other allegedly defective products which proximately caused Bell\u2019s injuries. While the declaration asserts such products were not manufactured by Yangas, it does not similarly deny any involvement in marketing or distribution which may be sufficient to give rise to strict liability for a defective product.

Since a defendant moving for summary judgment has the burden of negating every alternative theory of liability presented by the pleadings (see, e.g., <em>Pearl </em>v. <em>Shore </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 608, 613 [95 Cal.Rptr. 157]; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 690, 693 [86 Cal.Rptr. 705]), the Yangas declaration is insufficient to support the granting of summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Labor Code section 3600, excluding certain exceptions not relevant herein, provides: \u201cLiability for the compensation provided by this division, <em>in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person ... shall, without regard to negligence, exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his employees arising out of and in the course of the employment </em>... in those cases where the following conditions of compensation concur:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">it</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u201c(b) Where, at the time of injury, <em>the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his employment </em>and is acting within the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">\u201c(c) <em>Where the injury is proximately caused by the employment, either with or without negligence.\" </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">And Labor Code section 3601, insofar as relevant here, provides: \u201c(a) Where the conditions of compensation exist, the right to recover such compensation, pursuant to the provisions of this division is ... the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against the employer or against any other employee of the employer acting within the scope of his employment____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The employees\u2019 right to sue \u201csome other person than the employer\u201d for damages for a jobsite injury was first granted by statute in 1917.

The majority holds, contrary to both the great weight of authority and the express language of controlling California statutes, that an employer is liable in tort to any employee injured in the course of his employment as a result of defective products or equipment manufactured by the employer. In my view, the workers\u2019 compensation laws afford the sole and exclusive remedy to the employee against his employer in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Employer Yangas\u2019 contention that employee Bell\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation remedy is exclusive is statutorily founded. The Legislature has been very clear. Labor Code section 3600 provides: \u201cLiability for the compensation provided by this division, [is] <em>in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person </em>(Italics added.) If this statutory expression is not sufficiently specific, the following section, 3601, subdivision (a), recites that \u201c <em>Where the conditions of compensation exist, </em>the right to recover such compensation, pursuant to the provisions of this division is, ... <em>the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against the employer </em>....\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The majority opinion suggests that the employment relationship in this case was \u201c\u2018only a matter of circumstance.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 278.) With due respect, this suggestion of a lack of causal relationship between Bell\u2019s injury and his employment is, frankly, absurd. As the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>opinion itself states in its opening paragraph, \u201cAppellant William Bell was employed by respondent Industrial Vangas, Inc., as a route salesman. He was severely injured in a fire <em>which occurred when he delivered a flammable gas to the premises of a customer </em>. . . . \u201d (Italics added.) Indeed, it is uncontradicted that Bell has <em>already successfully pursued to finality </em>his workers\u2019 compensation remedy against Vangas, which requires as a prerequisite that the injury occur during the course of employment. Thus, I find it beyond reasonable dispute that, in the words of Labor Code section 3601, subdivision (a), \u201cthe conditions of compensation exist,\u201d and, accordingly, \u201cthe right to recover such compensation ... is the <em>exclusive remedy .. </em>. against the employer.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Bell never has contended that his injury was nonindustrial. Rather, having previously recovered full workers\u2019 compensation, he sought an <em>additional </em>remedy based on the theory that because Yangas was acting in a \u201cdual capacity\u201d as both manufacturer and employer, a strict liability tort recovery is also available to him. The majority permits it. I would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The so-called \u201cdual capacity\u201d doctrine originated in <em>Duprey </em>v. <em>Shane </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 781 [249 P.2d 8], wherein we announced a limited exception to the exclusive remedy rule. In <em>Duprey, </em>a nurse, injured in a previous work-related accident, sued her employer-physician for medical malpractice committed during the course of treating her injuries. We sustained the action, concluding that once an employer assumes the role of physician in treating the industrial injury, \u201cthe employer-doctor is a \u2018person other than the employer\u2019 within the meaning of section 3852 of the Labor Code [authorizing tort recovery by the injured employee] .... In treating the injury Dr. Shane did not do so because of the employer-employee relationship, but ... as an attending doctor, and his relationship to [plaintiff] was that of doctor and patient.\u201d (39 Cal.2d at p. 793; for more recent considerations of the dual capacity doctrine see <em>D\u2019Angona </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1980) 27 Cal. 3d 661, 666-668 [166 Cal.Rptr. 177, 613 P.2d 238] [employer-hospital liable for aggravating industrial disease]; <em>Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 465, 473-478 [165 Cal.Rptr. 858, 612 P.2d 948], and fns. 8, 10 [employer liable for aggravation of injury caused by fraudulent concealment of occupational disease]; see generally 2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1976) \u00a7 72.80, p. 14-112 and Supp.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>In his present action, Bell purports to sue his employer in its several capacities referable to the equipment or products which caused his injuries. The complaint alleges a variety of roles assumed by Yangas, including \u201cdesigning, manufacturing, purchasing, producing, constructing, assembling, processing, testing, inspecting, maintaining, repairing, installing, endorsing, selling, leasing, bailing, licensing the use of, and otherwise marketing\u201d its products. Because the description of these various activities adds nothing of legal significance to the complaint, for simplicity I consider Yangas as a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of the allegedly defective equipment. In the majority\u2019s view, Bell may sue Yangas in tort in its capacity as manufacturer of the vehicle, apart from its role as Bell\u2019s employer, based upon its breach of a general duty of care owed to all members of the public who purchase or use its products.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Most employers, however, assume additional roles or responsibilities which create particularized duties of care toward the public generally, whether as landowners, retailers, manufacturers, designers or sellers. To hold that an employee may sue in tort whenever an employer breaches such general duties owed to the public at large would, in my view, significantly affect the operation of the workers\u2019 compensation system and substantially alter the carefully constructed and fundamental balance between the rights and interests of employees and employers which is the cornerstone of workers\u2019 compensation laws. To preserve that balance, the dual capacity doctrine should be limited to those situations in which \u201cthe nonemployer aspect of the employer\u2019s activity generates a different set of obligations by the employer toward the employee.\u201d <em>(D\u2019Angona, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 667; see 2A Larson, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 14-117, 14-118.) The strict liability imposed by law upon a manufacturer (under products liability law) is no greater than that which is fastened upon the employer (under workers\u2019 compensation law). While the remedies differ, common law in the one instance and statutory in the other, Yangas\u2019 obligations toward Bell were coequal and coextensive in either capacity. Moreover, in the present case, Yangas\u2019 roles as manufacturer and employer were assumed concurrently; no <em>change </em>in capacity occurred. There was no point during Bell\u2019s use of the equipment that he ceased to be an employee. In <em>Duprey, </em>on the other hand, the defendant stepped out of his general role as employer into a special capacity as physician. The <em>Duprey </em>injury did not occur during the course of her employment by Dr. Shane, but rather during his medical treatment of her as his patient. The legal obligations which Dr. Shane owed to Duprey as his patient were entirely different from those which he owed her as his employee. This is the precise point which we stressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>last year in <em>D\u2019Angona </em>when we said: \u201cThe relationship between a county which operates a public hospital and its patients clearly involves a different set of obligations from the hospital\u2019s obligations toward its employees.\u201d (P. 667 of 27 Cal.3d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">A substantial majority of cases which have considered the issue, including those of our California appellate courts, fully agrees with the foregoing analysis. Thus, in <em>Shook </em>v. <em>Jacuzzi </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 978 [129 Cal.Rptr. 496], the plaintiff-employee was injured while operating a machine used to manufacture automobile wheels. He attempted to recover tort damages from his employer based upon its allegedly separate capacity as \u201cdesigner-manufacturer\u201d of the machine. The <em>Shook </em>court observed that our <em>Duprey </em>decision was \u201creadily distinguishable,\u201d stating that \u201cIn undertaking to treat the injured nurse [in <em>Duprey], </em>Dr. Shane assumed a role distinct in both time and nature from that of employer. Attempts to extend the rule of <em>Duprey </em>have been repeatedly rejected [citations].\u201d (P. 980.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Similarly, in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 116 [123 Cal.Rptr. 812], plaintiff-employee sought to impose products liability upon his employer on the theory that it designed, manufactured and supplied a defective spraying machine for use by its employees, thereby assuming a dual role as employer and manufacturer. The court properly rejected this theory, stating that \u201cThe analogy to <em>Duprey </em>is faint and unpersuasive. There the doctor-employer stepped outside his role as employer, elected to treat the injured employee as a doctor and subjected himself to malpractice liability. ... [\u00b6] Here there is no allegation that [employer] manufactured spraying machines as a business enterprise separate from that employing plaintiff . ... \u201d (P. 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The holdings in <em>Shook </em>and <em>Williams </em>are mirrored in many like decisions in our sister states.

The <em>Douglas </em>court, relying upon the <em>Duprey </em>dual capacity doctrine, rationalized its holding as follows: \u201cOur society is pluralistic. The same person (real or artificial) from time to time obviously adopts many <em>roles </em>in relationship with others.... [\u00b6] An employer <em>qua </em>employer enjoys the cloak of immunity weaved by the workers\u2019 compensation law. But when an employer engages in the dual capacity of manufacturer of a product <em>for sale to the </em>public, the employer assumes all of the duties and liabilities of such manufacturer.\u201d (P. 110, italics added; see also <em>Moreno </em>v. <em>Leslie\u2019s Pool Mart </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 179, 182 [167 Cal.Rptr. 747]; <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Uniroyal, Inc. </em>(1976) 49 Ohio App.2d 279 [3 Ohio Ops.3d 333, 361 N.E.2d 492, 495-496], adopting a similar rule.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Those commentators most frequently recognized in the field have rejected the majority\u2019s reasoning. Thus, Professor Larson, a respected authority in the workers\u2019 compensation area, is highly critical of both <em>Douglas </em>and <em>Mercer, </em>characterizing them as \u201cunsound applications of the dual-capacity concept. <em>They overlook the simple fact that the use of the product was a routine and integral part of the employment. </em>Dual capacity requires a distinct separate legal <em>persona, </em>not just a separate theory of liability of the same legal person.\u201d (2A Larson, <em>supra </em>(1981 supp.) p\u201e 193, italics added.) In the ease before us, use of the product in question was a \u201croutine and integral part of\u2019 Bell\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">I am convinced that the majority\u2019s adoption of the <em>Douglas </em>rule will drive a substantial wedge into the exclusivity principle which has characterized the workers\u2019 compensation laws from their very inception. If an employer is to be held civilly liable to injured workers in the employer\u2019s capacity as a \u201cmanufacturer,\u201d what compelling reason can exist for denying similar liability for injuries attributable to the employer\u2019s other relationships including his status as \u201clandowner,\u201d \u201cmotor vehicle operator,\u201d or \u201ccafeteria proprietor\u201d? Yet employers in our \u201cpluralistic society\u201d frequently assume multiple roles in the course of their ordinary business pursuits. For over 60 years, however, so long as the injury oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>curs while the employee is acting in the course of his employment, the employer\u2019s liability properly has been statutorily limited to the payment of workers\u2019 compensation in each of these situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The majority opinion, in extended fashion, emphasizes the social policies favoring adequate recovery by injured employees such as Bell. There is no reason to believe that the Legislature is insensitive to these policies. Yet, the majority wholly fails to explain how we properly may ignore the plain, specific, unambiguous language appearing in both sections 3600 and 3601, statutorily mandating the exclusive remedy rule. It is not our function to tinker with these laws for the purpose of \u201cimproving\u201d them. Moreover, if policy considerations were relevant here, surely the exclusivity rule is founded upon a sound policy of \u201creciprocal concessions,\u201d a policy which has been recognized historically as underlying the entire workers\u2019 compensation scheme. Unlike the ordinary consumer or user of manufactured goods, the employee-user under the workers\u2019 compensation laws is given an assured protection from impairment of earning capacity, and payment of medical expenses, without regard to any principles of comparative fault (see <em>Daly </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 725 [144 Cal.Rptr. 380, 575 P.2d 1162]) or proof of defect (see <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lull Engineering Co. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 413 [143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1]) which are applicable in strict liability actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Thus, in consideration for such concessions, employer misconduct much more egregious than that alleged here remains compensable only through a workers\u2019 compensation remedy. (See, e.g., <em>Wright </em>v. <em>FMC Corp. </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d <em>777, </em>779 [146 Cal.Rptr. 740] [employer\u2019s concealment of dangers inherent in work materials]; see also <em>Johns-Manville Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 465, 474-475.) As we recently explained in <em>Johns-Manville, </em>any broad exceptions to the exclusive remedy rule \u201cwould undermine the underlying premise upon which the workers\u2019 compensation system is based. That system balances the advantage to the employer of immunity from liability at law against the detriment of relatively swift and certain compensation payments. Conversely, while the employee receives expeditious compensation, he surrenders his right to a potentially larger recovery in a common law action for the negligence or willful misconduct of his employer.\u201d (P. 474.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">There can be no question but that this delicate balance, carefully conceived and preserved for many years by the Legislature, is signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>cantly altered and disturbed when we hold that each of the thousands of employers in this state engaged in manufacturing for ultimate sale to the public loses the statutory immunity to any employee who is injured by defects in the goods or products manufactured. The employee has his historic remedy created by a well-reasoned \u201ctrade-off\u201d of the benefits which we described in <em>Johns-Manville. </em>From the standpoint of sound public policy, no reason exists for judicially singling out for such special treatment employers engaged in manufacturing operations. If sections 3600 and 3601 are to be abolished, and the employee\u2019s remedy is no longer to be \u201cexclusive,\u201d it is the authors of the sections, the Legislature, and not the courts, which should do the erasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied December 30, 1981. Kaus, J., did not participate therein. Richardson, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
