(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602; Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 484, subd. (a), 488, 490.5, subd. (a).) In a consolidated proceeding the juvenile court sustained both petitions. Deborah appeals, asserting that physical evidence and confessions obtained by store security guards should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">One charge involves shoplifting at an Orbach\u2019s store on July 12, 1979. At the adjudication-and-suppression hearing Joseph McGinnis, plainclothes security agent, testified that several times he saw Deborah palm costume jewelry from a display counter and hide it in her pocket. He followed her when with a friend she left the store without paying. McGinnis and his partner stopped her, took her to the store\u2019s security office, and placed her under citizen\u2019s arrest. Without giving a <em>Miranda </em>warning he asked her why she did it. She replied that her friend had told her it was easy to steal, so she thought she would. Over counsel\u2019s objection the jewelry and confession were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>A second charge alleged that on or about October 22, 1979, she stole clothing from a Broadway store. Bernadette Laskowski, plainclothes security agent, testified that Deborah aroused suspicion because she was carrying a \u201clarge old plastic bag\u201d and \u201cwalking around, looking around quite a bit.\u201d She then stopped in the Junior World department, took several items off the racks, and went into a fitting room.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The fitting rooms adjoined a narrow aisle and apparently had doors three feet high, with two-foot gaps above the floor and below the ceiling. Laskowski looked over or under the door and saw Deborah put the merchandise in her plastic bag or purse. As Deborah left the store without paying, Laskowski followed, detained her, and took her to the store\u2019s security office. While Laskowski was making out a \u201cpolice report\u201d Deborah volunteered that she was sorry and that her sister and brother told her she should do it to help pay the rent. Laskowski\u2019s eyewitness testimony and Deborah\u2019s statement were admitted over objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><em>Miranda </em>Warning</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Counsel urges that the finding as to the Orbach\u2019s theft is reversible per se because, before Deborah confessed to the detective, she was not advised as to her rights pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974] (rehg. den., 385 U.S. 890 [17 L.Ed.2d 121, 87 S.Ct. 11]).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Does <em>Miranda </em>govern custodial investigations by store detectives? That case concerned \u201cthe police\u201d and \u201cthe authorities.\u201d California courts have limited its requirements (and those of the predecessor case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361], cert. den., 381 U.S. 937 and 946 [14 L.Ed.2d 702 and 710, 85 S.Ct. 1765]), to \u201claw enforcement officials,\u201d their agents, and agents of the court, while the suspect is in official custody. <em>(In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 527 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Polk </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 443, 449 [47 Cal.Rptr. 1, 406 P.2d 641], cert. den.

Absent evidence of complicity on the part of law enforcement officials, the admissions or statements of a defendant to a private citizen infringe no constitutional guarantees. [Citations.] ...\u2019\u201d <em>(Eric J., supra, </em>at p. 527, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Mangiefico </em>(1972) 25 Cal. App.3d 1041, 1049 [102 Cal.Rptr. 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Nongovernmental security employees that act without police cooperation have been regarded as private citizens unaffected by <em>Miranda. (People </em>v. <em>Payne </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 361, 365 [81 Cal.Rptr. 635]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crabtree </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 789, 790 [49 Cal.Rptr. 285]; but cf. <em>In re Victor F. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 673, 680-681 [169 Cal.Rptr. 455].)  Police complicity in the usual sense is not at issue in this case. There is no evidence that McGinnis acted under any arrangement with the authorities, at their direction, or with their approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Counsel cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Zelinski </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 357 [155 Cal.Rptr. 575, 594 P.2d 1000] for the proposition that security guards who routinely use state-conferred powers of detention and arrest act under color of law as police agents. Therefore, it is argued, confessions they extract in custodial settings without <em>Miranda </em>protections must be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\"><em>Zelinski, </em>however, avoided holding that security guards are police surrogates for all juridical purposes. There, store detectives trespassed by exceeding the limited powers of private search granted by statute. We stressed that private security personnel \u201care not police\u201d and have only the powers and privileges of other private persons, except as provided by statute. (P. 365.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Nonetheless we saw state involvement where security personnel, acting routinely in aid of law enforcement, exceeded the narrow, state-conferred citizen\u2019s search privilege; and exclusion seemed an appropriate and effective way to deter such unlawful invasions within the growing private-security sector. (Pp. 366-368.) To hold otherwise, we said, would penalize police for wrongful searches but immunize those of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>private security guards, when the conduct was illegal and deterrable in both situations. (P. 368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><em>Zelinski</em>'s \u201ccolor of law\u201d analysis responded to arguments that illegal searches by private guards are not state action and thus are unaffected by the Fourth Amendment and article I, section 13 of the California Constitution. (Pp. 366-367.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the mere asking of questions is not illegal. And guarantees against self-incrimination do not turn solely on whether interrogators are state agents. Rather, they prevent the state from using involuntary answers as evidence (see <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 368, 385-386 [12 L.Ed.2d 908, 920-921, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 1 A.L.R.3d 1205]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Varnum </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 808, 812-813 [59 Cal.Rptr. 108, 427 P.2d 772], app. dism. and cert. den. (1968) 390 U.S. 529 [20 L.Ed.2d 86, 88 S.Ct. 1208]) whether obtained by government or private conduct <em>(People </em>v. <em>Haydel </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 190, 197 [115 CaI.Rptr. 394, 524 P.2d 866]). Statements obtained without manifest physical or psychological coercion usually are deemed voluntary, though defendant never knew or waived his rights to silence and counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">For policy reasons <em>Miranda </em>established a stricter definition of voluntariness when answers are obtained in an \u201cofficial interrogation\u201d of a suspect in police custody by \u201claw enforcement officials\u201d or with their complicity. (See <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>451 U.S. at pp. 466-469 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 371-373]; <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 444 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 706]; <em>Eric J., supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 527.) That private security guards sometimes act under color of law when they conduct illegal searches neither makes them \u201claw enforcement officials\u201d nor establishes the complicity of those officials for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>It does not render their detention of shoplifting suspects \u201cpolice custody\u201d nor their questioning \u201cofficial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\"><em>Miranda </em>responded to the history of force, duress, and lengthy, incommunicado interrogation by some law enforcement agencies. (384 U.S. at pp. 444-456 [16 L.Ed.2d at pp. 706-713].) That abuse seems to have continued, at least in part. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Pettingill, supra, </em>21 Cal. 3d 231, 242-243.) The presence of overt police coercion is not, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>course, a prerequisite to application of <em>Miranda. </em>Courts recognize that nearly all police detention creates an atmosphere of compulsion. (Cf. <em>Orozco </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 324, 326-327 [22 L.Ed.2d 311, 314-315, 89 S.Ct. 1095]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arnold, supra, 66 </em>Cal.2d 438, 447-448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We think that routine detention and questioning by plainclothes store detectives present a substantially different situation. Unless they represent themselves as police they do not enjoy the psychological advantage of official authority, a major tool of coercion. Moreover, there appears little evidence of abusive techniques by store detectives similar to those that <em>Miranda </em>charged against the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Under California statutes store employees have only limited powers of detention. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 490.5, subd. (e)(1) [merchant may detain for reasonable time and investigation on probable cause]; \u00a7 847 [arresting citizen must deliver suspect to police or magistrate without unnecessary delay].) There is evidence that retailers exercise restraint; more than half the store representatives contacted in a national study said that store policy was to release most shoplifters without police involvement. <em>(Merchants\u2019 Responses to Shoplifting: An Empirical Study </em>(1976) 28 Stan.L.Rev. 589, 604 (hereafter <em>Merchants\u2019 Responses).)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, though detentions by store personnel may at times seem frightening, the \u201ccompelling atmosphere\u201d that <em>Miranda </em>deemed inherent in a custodial interrogation by police and other government personnel appears diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\"><em>Miranda </em>criticized police preference for confessions over independent investigation. (384 U.S. at pp. 447-448 [16 L.Ed.2d at pp. 708-709].) But citizens may not arrest for misdemeanors not committed in their presence. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 837, subd. 1.) And the study referred to above indicated that stores discourage detention and arrest of suspects not actually seen by store employees leaving the premises with unbought merchandise. <em>(Merchants\u2019 Responses, supra, </em>28 Stan.L.Rev. at pp. 598-599.)  That procedure was followed here. Before detaining Deborah, McGinnis saw her conceal several items, and then watched until she left the store without paying.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Thus it appears that shoplifting convictions routinely may depend more on eyewitness testimony and physical evidence than on the suspect\u2019s inculpatory statements. Store detectives\u2019 incentive to extract confessions is diminished even when the basic intent is to prosecute. Should psychological or physical abuse produce a confession, the exclusionary remedy is of course available. <em>(Haydel, </em>supra, 12 Cal. 3d at p. 197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Jurisdictions where the question now before us has arisen, including those that give to merchants the right to detain and question suspected shoplifters, generally have declined to extend <em>Miranda </em>to privately employed personnel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We concur with those rulings.  We hold that McGinnis, a plainclothes private detective, was not required to follow <em>Miranda </em>procedures before eliciting incriminating statements for use against Deborah. We therefore uphold the trial court order sustaining the Orbach\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Fitting-room Surveillance</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Deborah also contends that the second petition, charging theft from a Broadway store, cannot be sustained. She urges that by watching her in the Broadway fitting room from the adjacent corridor, Laskowski, the store security guard, searched without probable cause, unconstitutionally. She seeks suppression of the fruits of Laskowski\u2019s observations, including the stolen merchandise subsequently recovered outside the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">We find it unnecessary to decide whether prearrest searches by private-store detectives raise constitutional issues or whether the exclusionary rule can be applied to evidence obtained in a search of that kind. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Zelinski, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 357, 365-368; <em>People </em>v. <em>Triggs </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 884, 891-892 [106 Cal.Rptr. 408, 506 P.2d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>232], disapproved on other grounds, <em>People </em>v. <em>Lilienthal </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 891, 896 [150 Cal.Rptr. 910, 587 P.2d 706].) The trial court apparently ruled that no search occurred here because Laskowski\u2019s observations did not infringe Deborah\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record provides substantial, factual support for that determination. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rios </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 351, 357 [128 Cal.Rptr. 5, 546 P.2d 293]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 645, 647, 649-650 [111 Cal.Rptr. 565, 517 P.2d 829]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawler </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 156, 160 [107 Cal.Rptr. 13, 507 P.2d 621].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Law enforcement officials make a search within the purview of constitutional prohibitions only when they jeopardize an individual\u2019s expectation of privacy that society has recognized as justified. There is no reasonable expectation with regard to objects or events in plain view from a public place where the observer has a right to be. <em>(Lorenzana </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 626, 634 [108 Cal.Rptr. 585, 511 P.2d 33]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 84 [81 Cal.Rptr. 457, 460 P.2d 129]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lovelace </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 541, 548 [172 Cal.Rptr. 65]; see <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347, 351-353 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 581-583, 88 S.Ct. 507].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The record indicates that the fitting rooms at the Broadway store open off a three-foot-wide corridor. Each is about four by five feet square in area and has a door about three feet high from bottom edge to top edge, with approximately two-foot gaps above and below. Thus the door\u2019s design allows substantial portions of the small room\u2019s interior to be seen from the corridor.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">When Laskowski began to suspect Deborah she followed her into the corridor, watching as she entered a fitting room and closed the door. On cross-examination she testified that Deborah hung her purse or shopping bag on the doorknob, then placed it on the floor and began stuffing it with clothing taken from the rack. Counsel pressed for an admission that Laskowski had seen this by walking up to the door, then stretching or bending to peer over or under it. Though susceptible to varying interpretations, Laskowski\u2019s answers sustain the inference that once placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>on the floor the purse or bag was visible to a person standing normally in the corridor and was seen from such a position.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">It appears that this was the dispositive basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Seeking suppression, Deborah\u2019s counsel argued that \u201c[t]here is an expectation of privacy when one enters into a dressing room and closes the dressing room because the courts have held that that person upon entering the dressing room has an expectation of privacy; that a security officer looking into the room thereafter violates that expectation of privacy. ...\u201d The judge responded that he knew of a case where a guard had looked into a dressing room with a slatted door; a suppression motion had been overruled there because \u201cthere was no expectation of privacy.\u201d Though counsel and the judge also discussed differences between government and business security forces, we think the expecta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tion-of-privacy doctrine was an independent reason why the judge denied the suppression motion here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">What constitutes a \u201creasonable\u201d expectation of privacy depends on the circumstances and is measured by common habits in the use of domestic and business properties. (E.g., <em>North </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 301, 308-312 [104 Cal.Rptr. 833, 502 P.2d 1305, 57 A.L.R.3d 155]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lovelace, </em>supra, 116 Cal.App.3d 541, 550; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sneed </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 535, 540 [108 Cal.Rptr. 146].)  The fitting room here adjoined a narrow common corridor through which customers and salesclerks must have passed frequently. They would not always keep strictly to the center of the passageway, and slight deviations must have brought them close to the fitting-room doors. The large gaps above and below the doors provided an obvious view of the interior of each room. Though designed perhaps to give minimal protection to modesty, the doors hardly could promote any reasonable feeling that all actions and objects behind them were insulated from public observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Triggs, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 884, counsel suggests that fitting rooms, like public restrooms, are zones of complete privacy regardless of their construction or the means of observation. But <em>Triggs </em>held only that a public restroom gives rise to a reasonable expectation of freedom from observation by a law enforcement officer who has assumed a clandestine, unexpected vantage point to spy indiscriminately on all who enter. In those circumstances it does not matter that a stall\u2019s construction offers little privacy from normal view or that the officer <em>could </em>have seen the interior from a place open to the public. (Pp. 891-892; see also <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 469, 471-472 [24 Cal.Rptr. 849, 374 P.2d 817]; <em>Bielicki </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Cal.2d 602, 605-607 [21 Cal.Rptr. 552, 371 P.2d 288]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Metcalf (1971) </em>22 Cal.App.3d 20, 22-24 [98 Cal.Rptr. 925].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The only California decision suggesting a limitation on surveillance of fitting rooms also involved observation from a hidden and unusual position. <em>People </em>v. <em>Randazzo </em>(1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 768 [34 Cal.LRptr. 65] concluded (in dictum) that police could not have watched a fitting room by lying on the floor of an adjacent cubicle to peer through a narrow gap below the dividing partition. (Pp. 769-770; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Moreno </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d Supp. 23, 29-30 [135 Cal.Rptr. 340].)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Retailers face a shoplifting epidemic. (See U.S. Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, Security and the Small Retailer (1979) p. 11; <em>Merchants\u2019 Responses, supra, </em>28 Stan.L.Rev. 589.) The fitting rooms they often provide for customer convenience and modesty are particularly suited to concealment of stolen property. One way to fight that problem is to provide facilities that shield intimate body parts but are not entirely hidden from view. In effect, counsel asks us to hold that stores may not use evidence obtained by their employees\u2019 normal-view observations through fitting room doors whose design and location almost invite inspection.  That rule would comport with neither common habits in the use of property nor wise policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>One who uses a dressing room is entitled to the modicum of privacy it appears to afford. The record here supports the inference that Deborah placed the purse or bag on the floor of the room, where it was seen in full view of any passing customer, salesclerk, or security guard. No constitutionally recognized expectation of privacy proscribes that observation, and it appears that the trial court so ruled. Thus no ground appears for disturbing its order denying suppression of the evidence obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Postdetention Searches</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">After the People had urged on appeal that any <em>Miranda </em>error or illegal surveillance was harmless in view of the recovery of the stolen items, Deborah argued for the first time that all postdetention searches leading to such recovery were themselves improper. She further noted that the record does not show any recovery of property in the Broadway incident. If proof of recovery is suppressed or was omitted, she reasons, there is insufficient evidence to sustain either petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Yet did she not waive the invalidity of postdetention searches by not raising the issue in juvenile court? (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pranke </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 935, 942 [91 Cal.Rptr. 129].) In any event the eyewitness testimony of the detectives is overwhelming evidence of guilt, and any improper admission or omission of the recovered property seems harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Custodial Credits</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Deborah urges that the trial court erred in denying her 32 days of detention credit for time spent in juvenile hall before the disposition hearing. The contention has merit. The period of confinement under the Juvenile Court Law may not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment for a person convicted of the same offenses in adult court. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 726.) Predisposition custodial credit therefore must be given to the extent the minor\u2019s total period of confinement would otherwise exceed the statutorily defined \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment\u201d for one convicted as an adult. <em>(In re Eric J., supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 522, 535-536.)

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az2\">I concur in the majority opinion. However, I write separately to emphasize that the principles herein enunciated do not apply to off-duty police officers who work part time as security guards for private businesses. The majority\u2019s holding is limited to a determination that the policies which underlie the <em>Miranda </em>decision do not extend to private security guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Unlike the private security guard, a police officer is under a continuing duty to protect the public. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 830.1 and 836; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Derby </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 626 [2 Cal.Rptr. 401].) The fact that police pfficers may work part time for private businesses should not relieve them of their obligation to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings before conducting a custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The logic of this distinction is borne out when two sets of facts are compared.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An off-duty police officer enters a store as a customer and sees someone in the act of shoplifting. The officer places the suspect under arrest. The Constitution requires that <em>Miranda </em>warnings be given before questioning the suspect about the incident. (See <em>State </em>v. <em>Willadson </em>(1978) \u2014 Minn. \u2014 [268 N.W.2d 546, 546-547].) Similarly, an off-duty police officer, who is working as a security guard, observes someone shoplifting an item from the store and arrests him. In both instances the police officer seeks to question a suspect about criminal activity. If the second officer is not required to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings simply because he is working as a security guard, then the decision as to when basic constitutional principles apply will turn on who is paying the officer\u2019s salary at the time he questions the arrestee. Surely, the constitutional rights of our citizens should not hinge on such a silly, irrational distinction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">This court has held that an off-duty police officer acting as a privately employed security guard was not engaged in the performance of his official duties for purposes of Penal Code section 243 or for purposes of a suit for false arrest and imprisonment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Corey </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 738 [147 Cal.Rptr. 639, 581 P.2d 644] and <em>Cervantez </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 579 [156 Cal.Rptr. 198, 595 P.2d 975].) However, neither decision dealt with the obligation of a police officer to conform his actions to the requirements of the Constitutions of this state and nation. That question has never been addressed by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b169-6\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alq\">I concur in the majority opinion. I also agree with the views expressed in the concurring opinion of the Chief Justice. However, I would add another caveat, consistent with the conclusion I expressed for this court in <em>Dyas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 628 [114 Cal.Rptr. 114, 522 P.2d 674].</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">I would invoke the folk wisdom that if an object looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is likely to be a duck. If a security officer in an establishment open to the public dresses like a peace officer, carries a gun and a simulated badge or shoulder emblem like a peace officer, and conducts himself in the authoritative manner of a peace officer, he surely will be deemed in the eyes of the public and detained suspects to be the equivalent of a peace officer. He should be held to the obligations imposed by law upon a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>In <em>Dyas, </em>for example, the uniformed private security officer \u201cwas armed with a revolver, carried handcuffs, and had a two-way radio in his patrol car. Nor did he hesitate to use these indicia of authority in the manner in which they were intended. As we have seen, he radioed for a \u2018back-up unit,\u2019 ordered defendant to stand spreadeagled against a wall, conducted a pat-down search of defendant\u2019s clothing, drew his gun when defendant resisted, arrested and handcuffed defendant on finding contraband, and held him in custody in the patrol car until assistance arrived. Clearly these are the acts of a law enforcement officer.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 633-634.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Since no such circumstances appear in the instant case, I reach the same result as do my colleagues in the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Staniforth, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b170-6\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
