J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">May an exception to the law, which otherwise applies equally to every Californian, be carved out for a special class of individuals so that a person may violate, with impunity, a criminal statute which prohibits hunting out of season on public or private land simply because he belongs to an Indian tribe which once occupied the land?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The relevant facts are uncontroverted. Petitioner, Andrew Wilson, is a member of the Atsugewi branch of the Pit River Indians. About 5:30 p.m. on December 8, 1978, he was apprehended by William Fisher, a game warden, with two deer carcasses in his possession. Fisher seized both the deer and a .22 caliber rifle he found in petitioner\u2019s truck. Petitioner was cited for unlawful possession of deer taken during closed season in violation of section 2002 of the Fish and Game Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When apprehended, petitioner was on lands within the aboriginal territory of the Pit River Indians.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">At his court trial, petitioner did not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to establish that he violated section 2002. Instead, he argued that the Pit River Indians\u2019 aboriginal hunting rights had not been extinguished. Therefore, he contended that the state could regulate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Indians\u2019 hunting activities within their aboriginal territory only if the regulation met applicable federal standards. (See, e.g., <em>Antoine </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 194 [43 L.Ed.2d 129, 95 S.Ct. 944]; compare, <em>Kake Village </em>v. <em>Egan </em>(1962) 369 U.S. 60 [7 L.Ed.2d 573, 82 S.Ct. 562, 680].) Since the state could not demonstrate that the regulation at issue was a reasonable and necessary conservation measure, that its application to the Indians was necessary in the interest of conservation, and that it did not discriminate against the Indians <em>(Antoine </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>at p. 207 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 139]), petitioner asserted that the law could not be applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Rejecting this argument, the trial court found petitioner guilty of the offense charged and sentenced him to serve a one-year term of probation with a seven-day work furlough at the California Department of Transportation. Execution of the sentence was stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The Appellate Department of the Shasta County Superior Court affirmed petitioner\u2019s conviction and refused to certify an appeal. Petitioner now seeks habeas corpus relief. The trial court\u2019s stay remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Central to petitioner\u2019s claim is his assertion that the Pit River Indian aboriginal right to hunt has not been extinguished. Since it is now established that the tribe\u2019s aboriginal \u201cright to occupy\u201d their native territory has been extinguished <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Gemmill </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 535 F.2d 1145, 1148-1149, cert. den. <em>sub nom., Wilson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1976) 429 U.S. 982 [50 L.Ed.2d 592, 97 S.Ct. 497]),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the precise issue which this court must decide is whether extinguishment of the tribe\u2019s Indian title to, or right to occupy, their aboriginal territory operated to extinguish the tribe\u2019s aboriginal hunting rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Petitioner contends these rights are not mere incidents of Indian title but are rights separate therefrom which may be extinguished only pursuant to an express and specific congressional mandate. To assess this contention, it is necessary to review the nature and scope of Indian title and the effect of extinguishment of such title.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Indian title connotes only a permissive right to occupy land, fee title to the land resting with the United States government. <em>(Oneida Indian Nation </em>v. <em>County of Oneida </em>(1974) 414 U.S. 661, 667 [39 L.Ed. 2d 73, 79, 94 S.Ct. 772]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>McIntosh </em>(1823) 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 240, 253-254 [5 L.Ed. 681, 688-689].) Federal case law holds that the Indian right of occupancy is a mere possessory interest, <em>not </em>a property right. <em>(Tee-Hit-Ton Indians </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1955) 348 U.S. 272, 279, 288-289 [99 L.Ed. 314, 320, 324-325, 75 S.Ct. 313].) This interest is incapable of alienation absent federal authorization <em>(Oneida Indian Nation, supra, </em>at pp. 667, 669 [39 L.Ed.2d at pp. 79, 80]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>McIntosh, supra, </em>at pp. 261-262 [5 L.Ed. at pp. 693-694]), and it may be extinguished by the federal government at any time <em>(Oneida Indian Nation, supra, </em>at p. 670 [39 L.Ed.2d at pp. 80-81]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., supra, </em>314 U.S. 339, 347 [86 L.Ed. 260, 270, 62 S.Ct. 248]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>McIntosh, supra, </em>at pp. 259-260 [5 L.Ed. at pp. 691-693]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Until extinguished, such right of occupancy carries with it full use of the land. \u201cThe Indians had command of the lands and the waters\u2014 command of all their beneficial use, whether kept for hunting, \u2018and grazing roving herds of stock,\u2019 or turned to agriculture ...\u201d and other uses. <em>(Winters </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1908) 207 U.S. 564, 576 [52 L.Ed. 340, 346, 28 S.Ct. 207].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The scope of Indian title was the central question decided in <em>Shoshone Tribe </em>v. <em>U.S. (Shoshone I) </em>(1937) 299 U.S. 476 [81 L.Ed. 360, 57 S.Ct. 244], and <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Shoshone Tribe (Shoshone II) </em>(1938) 304 U.S. 111 [82 L.Ed. 1213, 58 S.Ct. 794]. At issue in that litigation was the compensation due the Indians for the taking of a portion of their reservation lands. While the litigation involved a treaty, the treaty was silent regarding the extent of the Indians\u2019 rights in the lands.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The outcome turned, therefore, on the scope of the Indian tenure prior to the treaty, or, more specifically, on the scope of Indian title. (See generally, Cohen, <em>Original Indian Title </em>(1947) 32 Minn.L.Rev. 28, 54-55.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In <em>Shoshone </em>I, Justice Cardozo held that the Shoshones had the \u201cright of occupancy with all its beneficial incidents [citation].\u201d <em>(Shoshone I, </em>supra, 299 U.S. at p. 496 [81 L.Ed. at p. 369].) As <em>Shoshone I </em>dealt only with fixing the date of the taking and not with damages, the court did not define those incidents, but held that \u201c[t]he right of occupancy is the primary one to which the incidents attach.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Shoshone II </em>forced the court to answer, at least in part, the question it had avoided in <em>Shoshone I. </em>Did the tribe\u2019s right of occupancy include timber and mineral resources? The court held that in the absence of an express reservation of such beneficial interest in the United States, the tribe had \u201cthe right which has always been understood to belong to Indians\u201d <em>(Shoshone II, supra, </em>304 U.S. at p. 117 [82 L.Ed. at p. 1219]), the right of occupancy with all its beneficial incidents, including the timber and mineral resources. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 115-118 [82 L.Ed. at pp. 1217-1219]; accord, <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Klamath Indians </em>(1938) 304 U.S. 119 [82 L.Ed. 1219, 58 S.Ct. 799].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Similarly, the right to hunt and to fish has been held to be included within the right of occupancy. (E.g., <em>Winters </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>207 U.S. at p. 576 [52 L.Ed. at p. 346]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Coffee </em>(1976) 97 Idaho 905 [556 P.2d 1185, 1189] [\u201caboriginal title includes the right to hunt and fish\u201d]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stasso </em>(1977) 172 Mont. 242 [563 P.2d 562, 563] [following <em>State </em>v. <em>Coffee, </em>supra. \u201c[h]unting and fishing rights are part and parcel with aboriginal title\u201d]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>State of Minn. </em>(D.Minn. 1979) 466 F.Supp. 1382, 1385 [\u201caboriginal hunting, fishing, trapping, or wild ricing rights ... are mere incidents of Indian title, not rights separate from Indian title\u201d], affd. <em>sub nom., Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians </em>v. <em>State of Minn. </em>(8th Cir. 1980) 614 F.2d 1161, cert. den. 449 U.S. 905 [66 L.Ed.2d 136, 101 S.Ct. 279]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Keezer </em>(1980) \u2014 Minn. \u2014 [292 N.W.2d 714, 720-721] [following <em>United States </em>v. <em>State of Minn., supra: </em>\u201c\u2018hunting. .. rights are mere incidents of Indian title\u2019\u201d], cert. den. 450 U.S. 930 [67 L.Ed.2d 363, 101 S.Ct. 1389].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Moreover, in a number of treaties with the Indians, Congress explicitly recognized the right to hunt as one of the privileges of occupancy. (E.g., Treaty of January 9, 1789, with the Wyandots, 7 Stat. 29 [reserving land to the Indians \u201cto live and hunt upon, and otherwise to occupy as they see fit\u201d]; Treaty of March 28, 1836, with the Ottawas and Chippewas, 7 Stat. 495 [reserving to the Indians the \u201cright to hunt\u201d along with \u201cthe other usual privileges of occupancy\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">No decision has been found wherein a court has taken the view that hunting rights exist \u201c[i]n addition to, and as a distinct right separate from aboriginal title\u201d (dis. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 38). It is not surprising that the dissent can cite no authority for its position. The dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>Sac &amp; Fox Tribe of Mississippi in Iowa </em>v. <em>Licklider </em>(8th Cir. 1978) 576 F.2d 145 is misplaced. There, the Eighth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>held that the Sac and Fox tribe lost its aboriginal right to hunt and fish when it ceded to the United States all the lands west of the Mississippi River to which it had any claim or title or interest. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 151, 153.) No mention was made of the relation between aboriginal hunting rights and aboriginal title. Other courts, construing virtually identical treaty language, have expressly found that such language operated to extinguish a tribe\u2019s aboriginal title which included the tribe\u2019s hunting and fishing rights. <em>(United States v. State of Minn., supra, </em>466 F.Supp. at p. 1385; <em>State </em>v. <em>Keezer, supra, </em>292 N.W.2d at pp. 720-721.) Nothing in <em>Licklider </em>is to the contrary. Moreover, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which decided <em>Licklider, </em>has affirmed this reasoning. <em>(Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians </em>v. <em>State of Minn., supra, </em>614 F.2d at p. 1162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><em>Menominee Tribe </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. 404, is also misconstrued by the dissent. In <em>Menominee Tribe, </em>the Supreme Court construed a treaty granting the tribe a reservation \u2018\u201cfor a home, to be held as Indian lands are held.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 405-406 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 699].) The court held that \u201cthe language \u2018to be held as Indian lands are held\u2019 includes the right to fish and to hunt.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 406 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 699].) In reaching that conclusion, the court noted with approval the rationale of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanapaw </em>(1963) 21 Wis.2d 377 [124 N.W.2d 41, 44]. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 406, fn. 2 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 699].) There, this language was construed as the Menominees would have understood it (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winans </em>(1905) 198 U.S. 371, 380-381 [49 L.Ed. 1089, 1092, 25 S.Ct. 662]). As a result, the Wisconsin court held that the tribe would enjoy on the reservation the hunting and fishing rights they had enjoyed on lands held under aboriginal title. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Sanapaw, supra, </em>124 N.W.2d 41.) The Supreme Court also noted that this language \u201csum[s] up in a single phrase the familiar provisions of earlier treaties which recognized hunting and fishing as normal incidents of Indian life. [Citation omitted.]\u201d <em>(Menominee Tribe, supra, </em>at p. 406, fn. 2 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 699].)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Winans, supra, </em>198 U.S. 371, cited by the dissent, is also inapposite. <em>Winans </em>construed the treaty by which the Yakima Indians ceded to the United States a portion of their Indian title lands. One clause of the treaty provided that the Indians were to retain, on the ceded lands, inter alia, \u201c\u2018the right of taking fish at all the usual and accustomed places,\u2019\u201d and the right \u201c\u2018of erecting temporary buildings for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>curing them\u2019 . . ..\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 378 [49 L.Ed. at p. 1091 ].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The respondents maintained that this provision secured to the Indians only such fishing rights on the ceded lands as any citizen of the state would have. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 380 [49 L.Ed. at p. 1092].)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Rejecting this construction, the court stated: \u201cAt the time the treaty was made the fishing places were part of the Indian country, subject to the occupancy of the Indians, <em>with all the rights such occupancy gave. </em>[Italics added.] The object of the treaty was to limit the occupancy to certain lands and to define rights outside of them.... [\u00b6] The right to resort to the fishing places in controversy was a part of larger rights possessed by the Indians, upon the exercise of which there was not a shadow of impediment, and which were not much less necessary to the existence of the Indians than the atmosphere they breathed. New conditions came into existence, to which those rights had to be accommodated. Only a limitation of them, however, was necessary and intended, not a taking away.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 379, 381 [49 L.Ed. at pp. 1091, 1092].) Since \u201cit was within the competency of the Nation to secure to the Indians ... a remnant of [their] great rights ...\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 384 [49 L.Ed. at p. 1094]), the court held that the treaty language indicated a congressional intent to secure to the Indians an ongoing right in the ceded land: \u201cthe right of crossing it to the river\u2014the right to occupy it to the extent and for the purpose mentioned.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 381 [49 L.Ed. at p. 1093].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Clearly, none of the cases relied upon by the dissent provides authority for the proposition that aboriginal hunting rights are not incidents of aboriginal title. Further, every case directly addressing the relation between aboriginal title and aboriginal hunting rights holds that <em>such rights are incidents of aboriginal title. </em>\u201c[A]boriginal title [is] more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>than just a right to remain camped on the land.\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>Coffee, supra, 556 </em>P.2d 1185, 1188.) It is the right to any and all beneficial uses of the land. It is the right of the Indians to live and hunt upon the land and otherwise to occupy it as they see fit. The case law is clear,  Hunting and fishing rights are an incident of the right of occupancy, an incident of aboriginal title. If aboriginal title is ceded to the government, the right to hunt and fish on those lands is gone. Emotions might dictate an opposite result, but this court must follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">It is equally well established that extinguishment of Indian title, if absolute and unconditional, vests in the United States or its grantee an \u201cabsolute title\u201d unrestricted by Indian rights. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>McIntosh, supra, </em>21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) at pp. 259, 261 [5 L.Ed. at pp. 692, 693].) \u201c[W]henever the Indian right of occupancy [is] terminated (if such termination [is] absolute and unconditional) the [owner] of the fee ... acquire[s] a perfect and unburdened title and right of possession.\u201d <em>(Minnesota </em>v. <em>Hitchcock </em>(1902) 185 U.S. 373, 389 [46 L.Ed. 954, 963, 22 S.Ct. 650]; accord, <em>United States </em>v. <em>State of Minn., supra, </em>466 F.Supp. at p. 1385; <em>State </em>v. <em>Keezer, supra, </em>292 N.W.2d at pp. 720-721; see also <em>Rosebud Sioux Tribe </em>v. <em>Kneip </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 584, 592 [51 L.Ed.2d 660, 668, 97 S.Ct. 1361]; <em>DeCoteau </em>v. <em>District County Court </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 425, 445-446 [43 L.Ed.2d 300, 314-315, 95 S.Ct. 1082].) If, however, the extinguishment of Indian title is qualified, or limited, that portion excepted from extinguishment survives. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Winans, supra, </em>198 U.S. 371 [see <em>ante, </em>at p. 29; <em>State </em>v. <em>Coffee </em>(1976) 97 Idaho 905 [556 P.2d 1185, 1192-1193].) Therefore, under the law, if the extinguishment of the Pit River Indian title was absolute and unconditional the Indians\u2019 occupancy rights, including their hunting rights, were abolished.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><em>Menominee Tribe </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. 404, is not to the contrary. The dissent argues that this case stands for the proposition that hunting rights are extinguished only if Congress acts specifically and unequivocally to extinguish them. (See dis. opn. of Mosk, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 39.) The rule of construction applied by <em>Menominee Tribe </em>is that \u2018\u201cthe intention to abrogate or modify a treaty is not to be lightly imputed to the Congress.\u2019\u201d <em>(Menominee Tribe, supra, </em>at p. 413 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 703].) As interpreted by the Supreme Court, the case clearly es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tablishes that in construing treaties, the focus of the inquiry is on congressional intent. (See <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Yakima Indian Nation </em>(1979) 439 U.S. 463, 478, fn. 22 [58 L.Ed.2d 740, 754, 99 S.Ct. 740]; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Fishing Vessel Assn., supra, </em>443 U.S. at p. 690 [61 L.Ed.2d at p. 848].) The court will consider all relevant indicia of that intent: \u201c[W]hether a congressional determination to terminate is \u2018expressed on the face of the (relevant) Act(s) or [is] clear from the surrounding circumstances and legislative history.\u2019 [Citation omitted; brackets in original.]\u201d <em>(Rosebud Sioux Tribe </em>v. <em>Kneip, supra, </em>430 U.S. 584, 588, fn. 4 [51 L.Ed.2d 660, 666]; see generally, Coggins &amp; Modrcin, <em>Native American Indians and Federal Wildlife Law </em>(1979) 31 Stan.L.Rev. 375, 384.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Indeed, this is precisely the inquiry undertaken by the court in <em>Menominee Tribe. </em>The court looked first to the face of the Menominee Termination Act. It found language which provided that upon termination of federal supervision over the tribe and its property, \u201c\u2018the laws of the several States shall apply to the tribe and its members in the same manner as they apply to other[s]\u2019 <em>...(Menominee Tribe, supra, </em>391 U.S. at p. 410 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 701].) This forcefully suggested an intent to submit the hunting and fishing rights of the Indians to regulation by the State of Wisconsin. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court then looked to the surrounding circumstances and legislative history. In so doing, the oourt discovered that \u201c[t]he same Congress that passed the Termination Act also passed Public Law 280 ...\u201d which became effective well in advance of the Termination Act and at a time when the Menominee Reservation was still part of Indian country. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 410-411 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 701-702].) That law granted Wisconsin, among other states, jurisdiction over offenses committed by Indians in Indian country. However, the law further provided that it was not meant to deprive any Indian of any right or immunity provided under a treaty <em>\u201c\u2018with respect to hunting, trapping, or fishing </em>or the control, licensing, or regulation thereof.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid, </em>[italics in original].)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Considering the two acts <em>in pari materia, </em>the court concluded that although Congress intended federal supervision of the tribe to cease and all tribal property to pass to a corporation formed by the tribe, it also intended to preserve the tribe\u2019s hunting and fishing rights. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 411 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 702]; see also, <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Callahan </em>(9th Cir. 1974) 493 F.2d 564, 567-569.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>In seeking to determine whether aboriginal rights have been extinguished, the nature of the inquiry is much the same. The question is congressional intent. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., supra, </em>314 U.S. 339.) Accordingly, this court must consider whether the legislative history reveals a congressional determination to extinguish the Pit River Indian title in its entirety which would include the tribe\u2019s hunting rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">A review of the \u201ccentury-long course of conduct\u201d by which the federal government extinguished the Pit River Indian title <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Gemmill, supra, </em>535 F.2d at p. 1149) leads inescapably to the conclusion that the Indians\u2019 occupancy rights have been extinguished in their entirety. To relate the manner in which this extinguishment was carried out is to set forth a dismal chapter in the history of this nation and in the history of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">California was admitted to the Union on September 9, 1850. (9 Stat. 452.) Thereafter, Congress began to debate what steps to take to remove the Indians of California from contact with the horde of gold seekers who had begun flooding the state, so as to reduce the friction between the two groups. (Heizer, <em>Treaties, </em>in 8 Handbook of North American Indians, <em>supra, </em>p. 702; )<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In 1852, Congress enacted legislation authorizing President Fillmore to appoint commissioners to negotiate treaties with the California tribes. He did so, and subsequently these commissioners negotiated 18 treaties with many of the California Indians. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Each of the treaties followed the historical pattern. Certain lands were to be set aside for the Indians; the rest were to be ceded to the United States. <em>(Ibid.) </em>At least some of the treaties apparently contained a provision reserving to the Indians hunting rights in the ceded lands. (See 4 Kappler, Indian Affairs\u2014Laws and Treaties (1929) pp. 1081-1128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Soon after the provisions of the treaties became known, the California Legislature adopted resolutions opposing their ratification. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>generally, Ellison, <em>Rejection of the California Indian Treaties. A Study in Local Influence on National Policy, </em>in Treaty Making and Treaty Rejection by the Federal Government in California, 1850-1852 (Heizer edit. 1978) pp. 50, 54-59.) The Legislature wanted the Indians removed to reservations outside the state. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 56.) Largely because of the opposition of the Legislature and the senators from California, the United States Senate refused to ratify the treaties, on July 8, 1852. The United States Senate placed the treaties under an injunction of secrecy which was not removed for over 50 years. (Heizer, <em>Treaties, </em>in 8 Handbook of North American Indians, <em>supra, </em>at p. 703.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In March of 1852, Congress passed an act establishing a \u201csuperintendency of Indian affairs\u201d in California. (10 Stat. 2.) When the treaties were rejected, Congress authorized the expenditure of a sum of money for the preservation of peace with the Indians who had been dispossessed of their lands as a result of the abortive attempt to establish treaties. (10 Stat. 56.) Also, the Congress wanted to prevent the starvation of the Indians. (Ellison, The Federal Indian Policy in California, 1846-1860 (1976) at pp. 204-205.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In 1852, the superintendent, Edward F. Beale, reported that \u201csome adjustment of the Indian question was necessary, as white people were fast filling up the habitable territory to the exclusion of the Indians.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 206.) Beale recommended in 1853 that Congress establish several \u201cmilitary reservations\u201d to which the Indians could be removed. Such reservations were to be established on unoccupied lands, with the understanding that if the growth in the Caucasian population required it, the location of these properties would be changed. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 206-212.) Congress adopted this recommendation<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and apparently pursued the policy into the 1870\u2019s. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 212-230; see <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Forty-Eight Pounds of Rising Star Tea </em>(N.D.Cal. 1888) 35 F. 403; see generally, Tyler, A History of Indian Policy (1973) at p. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The influx of Caucasians into the Pit River Indians\u2019 territory continued and a series of conflicts followed. In the 1850\u2019s and the 1860\u2019s the government undertook concentrated military action against the Indians. In 1859, all of the Indians who could be found were removed to the Round Valley Reservation. <em>(Pitt River Indians </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>7 Ind.Cl.Com. 815, 852.) By 1863, many of these Indians had left the reservation and the conflict continued until, in 1867, the Indians were \u201cdecisively overcome\u201d at the Battle of the Infernal Caverns. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 852, 862; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gemmill, supra, </em>535 F.2d 1145, 1148.) As a result, the Pit River Indians \u201chave not been in physical possession of [much of their aboriginal territory] for 100 years....\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Gemmill, supra.)</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>These events, considered in light of the federal government\u2019s general policy toward the Indians of California, strongly indicate an intent on the part of Congress to completely extinguish the Indian title of the Pit River Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Finally, from a legal standpoint the question concerning the extinguishment of the tribe\u2019s Indian title was \u201cdecisively resolved by congressional payment of compensation to the Pit River Indians for these lands.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Gemmill, supra, </em>535 F.2d at p. 1149.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the 1950\u2019s, the tribe filed a claim for compensation for the taking of their Indian title with the Indian Claims Commission. (See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 70a(4).)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In 1959, the commission found that their Indian title had been taken <em>(Pitt River Indians </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>7 Ind.Cl.Com. at p. 862), and in 1964, the commission approved a compromise final settlement of the Pit River Indian claim and that of other California Indian tribes. <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>13 Ind.Cl.Com. at p. 513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The settlement agreement provided that \u201centry of final judgment shall finally dispose of all claims or demands which any of the [Indians] have asserted or could have asserted against [the United States] . . . and <em>[the </em>Indians] ... <em>shall be barred from asserting all such claims or demands in any future </em>action.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 386; italics added.) Congress immediately appropriated the funds to pay the settlement. (Act of October 7, 1964, 78 Stat. 1033; <em>Andrade </em>v. <em>United States </em>(Ct.Cl. 1973) 485 F.2d 660, 661.)

The doctrine was adopted by Chief Justice Marshall as the basis of his decision in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>McIntosh, supra, </em>21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 240, a landmark case on Indian title. As summarized by Chief Justice Marshall, \u201cdiscovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 253 [5 L.Ed. at p. 688].) \u201cThe rights of the [Indians] were, in no instance, entirely disregarded; but were, necessarily, to a considerable extent, impaired. They were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil, with a legal as well as just claim to retain possession of it, and to use it according to their own discretion\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>but discovery gave the discoverer an exclusive right as sovereign to acquire Indian land and thereby \u201cto extinguish the Indian title of occupancy, either by purchase or by conquest\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 259 [5 L.Ed. at p. 692]). Thus, until the discoverer exercised its right, both the Indians and the discoverer had concurrent interests in the land: the discover held fee title, the Indians their right of occupancy. Finally, since discovery gave the sovereign alone the right to extinguish Indian title, the Indians\u2019 power to alienate their interest was denied <em>(id., </em>at pp. 253-254 [5 L.Ed. at pp. 688-689]).

The fundamental difference between Indian title and Indian title recognized by Congress pursuant to a treaty, a statute, or by other means is that recognized title is a property right under the Fifth Amendment.

A negative answer seems compelled: a right remains a right until specifically eliminated by agreement, unequivocal waiver, or appropriate legislative enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the federal government has the Big Brother power to extinguish the Indian right of occupancy, commonly known as \u201cIndian title.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Pacific R. Co. </em>(1941) 314 U.S. 339, 347 [86 L.Ed. 260, 270, 62 S.Ct. 248].) This is based on a theory, no longer open to us to question, that Indian title is primarily a permissive right to occupy certain land but the fee title remains with the United States government. <em>(Oneida Indian Nation </em>v. <em>County of Oneida </em>(1974) 414 U.S. 661, 667 [39 L. Ed.2d 73, 79, 94 S.Ct. 772].) Thus Indian title, or aboriginal title, differs from what we commonly know as fee title.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In addition to, and as a distinct right separate from aboriginal title and the \u201cright of occupancy,\u201d there has been an historically recognized and unrestricted aboriginal right to hunt and fish. <em>(Sac &amp; Fox Tribe of Mississippi in Iowa </em>v. <em>Licklider </em>(8th Cir. 1978) 576 F.2d 145, 153; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winans </em>(1905) 198 U.S. 371, 381 [49 L.Ed. 1089, 1092-1093, 25 S.Ct. 662].)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">It is a well-established tenet of federal law that neither the existence of aboriginal title nor the separate right to hunt and fish are dependent upon a grant from the federal government. As the United States Supreme Court has stated: \u201cNor is it true, as respondent urges, that a tribal claim to any particular lands must be based upon a treaty, statute, or other formal government action.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., </em>supra, 314 U.S. 339, 347 [86 L.Ed. 260, 270].) The term \u201cIndian title\u201d or \u201caboriginal title\u201d means the right is derived from ancestral occupancy to a specified land area, not by means of a grant from the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>While these ancestral rights\u2014occupancy, and hunting and fishing\u2014 are not dependent upon a grant, they can be eliminated by government action. For example, in <em>Sac &amp; Fox Tribe of Mississippi in Iowa </em>v. <em>Licklider, supra, SI6 </em>F.2d at pages 151, 153, the circuit court found that by formal treaty, the tribe relinquished not only its possessory interest but also its aboriginal right to hunt and fish. (Also see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winans, supra, </em>198 U.S. 371, 381 [49 L.Ed. 1089, 1092-1093].)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The only manner in which \u201cIndian title\u201d can be extinguished is through explicit extinguishment pursuant to a \u201cclear and plain\u201d congressional mandate. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., supra, </em>314 U.S. 339, 353-354 [86 L.Ed. 260, 273-274]; <em>Menominee Tribe </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 404 [20 L.Ed.2d 697, 88 S.Ct. 1705]). As was emphasized in <em>Menominee Tribe, </em>hunting rights exist independently from occupancy rights. Therefore, before tribal hunting rights are extinguished, Congress must also specifically and unequivocally extinguish them; this cannot be accomplished by conjecture or inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The United States Commission on Civil Rights recognized in its June 1981 report that \u201ctribes may retain hunting and fishing rights in lands ceded to the United States in cases where no mention of such rights is made in a treaty.\u201d Citing <em>Menominee Tribe, </em>the federal agency agrees that if hunting and fishing rights are not specifically terminated \u201cwhen the tribal-Federal relationship was ended\u201d the states are prevented from applying their game laws on the former reservation. (Indian Tribes: A Continuing Quest for Survival, Report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights (June 1981) pp. 44-45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In the case at hand, no congressional act can be identified by which the aboriginal hunting rights of the Pit River Indians have been extinguished. Moreover, the Appellate Department of the Shasta County Superior Court found as a fact that \u201cthe federal government has never abrogated or extinguished by treaty or statute, the tribe\u2019s aboriginal fishing and hunting rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">It is true that the Pit River Indians have lost title to their aboriginal lands <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Gemmill </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 535 F.2d 1145), but in that process, and in arriving at a settlement thereafter with the government, it was clear that the agreement only \u201crevoked the Indians\u2019 rights of permissive occupancy\u201d <em>(id., </em>p. 1149). No mention was made in the settlement, nor did <em>Gemmill </em>declare that any explicit or implicit under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>standing was reached, to eliminate the Indians\u2019 independent right to hunt and fish. As was stated recently in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dupris </em>(8th Cir. 1979) 612 F.2d 319, 323, \u201c[Djiminishment of a reservation should only be found where the intent of Congress for such diminishment is clear and unambiguous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Cases cited by the majority are not apposite. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>State of Minn. </em>(D.Minn. 1979) 466 F.Supp. 1382, the court found as a fact that the Indians there involved \u201cwere told that under the Nelson Act they would not retain special hunting and fishing rights in ceded areas . <em>..(Id., </em>p. 1387.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shoshone Tribe </em>(1938) 304 U.S. 111 [82 L.Ed. 1213, 58 S.Ct. 794] involved mineral rights, which everyone concedes are part of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The Supreme Court case of <em>Menominee Tribe </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. 404, convincingly undermines the majority\u2019s conclusion both in result and in rationale. The act of Congress there involved was by its terms \u201cto provide for orderly termination of Federal supervision over the property and members\u201d of the tribe, and thereafter \u201cthe laws of the several States shall apply to the tribe and its members in the same manner as they apply to other citizens or persons within their jurisdiction.\u201d Justice Douglas, for the court, declared, \u201cWe decline to construe the Termination Act as a backhanded way of abrogating the hunting and fishing rights of these Indians.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 412 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 703].) The court conceded the power to abrogate those rights exists <em>(Lone Wolf </em>v. <em>Hitchcock </em>(1903) 187 U.S. 553, 564-567 [47 L.Ed. 299, 305-307, 23 S.Ct. 216]) but an intention to do so \u2018\u201cis not to be lightly imputed to the Congress.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 413 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 703]; also see <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Callahan </em>(9th Cir. 1974) 493 F.2d 564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The following quotation from <em>Fishing in Western Washington\u2014a Treaty Right, a Clash of Cultures, </em>Indian Tribes: A Continuing Quest for Survival, A Report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights (June 1981) page 99, aptly relates the problem: \u201cThe fishing rights conflict is very much a study in frustration. Indian tribes have been fighting for their economic survival throughout this century. When non-Indian institutions, like courts and legislatures of the State and Federal governments upon which they have had to rely, have failed them, they have lost their promised rights. When some of those institutions have supported them, the battle itself has been moved to a different forum. The struggle, like the fish, is cyclical and ongoing. It requires tribes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>be ever vigilant to protect their fishing rights from many forms of direct attack as well as indirect assault. Through all the battles, they must move with caution. They are a political minority with assets envied by others. They have had to pay law firms and technical experts in order to retain their rights, and they have had to deal extensively with all branches of State and Federal governments in order to give lasting effect to last century\u2019s promises. The situation is perhaps most easily summarized by the remark of one Indian fish manager: \u2018Well, ... if they could get the politics out of the management of the fish, we\u2019d have some.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">It is anomalous that my colleagues in the majority have been willing to give unprecedented and, in my opinion unconstitutional, economic and educational preferences to specifically enumerated minorities, some of whom may have been recent arrivals in the state (see, e.g., <em>DeRonde </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 875 [172 Cal. Rptr. 677, 625 P.2d 220]; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 257 [161 Cal.Rptr. 475, 604 P.2d 1365]), but they are unmoved by the attempted exercise of historically recognized rights of a minority people whose presence here antedates all of us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One must ponder the political vigor of the former (see my dissent in <em>DeRonde, </em>p. 901) compared to the pathetic impotency of the numerically insignificant Pit River Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">From the colonial era to this very day, the dominant society has overreacted to Indian lore, as if it were a volatile threat to our security. This overrated danger, wrote the eminent historian W. E. Woodward, \u201chas become a sort of historical myth\u201d (Woodward, A New American History (1938) p. 105). Yet we have an unpaid debt to the Indians, if for no other reason than it was from them, who out of the need for survival were adept in the arts of hunting and fishing, that the early settlers on this continent learned and perfected their techniques of acquiring food for sustenance and material for clothing and shelter. (Beard, A Basic History of the United States (1944) p. 25.) We can best repay that obligation by broadening our perspective to welcome the existence of the diverse Indian culture, by encouraging rather than penalizing cherished traditions and by enhancing rather than disparaging the Indians\u2019 sense of personal dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>This petitioner and his fellow tribesmen should prevail\u2014on the strength of their legal, moral and historical rights.
