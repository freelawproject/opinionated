The first mandates that if such offenses are listed in subdivision (c) they are subject to certain enhancements. The second places a five-year maximum on the total of subordinate terms for offenses not listed in subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">We dealt with the first of these cross-references in <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 754 [159 Cal.Rptr. 696, 602 P.2d 396], where we held, in effect, that the offenses generally described but not specified in paragraph (8) of subdivision (c) were not subject to enhancements. The issue in this case is whether the second cross-reference must be similarly qualified: Whether the offenses described in paragraph (8) of subdivision (c) count against the five-year maximum for \u201coffenses not listed in subdivision (c) ... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Defendant Ernesto Hernandez appeals from a judgment entered after his conviction by a jury on 11 of 13 charged felony counts, including mayhem, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon, plus a total of 8 enhancements for firearm use and infliction of great bodily injury. He was sentenced to state prison for a term of 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Defendant contends that the total permissible term under Penal Code section 1170.1 is 17, not 20 years. Specifically, it is urged that the trial court erred, under subdivision (a) of that section, in sentencing him to more than the maximum five-year total for consecutive sentences on eight robbery and assault counts. We conclude that the trial court did not err and that the Legislature intended to permit unlimited subordinate terms for consecutive offenses (1) as to any felony in which a firearm was used or great bodily injury inflicted, and (2) as to other named felonies, irrespective of firearm use or bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">There is no challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Briefly, in a period spanning January 3 to January 17, 1980\u2014that is, before the 1980 amendments to section 1170.1 (Stats. 1980, ch. 132, \u00a7 2) became effective\u2014defendant robbed seven people, six of them at gunpoint, shot two of his victims in the face blinding one of them, assaulted another by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, and shot at a person who pursued him from the scene of one of the robberies. The crimes occurred at different times and different locations. When apprehended, defendant confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Defendant was found guilty on a count of mayhem (\u00a7 203) with firearm use; seven counts of robbery (\u00a7 211), all but one with firearm use or bodily injury, or both; and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)), one with firearm use. He was sentenced to state prison for a term of 20 years. The principal term (ten years) was imposed on a robbery count\u2014upper term of five years for the robbery,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with enhancement of two years for the use of a firearm and three years for inflicting great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Consecutive terms were imposed as follows; one count of mayhem with firearm use\u2014two years; one count of robbery with firearm use and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>great bodily injury\u2014one year; four counts of robbery with firearm use \u2014one year each; one count of robbery\u2014one year; one count of assault with a deadly weapon with firearm use\u2014one year; and one count of assault with a deadly weapon\u2014one year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that none of the offenses, except mayhem, is an offense specifically listed in subdivision (c) of section 667.5 (see fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>and therefore, under subdivision (a) of section 1170.1 (see fn. 1, <em>ante) </em>the total of subordinate terms for the consecutive offenses, other than mayhem, may not exceed five years. He relies entirely on our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In <em>Harvey </em>we held that enhancement of a consecutive sentence was proper under section 1170.1 only for the seven offenses listed <em>by name </em>in section 667.5. <em>Harvey </em>involved a subordinate term for robbery with use of a firearm. We held that since robbery was not a specifically enumerated offense in section 667.5, the consecutive sentence could not be enhanced, despite the broad language of paragraph (8) in subdivision (c) of section 667.5. <em>(Harvey, supra </em>at pp. 760-761.) We reasoned: \u201c[T]o construe section 1170.1, subdivision (a), as permitting the enhancement of defendant\u2019s consecutive offense solely by reason of his commission of a felony involving use of a firearm would result in a troublesome anomaly: As so interpreted, section 1170.1 would permit enhancement for firearm use <em>in any case involving firearm use, </em>thereby seeming to render wholly unnecessary the section\u2019s specific statutory reference to the various violent felonies described in section 667.5, subdivision (c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">This rationale of <em>Harvey </em>does not apply to the limitation on the <em>total </em>of subordinate terms. There is no inconsistency or redundancy in interpreting section 1170.1 to permit unlimited subordinate terms for the enumerated crimes in subdivision (c) of section 667.5 <em>as well as </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u201cany other felony\u201d where great bodily injury was inflicted or in which a firearm was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">To put the matter differently: If the first issue to come before us had been the one involved here\u2014whether all the felonies listed in subdivision (c), specifically or genetically, are excepted from the five-year total\u2014there simply would have been no reason to except felonies described in paragraph (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The multiple counts in the instant case illustrate the potential application of the clear language of section 667.5, incorporated into section 1170.1: As to the count for mayhem, a consecutive term can be imposed outside the five-year limitation on total subordinate terms, <em>irrespective of firearm use. </em>The robbery and assault counts in which a firearm was used and/or great bodily injury inflicted would similarly fall outside the five-year limitation. (Five counts of robbery and one count of assault are in this category.) And, finally, the robbery and assault counts in which no firearm was used nor injury inflicted would fall within the five-year limit of total subordinate terms. No anomalies, no superfluities, no unnecessarily enumerated felonies spoil this literal construction of the final sentence of section 1170.1, subdivision (a) in its reference to section 667.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The dichotomy between this case and <em>Harvey </em>arises from the fact that section 1170.1, subdivision (a) borrowed the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d for two different purposes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Yet, on occasion, as <em>Harvey </em>illustrates, transposition of a definitional statute without refinement of language to accommodate the incorporating statute results in ambiguity, inconsistency, or superfluous language. Thus, if section 1170.1, subdivision (a) were interpreted to employ the statutory definition in section 667.5 to permit enhancement of a consecutive term for firearm use or great bodily injury as to any violent felony, the listing of the seven named felonies would be redundant. <em>(Harvey, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 754.) In contrast, the use of the statutory definition in section 667.5 to permit unlimited total subordinate terms for consecutive offenses is entirely harmonious with the related provisions. We see no reason not to abide by the clear letter of the statute and the legislative intent manifested by the incorporation of the statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>We are aware that our interpretation gives to the phrase \u201cconsecutive offenses not listed in subdivision (c) of section 667.5\u201d a different meaning in two parts of the same statute. It is presumed, in the absence of anything in the statute to the contrary, that a repeated phrase or word in a statute is used in the same sense throughout. <em>(Hoag </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1880) 55 Cal. 564, 565; <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Knight </em>(1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 671, 680 [310 P.2d 673].) The rule is, however, quite flexible: \u201cThere is no rule of law that necessarily requires the same meaning to be given to the same word used in different places in the same statute.\u201d <em>(Sunset Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Pasadena </em>(1911) 161 Cal. 265, 275 [118 P. 796]; <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Conrad </em>(1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 85, 95 [8 Cal.Rptr. 56].) \u201cWhen the occasion demands it, the same word may have different meanings to effectuate the intention of the act in which the word appears.\u201d <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 219, 224 [106 Cal.Rptr. 299]; <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Board of Directors </em>(1904) 145 Cal. 468, 473 [78 P. 951].)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In our view, the legislative intent to punish more severely those crimes in which a firearm is used or great bodily injury inflicted is clear. Although we could not effectuate that intent with regard to the <em>enhancement </em>of subordinate terms <em>(Harvey, supra, </em>25 Cal. 3d 754), there is nothing to prevent our implementation of the Legislature\u2019s intention in regard to the computation of the <em>total </em>subordinate terms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We conclude, therefore, that defendant, whose consecutive terms include five robberies and one assault with firearm use or infliction of great bodily harm or both, all \u201cviolent felonies\u201d as defined in paragraph (8) of subdivision (c) of section 667.5, is not entitled to the benefit of the five-year limitation in section 1170.1 on the total subordinate term.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We reach our conclusion without reference to the 1980 amendment of section 1170.1, enacted in apparent response to the <em>Harvey </em>decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Bird, C.

In accord with <em>Harvey </em>the court enhanced only the sentence for mayhem, i.e., one-third of the middle term (sixteen months), plus one-third of the two-year enhancement for firearm use (eight months), resulting in a two-year subordinate term for the offense.
