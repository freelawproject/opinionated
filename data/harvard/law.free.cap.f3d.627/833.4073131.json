System, Inc. (\u201cI.C. System\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff-Appellee Barry Oppenheim\u2019s (\u201cOppenheim\u201d) claims under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692 <em>et seq., </em>and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act (\u201cFCCPA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 559.72 <em>et seq. </em>After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">In May 2008, Plaintiff Barry Oppenheim sold his laptop computer to a buyer through Craigslist, an Internet website. Oppenheim instructed the laptop buyer to make payment for the computer by depositing funds into Oppenheim\u2019s account with PayPal. PayPal is an e-commerce business that facilitates money transfers through the Internet. PayPal typically acts as an intermediary that accepts funds from a buyer and deposits these funds into the account of a seller, subtracting any applicable service charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">Oppenheim had set up his PayPal account several years prior to this laptop transaction, and he agreed to abide by the PayPal User Agreement. The User Agreement allows PayPal to \u201creverse\u201d a transaction if, among other reasons, a payment is invalidated by the sender\u2019s bank or if the sender did not have authorization to transfer the funds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PayPal account user, here Oppenheim, bears the risk of such reversals and is liable for the full amount of the invalidated payment, plus applicable fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">The laptop buyer agreed to make payment into Oppenheim\u2019s PayPal account. PayPal notified Oppenheim once the funds were deposited, and the laptop exchange took place. Later, Oppenheim transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>these funds from his PayPal account to his personal bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Weeks after the laptop transaction occurred, PayPal notified Oppenheim that the laptop buyer\u2019s payment was fraudulent<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that PayPal would therefore exercise its reversal rights under the User Agreement. Nevertheless, Oppenheim refused to repay the funds to PayPal.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">PayPal then retained the services of Defendant I.C. System to recover the laptop money from Oppenheim. Over a period of three months, I.C. System made a series of telephone calls to Oppenheim in an attempt to collect the funds. According to Oppenheim, I.C. System\u2019s calls constituted a form of harassment and contained false and misleading representations. Oppenheim brought suit against I.C. System, alleging (1) a violation of the FDCPA in Count 1, (2) a violation of the FCCPA in Count 2, and (3) a common law invasion of privacy by intrusion in Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Prior to the commencement of the trial, I.C. System moved for summary judgment on all three counts. I.C. System argued that Oppenheim\u2019s payment obligation to PayPal did not constitute a \u201cdebt\u201d under the FDCPA or the FCCPA and that Oppenheim had not pled sufficient facts to maintain the tort claim of invasion of privacy. In a February 18, 2010 order, the district court granted I.C. System\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count 3 but denied its motion for summary judgment with respect to Count 1 (the FDCPA claim) and Count 2 (the FCCPA claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The case proceeded to trial and a jury ultimately awarded $1,000 in statutory damages to Oppenheim. Additionally, the district court awarded Oppenheim $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and $986.21 in costs. I.C. System timely appealed the district court\u2019s denial of its summary judgment motion with respect to the FDCPA and FCCPA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of I.C. System\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>LeBlanc v. Unifund CCR Partners, </em>601 F.3d 1185, 1189 (11th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\u201d and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine issue of material fact exists when \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The Court reviews the evidence and draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Patton v. Triad Guar. Ins. Corp., </em>277 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">\n<em>B. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">In 1977 Congress enacted the FDCPA \u201cto eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e). To recover under both the FDCPA and the FCCPA (a Florida state analogue to the federal FDCPA), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>a plaintiff must make a threshold showing that the money being collected qualifies as a \u201cdebt.\u201d The FDCPA and the FCCPA identically define \u201cdebt\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALm\">any obligation or alleged obligation <em>of a consumer </em>to pay money <em>arising out of a transaction in which the money, </em>property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction <em>are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, </em>whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5) (emphasis added); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.55(1) (same). Accordingly, the FDCPA and FCCPA apply only to payment obligations of a (1) <em>consumer </em>arising out of a (2) <em>transaction </em>in which the money, property, insurance, or services at issue are (3) <em>primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. </em>The statute thus makes clear that the mere obligation to pay does not constitute a \u201cdebt\u201d under the FCPA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Whether the district court erred in classifying Oppenheim\u2019s payment obligation to PayPal as a \u201cdebt,\u201d governed by the provisions of the FDCPA and FCCPA, is the only issue raised on appeal. We analyze each of the three elements separately to determine whether Oppenheim\u2019s payment obligation constituted a \u201cdebt\u201d under the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">1. <em>Consumer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">I.C. System contends that the money at issue here was proceeds from a commercial sale in which Oppenheim was the seller. Since the FDCPA concerns the obligations of a consumer,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> not a seller, I.C. System argues that the FDCPA cannot apply to Oppenheim\u2019s payment obligations to PayPal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">However, I.C. System conflates two connected, but separate transactions. The first transaction concerned the laptop sale between Oppenheim, as seller, and the fraudulent Craigslist purchaser, as buyer. The second transaction \u2014 and the relevant transaction for purposes of this action\u2014 concerned the services provided by PayPal to Oppenheim, pursuant to the terms delineated in the User Agreement. In this second transaction, as purchaser of PayPal\u2019s services, Oppenheim embodies the role of \u201cconsumer.\u201d The mere fact that he consumes PayPal\u2019s services in order to facilitate a separate sale does not thereby negate his consumer status with respect to PayPal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">2. <em>Transaction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">This Court previously has recognized the broad scope of \u201cdebt\u201d in the FDCPA, agreeing with the Seventh Circuit that \u201c \u2018[a]s long as the transaction creates an obligation to pay, a debt is created.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Budget Rent-A-Car Sys. Inc., </em>119 F.3d 922, 924 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Bass v. Stolper, Koritzinsky, Brewster &amp; Neider, S.C., </em>111 F.3d 1322, 1325 (7th Cir.1997)) (holding that \u201cdebt\u201d in FDCPA does not require an extension of credit). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>have also stated that, \u201cat a minimum, a \u2018transaction\u2019 under the FDCPA must involve some kind of business dealing or other consensual obligation.\u201d <em>Hawthorne v. Mac Adjustment Inc., </em>140 F.3d 1367, 1371 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">I.C. System contends that PayPal provided no service to Oppenheim for which he refused to pay, and that Oppenheim\u2019s obligation to return the fraudulent funds to PayPal existed regardless of any contractual relationship with I.C. System. We take I.C. System to mean, therefore, that Oppenheim\u2019s failure to reimburse PayPal was not a \u201ctransaction\u201d and thus does not fall within the ambit of the FDCPA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In support of its contentions, I.C. System cites <em>Arnold v. Truemper, </em>833 F.Supp. 678 (N.D.Ill.1993). <em>Arnold </em>involved a bank that accidentally allotted a $20,000 credit to the plaintiffs\u2019 bank account when the plaintiffs had deposited only $2,000. <em>Id. </em>at 680. When the bank requested a return of the erroneously credited money, plaintiffs refused and ultimately filed suit alleging that the bank\u2019s collection attempts violated the FDCPA. <em>Id. </em>at 680-81. The district court, however, ruled that the complaint failed to state a claim because the improper credit did not arise out of any transaction and thus did not constitute a \u201cdebt\u201d under the FDCPA. <em>Id. </em>at 685-86. <em>See also Orenbuch v. Leopold, Gross &amp; Sommers, P.C., </em>586 F.Supp.2d 105, 108 (E.D.N.Y.2008) (obligation to refund erroneously paid salary, due to accounting error, did not arise from a consumer transaction and therefore not a \u201cdebt\u201d under the FDCPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In this case, however, the district court correctly distinguished <em>Arnold </em>because Oppenheim\u2019s payment obligation did arise from a transaction. The factual scenario here would be more analogous to <em>Arnold </em>had Oppenheim set up a PayPal account and, without Oppenheim having used PayPal\u2019s services to transmit any funds, PayPal improperly credited his account. Here, however, Oppenheim had utilized PayPal\u2019s services in a transaction and, according to the terms of that transaction, was under a contractual obligation to repay the money. <em>See </em>PayPal User Agreement \u00b6 4.5 (stating that, under PayPal\u2019s right of reversal, PayPal user is liable for full amount of invalidated payment). Oppenheim\u2019s transaction with PayPal did not cease upon the transfer of funds to his account; rather, he remained under a continuing contractual obligation to refund any invalidated payments \u2014 an obligation which arose from the transaction itself. By contrast, there is no indication that the plaintiffs in <em>Arnold </em>or <em>Orenbuch </em>had a contractual obligation dictating their liability in the event of any overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Contrary to I.C. System\u2019s contention, <em>Arnold </em>and <em>Orenbuch </em>do not stand for the proposition that one who improperly receives money does not incur a \u201cdebt\u201d subject to the FDCPA. Rather, they stand for the proposition that a consumer\u2019s obligation must arise from a \u201ctransaction\u201d in order for the FDCPA to apply. In this case, Oppenheim\u2019s obligation to PayPal amply meets that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">3. <em>Primarily for Personal, Family, or Household Purposes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\"> I.C. System also argues that the funds at issue do not satisfy the FDCPA requirement that they be \u201cprimarily for personal, family, or household purposes,\u201d since the transaction served a commercial purpose. <em>See </em>Reply Br. at 5-7. This issue was not clearly raised in I.C. System\u2019s initial brief and is thus waived. <em>See McGinnis v. Ingram Equipment Co., </em>918 F.2d 1491, 1496 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cA party normally waives its right to argue issues not raised in its initial brief.\u201d). In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>event, we are unpersuaded that the sale of Oppenheim\u2019s <em>personal </em>computer \u2014 the funds from which were ultimately transferred to Oppenheim\u2019s <em>personal </em>bank account \u2014 violates the \u201cpersonal, family, or household purposes\u201d requirement. Oppenheim does not run a business and specifically registered his PayPal account as a \u201cpersonal account,\u201d which the User Agreement defines as an account \u201cused for non-business purposes and used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d PayPal User Agreement \u00b6 15.aj.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">\n<em>C. Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The FCCPA definition of \u201cdebt\u201d is identical to that found in the FDCPA. <em>Compare </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.55(1) <em>with </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5). Furthermore, the FCCPA specifies that, in construing its provisions, \u201cdue consideration and great weight shall be given to the interpretations of the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts relating to the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.77(5). On appeal, I.C. System does not contend that Oppenheim\u2019s FDCPA claim should be treated differently from his FCCPA claim. Since the district court did not err in denying I.C. System summary judgment on Oppenheim\u2019s FDCPA claim, the court also correctly denied I.C. System summary judgment on Oppenheim\u2019s FCCPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">III.
