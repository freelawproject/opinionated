Thyll, and to give credit to such note, and the plaintiff then cashed the same. Her answer herein alleges several counterclaims for board of plaintiff\u2019s family and friends by defendant. Plaintiff denied such counterclaims under such general denial. We think he proved that the claim for board embraced, in such counterclaims was due to said Thyll, and was paid in full to him. It was proper for the plaintiff, under the general denial, to show that the claims mentioned were due to another, and were paid. It was not necessary for him in his reply, as defendant contends, to allege accord, satisfaction, and payment of the counterclaims set up by the defendant. By his general denial he denied the existence of the same, and showed by evidence, as he has a right to do, to whom the claims mentioned were due, and the settlement thereof later. For the same reason it was proper to put in evidence the advertisement issued by Thyll, seeking for boarders at the place wherein defendant claims she conducted an hotel or boarding house, and it was also proper to show by the testimony, of the other boarders at the place in question with whom they made their arrangements for board, and to whom they paid their debt for such board. Such testimony tended to corroborate plaintiff\u2019s testimony that Thyll, and not the defendant, was the hotel or boarding-house keeper. We think that the record clearly shows that the note in suit was not paid by the defendant, and that the plaintiff was not indebted to her for board, but, on the contrary, such indebtedness was due Thyll, and was fully paid to him. We have examined the record carefully, and find that no error was committed, and the judgment therefore must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
