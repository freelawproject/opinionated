The section last quoted must be construed as providing that the \u201cnotice therefor\u201d (i. e. a new trial) is given when a stay of proceedings is obtained for the purpose of making a case and exceptions preparatory to making a motion for a new trial; and the making of a case and exceptions by the plaintiff, and the service of the same, and the preparing and serving of amendments thereto, for the purpose of making a motion for a new trial upon the case and exceptions, constitute a \u201cnotice therefor,\u201d within the provisions of the section last quoted, and after such notice has been given the entry of judgment does not prejudice a subsequent motion for a new trial. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1005. There was no necessity, therefore, for the court to set aside the notice of entry of judgment in this case, for the reason that the defendant was duly notified of the plaintiff\u2019s intention to move for a new trial herein upon case and exceptions, which was afterwards done. The motion was made, therefore, within the time allowed by the 'Code of Civil Procedure, and the order made thereon should be affirmed, on authority of McNally v. Insurance Co., 137 N. Y. 389, 33 N. E. 475, and Paltrovitch v. Insurance Co., 143 N. Y. 73, 37 N. E. 639, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
