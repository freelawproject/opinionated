Failing to record above saving, the machines to be removed free of all expense.\u201d Some 22 days after installation of the machines, and 27 days after the date of the contract, a time test, such as provided for, was made, showing an apparent saving of a little more than 15 per cent., and the slips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>recording- the result were signed \u2022 by one of the defendant's. ' It it claimed by the appellant.that this was conclusive of its performance of the contract, and that the defendants\u2019 subsequent expression of dissatisfaction, upon the ground that the 40 days\u2019 trial of the machines showed no actual saving, was without significance. It would seem that this provision for \u201cforty days\u2019 fair trial\u201d had some meaning, and that the whole question of the plaintiff\u2019s performance was not intended to rest upon a test made before the expiration of that time. \u25a0 It may be that the agreement should be construed as intending that the test was a \u201cdemonstration\u201d to which the consumer was entitled, but that the value of the machine, as an economizing agent, should be shown by a continued practical use for the full period stated. Discussion of the subject is not essential, however, in this case, since ample evidence justified the conclusion that the parties had agreed to abide the result of the 40 days\u2019 trial as shown by the state- of the defendants\u2019 gas bills at the expiration of that time, and it was satisfactorily made .to appear that the machines, as so tested, had brought about an additional expense, rather than effecting a saving. If this evidence was open to the objection that it tended to vary the written contract, no such objection was raised at the trial, and we are to assume that the plaintiff consented that this proof of the actual agreement made should be received. As admitted to the case, this evidence was properly to be considered by the justice when reaching his conclusion upon the facts (Crane v. Powell, 139 N. Y. 379, 34 N. E. 911); and the result, as based upon that evidence, is found to be unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Judgment affirmed,, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
