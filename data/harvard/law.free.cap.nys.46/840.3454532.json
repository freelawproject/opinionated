The application was based alone upon the petition of the assignee, and the order made therein extending his time to file his schedule. It did not appear that the applicant had any standing in court to make the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
