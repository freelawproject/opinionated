To sustain their plea, the defendants offered in evidence a summons issued from the Fifth district court, November 27, 1896, returnable December 8, 1896, in an action by the plaintiff against the defendants herein. Indorsed on the summons is an affidavit proving its service on one of the defendants, and upon the face of the process appear these words: \u201cPlaintiff appeared A. H. Sarasohn. Complaint, wages and money laid out and expended.\u201d It appears that on the return day of said summons the plaintiff failed to appear, the process server not having notified Mr. Sarasohn that service had been effected. The defendants appeared by attorney on the return day, but, the trial fee not having been paid, the cause was not on the calendar, and was not called; whereupon the defendants\u2019 attorney departed from the court house, and the action was allowed to abate,\u2014that is, to cease, terminate, or come to an end prematurely. Bouv. Law Diet. The defendants might, if they had so desired, have presented the copy of the summons to the justice, and had the action called and dismissed, with costs. Risk v. Uffelman, 7 Misc. Rep. 133, 27 N. Y. Supp. 392. They did not choose to, adopt that course, but the action terminated as effectually as if they had done so. Section 1366 of the consolidation act provides that, \u201cif the plaintiff fail to appear at the return of the summons and make his complaint, the action must be dismissed.\u201d There is no power to continue it by adjournment or otherwise. Cow. Treat. (Kingsley\u2019s Ed.) \u00a7 1227. As the defendants did not elect to have the action dismissed, the plaintiff\u2019s neglect to keep the case properly before the court amounted to a discontinuance thereof. See 5 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 674; also, Gold v. Bissell, 1 Wend. 213. This is the rule applicable to inferior jurisdictions. In contemplation of law, therefore, the action the pendency of which is pleaded in bar effectually terminated, and was unavailing as a defense in abatement of the present suit, which was commenced by new process issued December 24, 1896, over two weeks thereafter. The justice decided, however, that the former action was then pending, and was for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>that reason a bar to this one, and rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiff's complaint, with costs. This was error, for which the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
