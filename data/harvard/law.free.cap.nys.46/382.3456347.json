The answer denies these allegation s, except that it alleges that defendant did not on that day do anything to plaintiff except defend himself from the attacks of plaintiff, and sets up a counterclaim for damages for an assault made by the plaintiff upon defendant on the same day and at the same place, against which defendant defended himself as aforesaid. The answer sufficiently connects the subject of the counterclaim with the subject of the action. The subject of both was the affray between plaintiff and defendant on the day and at the place alleged. A tort can be counterclaimed in an action in tort, if it is connected with the subject of the action. Carpenter v. Insurance Co., 93 N. Y. 552. In an action for damages for defendant\u2019s negligence in driving his wagon against plaintiff\u2019s wagon the defendant may counterclaim for damages to his person and property occasioned by the same collision, and which he claims was caused by plaintiff\u2019s negligence. Heigle v. Willis, 50 Hun, 588, 3 N. Y. Supp. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">The order and interlocutory judgment are affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
