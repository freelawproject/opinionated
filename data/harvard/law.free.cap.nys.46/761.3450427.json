H. Hammond &amp; Co., to Induce him to sell to defendant upon credit a quantity of meat. It is shown that when defendant, on or about March 16, 1896, applied to purchase the meat in question, the agent refused, unless defendant would give security. Defendant thereupon stated to such agent that one Gustave Levor stood behind him, and backed him for all bills, and would guaranty the payment; that Levor had told him to tell G. H. Hammond &amp; Co. that he would be responsible for all meat he (defendant) got; that Levor was away from home then, but would return soon, and the agent could then see him; that he (defendant) was responsible himself, but that Levor would stand between him and the company in the matter. The agent, relying upon such statements, sold and delivered to defendant meat at divers times between that date and May 29, 1896, of the value of $53.87, no part of which has ever been paid for. Soon after he got the meat, defendant gave a bill of sale of all his property to his wife. What his property consisted of, or what was its value, does not appear. The plaintiff claims as the assignee of G. H. Hammond &amp; Co., and the justice rendered a judgment in his favor for $55.37 damages and $3.30 costs. The county court affirmed such judgment, and from such judgment of affirmance this appeal -is brought.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b780-7\">Argued before PARKER, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axn\">Upon the trial of this action the only evidence that Levor did not \u201cstand behind defendant,\u201d and authorize him to tell G. H. Hammond &amp; Co. \u201cthat he would be responsible for all the meat got,\u201d was the testimony of the agent \u201cRau\u201d to the following effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">\u201cSoon after May 29, I saw Mr. Levor, and told him what defendant had said. Mr. Levor said he never told defendant to tell us he would be responsible for the meat, and he would not be responsible for it, and would not pay for it, and that the statements made by defendant were false, and defendant knew them to be false when he made them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">Thus, the justice decided that the statements which defendant made were false and fraudulently made, upon the unsworn statement of Levor, made in response to a demand that he pay for the meat sold. Levor himself did not appear and testify that they were false, but he told the witness Rau that they were. True, this hearsay evidence was given without objection on defendant\u2019s part; but, nevertheless, after it is received and is before the court, it does not furnish any proof that defendant\u2019s statements were false. It is proof only that Levor told the witness that they were false. Levor\u2019s unsworn statements, out of court, are in no sense proof of the facts which he so states.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">But the respondent seeks to justify this evidence, and give it the force of proof, because defendant, when he made the statements, said to the agent that \u201cLevor was away from home then, but would return soon, and he [the agent] could then see him.\u201d It is claimed that this remark brings the case within the following rule, laid down in Stephen\u2019s Digest of Evidence (article 19), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>\u201cWhen a party to any proceeding expressly refers to any other person for Information in reference to a matter in dispute, the statements of that other person may be admissions as against the person who refers to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">The rule, so stated, is an approved one; but the reference to \u201cseeing\u201d Levor, above quoted, does not make it applicable to this case. If, after the agent had taken the position that he had been defrauded by reason of defendant\u2019s statements being false, the defendant had referred him to Levor as to their truth or falsity, the above rule would be applicable. Under such circumstances, defendant would be authorizing Levor to speak for him, and Levor\u2019s statements would be equivalent to defendant\u2019s own admissions; but the reference to Levor, as actually made, was not at all of that character. Ho dispute then existed. It was not a reference to Levor as to whether defendant was then telling the truth or not. It was but a suggestion that Levor would soon return, and then the agent, if he preferred, could make the deal directly with him. The defendant wanted a continuing credit for meat to be delivered in small quantities, at various times in the future; and the statement that the agent could very soon see Levor himself was but equivalent to saving: \u201cIf you do not want to deal with me now, wait and get authority directly from him.\u201d It was a suggestion that Levor would, if applied to, speak for himself as to whether he would \u201cback\u201d defendant, and the extent to which he would do so, and undoubtedly tended to induce belief on the agent\u2019s part that defendant was telling the truth; but it was not by any means authority to Levor to declare for defendant that the statements he was then making were false. In order to render one party responsible .for the declarations of another under such circumstances, the authority to make them should be plainly conferred. Lambert v. People, 76 N. Y. 220. In the case at bar, defendant\u2019s statement that the agent could \u201csee Levor,\u201d under the circumstances in which they were made, conferred no authority upon Levor to speak for any one but himself. It was, of course, an essential element of plaintiff\u2019s right to recover that the statements made by defendant, and on which the agent relied, were false. This fact he has failed to establish by any legitimate proof, and for that reason the judgment against defendant cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The judgment of the county court and of the justice is reversed, with costs. All concur, except HERRICK and HERWIH, JJ., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
