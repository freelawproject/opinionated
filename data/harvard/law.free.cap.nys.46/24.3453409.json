The order consolidating the actions should therefore have given to the plaintiff the right to tax such costs in each action as had accrued up to the -time of the malting of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">The order should therefore be reversed, without costs, and the motion for consolidation granted, as above stated, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
