There is no dispute except as to the goods delivered to two of the employ\u00e9s, Kelsey and Hawkins. Three questions are raised: (1) Whether, under the complaint, proof was admissible for the purpose of showing an arrangement between plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>and defendant for the furnishing by plaintiff to defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s of goods, and charging them to defendant, and showing that plaintiff, acting under this arrangement, furnished to the employ\u00e9s the goods in question, and charged them to the defendant; (2) whether the proof sustains the finding of such an agreement; and (3) whether the judgment before a justice of the peace between the same parties, for goods furnished under the same arrangement after the commencement of this suit, was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">1. The complaint is for goods sold and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant\" between certain dates. A bill of particulars was served, giving the items in detail. This bill is not in the case. It may be inferred from the evidence that in the books of the plaintiff, and in the bill as served, the name of the employ\u00e9 was entered in cases where it was claimed the goods were delivered to employ\u00e9s. Sales made under the arrangement as claimed by plaintiff were, in effect, made to the defendant, the same as if made upon the direct order oi defendant. It was an original undertaking on his part. The goods were at the time charged to defendant, and the referee finds that the sales were in fact made to the defendant. The findings of the referee on this subject are to be construed together. Ordinarily, facts may be pleaded as they actually exist, or according to their legal effect, at the option of the pleader. New York News Pub. Co. v. National Steamship Co., 148 N. Y. 39, 42 N. E. 514. The undertaking being original, the plaintiff might declare generally. Northrop v. Jackson, 13 Wend. 85. The defendant was not misled. The complaint, amplified as it was by the bill of particulars, was, I think, sufficient. See McMahon v. Sherman, 14 N. Y. St. Rep. 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">2. The finding of the arrangement, as claimed by the plaintiff, was, I think, sustained by the evidence. The evidence of the plaintiff himself supported it, and he was sustained by the judgment in the justice\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">3. Was the justice\u2019s judgment competent? It was between the same parties, and involved the question whether the arrangement, as claimed by the plaintiff in this action, was in fact made. Both sides agree that there was in fact but one arrangement. The goods claimed for in the justice\u2019s action were furnished to Kelsey, and under the same arrangement as claimed in this action, and it was in substance a continuance of the same deal. It is suggested that the arrangement was sworn to before the justice as being in April, 1894, at plaintiff\u2019s house; while in this action it was said to be in February, 1894, at plaintiff\u2019s store. Before the justice it was said to have been near the store, and in this action plaintiff, on being recalled, placed the date as about February or March, 1894. Clearly, the referee had a right to find that, as there was but one arrangement, the evidence in the two cases referred to the same arrangement. If, in an action for an installment of rent, the validity of the lease is questioned and established, the judgment is binding in actions for future installments (Ackley v. Westervelt, 86 N. Y. 452); so as to a contract for advertising (Ibbotson v. Sherman, 42 N. Y. Super. Ct. 478). The former judgment is evidence of the facts established thereby, though not pleaded. Krekeler v. Ritter, 62 N. Y. 372. See, also, Embury v. Conner, 3 N. Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>511; Doty v. Brown, 4 N. Y. 71. The fact that the. justice\u2019s suit was after the commencement of this action does not change the rule (Gates v. Preston, 41 N. Y. 113); nor that the subject-matter may be different (Castle v. Noyes, 14 N. Y. 329). The justice\u2019s judgment was, I think, admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur, except HERRICK, J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
