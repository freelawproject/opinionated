Judgment for plaintiff. From an order denying a motion to resettle case, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AWk\">Modified.</disposition>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b521-11\">Upon the trial of an action for personal injuries, the court admitted, against the objection of defendant\u2019s counsel, evidence of despondency and attempts to commit suicide by the plaintiff, on the assurance of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that it would be connected with the injury on which the action was based. Immediately after the introduction of the evidence, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to strike it out, saying that the facts were too meager to predicate anything on, and his motion was granted. At a later period of the trial, the following proceedings took place: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Before recalling the doctor, I don\u2019t think it is quite dear. There isn\u2019t any direct evidence of where the man struck when he fell off the truck. If your honor will permit me, I would like to recall one witness, and question him on that subject. The Court: There is no necessity for calling him back, unless you have another case to make. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: In asking these doctors questions, it is necessary that you should show where the injury to the man was. The Court: You mean how he fell? Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Yes, sir. It appears that he fell, and that he was on the truck; and it was found upon him. I don\u2019t think there is any place in the record where it specifically says where the man struck as he reached the pavement,\u2014on what part of his body he reached the pavement. The Court: In my judgment, the circumstantial inferences so point to his striking on his head that this may be as well given in evidence. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>.no.objection to anything of that kind. I wish to say to your honor this: That in-order that it would not be deemed an afterthought, that I deem it my duty to my client, in view of the evidence of despondency and suicide, to the withdrawal of which testimony I took an_exception, as the mischief had been done; I.ought to ask for the withdrawal of a juror on that ground, so as to keep myself clearly right on the record; and I do ask the court for that leave, on the ground that there has got to be, practically, a mistrial of this case. The 'Court: If Mr. Smyth consents to that, it will be done. If he don\u2019t, it will be Mr. Smyth\u2019s fault, for he brought out the testimony, and let it go. Plaintiff\u2019s \u25a0Counsel: I think the withdrawal of a juror is a matter that- should be addressed to your honor\u2019s discretion, and if your honor wishes to hear me as to whether there is enough in this case for the withdrawal of a juror. The Court: No; I did not make myself clear. You can keep things just as they are, with the chances for it being afterwards held that 1 should not have allowed that -evidence before the further evidence with which you said you would connect \u25a0it was given. If you don\u2019t want to\u2014 Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I do not. I had -a suggestion to make \u2018 on another point,\u2014on the same point. I want to find What your honor would do, and that might have some bearing on whether I would consent, and that is whether you will not charge the jury that they are to entirely disregard anything in that connection. The Court: I don\u2019t know \u2022whether I will or not. I will see to 'that when I come to charge the jury.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b522-8\">A verdict having been rendered for the plaintiff, the defendant appealed, and, in its proposed case, inserted the proceedings above set forth, which appeared on pages 62 and 63 of the proposed case. The court, on settlement of the case, struck out this passage of its own motion, without an amendment relating thereto; and, a motion for resettlement of the case in this and other respects having been denied, the defendant appealed.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b522-9\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
