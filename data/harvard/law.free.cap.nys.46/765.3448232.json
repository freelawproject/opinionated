H. Tamsen, as sheriff of the city and county of Hew York. The sheriff had levied upon the property in suit by virtue of certain writs of attachment issued at the suit of Jacob Lewis and Morris Fordinsky. The attaching creditors were subsequently made parties defendant on their application, but the complaint in replevin was afterwards dismissed as to them. The sheriff defaulted for want of an answer, and afterwards made a motion to be allowed to come in and defend, but the motion was denied. Subsequently, on motion of said Lewis and Fordinsky, an order was made directing the return of the property to the sheriff, and plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AgtL\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b783-11\">Argued before RUMSEY, WILLIAMS, PATTERSOH, O\u2019BRIEH, and PARKER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b783-12\">W.

The order dismissing that complaint reserved no right to make further application, and that order stands without modification. Subsequently, and on the 2d of October, 1896, a motion for the same relief which was granted herein was made at a special term held by Mr. Justice Russell, who denied the motion, and that order stands unappealed from and unreversed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>That order is a conclusive decision against the right o\u00ed the defendants to have the relief which they asked for here. The question as to the right to grant such relief in an action of a similar nature was submitted to the court in the case of Sheehan v. Golden, 85 Hun, 462, 33 N. Y. Supp. 109, in which it was held that the defendants other than the sheriff, upon dismissal of the complaint, were not entitled to judgment that the goods replevied he delivered to the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">For these reasons, the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
