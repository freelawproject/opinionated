The plaintiff replied to this answer, admitting all these allegations, but denying that the validity of the chattel mortgage was at issue in the action in the justice\u2019s court. Held, that this was a conclusive admission, which the court had no authority to disregard, that the right to the possession of the chattels had been tried in the former action, the judgment in which was conclusive, not only as to the questions actually litigated therein, but as to all which could have been litigated, including the validity of the chattel mortgage.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b636-4\">Appeal from trial term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-5\">Action by Chauncey A.

The case is certified to by the attorneys as containing the judgment roll and defendant\u2019s exceptions to the decision. From this record it appears that the plaintiff brought his action complaining that he had theretofore executed and delivered to defendant a certain chattel mortgage; that said chattel mortgage was usurious and void; that he furnished to the defendant board and lodgings upon the understanding that the value thereof was to be applied towards the amount due upon the said chattel mortgage; that the defendant refused to apply the same, excepting a small portion thereof. He further alleges that the amount due upon said bond and mortgage had all been paid, except the sum of $40, prior to the commencement of this action, and that plaintiff had tendered the sum of $40, and asked the defendant to sign a satisfaction of the mortgage; that the defendant refused such tender, and refused to sign such satisfaction. And he further alleges that on or about the 12th of December, 1896, in spite of the facts before set out, the defendant wrongfully took from the possession of the plaintiff the goods and chattels set out in said mortgage, together with other goods and chattels, and he still unjustly detains the same from the possession of the plaintiff, and has advertised the same for sale under said chattel mortgage; and demands judgment that said chattel mortgage be declared to be usurious and void, or, in case that it is found to be a valid mortgage, that it be decreed that defendant has lost his lien upon the property by reason of the said tender and payment, and that the defendant be restrained from disposing of or selling the articles so taken from the possession of the plaintiff, and that he be required to return the same to the plaintiff, or, in the event of the same not being returned, that he be directed to pay the value thereof, which the plaintiff alleges to be the sum of $250. The defendant, in a supplemental answer to the plaintiff\u2019s \u2022complaint, among other things alleges: \u201cFirst. That the plaintiff herein, on or about December 18, 1895, commenced an action against this defendant in justice\u2019s court in Saratoga Springs, N. Y., for the return of certain personal property, or the value thereof, if not returned, which plaintiff claimed to have -owned, and that defendant had taken from plaintiff by virtue of the chattel mortgage set out in the complaint herein, without authority or consent of the plaifitiff. Second. That defendant, in said action in justice\u2019s court, denied said \u25a0complaint, and alleged said property was taken by him by virtue of the aforesaid chattel mortgage given by the plaintiff to defendant, under proceedings to foreclose said mortgage, and that the defendant had a right to take the said property on said mortgage claim.\u201d Such supplemental answer then proceeded to allege that the defendant\u2019s right to take such property by virtue of the sail? mortgage, and the validity of said mortgage given by plaintiff to defendant, were at issue in the justice\u2019s court, and that the validity of said mortgage was tried and passed upon in that action, and that the trial resulted in a ver\u25a0dict of no cause of action in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, thus establishing the defendant\u2019s claim that said mortgage was valid, and \u2022that the defendant had the right to seize, take, and sell said property under and by virtue of said chattel mortgage, and that judgment was entered in favor \u2022of the defendant and against this plaintiff, and pleads that such judgment of the justice\u2019s court now remains in full force and effect between plaintiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>defendant, and that by reason thereof plaintiff is estopped from contesting the validity of such mortgage. The plaintiff made reply to the supplemental answer, a portion of which is as follows: \u201cFirst. Plaintiff admits the first and second counts of said answer, except that portion of the first count in which it is alleged (hat defendant had taken from plaintiff by virtue of the chattel mortgage set out in the complaint herein, and as to that portion of said count the plaintiff has no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief, and therefore denies the same.\u201d In the second paragraph of the reply the plaintiff denies all the other counts in said answer, and each and every allegation thereof, \u201cexcept that plaintiff admits that the defendant\u2019s right to take said property was at issue in said action, and that a verdict of no cause of action was rendered against plaintiff on said issue, and judgment entered thereon, and the same is in full force and effect; the plaintiff hereby intending to deny and denying that the question of the validity of said chattel mortgage was at issue, or that said question was tried, passed upon, or determined in said action, or that plaintiff is estopped from contesting the validity of said mortgage herein.\u201d The case was tried during the October term of the supreme court in Saratoga county, and prior thereto, and on the 28th of September, the attorneys for the plaintiff and defendant entered into a stipulation, a portion of which is as follows: \u201cIt is admitted that the chattel mortgage, a copy of which is attached to the complaint in this action, is the same chattel mortgage that plaintiff introduced in evidence in the previous action in justice\u2019s court, * * * and which is referred to in defendant\u2019s supplemental answer in this action, and is the same.mortgage on which defendant claimed that he seized and advertised plaintiff\u2019s property for sale.\u201d On the 21st day of September the defendant made a demand upon the plaintiff for a bill of particulars \u201cof the items and each specific article of the \u2018other goods and chattels\u2019 which plaintiff alleges that defendant \u2018wrongfully took from the possession of the plaintiff,\u2019 together with the goods and chattels set out in said chattel mortgage.\u201d In response to that demand, plaintiff served upon the defendant\u2019s attorney a bill of particulars setting forth various articles of personal property, and concluding with these words: \u201cBeing the same articles set out in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint in the action heretofore tried between the parties hereto in the justice\u2019s court in the town of Saratoga Springs, N. Y., before William McNulty, Justice.\u201d The trial court made no finding as to the action in the justice\u2019s court, but found that the defendant, on or about the 12th of December, 1895, seized the goods and chattels mentioned in said mortgage, and took them from the possession of plaintiff, against his will, and without his consent and has not returned them to said plaintiff, and that the value of the goods was $200; and he also found that the chattel mortgage was void for usury, and should be set aside, and that the defendant, in taking such goods, mentioned in the mortgage, converted them to his own use against the right of the plaintiff and lawful owner and possessor, and that the plaintiff is entitled to the return of the same, or their value of $200, and, in case they cannot be returned, judgment should be rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in pursuance thereof, together with the costs of the action.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b637-5\">Argued before PARKER, P.

It therefore plainly appears that the right to the possession of these same articles in question here has heretofore been tried between the same parties in the justice\u2019s court; that the defendant there relied upon his right under-the chattel mortgage to take such property, and the rightfulness of that claim must have necessarily been passed upon by that court in determining the issue raised between the parties. These admissions-were matters of record in the case, and were conclusive upon the parties and the court, and the court had no authority to disregard them Dale v. Gilbert, 128 N. Y. 625, 28 N. E. 512. They have been made a part of the judgment roll filed in the case, and are certified to us as-part of the record upon which this appeal is to be heard, and we must so consider them. There is no pretense but what the justice\u2019s court had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter, and the-judgment rendered is conclusive between the parties upon every question necessarily embraced in the judgment, or upon every question within the issues that could have been litigated. Collins v. Bennett, 46 N. Y. 490; Malloney v. Horan, 49 N. Y. 111; Dunham v. Bower, 77 N. Y. 76; Reich v. Cochran, 151 N. Y. 122-127, 45 N. E. 367; Griffin v. Railroad Co., 102 N. Y. 449, 7 N. E. 735. It makes no difference-whether the question as to whether the mortgage was or was not usurious was passed upon in the former action. All questions as to-the validity of the mortgage were fairly up when the defendant justified the taking of the property by asserting his mortgage. The principal issue there, as here, was whether the defendant\u2019s taking of the property was or was not wrongful; and that question has been passed upon. When an action has once \"been determined, and when through lack of knowledge or by design the plaintiff has neglected or failed to-properly present the facts in his case, or to assert the proper reply to his adversary\u2019s defense or counterclaim, it would be intolerable to permit him to maintain another action for the same thing upon the plea that the facts he should have asserted and proved to maintain, his former action were not passed upon in such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">It appearing, therefore, from the record before us, that the subject-matter of this action has been litigated in a former action between, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>the same parties, and a judgment therein rendered, which stands unreversed, the judgment herein appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
