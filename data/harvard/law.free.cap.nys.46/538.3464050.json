Lumber Co. v. Abrahams, 19 Misc. Rep. 425, 43 N. Y. Supp. 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-17\">In Walter v. Mather, 10 Misc. Rep. 216, 31 N. Y. Supp. 111, the general term of this court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-18\">\u201cWhere the action has once been tried, and the judgment reversed at the in\u2022stance of the defendant, with costs to abide the event, the plaintiff will not be -permitted to amend the complaint, except upon payment of all the costs to date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-19\">In Ireland v. Railway Co., 8 N. Y. St. Rep. 127, the general term of the superior court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-20\">\"\u201cWhere an action was once tried, and the judgment entered in favor of plaintiff, which was reversed on appeal to the general term, with costs to the appellant to abide the event, and a new trial ordered, at which new trial the defendant objected to the sufficiency of the complaint, and plaintiff was allowed to amend on payment of twenty dollars costs, held that the plaintiff should have been ordered to pay the costs awarded to the appellant on the appeal, and $10, \u25a0costs of the motion, as the terms on which the amendment would be allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-21\">From the abo-ve decisions we drew distinctions between the cases where judgment was reversed with costs to abide the event, which means to either one of the parties who is successful, and with costs ,to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-22\">We think the judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the amendment herein, but should have allowed the same on payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the costs awarded to the appellant on the appeal. It may be that the amendment allowed herein will result in a verdict in favor of the defendant, in which event the plaintiff, appellant, will lose the costs of an appeal in which he was successful. We therefore amend the order appealed from herein by striking out the words, \u201c$20 and the disbursements taxed on the appeal in this action,\u201d and substitute in the place thereof the words, \u201cthe costs awarded t\u00f3 the appellant on the appeal, and $10, costs of the motion\u201d; and, as so modified, the order appealed from is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">P. S. We have looked at Whitehead v. Smack, 20 Misc. Rep. 229, 45 N. Y. Supp. 1150, but in that case the motion to amend the complaint was made before trial. It is therefore not agreeable to the facts in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">VAN WYCK, C. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
