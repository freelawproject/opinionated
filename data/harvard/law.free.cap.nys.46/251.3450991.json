It was not error to deny the nonsuit, nor to permit plaintiff to withdraw a juror, with leave to apply at special term for leave to amend the complaint. It was proper for the special term to permit an amendment of the complaint upon payment of $30 (the trial fee) to defendant. The defendant\u2019s motion, made at the opening of the trial, to dismiss the complaint because it did not state a cause of action, was properly denied, as the complaint did state facts sufficient to constitute a good cause of action. The orders are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">McCABTHY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
