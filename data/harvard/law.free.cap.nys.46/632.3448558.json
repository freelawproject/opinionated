The defendant and Ms wife were living to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>gether. There is evidence tending to prove that he had been in the habit of paying bills for goods purchased by his wife; and whether those in controversy came within such as might, in view of the station in life of the husband and wife, be deemed necessaries, and suitable for her, and whether his custom had been to permit her to make purchases for herself and to pay the bills himself, were questions of fact fairly submitted to the jury. And, while the evidence permitted the jury to find these facts in the affirmative, it did not require that conclusion. The difficulty in the way of sustaining the recovery arises upon the exception tajeen by the defendant to the reception in evidence of a letter written by the defendant\u2019s wife to the plaintiffs after the purchases were made, to the effect that she had been called upon by the plaintiffs\u2019 collector, <em>that </em>her husband would have to settle the bill, that she had no money except what he let her have, and that <em>it </em>had been so small in amount for the past few months as to render it impossible for her to pay bills; and added, \u201cKindly look to him for same, not to me.\u201d This letter was her mere declaration, distinct from the transaction of the purchase or delivery of the goods, and clearly incompetent as evidence. The statement of tin trial justice in the charge to the jury that the letter was put in evidence solely to show the delivery of the goods, and <em>that the </em>jury were not to take it as proof of any of the statements of fact contained in it, did not necessarily cure the error. The evidence was not stricken out. Mandeville v. Guernsey, 51 Barb. 99. Kor was it competent as evidence, against the husband, to show the delivery of the goods. It cannot be seen that the reception of the letter in evidence may not have had an effect prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">And therefore the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
