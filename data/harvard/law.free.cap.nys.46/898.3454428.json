One of these ballots was not counted at all, but was treated as void, because the mark within the circle at the head of the Democratic ticket was something more than merely a cross. The votes upon the other ballot for three of the four offices to be filled were counted, but it was treated as blank so far as the office of trustee was concerned. In respect to the three other offices, it was properly marked by a cross at the left of the names of the respective candidates for those offices which appeared in the Republican column. The Republican candidate for trustee was Charles H. Morgan, who intervenes in this proceeding. The Democratic candidate was Matthaus Bantel, the relator. No cross appeared in the proper place at the left of either of their names. But in the column upon the blank ballot which is provided for the use of such electors as desire to vote for nersons not formally nominated, and whose names are not printed thereon, a cross had been placed by the voter in the space at the left of the blank headed \u201cFor Trustee.\u201d No name, however, had been written under those words, and therefore the inspectors evidently deemed the mark a nullity. It had no meaning with reference to the column of blank spaces in which it appeared, and, if it was intended to be a vote for the relator whose name was in the next column, the mark should have been in that column, and at the left of the relator\u2019s name. The statute provides that the voter \u201cshall make a cross (x) mark in the voting space before the name of each candidate for whom he desires to vote, on whatever ticket he may be.\u201d Election Law, \u00a7 105, as amended by Laws 1896, c. 909. This mark was placed after the name of Mr. Bantel, and in a different and wholly distinct column.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>Upon the return of the order to show cause why the relator should 'not have a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the counting of these two ballots, Charles H. Morgan, the opposing candidate for the \u25a0 office of village trustee, was very properly allowed to intervene; and :the court compelled the production of the ballot box, and took the \u25a0oral evidence of one of the inspectors as to what had been their action ;in respect to the two ballots in controversy. After the proof was all \u25a0 in, it appeared that there was no material dispute of fact, and the case : as it finally came before the learned judge at special term for decision \u25a0was one where the applicant\u2019s*right to the mandamus, if it existed at all, depended only upon questions of law, and hence it was not necessary that an alternative writ' should first issue. 'Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 :2070.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The case of the ballot which the inspectors refused to count, because ' Hie cross mark in the circle at the head of the Democratic ticket was not as perfect as it might have been, came directly within the provisions of section 114 of the election law, as amended in 1896. It was a ballot which, to all intents and purposes, had been rejected as \u2022 void. I think that, upon its face it was a good ballot, and that it was the duty of the inspectors, as matter \u00bfof law, to count it. The deter\u2022mination of the court below as to this ballot was clearly right, and the order to that extent should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">I am unable, however, to take the view of the other ballot which was \u25a0 adopted at the special term. That ballot, as the inspector expressl; testified, was counted for the offices of president of the village, treasurer of the village, and trustee at large. It was merely treated as a blank, so far as it related to the fourth office of trustee, for which Mr. Bantel and Mr. Morgan were rival candidates. Assuming that this fact authorized the court to institute the investigation provided for by \u2022 section 114, in order to determine whether there appeared upon the ballot any vote for trustee which should be counted, I think the mere inspection of the ballot itself answers that question in the negative. ' The voter marked the ballot so as to manifest his choice effectively for \u2022 president and treasurer and trustee at large of the village; but, what- \u2022 ever may have been his intent in respect to the trusteeship for which Mr. Bantel and Mr. Morgan were rival candidates, that intent is not \u2022 disclosed in the slightest degree by the mark which he placed in the voting space in the column of blanks. There is just as much reason to infer that he meant to vote for some one whose name he inadvertently omitted to write in the place provided for that purpose, as there is to infer that he meant to vote for Mr. Bantel simply because the name of that candidate was in the next column, not far off. To \"make that mark effectual as a vote would, in my opinion, be to make the result of an election turn upon judicial guesswork, pure and simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-17\">The order should be affirmed so far as it applies to the ballot marked \u201cDelator\u2019s Exhibit B,\u201d and reversed so far as it applies to the ballot marked \u2018Delator\u2019s Exhibit A,\u201d without costs of this appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
