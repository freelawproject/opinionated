When he approached the Third avenue crossing he looked up and down the track. He noticed an uptown car just leaving Twenty-Third street,, and a car coming down about one-half to three-quarters of a block away from Twenty-Fourth street. His horse\u2019s head was then five feet away from the east or north-bound track. The plaintiff kept on across the avenue, but, before he could clear the westerly or downtown track, his hind wheel was struck by the downtown car, his wagon was jammed against a pillar of the elevated railroad, and he was thrown out of the wagon and received the serious injuries complained of. The plaintiff drove the horse to show an expected buyer how gentle it was. He was driving at the rate of S miles an hour, and when halfway across the west track the car was about 18 feet away from him. There is a down grade on the cable road at this point, and the car came so fast that there was no means by which the plaintiff could escape the collision. The plaintiff was certainly not guilty of contributory negligence per se. It was for the jury to say, under all the circumstances, whether he was free from any fault contributing to the injury, and they found in his favor on that issue. The degree of care to be used in crossing the tracks of a street railway is quite different from that which must be exercised in crossing a steam railway. Wendell v. Railroad Co., 91 N. Y., at page 429. At the intersection of streets the rights of street-railway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>-cars and of other vehicles are equal,\u2014the car, to the use of the track; and the other vehicles, to cross the tracks. \u201cThe car has the right -and must cross the street, and the vehicle has the right to cross and \u25a0must cross the railroad track. Neither has a superior right to the \u25a0 other. The right of each must be exercised with due regard to the right of the other, and the right of each must be exercised in a reasonable and careful manner, so as not unreasonably to abridge or \"interfere with the right of the other.\u201d O\u2019Neil v. Railroad Co., 129 N. Y., at page 130, 29 N. E. 84. Under this rule the plaintiff was \"..perhaps justified in assuming that, having once started across the track, the defendant would so regulate the speed of its car as to permit him to pass in safety. It appears that the owner of the wagon in which the plaintiff was driving on the occasion in question recovered damages against the defendant for injuries to the wagon. McDonald v. Railroad Co., 16 Misc. Rep. 52, 37 N. Y. Supp. 639. This court, in affirming the recovery, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-6\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s driver, proceeding along Twentj'-Fourth street, approached \u2019Third avenue from the east; and, when within five feet from the defendant\u2019s easterly car track, he observed a car upon that track approaching from a point one block distant, and another car approaching upon the westerly or downtown \u25a0 track at a distance of three-quarters of a block. When his wagon, driven at an ordinary speed, was upon the westerly track, this second car was suddenly dis- - .covered to be but 18 feet away; and, despite his efforts to escape, the collision occurred. * * * In view of the position of the vehicles, it was certainly not \"the plaintiff\u2019s duty to wait for the ear to pass. He had the right to rely upon 'the observance by the gripman of reasonable care when he attempted to cross the tracks at the point noted, and the attempt itself was obviously justified. The point where the question of the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of care arose was when the \u25a0car was three-quarters of a block away, not when it had come within 18 foot \u25a0of the wagon, through the entire disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s rights upon the part \u25a0of the individual controlling it. Were it negligence for a driver to attempt a \u2018Crossing under such circumstances, it might be urged that the highway in question were better closed to all except the employes of the railroad company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">The evidence in this case, as in that, clearly authorized the finding of the jury that the defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">The exception at folio 65 is frivolous. The court said to the plaintiff\u2019s attending physician, \u201cYou may describe at length what you found to be this man\u2019s condition,\u201d and the witness accordingly stated it. This was proper, and the exception thereto unavailing. The complaint specifically charged that, in consequence of the injuries, the \u25a0plaintiff was \u201cmade sick, sore, and disabled\u201d; and the physician who \u2022attended him was properly allowed to describe the nature and extent of the sickness and disability, and that is all he did. The defendant\u2019s counsel, on the conclusion of the charge to the jury, referring to this testimony, said, \u201cThat there is no evidence of pleurisy, and the jury may not consider pleurisy, as it had not been pleaded,\u201d to which the court replied, \u201cWhatever evidence has been given in regard to pleurisy is before you [the jury], and it is for you to attach such, importance to it as you think fit.\u201d To this the defendant excepted. The judge in his charge had not said a word about pleurisy, and the attention of the jury was first called to it by the defendant. Under the specific allegation in the complaint before referred to, the plaintiff\u2019s physician had described the plaintiff\u2019s physical condition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>and in doing so said he had been troubled with pleurisy and other ailments owing to the injuries. The description would not have been complete without this testimony, which was clearly competent. If the defendant desired an enumeration of all the ills the' plaintiff suffered on account of the injuries received, it should have applied for a . more specific bill, describing them in detail. In Ehrgott v. Mayor, etc., of N. Y., 96 N. Y. 264, at page 277, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-5\">\u201cUpon the trial, plaintiff gave evidence tending to show that he had a disease of the spine, of a permanent nature, as the result of his injuries. This evidence was objected to * * * on the ground that the plaintiff had not alleged such . a result from the injury in his complaint. We think the complaint is sufficient. It alleges that he suffered great bodily injury; that he became, and still continues - to be, sick, sore, and disabled,\u201d etc. * * * \u201cThese allegations are sufficient . to authorize proof of any bodily injury resulting from the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">The exception is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">At folio 68 the following question was objected to as incompetent: \u2022 \u201cFrom the condition that you found this man in, and the subsequent treatment you gave him, could you state with reasonable certainty what the injuries he received had come from?\u201d This question calls for \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d No motion was made to strike out the answer of ' the witness as not responsive, or upon any other ground, and defendant\u2019s objection is therefore unavailing. Vinegar Co. v. Schlegel, 143 N. Y., at page 543, 38 N. E. 729. If objectionable at all, it was merely as to the form of the question; and that was cured by the answer, which was accepted by the defendant. As a matter of fact, the witness\u2019 reply was in no respect prejudicial to the defendant, for he answered, \u201cTaking the history of the case, I should say undoubtedly - it was from this accident.\u201d But the question was competent, for a physician may tell whether the physical condition in which he found. an injured person could have resulted from an injury. Turner v. City of Newburgh, 109 N. Y. 301, 16 N. E. 344. In the case cited the court, at page 309, 109 N. Y., and page 347, 16 N. E., said, \u201cIt is perfectly competent to furnish the jury with evidence of the present physical condition and bodily sufferings, and with the opinions of\" competent physicians as to whether such could have\"resulted from the accident.\u201d See, also, Clegg v. Railway Co., 1 App. Div. 207, 37 N. Y. Supp. 130. In Thompson v. Railway Co., 11 App. Div. 182, 42 N. Y. Supp. 896, cited by appellant, the plaintiff sought to prove by - an expert\u2014not the attending physician\u2014what the plaintiff would \u2018 probably be suffering from in case a certain mode of treatment were \u2022 administered, and such evidence was properly held hearsay. The-difference between such a question and the one under consideration - is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">At the conclusion of the charge the defendant\u2019s counsel also said,. \u201cThat there is no evidence of permanent injury, and they may not find anything for permanent injury, if they find at all.\u201d The court replied, \u201cI instruct the jury that the plaintiff has not claimed in his \u2022 complaint damages for permanent injury, but I submit the evidence \u2022 as to his present condition to the jury for what it may \"be worth.\u201d' While it is the absolute right of counsel to submit propositions of law bearing on the evidence, and the duty of the court to instruct the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>on each proposition- (Chapman v. McCormick, 86 N. Y. 479), the rule stated does not require the court to put every abstract proposition that may be submitted, nor charge requests in the terms formulated by counsel. If the jury are correctly instructed as to the point, the party is not legally harmed by the departure. Morehouse v. Yeager, 71 N. Y. 594; Conley v. Meeker, 85 N. Y. 618. The justice instructed the jury, in effect, that the question of permanent damages was not in the case, because such damages were not claimed. This, in substance, covered the request the defendant desired put; and the jury, no doubt, properly understood it. It is not to be presumed that the jury allowed for something neither claimed nor proved. Nor does the amount of the verdict, which was for $750 only, justify the inference that the jury were in any manner misled by the charge. Moreover, the justice went further, and said, \u201cBut I submit the evidence as to his present condition to the jury for what it may be worth.\u201d This was proper, for it had been testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s physician, whose opinion on the subject was to be considered as the justice put it. The intention to exclude any recovery for permanent injuries is too apparent to require extended comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">We find no error, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
