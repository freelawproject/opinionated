The defendant occupied the flat during the free period, from October 1 to November 15, 1896, and during the following month, paying the rent to December 15, 1896, when she abandoned the premises; and the action is to recover two months\u2019 rent after that date. The issue litigated was whether the hiring was for a year, as plaintiff maintained, or for one month only after the gratuitous period expired, as defendant claimed. While the probabilities would seem to favor the plaintiff\u2019s contention that a yearly hiring was intended, the justice, on evidence which he had the right to believe, found the letting to be by the month only. The tenant testified positively that the hiring was by the month, and that she persistently refused to sign a lease acknowledging a tenancy for a longer period. Mr. Lewis, the plaintiff\u2019s main witness, testified to a yearly hiring; but he admitted the defendant\u2019s unwillingness to sign a lease, and stated that, in consequence, he instituted summary proceedings, under the statute, to remove her from the premises. In the petition filed to obtain the precept, Lewis swore that the defendant was a monthly tenant,\u2014a circumstance which the justice may have regarded as affecting his credibility. While the story told by the defendant as to the term of hiring is somewhat improbable, we cannot say that it is untrue or should have been discredited. The justice saw the witnesses, and observed their manner of testifying, and was on that account best qualified to pass upon the conflict presented. Upon the proofs before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>us, and particularly the opposing statements of the plaintiff's chief witness, we are unable to say that the justice erred in finding for the defendant upon the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
