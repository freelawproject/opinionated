J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYb1\">On the 27th day of July, 1891, the defendant executed and delivered to the plaintiff its policy of insurance upon the life of one Edward Fanning, who was a brother of the plaintiff. During the lifetime of Edward Fanning the plaintiff paid to, and tendered to, the defendant the amounts by the provisions of the policy required to be paid; and the defendant, by its policy, promised to pay to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>plaintiff, on the death of said Edward, if such death occurred after the expiration of one year from the issuing of the policy, the sum of $576. He died on the 26th of March, 1893, having lived more than one year after the issuing of the policy. The complaint alleges that the policy was issued to the plaintiff, \u00e1 sister of the said Edward, \u201cand she has ever since remained and now is the owner and holder thereof, and is entitled to payment thereon.\u201d The complaint further alleges that proofs of the death of Edward Fanning were delivered to the defendant, and that it denied its liability under said policy, and neglected and refused to pay to the plaintiff the amount due by the terms thereof. The answer of the defendant consisted of several denials, but admitted that it issued the policy on the 27th of July, 1891. It also alleged that the application \u201cwas not in fact\u201d signed by Edward Fanning. It also alleged that he was not present, and \u2018had no knowledge whatever that such application was being made, and knew nothing of the existence of said insurance, until long after the policy in question had been issued.\u201d It was also alleged in the answer that the policy of insurance \u201cwas procured from defendant by the plaintiff by false and fraudulent means, and by acting in collusion with one or more of defendant\u2019s agents in the perpetration of such fraud.\u201d Upon the trial evidence was given tending to support all the essential allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and also tending to negative the allegations of the defendant\u2019s answer, so far as the same relates to any affirmative matters. At the close of the evidence each party asked for the direction of a verdict. Therefore the questions of fact were for the court to pass upon, and he did so in ordering a verdict for the plaintiff; and, as neither party asked to have any question of fact submitted to the jury, the findings of fact made by the court, as evidenced by the verdict, should be sustained. Fogarty v. Hook, 84 Hun, 165, 32 N. Y. Supp. 555; Grogan v. Insurance Co., 90 Hun, 521, 36 N. Y. Supp. 687; Adams v. Lumber Co., 2 App. Div. 47, 49, 37 N. Y. Supp. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">2. The policy required the submission to the defendant of death proofs, and the same were prepared and executed by the plaintiff, and delivered to the defendant, and that fact was properly shown upon the trial; and it was proper to produce and offer in evidence such proofs to establish that the plaintiff had comnlied in that regard with the requirements of the policy. Helwig v. Insurance Co. (Sup.) 12 N. Y. Supp. 172, does not aid the contention of the defendant. In that case a statement accompanied the proofs of loss, and it was held that the statement could not be used as evidence against the plaintiff in an action on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">3. It is contended in behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the policy was a joint interest with one Rose McCabe. The complaint alleged that the nlaintiff was the owner of the policy, and the proofs showed that the policy and receipt book were delivered to her, and that she paid all the premiums. In the policy there was provision made that the production of the policy and the receipt book, \u201csigned by any person furnishing proof satisfactory to the company that he or she is * * * husband or wife, or relative by blood, lawful beneficiary of the insured, shall be conclusive evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>such sum has been paid to and received by the person or persons lawfully entitled to the same, and that all claims and demands upon said company under the policy have been fully satisfied.\u201d The name of Rose McCabe is not mentioned in the policy. The answer did not set up the defense of nonjoinder or misjoinder of parties plaintiff. Code 'Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 488, 498, 499. It has been repeatedly held that a defendant will waive his right to object to defect of parties plaintiff, not apparent upon the face of the complaint, by an omission to state the objection in the answer. People v. Telegraph Co., 31 Hun, 596. Besides, Rose McCabe was called as a witness at the trial, and testified expressly that she had no interest in the policy and made no claim thereto, and the effect of her evidence is to acquiesce in the sole ownership by the plaintiff of the policy and the moneys due thereon. Grogan v. Insurance Co., 90 Hun, 521, 36 N. Y. Supp. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">4. It appears by the evidence that, at the time the application was made for the insurance, the plaintiff and her sister were present, and that the agent who solicited the insurance, and who supervised the execution of the application, was made aware that the insured, Edward Fanning, could not write, and when the application had been filled out and completed, the sister, at his instance and in his presence, was asked to place his name to the application; and, although it was not written by his own hand, yet it seems to have had his assent; and there is no force in the contention of the defendant that the application or the policy should be avoided by reason of the circumstance that the signature to the application was written by the sister of the insured at his instance and with his consent. Some exceptions were taken during the trial which have received attention, but require no special comment. We are of the opinion that the trial judge was warranted in the conclusion which he reached, and which is evidenced by the verdict which he ordered. Ho counterclaim is set up in the answer, and no specific question was raised at the trial as to the amount the plaintiff was entitled to recover. Practically the amount recovered, as ordered, was acquiesced in and assented to by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We are of the opinion that the verdict, and judgment entered thereon, should be sustained, and that the order denying a motion for a new trial should also be sustained. Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
