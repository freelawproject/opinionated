They have believed the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, and found for them. It is not the rule, and there is no such law, that where a dispute arises, and only the plaintiff and the defendant were present, the plaintiff cannot recover, because he is interested. It is still a question for the jury, under proper instructions, which the appellant availed himself fully of.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-19\">Judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.
