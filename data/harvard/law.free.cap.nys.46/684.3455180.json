They having found, on the facts, against the defendant, and although the evidence was slight, it is enough to sustain the judgment. This was a toilet or urinal where they used some kind of chemicals to keep it clear and free from disagreeable odors. It was dangerous, and not a safe place for the plaintiff, who was not a plumber or professional mechanic. He had the right, not knowing or being informed of the use of any chemicals, to assume that it was safe in every part of it, which, as an actual fact, it was demonstrated it was not, and _which must be conceded it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">We think tlie defendant was clearly liable, and under the facts the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-18\">VAN WYCK, O.
