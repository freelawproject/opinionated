The assessors had jurisdiction of the subject of taxation, and of the relator, so far as the railroad was in the town. The general rule is that where a body of assessors have made the assessment, using their judgment, and not capriciously or in an arbitrary manner, the assessment will not be reviewed. People ex rel. Edison Electric Illuminating Co. v. Barker, 139 N. Y. 55, 34 N. E. 722; People ex rel. Edison General Electric Co. v. Barker, 141 N. Y. 251, 36 N. E. 196; People ex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>rel. Equitable Gas Light Co. v. Barker, 144 N. Y. 102, 39 N. E. 13. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the assessors are presumed to have done their duty. People ex rel. Manhattan Ry. Co. v. Barker, 146 N. Y. 304, 40 N. E. 996. Upon the evidence, the value put upon the land is not excessive. The railroad owns a strip of suburban and farm land adjacent to the city of Poughkeepsie, some 66 feet in width, and some 3 miles in length. The present corporation bought a road of 34 miles for $50,000 and over, on foreclosure, and at once put it in order, at an expense of $150,000, or about that sum. The road is not completed. Prom Stissing to Pine Plains it has not been built, but the corporation obtained a right to use the track of another road for that distance. At the actual cost paid for it at a recent sale, the road is worth for its whole length $6,000 a mile. A reasonable discrimination in favor of the town land next to the city of Poughkeepsie may properly be made, and it was made in respect to the two other roads running through the town. Under the proof given on the trial, the assessment appealed from cannot be reduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b903-5\">Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b903-6\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.
