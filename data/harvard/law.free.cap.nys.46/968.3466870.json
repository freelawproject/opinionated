The defendant paid $28 on the rent in three installments, the last payment being made as late as October 8, 1896, after the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>had complained of certain defects in the machine. The action was-to recover $22, the balance due. The defense was general denial and counterclaim of $28, but the nature or particulars of the- counterclaim were not given. It appeared on the trial that the defendant had been in the bicycle business for three years, and was an expert wheelman, with a thorough knowledge of bicycles; that he had possession of this particular machine for four months prior to the leasing thereof to Mm, and presumably knew more about its condition at the time than the plaintiffs. No representations were made by the plaintiffs respecting the condition of the bicycle, no warranty was given, and there is neither allegation nor proof of any fraud or deception on the part of the plaintiffs. The property remained in the defendant\u2019s possession during the entire term of the lease, and up to and at the time of the trial, which took place January 17, 1897. The plaintiffs apparently established a good cause of action for the balance of rent due; yet the justice found in favor of the defendant, and awarded him a judgment against the plaintiffs for $20, the wheel to be returned to the plaintiffs. We know of no legal principle upon which this recovery can be sustained. It seems that the defendant had made a profit of about $8 by letting out the wheel, and the justice evidently awarded the defendant the amount of his counterclaim, less tMs $8, as upon rescission of the contract, holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to nothing for the use of the wheel. There was no rescission of the contract. Nor was there anything in the contract or the proofs which authorized a rescission. The bicycle was not delivered on trial or approval, or even with warranty; and, as there was no fraud, there was nothing wMch authorized a return of the chattel. Voorhees v. Earl, 2 Hill, 288; Cary v. Gruman, 4 Hill, 625. The defendant testified to an offer to return the machine to Mr. Cohen, the plaintiff\u2019s collector; but there is no proof that Cohen had any authority to accept such an offer for the plaintiffs. In any event, he refused to accept the return, and that is all that was ever done in that direction. Whether the agreement is to be regarded as a lease or a conditional sale of the bicycle, the doctrine of caveat emptor controlled (Broom, Leg. Max. 746, 747), and there appears no legal reason why the plaintiffs should not have recovered the unpaid rent or purchase money. The fact that the bicycle got out of condition furnished no defense. The burden of keeping it in repair was cast upon the defendant by the express terms of the contract, and he was bound to keep it in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
