Upon its return the tenant appeared, and objected that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the court was without jurisdiction, for the reason that Saturday, after 12 o\u2019clock noon, is a half holiday. The objection was overruled, and on failure of the tenant to file an answer a final order was made awarding possession of the demised premises to the landlord, pursuant to the statutory requirements. The objection is based upon the provision of chapter 289 of the Laws of 1887 (amending Laws 1875, c. 27, as amended by Laws 1881, c. 30), which makes Saturday after 12 o\u2019clock noon a half holiday. The provision is limited in its application, however, to public offices of the state and counties of the state, and a court is not a public office with the meaning of the act. People v. Kearney, 47 Hun, 129; Didsbury v. Van Tassell, 56 Hun, 423, 10 N. Y. Supp. 32; In re Bornemann, 6 App. Div. 524, 39 N. Y. Supp. 686; Berthold v. Wallach, 14 Misc. Rep. 55, 35 N. Y. Supp. 208. The act of 1892 (chapter 681, \u00a7 41) is for the same, reason inapplicable. The Saturday half holiday is not dies non juridicus, and does not prevent courts from continuing their sessions, and performing any judicial business which may come before them. The objection to the justice\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding or proceed to final order therein was therefore without merit, and properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Order confirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">BISCHOFF, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
