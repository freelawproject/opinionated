On the trial the defendant sought to show (1) that the plaintiff had not fulfilled the provision of the contract which required him to break up the rock into building stones small enough for two men to lift each piece; and (2) that the \u25a0'3,475 cubic yards of rock actually excavated included a considerable quantity taken from a lower level than that specified in the contract as the desired depth of the excavation. The trial court allowed the defendant to put in his proof in support of the first proposition, but excluded all evidence tending to prove that a portion of the excavation was below the depth designated in the contract, holding that .no such defense had been pleaded: In this ruling, I think the learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>judge was right. The complaint alleged that \u201cat South Mount Vernon, in the county o\u00ed Westchester, in the state o\u00ed New York, between and including the 4th day of April, 1891, and the 25th day of July, 1891, both inclusive, the plaintiff rendered and performed certain work, labor, and services for the defendant, consisting of the blasting, excavating, and removing of three thousand four hundred \"and seventy-five cubic yards of rock.\u201d This allegation was not denied. In the second subdivision of the answer the defendant set out the contract substantially in accordance with its terms as proved upon the trial, and then proceeded to aver \u201cthat the work, labor, and services done bv the plaintiff for the defendant, and alleged in the complaint, were done and performed under and in pursuance of the said contract, and not otherwise.\u201d Here was the clearest sort of admission and averment that the 3,475 cubic yards of excavation, for which the plaintiff was seeking payment, was work done under the contract between the parties; and, if so, it must have been work for which the plaintiff was entitled to be paid. With such a statement in his pleading, the defendant could not properly be allowed to prove that a portion of this very work was done outside the contract, and hence should not be paid for. It seems probable that the importance of this defense was not impressed upon the mind of the learned counsel for the appellant when he drew the answer, as so skillful a pleader would hardly have omitted to state it in a form which would admit of no doubt as to the meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
