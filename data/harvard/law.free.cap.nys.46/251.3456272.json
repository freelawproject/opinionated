The motion at special term was granted upon condition that plaintiff within 10 days pay $30 to defendant\u2019s attorney, and it is from the order granting the motion that \u2022defendant now appeals. The amendment, if necessary, should have been allowed at trial, and its allowance at special term was a proper exercise of discretion, for it does not change the cause of action, which is still in replevin. The order is affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">SOHUCHMAN, J.,' concurs.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
