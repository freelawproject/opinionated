The receiver took possession of the property of the defendant on or about the 7th of April, 1893. He made an inventory, and. put two persons, employed by him, in charge of the property. It would seem that the sheriff\u2019s claim for the fees of the three persons said to have been employed by him as keepers is for services of such keepers subsequent to the receiver taking possession. There is no-satisfactory proof of any kind, as against this receiver, that the sheriff\u2019s alleged keepers were ever in possession after the receiver took, the property, or that they actually rendered any service in watching or taking care of that property. That those three persons recovered judgments against the sheriff for services as keepers does not affect the matter in any way. Those judgments are not binding-upon the receiver, nor is the fact that the sheriff merely levied prior to the appointment of the receiver decisive of the matter. The right to charge keepers\u2019 fees does not result from a levy, but from necessary or proper services duly proven to have been rendered. On these-papers, we have no other course to pursue than to reverse the order; but, under all the circumstances of the case, we think the executrix-of the sheriff should have an opportunity to present her claim fully to the court; and for that reason the order will be reversed, with costs,, with permission to make a new motion on proper papers, and on payment of costs of the motion in the court below and of the appeal im this court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
