Supplementary proceedings are special proceedings, and the court has not, and cannot confer, greater jurisdiction than what is conferred by statute. The established rule of law is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-15\">\u201cWhenever a substantial dispute arises as to the ownership of a certain fund between rival claimants, the court cannot settle such dispute in supplementary proceedings, but should leave the parties to their action.\u201d Krone v. Klotz, 3 App. Div. 587, 38 N. Y. Supp. 225.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">The facts in this matter reveal substantial dispute. The respondent may apply for the appointment of a receiver, who can bring an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-17\">Order appealed from reversed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
