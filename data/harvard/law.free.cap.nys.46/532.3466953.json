Fisher. The terms of the wager are in the defendant\u2019s handwriting, as follows: \u201cIf Bryan is elected, Frank Miller pays Liebman $400.\u201d This writing was headed by the words: \u201c$100.00 received. Exchange memorandum of election bet between J. Liebman and F. Miller.\u201d It is quite apparent from this writing, and from defendant\u2019s letter to plaintiff dated October 19, 1896, and also from his verbal statement made to plaintiff, all of which appears in the printed record, that defendant acted as stakeholder of the above wager. That an actual wager was made between plaintiff and Fisher concerning the election of a president of the United States, and which was not yet determined, is apparent. The transaction in question was clearly a wager, and the defendant a stakeholder, within the meaning of the law. 1 Rev. St. p. 662, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9. The plaintiff's right to recovery of the fund deposited by him with defendant is clear. He was not bound to commence his action to recover the same within three months after such delivery, for section 14 of the act just referred to does not apply to wagers of this kind, but only playing or betting upon \u25a0 any game. This transaction was not a wager or bet upon a. game, but was upon an event which was at the time of the making of such wager an unknown or contingent event, and therefore does not. apply as the appellant asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">Upon the whole record, in our judgment, the trial justice was right in directing a verdict for the plaintiff, and the judgment therefore is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">SOHUGHMAN..
