And, moreover, it appears that, at the request of counsel for both parties, the learned trial justice made a personal inspection of the premises in question, so that his findings of fact in the case must be deemed sufficiently fortified to relieve this court of the necessity of reviewing them; and it only remains, therefore, to determine whether they will support the legal conclusions upon which the judgment appealed from is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The learned counsel for the defendant appears to regard this as a case involving the relative rights of adjoining riparian owners, and directs attention to the rule which permits one riparian proprietor to use the waters of a stream passing by his land, even to the extent of diminishing the quantity or retarding or accelerating the flow thereof, to his neighbor\u2019s detriment, provided such use may, in the circumstances of a particular case, be regarded as reasonable. The existence of such a rale as the one relied upon by the counsel cannot, of course, be denied (Gould, Waters, \u00a7 208; Prentice v. Geiger, 74 N. Y. 341; Herman v. Roberts, 119 N. Y. 37, 23 N. E. 442); but the difficulty in the case arises from the attempted application of the same to the facts as found.</p>\n<p id=\"AGl\">This, as we regard it, is not a controversy involving the right of riparian owners to the reasonable use of the water of a stream, nor is any complaint made that the defendant\u2019s use of the water in question is unreasonable; but the gist of the action is that, after the defendant has used the water to which it is entitled, it discharges the same upon the plaintiffs\u2019 premises in an unlawful manner. The plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is therefore one in which the rule invoked by counsel will not aid the defendant, for the acts complained of, if proven, amount to an interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 rights which can only be justified by establishing a superior right in the defendant, and one which must, of necessity, have been acquired either by grant or prescription. Although no such defense is pleaded in the answer, some attempt was made upon the trial to prove that the defendant did acquire the right to discharge water upon the premises of the plaintiffs, in the manner and to the extent it is now discharging the same, by virtue of a deed from one McCracken, the common source of title to all these premises; but it appears that this deed grants nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>more than a water privilege, and the defendant is consequently forced into the position of claiming that such a grant must be so construed as to convey by implication the right to discharge the water in whatever manner will prove most beneficial to the enjoyment of the right granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We think that the mere statement of this proposition exposes its fallacy, and we therefore proceed to a brief consideration of the single question involved in this controversy, which is whether or not the defendant has acquired a prescriptive right to discharge the waters from its tail race upon the premises of the plaintiffs, to their annoyance and injury. It is, of .course, a familiar rule that a user of real estate which is in the nature of an easement ripens into an absolute right only by an adverse, continuous, and uninterrupted enjoyment thereof for a period of 20 years (Prentice v. Geiger, supra); and, moreover, that such enjoyment or user must be without substantial change for the same length of time. As was held in an early case, where this subject was under consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cThe erection of a milldam on one\u2019s own land, and flowing a neighbor\u2019s land for more than twenty years uninterruptedly, bars all right of action in the neighbor, but only for the dam as it stood. If it be raised and the flow increased within twenty years, an action lies.\u201d Russell v. Scott, 9 Cow. 279.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">And this doctrine has been ,too often reiterated by the courts of this state, and is now too firmly established, to require the citation of any authorities in its support. i</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">It would seem, therefore, that, before the value of this contention upon the part of the defendant can be determined, reference must once more be had to the established facts of the case. As has already been stated, it was found by the trial court, upon evidence which was ample to support the finding, that the water discharged by the defendant upon the plaintiffs\u2019 premises was materially increased in quantity and velocity by the introduction of the Eodney-Hunt wheel and the siphon in the year 1887 or 1888; and this fact, within the rule to which we have adverted, necessarily disposes of the defendant\u2019s claim that the act complained of does not constitute an invasion of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights, but is simply an enjoyment of a right which the defendant has acquired by prescription. We are led, therefore, to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
