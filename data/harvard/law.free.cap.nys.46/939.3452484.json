Witnesses called for the plaintiff testified to the fact that the animal had been unguarded by its driver, the defendant\u2019s servant, for some time prior to the accident in question, and therefore the defendant\u2019s negligence was proven sufficiently to support the recovery in this aspect. Wasmuth v. Butler, 86 Hun, 1, 33 N. Y. Supp. 108; Dickson v. McCoy, 39 N. Y. 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-19\">It is claimed for the appellant, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s act in placing his bicycle in front of this unguarded horse was negligence upon his part, obviously contributing to the injury, and that, for this, the complaint should have been dismissed. Had the plaintiff observed the driver\u2019s absence from the wagon when leaving his bicycle as he did, his right of recovery might be open to discussion; but his testimony was to the effect that at this time he did not observe whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>the driver was or was not present, and only when he removed the machine from the street, after the damage was done, did he notice that the horse was unattended. At most, it was a question of fact whether he should have ascertained in the first instance that the horse was under its driver\u2019s control. Certainly, it cannot be said, as matter of law, that such was his duty, for, indeed, he could have assumed that the defendant so operated its wagon that its duty to exercise ordinary-care towards persons also using the highway was property observed. That this stationary vehicle would become a thing of danger through the defendant\u2019s negligence was not for him to anticipate. The absence of contributory negligence, therefore, was readily to be found from the evidence, and the sole ground upon which this appeal is based becomes untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
