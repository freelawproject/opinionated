The questions arise upon three counterclaims pleaded by Abeles, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-23\">1. Part of the property belonging to the business sold consisted of certain fixtures, and the price put upon them at the sale was $100. The bill of sale contained the usual warranty of title. The vendee claimed that these fixtures belonged to the landlord of the store at Altoona, and not to Wolf, the vendor; and the jury so found, and on that account deducted $100 from the plaintiff\u2019s demand. The deduction was warranted by the finding of the jury; for the rule is that, where there is a total failure of title on the part of the vendor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>the vendee may rescind and recover back his advances (Story, Sales, \u00a7 203), or he may abandon the property to the true owner, taking upon himself the onus of proving title in such owner (Sweetman v. Prince, 20 N. Y. 224), The fixtures are still in the store, which is occupied by Abeles, and she has acknowledged the right of the landlord to them, and, as far as surrender thereof is possible, has given them to him. She cannot take them out and deliver them to him physically, because he wants them where they are, as an incident to his ownership of the realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">v 2. The plaintiff sold certain other personal property to the defendant Abeles, including what are called \u201cbranded goods,\u201d which were represented to be O. K., in good order, and salable. They were proven <em>to </em>be unsalable, not in good order, and almost valueless. The doctrine of caveat emptor, invoked by the plaintiff, does not apply where the vendor has been guilty of fraudulent representations. Story, Sales, \u00a7 378. The jury allowed the vendee as damages for such fraud and breach the sum of about $30, which with the $100 before referred to made $130, and gave the plaintiff a verdict for the balance of his claim, amounting to $20; and it is from the judgment entered on this verdict that the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">3. The third counterclaim for damages on the sale of the accounts was disallowed, and may be considered out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The maker and indorsers of the note having been sued together, a successful recoupment by the former inures to the benefit of the latter. Springer v. Dwyer, 50 N. Y. 19. The case appears to have been fairly tried. It was submitted to the jury on conflicting evidence.by an impartial charge, and their finding is warranted by the evidence.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">There is no merit in the exceptions, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
