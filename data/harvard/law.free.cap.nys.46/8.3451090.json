It is sufficient to say that he was then appointed, and from that time until his summary discharge by the respondents, on the 31st day of January, 1896, was a de facto police officer of Long Island City. The relator was an honorably discharged soldier of the late war. In the case of People v. Board of Health of City of Troy, 15 App. Div. 273, 44 N. Y. Supp. 597, it was decided by the appellate division of the Third department that a veteran could not be.removed from his position or employment except after a hearing upon notice, even though his original appointment was unlawful. It was held that he had a right to a hearing upon the very question of the legality of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>appointment. This authority is conclusive of the disposition of the case before us. The summary removal of the relator was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
