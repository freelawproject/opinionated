This agreement could not and would not affect the plaintiff unless brought home to his notice, and that said work was performed with a knowledge of such special agreement; nor would the payment of any money to Converse which was not paid to the plaintiff by Converse relieve the defendant of the liability unless the plaintiff took it under such conditions and knew of such agreement. She herself said she was the owner of the premises, and that the work was well done, and she received the benefit of it. The judge\u2019s charge was fair, and in accordance with the law, and there was no error committed on the trial. The verdict was right and just.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">Judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">SOHUCHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
