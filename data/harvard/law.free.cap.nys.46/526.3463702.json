And. reference is made to the statute, which provides that \u201ctown meetings-shall be kept open for the purposes of voting in the daytime only, between the rising and setting of the sun.\u201d Laws 1890, c. 569, \u00a7 29. It appears that the polls were opened at 9 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, and continued open from that time until sunset, except one hour, from 12 o\u2019clock noon until 1 o\u2019clock p. m. Unlike th\u00e9 statutory direction applicable to general elections, the statute in question does not, in express terms, provide the hour or time the polls shall be opened, or that \u201cthere shall be no adjournment or intermission until the polls-are closed.\u201d Laws 1896, c. 909, \u00a7 3. The language of the provision of the present statute as to the time that town meetings shall be kept open for purposes of voting is substantially no different than it has-been for upward of 80 years. 2 Rev. Laws, p. 127; 1 Rev. St. p. 342, \u00a7 16. And it never has been so construed as to require that the polls-of town meetings be opened at sunrise, or continuously kept open until sunset, as contended by the learned counsel for the relator. But the contrary has been he\u00edd by the courts. Goodel v. Baker, 8 Cow. 286; People v. Martin, 5 N. Y. 22. This view of the interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the statute disposes of the question of legality of the town meeting adversely to the contention of the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">There is a further reason why the writ cannot be supported, and that is in the fact that a certiorari is available only to review a determination judicial in character. The functions of the election board of a town, in receiving votes and announcing the result, are not judicial. In doing that, they do not necessarily have any discretion to exercise or any determination to make. They receive the votes, count them, and return the results which the figures produce. There is no allegation in the petition\" of any judicial action of the defendants, nor does anything of that character appear in their return. It cannot therefore be assumed that any acts performed by them, as such board, were other than such as may be denominated \u201cministerial\u201d and \u201cadministrative\u201d; and therefore they are not the subject of review by the writ issued herein.

E. 488; In re Many, 10 App. Div. 451, 41 N. Y. Supp. 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The writ of certiorari should be quashed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
