The written contract provided that plaintiff was to receive $10 per 1,000 gallons of water for each day of 24 hours. The contract claimed by the defendant to have been made provided that the plaintiff should only receive $1 per 1,000 gallons of water for each day of 24 hours. The answer avers that this change was made either through mistake or fraud, and asked in its prayer for relief that the contract be reformed in this respect. The amended answer, averring these facts, pleads the same by designation as a defense, and not by way of counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">It is probably true that the matter alleged in the defendant\u2019s answer, as above stated, constituted a counterclaim. Such view has the sanction of authority to sustain it. Colville v. Chubb, 20 Civ. Proc. R. 352, 14 N. Y. Supp. 717; Bora v. Schrenkeisen, 110 N. Y. 60, 17 N. E. 339. The matter was equally available to the defendant as a defease to the action in the manner in which it was pleaded; and, if it was established that there was a mistake in the respect claimed, it constituted a good defense to that extent, and the plaintiff\u2019s action would be defeated, or its damages measured by the reduced price. There is an incongruity in severing the issues in such an action, and sending the equitable counterclaim to the special term for trial, and holding the law part of the action for trial at the circuit. If the matter pleaded as a defense is, in its technical sense, a counterclaim, still it is equally available as a defense, and there is no difficulty in disposing of such an issue at the circuit, and much less circumlocution. The issue is plain and direct should the contract read 10 or 1. No embarrassment can be encountered in disposing of such an issue in an action at law. That it is proper to plead this issue as a defense, and try and dispose'of the same at the circuit, has the support of direct authority. Kirchner v. Machine Co., 135 N. Y. 182, 31 N. E. 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">The cause having been sent to the circuit, and a trial had, this appeal should not now be heard. The motion to dismiss should be granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
