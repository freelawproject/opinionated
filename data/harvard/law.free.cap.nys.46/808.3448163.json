Hodecker,\u201d and \u201cMrs. Emma Hodecker,\u201d and kas dealt with tradespeople as the wife of Frederick Hodecker, although well knowing that the plaintiff is his true and lawful wife.

The amended complaint was in turn demurred to upon the same ground, and this was likewise sustained. Prom the interlocutory judgment entered thereon, this appeal is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Upon the first decision a very careful and comprehensive opinion was written by Mr. Justice Bradley (39 N. Y. Supp. 515), which commends itself to our unqualified approval; and, while the plaintiff has availed herself of the privilege to reform her complaint, we are unable, after a careful reading of the amended pleading, to discover wherein she has successfully met the adverse criticism to which the first complaint was subjected. But, if we correctly apprehend the present attitude of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, he does not rely with so much confidence upon the amendments which have been incorporated into his pleading as he does upon the general proposition that the complaint has, from the very first, contained a good and complete cause of action, inasmuch as it alleges facts which, if true (as they must be assumed to be in the present situation of the case), constitute a crime; his theory being, as we understand it, that this necessarily determines the wrongful- character of the acts complained of, and requires that a court of equity shall discover some suitable remedy therefor. The crime which it is claimed has been committed by the defendant is that which is defined by section 562 of the Penal Code, which, so far as deemed applicable, reads as follows, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-9\">\u201cA person who falsely personates another, and in such assumed character marries, or pretends to marry, or to sustain the married relation towards another, with -or without the connivance of the latter, is punishable by imprisonment in a state prison for not more than ten years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">We do not wish to be understood as assenting to the proposition of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the violation of any provision of the criminal law necessarily established a right to maintain a civil suit; nor is it necessary to seriously consider the same, for we think the learned counsel is clearly in error when he asserts that the defendant has violated the provision of the Penal Code just quoted, as it is not claimed that before marrying, or pretending to marry, or prior to sustaining the marriage relation, with Hodeclcer, she falsely personated the plaintiff. Indeed, she never pretended to personate her. She has simply held herself out to the world as \u201cMrs. Frederick Hodeclcer\u201d; and while, in doing so under the circumstances detailed in the complaint, she was undoubtedly guilty of conduct which was morally indefensible and false in fact, she did not thereby bring herself within either the letter or the spirit of the offense denounced by the section in question, and consequently the counsel\u2019s contention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>so far as it is founded upon the supposed commission of a crime, is utterly fallacious. But, without prolonging the discussion of the various questions to which our attention has been directed, it is sufficient to say that for the reason just stated, as well as for those given by Mr. Justice Bradley, we are of the opinion that the demurrer should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
