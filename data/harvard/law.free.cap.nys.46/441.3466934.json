A verified petition was filed by William F. Cochran, the landlord, and a precept founded on said petition was duly issued and served, returnable August 17, 1892. Upon the return day, the tenant appeared by James D. Hewitt, his attorney, and applied for an adjournment, which was denied by the justice; and, as no answer was filed by the,tenant, a final order went against him by default, awarding possession of the premises to the landlord. The appearance by the tenant without objection conceded the regularity of the service of process, and, as all the jurisdictional facts required to be stated were alleged in the petition with care and particularity, it is difficult to discover upon what ground the record is open to attack upon appeal. The rent was subsequently paid, and, in consequence, no warrant on the final order was executed..</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">There was an attempt made in the motion papers to dispute Mr. Hewitt\u2019s authority to appear, but Mr. Hewitt\u2019s affidavit upon that subject establishes that the appearance by him was authorized. The marshal\u2019s return of service was also attacked, buj; this was fully met by affidavits produced by the landlord. Without conceding the power of the justice, after final order, to pass upon such objections, it is sufficient to say that no harm came to the tenant by the rulings made, because they seem to be sustained by the proofs, and the marshal\u2019s return, upon its face, answers all the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The motion to open the default was denied March 21, 1893, on various grounds, including that of want of power,\u2014a question we will next consider. Section 1367 of the consolidation act, relating to the district courts, under which statute the application was made, provides that \u201cany justice may, upon motion made before him, open and set aside any default made in any action tried before or by him,\u201d etc. This applies only to \u201cactions\u201d (technically so called), and not to the summary remedies authorized by statute, under which the landlord proceeded, which are denominated \"special proceedings,\u201d as distinguished from actions. Dorschel v. Burkly, 18 Misc. Rep. 241, 41 N. Y. Supp. 389; Decker v. Sexton, 19 Misc. Rep. 59, 43 N. Y. Supp. 167, 174. So that, irrespective of the merits (if any there were), the application was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">It follows that the final order must be affirmed, and the appeal from the order denying the motion to open the default dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">BISCHOFF, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
