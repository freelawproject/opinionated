He was hired by the head waiter, who was employed by Mr. Archibault, who managed the restaurant for defendants. The manager promised the plaintiff $20 and expenses for making certain figures to be displayed at the French cooks\u2019 ball, an exhibition in Madison Square Harden, as an exhibit of the Siegel-Cooper 'Company, and bearing the name of that house. The plaintiff and his -wife, with the approval of the manager, made the figures at defendants\u2019 store, and took them from there to the exhibition. \u25a0 The manager paid $6.45 for the expenses, but refused to pay the $20, and this action is brought to recover it. The plaintiff recovered judgment, and the above facts must be assumed to have been found in his favor upon his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>in support of them. . The defendants called Mr. Archibault as a witness, who testified that the promise of $20 was conditional upon the plaintiff being awarded first prize for his figures at the exhibition. This was denied by the plaintiff. The chief contention of defendants upon appeal is that this was a special contract, which Mr. Archibault, as manager of the restaurant, had no authority to make. Mr. Archibault stated that special contracts had to be approved by the house, but did not say that this was not approved. On the contrary, he testified that he got from the house the $6.45 for expenses, and that the house knew what the expenses were for. This payment by defendants with full knowledge was an approval or ratification of the contract. There was a conflict of testimony as to whether the plaintiff had committed a breach of contract by not returning the figures after exhibition, but this dispute, which involved a question of custom as well as of contract, was determined by the justice in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and the finding of fact cannot be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
