The school district is within the corporate limits of the village of Warsaw. The respondent entered a demurrer upon the ground that the facts stated in the affidavit did not furnish warrant for the legal relief sought. By the statute referred to, the legislature intended to create a privileged class entitled to preferential employment in public service in every public department of the state, counties, cities, and villages, and upon all public works of the state, counties, cities, and villages. The question here is whether the Union free school is, within the meaning of the statute, a publie department of the state or village. I do not think it is. The respondent is a school district organized, existing, and supported by taxation levied upon the taxable inhabitants of the district, which may or may not be co-extensive with the corporate limits of the village; and, when organized by force of the statute, becomes a district having a distinct classification in the civil divisions eff the state. The care of the school building is committed, by the consolidated school act, to the board of education, and the board is in no way subject to the direction or control of the village or state authorities in the execution of suds duties, and, in my judgment, under no legal requirement to prefer the relator as&gt; janitor A privilege of this character must have its foundation in express provision of the statute. The demurrer should be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1101-17\">Argued before HARDIN, P.
