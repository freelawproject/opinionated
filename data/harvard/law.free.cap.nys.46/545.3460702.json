But one question is raised on this appeal. The defendant claimed a lien on the boat for the amount due him for work and materials. On the trial the' plaintiff showed that the defendant had given Kraemer Bros, the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">\u201cCollege Point, June 25th, 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">\u201cSamuel T. Shaw, Esq.\u2014Dear Sir: Will you please pay to Kraemer Bros, the amount of balance on contract, and also on extra work, and charge to my account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">8270 oo/ioo 279 0\u00b0/ioo</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">$549 oo/ioo Capt. L. N. Tonns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">At the close of the evidence the plaintiff asked the court to direct a verdict in his favor on the ground that the order was an equitable assignment to the Kraemers of the defendant\u2019s claim, and that the assignment destroyed any lien that the defendant might otherwise have had. This request the court refused, and the cause was submitted upon the other issues to the jury, who found for the defendant. The perfect answer to the appellant\u2019s claim is that no equitable assignment is established. The order, on its face, recites no consideration, and the plaintiff neglected to prove that there was in fact any consideration for it. \u201cThe presence of a valuable consideration, upon which the order or direction to pay was founded, becomes the essential and necessary element of an equitable assignment.\u201d Tallman v. Hoey, 89 N. Y. 537; Brill v. Tuttle, 81 N. Y. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
