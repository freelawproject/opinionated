The provisions of section 2068 of the Code of Civil Procedure that a writ of mandamus can be granted only at a special term of the court apply only to an original application for the writ. That section does not limit the effect of section 1317 of the Code that on appeal the appellate division may reverse, affirm, or modify any order appealed to it. The-authority for the issue of a writ in this case was the order of this, division, made on an appeal from an order denying the application for the writ. The order of this branch of the court required no action by the special term to give it full vitality and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">Defendants should be convicted of contempt, and fined the sum of $10, and ordered to stand committed to the common jail of Queens county until they comply with the terms of the writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
