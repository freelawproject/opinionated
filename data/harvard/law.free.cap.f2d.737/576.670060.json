We grant enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">Harper-Grace Hospitals\u2019 service maintenance employees are represented by the Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO (Union). Sometime prior to January 1981, several maintenance employees formed an action committee after they became dissatisfied with the presiding Union officers. At approximately 6:30 a.m. on January 16, 1981, employees Shanta Driver and Catherine Schaaf arrived at the hospital\u2019s main (Weber) entrance and began passing out anti-union leaflets to other bargaining unit employees. A short time later, a uniformed hospital security guard allegedly told the two women that they were not allowed to distribute union literature on hospital property and that they must move to the public sidewalk. The women complied with this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">At the same time, employees Marianne Jensen and Arrundys Wright were distributing anti-union literature at the old Grace basement entrance, which is used exclusively by hospital employees. Several security guards approached the women and ordered them to move to the public sidewalk. The employees complied with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>On January 21, 1981, Driver, Jensen, and another employee met with Garry Beggs, the hospital\u2019s labor relations representative, in order to discuss the hospital\u2019s no-distribution rule. After reviewing the matter, Beggs informed the employees that the hospital intended to maintain its strict no-distribution rule, which was incorporated in the collective bargaining agreement between the hospital and the Union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Soon thereafter, Jensen filed unfair labor practice charges against the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Following a hearing, the AU ruled that the hospital had violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act by maintaining and enforcing an over-broad no-solicitation/no-distribution rule. The Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s recommended order and now petitions this court to enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">It is well settled that, in areas of a hospital other than immediate patient-care areas, a hospital rule which prohibits union solicitation by employees during non-work time or distribution of union literature during non-work time in non-work areas of the hospital is <em>presumptively invalid </em>under \u00a7 8(a)(1) unless the hospital can justify the prohibition as necessary to avoid disruption of health-care operations or disturbance of patients. <em>Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB, </em>437 U.S. 483, 507, 98 S.Ct. 2463, 2476, 57 L.Ed.2d 370 (1978). In this case, several of the hospital\u2019s service maintenance employees sought to distribute union literature during non-work time in non-work areas of the hospital, but were prevented from doing so pursuant to the hospital\u2019s no-solicitation/no-distribution rule. The hospital, therefore, had the burden of showing that its prohibition was necessary to avoid disruption of health care operations of disturbance of patients. The Board found that the hospital failed to satisfy its burden and thus held that the no-soliciation/no-distribution rule was invalid. On petition for review, we must grant enforcement of the Board\u2019s order if we find substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">In this case, the hospital limits its attack to the Board\u2019s finding that the no-solieitation/no-distribution rule is invalid insofar as it prohibits the distribution of union literature at its main (Weber) entrance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hospital first contends that the General Counsel failed to establish that the hospital did in fact prohibit employees Schaaf and Driver from distributing union literature at the hospital\u2019s main (Weber) entrance. To buttress its claim, the hospital points to the fact that Schaaf could not identify the hospital security guard who allegedly ordered Schaaf and Driver to leave the main (Weber) entrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">Since the AU\u2019s finding on this point rests solely upon Schaaf's testimony, the hospital is essentially challenging the AU\u2019s decision to credit her testimony. This circuit has previously indicated, however, that an AU\u2019s credibility findings must be accepted unless they lack a rational basis. <em>NLRB v. S.E. Nichols of Ohio, Inc., </em>704 F.2d 921, 923 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 275, 78 L.Ed.2d 256 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-17\">We hold that the AU\u2019s credibility finding on this point has a rational basis and must be upheld. Schaaf testified with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>out contradiction that she and employee Driver were distributing union literature at the main (Weber) entrance when a hospital security guard told them that they were not permitted to distribute literature on hospital property. While Schaaf did not know the name of the security guard, she did testify that the security guard was dressed in the same outfit as other security guards at the hospital. Such uncontradict-ed testimony forms a rational basis to support the AU\u2019s credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The hospital also argues that the Board could not have made a finding on the issue of whether the hospital\u2019s prohibition was necessary to avoid disruption of health care operations or disturbance of patients because this issue was not fully litigated before the Board. Accordingly, the hospital maintains, the Board failed to compile a full, fair and complete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The short answer to this argument is that it is the <em>hospital\u2019s </em>burden to establish that its prohibition was necessary to avoid disruption of health care operations or disturbance of patients. <em>NLRB v. Baptist Hospital, Inc., </em>442 U.S. 773, 781, 99 S.Ct. 2598, 2603, 61 L.Ed.2d 251 (1979); <em>Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB, </em>437 U.S. at 507, 98 S.Ct. at 2476. If the record is somehow incomplete on this point, it is the hospital\u2019s fault for not producing sufficient evidence. Accordingly, we would be improperly shifting the burden of proving this point onto the Board if we remanded this case due to an incomplete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Finally, the hospital contends that it has complied with the Board\u2019s order \u201cto the extent that it is necessary and appropriate\u201d by posting a notice along side the Board\u2019s notice indicating that the hospital reserved the right \u201cto prohibit or otherwise limit solicitation or distribution of literature at the Main Weber entrance on the basis that such entrance is patient-related and/or that such conduct disturbs or disrupts health services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Since the Board specifically found that the hospital violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) by prohibiting the distribution of literature at the main (Weber) entrance, we are at a loss to explain how the hospital\u2019s side notice, which reserves the hospital\u2019s right to continue applying its no-distribution rule at the main. (Weber) entrance, complies with the Board\u2019s order. We therefore hold that the side notice in no way constitutes \u201ccomplete compliance\u201d with the Board\u2019s order, and that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s order is Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\">. The collective bargaining agreement\u2019s no-distribution rule read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">Section 1. The hospital shall provide bulletin boards in appropriate locations for the exclusive use of the Union. The use of these bulletin boards shall be confined to the following notices:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">(a) Recreational and social affairs of the Union;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">(b) Union meetings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">(c) Union appointments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">(d) Union elections, including those required in the Union constitutions, and results of such elections;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-18\">(e) Union member changes of address;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-19\">(f) Any proper Union notices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-20\">There shall be no distribution or posting by the Union or employees of pamphlets, advertising or political matter, notices, or any other kind of literature upon Hospital property other than as herein provided.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-21\">. The hospital does not contest the Board\u2019s finding that its no-solicitation/no-distribution rule is invalid insofar as it prohibited the distribution of union literature at the old Grace entrance, which is used exclusively by hospital employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
