After rejecting that constitutional challenge, Judge Mishler granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">While agreeing with that disposition, we find that it was unnecessary to' reach plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection argument because, aside from one meritless issue, this case is controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Franklin v. Krause, </em>32 N.Y.2d 234, 344 N.Y.S.2d 885, 298 N.E.2d 68 (1973), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>415 U.S. 904, 94 S.Ct. 1397, 39 L.Ed.2d 461 (1974). Accordingly, we affirm but on the basis of that prior Supreme Court summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b220-16\">New York State\u2019s Nassau County is governed by the Board, whose six members are the chief executives of the cities of Glen Cove and Long Beach, and the Towns of Hempstead, Oysfer Bay and North Hempstead.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since 1917, the Board has used a weighted voting system,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which has been the subject of other litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-17\">In <em>Franklin v. Mandeville, </em>26 N.Y.2d 65, 308 N.Y.S.2d 375, 256 N.E.2d 534 (1970), a case early in reapportionment jurisprudence, the Board\u2019s weighted voting plan was also attacked as unconstitutional. Then, as now, despite having a majority of Nassau County\u2019s population, the Town of Hempstead was assigned less than a majority of the weighted vote. The New York Court of Appeals held that that allotment violated equal protection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-18\">\u201c[T]he Town of Hempstead\u2019s population constituted 57.12% of the county\u2019s population but that town\u2019s representatives may cast but 49.6% of the board\u2019s vote. Important as is ... the present inequality, it is of even greater moment that inequality in some degree is mandated and, indeed, perpetuated by the charter provision: \u2018nor shall the supervisor or supervisors of any town or city be entitled to cast more than fifty per centum of the total vote of said board.\u2019 (L.1936, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ch. 879, \u00a7 104, subd. 2.) This provision ... clearly violates the one man, one vote principle____ Not only are the Hemp-stead Supervisors presently barred from ... a majority vote, but section 104 would continue to deprive them, or the residents of any other town or city subsequently containing a majority of the county population, from majority representation, ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 377, 256 N.E.2d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Notwithstanding that illegality, the New York Court of Appeals permitted the weighted voting system to continue until after the 1970 census, so that the new reapportionment plan would be accurately based. A computer analysis was performed, but yet another weighted voting system was proposed. That proposal was contained in Nassau County Local Law 13-1972 (\u201cLocal Law 13-1972\u201d) to amend Nassau Government Law \u00a7 104 (\u201c\u00a7 104\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Outlining the provisions of Local Law 13-1972, one court during the period stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">\u201cThe new plan ... is embodied in Local Law No. 13-1972. It continues a structure of town and city Supervisors sitting as Board members, the mandatory decennial reallocation of votes and use of a weighted voting system____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\u201cIn fixing the standards for allocating votes, the new law provides that the \u2018voting power\u2019 of a Supervisor shall be measured \u2018by the mathematical possibility of his casting a decisive vote on a particular matter.\u2019 It then equates a town\u2019s or city\u2019s \u2018voting power\u2019 with that of its Supervisor, or, in the case of Hempstead, with the total voting power of its two Supervisors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">\u201cFurthermore, the percentages of voting power \u2018shall approximate\u2019 the corresponding percentages of population and it further guarantees that no town or city shall be wholly without voting power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-14\">\u201cFinally, ... the new plan requires that in preparing each reapportionment ... [the] Board shall employ \u2018an independent computerized mathematical analysis\u2019 and any other methods which shall \u2018most nearly analyze\u2019 the percentages of voting power and population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-15\">\u201cParagraph 5 of the new law turns from general standards to specific allocation of votes based upon the 1970 census data.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-16\"><em>Franklin v.

Mandeville, </em>308 N.Y.S.2d at 377, 256 N.E.2d 534. Not suprisingly, the new plan was challenged as constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In a conceded turnabout, the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Franklin v. Krause, </em>32 N.Y.2d 234, 344 N.Y.S.2d 885, 892, 298 N.E.2d 68 (1973), held that the weighted voting system under Local Law 13-1972 had \u201cno constitutional infirmity.\u201d In reaching that decision, the Court of Appeals acknowledged and endorsed the evolution of reapportionment law, especially in regard to local government.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201c[Wjhile the Town of Hempstead Supervisors together possess 70 votes, more than a majority of the total 130, they cannot have 55% voting power which would ordinarily be 100% voting power in a \u2018pure majority\u2019 situation. This admittedly artificial voting requirement ... gives the Town of Hempstead a greater disenfranchisement than ... in certain voting combinations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">\u201cThis is precisely the point which caused our rejection of the former plan ____ At the time that decision was handed down, the preachment was that one man, one vote had to be applied at all levels of government with mathematical certitude and this court was concerned with the scope of Hempstead\u2019s disenfranchisement. In the intervening years this stricture has been considerably softened with respect to local level government and this reshaping is most desirable, as demonstrated in the case at bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 888, 298 N.E.2d 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">The <em>Franklin v. Krause </em>plaintiffs, with the League intervening, appealed to the Supreme Court. Before doing so, however, they moved to amend the remittitur. The New York Court of Appeals granted the motion, thereby clarifying that the constitutionality of Local Law 13-1972 had indeed been decided.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">\u201c[Tjhere were presented, and necessarily passed upon, questions arising under the Constitution of the United States, viz: (1) whether Local Law No. 13-1972 of Nassau County is unconstitutional because it deprives plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws as well as due process of law ...; and (2) whether said Local Law, because it utilizes weighted voting, is unconstitutional <em>per se </em>in that it violates the plaintiffs\u2019 right to equal protection of the laws and to due process of law____ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The Court of Appeals held there was no violation of any of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><em>Franklin v. Krause, </em>33 N.Y.2d 646, 348 N.Y.S.2d 554, 303 N.E.2d 71 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The Supreme Court received the ease under its mandatory appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(2), but dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. <em>Franklin v. Krause, </em>415 U.S. 904, 94 S.Ct. 1397, 39 L.Ed.2d 461 (1974). Thus, the constitutional gauntlet of Nassau County\u2019s weighted voting system was evidently ended, and the provisions of Local Law 13-1972 became effective on January 1, 1976 as part of \u00a7 104.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The constitutional calm was brief. Section 104(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">\u201cIn accordance with ... subdivision four ..., the board of supervisors shall, not later than six months after the publication of the results of each federal decennial census by appropriate amendment to subdivision five ..., propose a reapportionment of the voting power....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">And \u00a7 104(4) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">\u201cg. The percentage of voting power of each town and city ... shall approximate the town\u2019s or city\u2019s percentage of the total county population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">\u201ch. In preparing each reapportionment, the board of supervisors shall employ an independent computerized mathematical analysis and such other ... methods as shall most nearly equalize the percentage of voting power of each town and city to its percentage of the total county population.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">As required by those provisions, after the 1980 census and a computer analysis, the Board was to be reapportioned by an amendment to \u00a7 104(5). The amendment eventually enacted was Nassau County Local Law 2-1982 (\u201cLocal Law 2-1982\u201d)\u2014os-tensibly, the focus of this lawsuit. Except for mathematical adjustments reflecting Nassau County\u2019s population changes since the 1970 census, Local Law 2-1982 is a verbatim version of \u00a7 104(5) as originally embodied in paragraph five, <em>supra, </em>of Local Law 13-1972.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">\u201cBased on the nineteen hundred eighty federal census, the number of votes in each of the following categories is ... fixed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-15\">\u201ca) For matters requiring a majority of the voting strength of the board of supervisors or a majority of the voting power of the board of supervisors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-16\">\u201c(1) Total number of votes..............108</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-17\">\u201c(2) Distribution of votes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-18\">Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead . 30</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-19\">Supervisor of Hempstead........... 28</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-20\">Supervisor of Oyster Bay........... 22</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-21\">Supervisor of North Hempstead..... 15</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-22\">Supervisor of Long Beach.......... 7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-23\">Supervisor of Glen Cove............ 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-24\">\u201c(3) Votes required for passage......... 65\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-25\">This allocation results in the following deviations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-26\">\n<em>Municipality Population Percent of Population Percent Voting Power Deviation</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AunI\">Hempstead 738,517 55.92 53.85 -2.07</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyD\">Oyster Bay 305,750 \u25a023.12 21.15 -1.97</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlMc\">No. Hempstead 218,624 16.53 17.31 + .78</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAt8\">Long Beach 34,073 2.58 5.77 +3.19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axr-dedup-0\">Glen Cove 24,618 1.86 1.92 + .06\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALn\">Total 1,321,582</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>As seen, due to Nassau County\u2019s population decrease, the total votes are reduced to 108. Once again and (now) pursuant to \u00a7 104(4)(g)-(h), <em>supra, </em>the municipalities are assigned votes proportionate to their respective populations. Still, the Town of Hempstead is denied a majority.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Significantly, the maximum range of deviation under Local Law 2-1982 of 5.26% (the Town of Hempstead\u2019s -2.07% computed with Long Beach\u2019s + 3.19%) is <em>less than </em>the 7.3% under Local Law 13-1982. But, that diminished disparity and the numerical vote allotment are the <em>only </em>differences between Local Law 2-1982 and its predecessor \u2014 paragraph 5 of Local Law 13-1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In any event, Local Law 2-1982 was submitted to the Board, which after public hearings, adopted it on March 8, 1982. Nassau County\u2019s Chief Executive signed it on the same day, and, after being approved in a referendum, Local Law 2-1982 became effective on January 1, 1983. Prior to that referendum, however, plaintiffs had filed this lawsuit seeking unsuccessfully to enjoin it. Thus Nassau County\u2019s weighted voting plan is again under constitutional attack \u2014 this time through the enactment of Local Law 2-1972.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">A. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Plaintiffs have brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 through its legislative implementation, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3). Defendants correctly maintain that the League does not have standing to assert the rights of its members.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This Circuit has restricted organizational standing under \u00a7 1983 by interpreting the rights it secures to be personal to those purportedly injured. <em>Aguayo v. </em>Richardson, 473 F.2d 1090 (2d Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1146, 94 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed.2d 101 (1974). As we there pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">\u201cNeither [the] language nor the history ... [of \u00a7 1983] suggests that an organization may sue under the Civil Rights Act for the violations of rights of members.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1099. <em>See also Albany Welfare Rights Organization v. Wyman, </em>493 F.2d 1319, 1321-22 (2d Cir.1974) (A welfare rights organization had standing under \u00a7 1983 because the asserted injury was to the right of association, an avenue left open in Aguayo); <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>495 F.2d 1187, 1194 (2d Cir.1974); <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>422 U.S. 490, 516-17, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2214, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (In denying standing to a housing organization, this court added, \u201cIt is highly doubtful that an organization has standing to represent its members in most cases under the Civil Rights Act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Necessarily, we adhere to our prior decisions and, consequently, hold that the League lacks standing under \u00a7 1983, the only jurisdictional basis asserted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Defendants are similarly correct in contending that plaintiffs Carlton, Fox and Borner, who live in Long Beach, North Hempstead and Glen Cove, respectively, lack standing, as well. These.voters reside in overrepresented municipalities, <em>i.e., </em>political subdivisions that have percentages of the Board\u2019s voting power greater than their percentages of Nassau County\u2019s population. Hence, as voters from overrepresented municipalities, these plaintiffs cannot claim any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The issue whether plaintiffs such as these have standing was addressed in <em>Fair-ley v. Patterson, </em>493 F.2d 598 (5th Cir. 1974). There, the Fifth Circuit held that the plaintiffs, who had not alleged that they resided in underrepresented voting districts, lacked standing to contest a reapportionment law. <em>Id. </em>at 604. In so holding, the Fifth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">\u201cUnder appellants\u2019 first claim, a traditional one man, one vote argument, the Supreme Court has conclusively established in <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204-208 [82 S.Ct. 691, 703-705, 7 L.Ed.2d 663] ... (1962), and <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 554-561, [84 S.Ct. 1362, 1377-1381, 12 L.Ed.2d 506] ... (1964), that sufficient damage through under-representation to obtain standing will be inflicted if population equality among voting units is not present. However, injury results only to those persons domiciled in the <em>underrepresented </em>voting districts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 603 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). <em>Cf. Minority Police Officers Association of South Bend v. City of South Bend, </em>721 F.2d 197, 202 (7th Cir.1983) (in a \u00a7 1983 case for alleged hiring discrimination, minority police offic\u00e9rs, \u201cwho [were] all' employees, [could not] represent ... unsuccessful applicants, all of whom [were] by definition nonemployees.\u201d) (citing <em>Fair-ley).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\"><em>Fairley </em>aside, plaintiffs again invoke <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. at 208, 82 S.Ct. at 705, as authority for standing generally in reapportionment suits. However, as the just-quoted passage in <em>Fairley </em>indicates, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Baker v. Carr </em>stems from less than a close reading of that case. In contrast to the municipalities in which Carlton, Fox and Borner dwell, the <em>Baker v.Carr </em>voter appellants lived in <em>underrepresented </em>areas.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">\u201cThe injury which appellants assert is that this classification disfavors the voters in the counties in which they reside, placing them in a position of constitutionally unjustifiable inequality <em>vis-a-vis </em>voters in irrationally favored counties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 207-08, 82 S.Ct. at 704-705.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">Notably, the Supreme Court explicitly declined to decide whether overrepresented voters had standing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-17\">\u201cThe complaint also contains an averment that the appellants sue \u2018on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>own behalf and <em>on behalf of all other voters </em>in the State of Tennessee.\u2019 ... This may be read to assert a claim- that voters in counties allegedly over-represented in the General Assembly also have standing to complain. But it is not necessary to decide that question in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 205 n. 24, 82 S.Ct. at 703 n. 24 (emphasis in original). In brief, plaintiffs\u2019 summoning of <em>Baker v. Carr </em>is to no avail. <em>See </em>L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 87 n. 40 (1978) (\u201cThe Court [in <em>Baker v. </em>Carr] found it unnecessary to decide whether [overrepresented voters had standing] ____ Under the theory that limits standing to cases where the litigant\u2019s own material interests are adversely affected, such voters quite plainly would <em>not </em>have standing.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Independent of <em>Baker v. </em>Carr\u2019s nonsupport, we agree with the Fifth Circuit. Therefore, Carlton, Fox and Borner, who are not \u201cpersons domiciled in <em>underrepresented </em>voting districts,\u201d lack standing to prosecute this appeal. <em>Fairly v. Patterson, </em>493 F.2d at 603 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Defendants, nevertheless, do not contest the standing of Schmertz, a Town of Hempstead resident, and Josepher, an Oyster Bay resident. Those plaintiffs live in underrepresented municipalities, <em>i.e., </em>political subdivisions that have percentages of the Board\u2019s voting power less than their percentages of Nassau County\u2019s population.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">That being so, Schmertz and Josepher have seemingly incurred injury. The inquiry on appeal, then, will proceed only as to them. <em>See Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. at 206, 82 S.Ct. at 704.

Undeterred by that semblance as well as Local Law 2-1982\u2019s limited, mechanistic changes, plaintiffs challenge Nassau County\u2019s weighted voting system <em>as a whole.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 litigation strategy aside, defendants argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s summary adjudication in <em>Franklin v.

We agree. The Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal for lack of a substantial federal question then is binding now.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">In <em>Hicks v. Miranda, </em>422 U.S. 332, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 45 L.Ed.2d 223 (1975), the Supreme Court clarified the import of its summary adjudications on later lower court decisions. There, a three-judge court had declared a State obscenity statute unconstitutionally vague. In doing so, the three-judge court had not deemed controlling an earlier State decision holding the statute valid \u2014 although the Supreme Court had dismissed the appeal from that State case for lack of a substantial federal question. <em>Miller v. California, </em>418 U.S. 915, 94 S.Ct. 3206, 41 L.Ed.2d 1158 (1974) <em>(\u201cMiller II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">In reversing the three-judge court, the Supreme Court outlined the rationale underlying such a dismissal along with the deference it should have been accorded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aij-dedup-0\">\u201cThat case was an appeal from a decision by a state court upholding a state statute against federal constitutional attack. A federal constitutional issue was properly presented, it was within our appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(2), and we had no discretion to refuse adjudication of the case on its merits ____ We are not obligated to grant the c\u00e1se plenary consideration, and we did not; but we were required to deal with its merits. We did so by concluding that the appeal should be dismissed because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>constitutional challenge to the [state] statute was not a substantial one.

Only footnote fourteen states clearly that the precedential value of a summary disposition by the Supreme Court extends to a limited range of issues.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The Supreme Court further illuminated the parameters of such dispositions in <em>Mandel v. Bradley, </em>432 U.S. 173, 97 S.Ct. 2238, 53 L.Ed.2d 199 (1976). There, an independent candidate for a federal office challenged a Maryland statute requiring all independents desiring placement on the general election ballot to file a .certificate of candidacy 70 days before the party primaries, in addition to signatures of 3% of the voters. Relying on a summary affirmance in <em>Tucker v.

Bradley, </em>432 U.S. at 177, 97 S.Ct. at 2241. In <em>Salera, </em>besides an early filing date, the signatures had to be obtained during a 21-day period. The Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">\u201cThis combination of an early filing deadline and the 21-day limitation on signature gathering is sufficient to distinguish <em>Salera </em>from the case now before us, where there is no limitation on the period within which such signatures must be gathered.

(1977) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">In accordance with that rule, the <em>Franklin v. Krause </em>plaintiffs offered these \u201cQuestions Presented\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-16\">\u201c1. Whether weighted voting is unconstitutional <em>per se </em>as a plan of permanent apportionment for a unicameral, County legislative body having general governmental powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-17\">\u201c2. Whether a plan of apportionment for a County legislative body having general governmental powers constitutionally may prevent the representatives of one local unit (Town of Hempstead) containing more than 57% of the County population, from casting sufficient votes to pass legislative measures requiring a simple majority vote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-18\">\u201c3. Whether a plan of apportionment for a County legislative body having general governmental powers constitutionally may create an artificial \u201cmajority\u201d requirement so that elected representatives of 57% of the County population do not hold sufficient votes to pass legislative measures requiring a simple majority vote.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-19\">Appellants\u2019 Jur.St. at 3, App. at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-20\">Before this court, plaintiffs offer the following \u201cIssues Presented for Review\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-21\">\u201c1. Did the lower Court err by not holding evidentiary hearings from which to make specific findings of fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-22\">\u201c2. Is computerized weighted voting using the Banzhaf weighted voting power methodology unconstitutional per se?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-23\">\u201c3. Was the percentage point deviation test used by the lower Court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>correct mathematical test to use to review the reapportionment plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">\u201c4. Is there an impermissible built-in bias in the Nassau plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">\u201c5. Is computerized weighted voting in a local legislative body with general governmental powers unconstitutional per se?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Pl.Br. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">a. <em>Issue 1: Evidentiary Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"AjF\">Decidedly, Issue 1 here was not before the Supreme Court. Nor for that matter was it before Judge Mishler \u2014 at least with any consistency. Initially, plaintiffs sought an evidentiary hearing. <em>See, e.g., </em>Aff. \u00b6 22, App. at 36 (\u201c[A] hearing is requested ... for the proponents of the Nassau County plan to carry their burden.\u201d). Yet, plaintiffs later cross-moved for summary judgment stating that \u201cthere are [sic] no dispute in facts, but rather, interpretations of mathematics and applicable law which does not require this Court to hold a trial.\u201d). Aff. \u00b6 24, App. at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Notwithstanding that certitude, plaintiffs\u2019 position sharply changed again \u2014 after Judge Mishler\u2019s May 18, 1983 decision. Purportedly, <em>Morris v. Board of Estimate, </em>707 F.2d 686 (2d Cir.1983), which had been issued on May 16, 1983, dictated that turnaround. In a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 60(b)(6), plaintiffs enumerated the contested facts suddenly necessitating a trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">\u201c[P]laintiffs respectfully request that their motion for relief from judgment... be granted and this matter be set down for a trial ... for the Court to determine the findings of fact per the holding of <em>Morris v. Board of Estimate.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Aff., App. at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Despite misgivings about Issue l\u2019s authenticity due to plaintiffs\u2019 vacillation, we address it but find <em>Morris </em>not mandating a trial in this case. There, after holding that the one person, one vote rule applied to the Board of Estimate, the <em>Morris </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">\u201cBecause the district court found the one person, one vote rule inapplicable, no findings were made concerning the level of malapportionment, the weight of the state interests alleged to justify whatever level of deviation exists or whether the combination of at-large and local seats, in the context of the voting procedures of the Board, creates a system of representation that satisfies constitutional standards for instruments of local government. It is therefore proper to remand the case to the district court so that it can make such findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">\u201cUpon remand, the district court must determine the degree of malapportionment present (after deciding on the appropriate methodology for doing so) and rule on the policies and interests which the Supreme Gourt has held may justify deviations .from the literal one person, one vote formula.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-15\"><em>Morris v. Board of Estimate, </em>707 F.2d at 690 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">Nowhere does <em>Morris </em>direct a hearing. To the contrary, <em>Morris </em>leaves that determination to the considered discretion of the district court who <em>\u201cmay </em>find it desirable to amplify the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691 (emphasis added). Further, even were the district court to deem amplification warranted, additional submissions might be sufficient, depending on \u2014 as in most suits \u2014 what issues require development. In any event, <em>Morris </em>simply does not stand for the principal proposition asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">Apart from that misinterpretation, <em>Morris </em>is distinguishable on its face. In that case, as mentioned, the district court had determined that the one person, one vote rule did not apply to the Board of Estimate and, consequently, had not made certain findings. Here, however, that ride\u2019s relevance was never contested. In addition, the appropriate findings w\u00e9re made.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-18\">For example, Judge Mishler accepted the malapportionment level as 5.26%, Mem. Dec. at 6, App. at 359, and, thereby, pointedly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 mathematics.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-19\">\u201cAccording to plaintiffs, their approach is the proper mathematic method for testing a weighted voting plan under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506, ... (1964). We find no such suggestion in <em>Reynolds.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFs\"><em>Id. </em>at 8 and 361, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Judge Mishler, likewise, did the required weighing between the equal protection guarantee and the proffered governmental policies.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cWe find that the plan for the apportionment of votes on the Nassau County Board of Supervisors, contained in Local Law 2-1982, is an adequate compromise between the constitutional one man, one vote requirement and the County\u2019s interest in preserving existing subdivision lines and the existing legislative structure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 12 and 365, respectively. <em>See generally </em>R. Dixon, Democratic Representation \u2014 Reapportionment in Law and Politics 518 (1968) (\u201cArithmetically viewed, weighted ... voting [is] in line with the Supreme Court\u2019s announced goal [in <em>Reynolds v. Sims, 377 </em>U.S. at 579, 84 S.Ct. at 1390] of \u2018substantial equality of population\u2019; moreover, [it] achievefs] this while maintaining concern for the Court\u2019s corollary interest in \u2018integrity of various political subdivisions.\u2019 <em>[Id. </em>at 578, 84 S.Ct. at 1390].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">To conclude the <em>Morris </em>discussion, while not directing a hearing as a matter of course, it does instruct that certain findings be made <em>when </em>the one person, one vote rule is operative. In this case, having made those findings, the district court complied with <em>Morris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Besides <em>Morris, </em>plaintiffs also contend that <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>462 U.S. 725, 103 S.Ct. 2653, 77 L.Ed.2d 133 (1983), and <em>Brown v. Thomson, </em>462 U.S. 835, 103 S.Ct. 2690, 77 L.Ed.2d 214 (1983), companion cases also decided after Judge Mishler\u2019s opinion, similarly require a hearing. The court disagrees, too, with that interpretation of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">In <em>Karcher, </em>the Supreme Court invalidated a New Jersey congressional redistricting plan with a deviation of less than 1% because, though small, that disparity was not due to a good faith effort towards population equality. <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>462 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2665.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\"><em>Brown, </em>on the other hand, upheld a Wyoming statute permitting each county to have at least one member in the State house of representatives, despite a resultant 89% maximum deviation. The Supreme Court approved the apportionment because Wyoming had a longstanding, legitimate policy of providing each county with a representative <em>and </em>because the deviation issue had been removed from the Supreme Court\u2019s scrutiny. <em>Brown v. Thomson, </em>462 U.S. at-, 103 S.Ct. at 2698-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Like <em>Morris, </em>neither <em>Karcher </em>nor <em>Brown </em>commands that evidentiary hearings automatically be held. In fact, the lower court\u2019s \u201chearing\u201d in <em>Karcher </em>was, at the most, a <em>pro forma </em>proceeding, the ease being taken essentially on submission. The Supreme Court described that proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AafV\">\u201cThe District Court held a hearing ... at which the parties submitted a number of depositions and affidavits, moved for summary judgment, and waived their right to introduce further evidence in the event the motions for summary judgment were denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-13\"><em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>462 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2657. So, the <em>Karcher </em>hearing did not differ markedly from the usual summary judgment procedure employed here. In neither instance was live testimony received.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">In sum, those Supreme Court cases do not compel lower courts to hold superfluous evidentiary hearings. Nevertheless, consistent with <em>Morris, </em>they do expect that adequate findings will be made. <em>See Brown v. Thomson, </em>462 U.S. at \u2014 , 103 S.Ct. at 2696 (\u201cAs the District Court found, this policy [of preserving county boundaries] has particular force given the particular size and population of the State and the nature of its governmental structure.\u201d); <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>462 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2665 (\u201c[T]he District Court\u2019s findings easily pass the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 test.\u201d). Once again, that was done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Appending a final point to our Issue 1 resolution, it is not obvious what more could have been adduced at a trial, in light of the past, related litigation and plaintiffs\u2019 purposeful thoroughness in pressing their claims in the present case. This observation is confirmed by plaintiffs' announced pre-decisional position that there were no disputed, material facts. Differently stated, had it been incumbent to reach plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional arguments, this case would still remain in a summary judgment posture \u2014 as <em>all </em>had agreed. In short, the court views plaintiffs\u2019 Issue 1 as too infirm to distinguish this case from <em>Franklin v. Krause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">b. <em>Issues 2 and 5: Weighted Voting as Unconstitutional Per Se</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHs\">Issues 2 and 5 were included in <em>Franklin v. Krause\u2019s </em>Question 1 and, also, in the remittitur. <em>See Franklin v. Krause, </em>348 N.Y.S.2d at 554, 303 N.E.2d 71 (\u201c[T]here [was] presented, and ... passed upon ... whether ... Local Law [13-1972], because it utilizes weighted voting, is unconstitutional <em>per se </em>____\u201d) (granting motion to amend the remittitur). The <em>heart </em>of both Issues 2 and 5 is the <em>per se </em>unconstitutionality of the Board\u2019s weighted voting system. That was unmistakably <em>Franklin v.-Krause\u2019s </em>Question 1 and the Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of it is controlling precedent as to Issues 2 and 5. <em>See Mandel v.

Upon information and belief, the United States Supreme Court in a cursory review of the jurisdictional statement may have assumed the \u20187.3%\u2019 figure discussed in <em>Franklin v.

The \u201creach and content\u201d of <em>Franklin v. Krause, </em>thereby, extends to Issue 3. <em>Hicks v. Miranda, </em>422 U.S. at 345 n. 14, 95 S.Ct. at 2281 n. 14. <em>See generally Prettyman v. Nebraska, </em>537 F.Supp. 712, 715 (D.Neb.1982) (A prior Supreme Court dismissal of a State court decision upholding the constitutionality of Nebraska\u2019s education statutes and regulations was binding in a subsequent action involving different parties but the same \u201cissues and arguments.\u201d); <em>Bangor Baptist Church v.

Although not fully developed, their contention is that the Supreme Court could not have appreciated the method before it, since the simple computation used was applicable to single-member district plans \u2014 not a complex weighted voting system. <em>See Brown v. Thomson, </em>462 U.S. at-, 103 S.Ct. at 2701 (\u201cWe have come to establish a rough threshold of 10% maximum deviation ... (adding together the deviations from average district size of the most underrepresented and most overrepresented districts) ____\u201d) (Brennan, J., dissenting). <em>See, e.g., White v. Weiser, </em>412 U.S. 783, 785, 93 S.Ct. 2348, 2350, 37 L.Ed.2d 335 (1973) (\u201cThe 13th District exceeded the ideal ... by 2.43% and the 15th District was smaller by 1.7%. [T]heir total percentage deviation was 4.13%.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">In plaintiffs\u2019 view, the Supreme Court obviously made a mistake, since <em>Franklin v. Krause </em>assertedly does not comport with other reapportionment caselaw. Accordingly, that summary adjudication was an \u201caberration\u201d and, of necessity, nonbinding. <em>See </em>Pl.R.Br. at 7 (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court decision was based on the same mistake ... that was before the New York ... Court of Appeals. Thus, ... the <em>Franklin v. Krause </em>holding is such an aberration from all other Supreme Court holdings that it cannot be relied upon.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">There are two responses. First, the short answer is that, as shown, the Supreme Court knew that a weighted voting system was being measured and by what method.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">Second, applying that simple method to the Board\u2019s weighted voting system was in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s reapportionment jurisprudence then and more so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>now. Early in its journey through the \u201cpolitical thicket,\u201d the Supreme Court recognized that <em>flexibility </em>\u2014 not precise mathematical tests \u2014 was required when reviewing State and local government representation plans.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">\u201c[T]he problem does not lend itself to any such uniform formula, and it is neither practicable nor desirable to establish rigid mathematical standards for evaluating ... a state legislative apportionment scheme____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><em>Roman v.

The flexibility which is to be afforded municipal government schemes has been repeatedly stressed ____\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">Thus, while deviation from the ideal is a fundamental inquiry in reapportionment disputes, the Supreme Court\u2019s review of State and local government legislative plans has been noteworthy for the <em>nonpro-mulgation </em>of strict mathematical tests. Rather, the theme \u2014 especially concerning units of local government \u2014 has been flexibility. Based upon that theme, we conclude that the Supreme Court was not only aware of the simple mathematical method used in <em>Franklin v. Krause, </em>but deemed that measure to comport with the flexibility desirable when examining a local government plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">Therefore, despite plaintiffs\u2019 intemperate c\u00e1tegorization of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Franklin v. Krause </em>as a nonbinding \u201caberration,\u201d this court believes the contrary. <em>Franklin v. Krause </em>is both binding and aligned with the Supreme Court\u2019s reapportionment jurisprudence. As such, <em>Franklin v. Krause </em>resolves Issue 3. <em>Mandel v. Bradley, </em>432 U.S. at 176, 97 S.Ct. at 2240.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">Besides Issue 3, <em>Franklin v. Krause, </em>as discussed, resolves Issues 2, 4 and 5, also. In so holding, we are heeding the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, while adhering to the guidance of our prior decisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-17\">\u201cThe District Court should have followed the Second Circuit\u2019s advice, first, in <em>Port Authority Bondholders Protective Committee v.

Miranda, </em>422 U.S. at 345-46, 95 S.Ct. at 2289-90 (brackets by <em>Hicks </em>Court). The Supreme Court has not informed us otherwise \u2014 either directly or by doctrinal development. Instead, as noted, the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence since <em>Franklin v. Krause </em>has continued to underscore the latitude afforded State and local governments. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Thomson, </em>462 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2698-99. Accordingly, we remain bound by <em>Franklin v. </em>Krause\u2019s \u201creach and content.\u201d <em>Hicks v.

As defendants pointedly remark, plaintiffs are attacking \u201cthe <em>same </em>legislative body in the <em>same </em>county using the <em>same </em>system of allocating votes.\u201d Def.Br. at 21 (emphasis in original). There can be no disagreement with that description. Differences between the two suits are too inadequate to preclude <em>Franklin v. </em>Krause\u2019s precedential effect. In other words, even if no further, <em>Franklin v. Krause </em>extends to this case. <em>See Preston v. Seay, </em>684 F.2d 172, 173 (1st Cir.1982) (In rejecting a constitutional challenge to a jury trial waiver statute, the court grounded its decision on two prior Supreme Court dismissals of factually different cases attacking the same statute and commented, \u201cIt is ... often difficult to understand the proper reach of ...

Unsurprisingly, given the prevalence of such representational plans, the subjection of Nassau County\u2019s weighted voting system to constitutional litigation has not been atypical. <em>See Imbriani v.
