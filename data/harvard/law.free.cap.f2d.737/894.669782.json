We determine the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s damages claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and state tort law, against the City of Atlanta, three officials of the City\u2019s Police Department, and two uniformed police officers under <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981); and <em>Rizzo v. Goode, </em>423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976). We conclude on the basis of the district court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law that the plaintiff failed to establish a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) claim against any of these defendants. We also conclude that plaintiff failed to establish state law claims of false arrest or false imprisonment against any defendant. The district court\u2019s findings and conclusions on plaintiff\u2019s state law claim against the individual defendants for assault and battery are inadequate to permit us to render a decision as to their sufficiency; consequently, we remand that claim for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-20\">The plaintiff\u2019s claims in this case grew out of a New Year\u2019s Day celebration. We recite the salient facts as the district court found them.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-21\">Thomas Patillo, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, spent the afternoon of January 1, 1980, driving about Atlanta with a male companion, visiting friends and drinking quite heavily.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He came home around 5:00 p.m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>and pulled into a service station across the street from his house to buy some gas. As he was driving out of the station he almost hit a red van also leaving the station. Patillo and the driver of the van got out of their vehicles and exchanged words. Patillo pulled a handgun from his trunk and threatened the driver. The driver, in turn, ran for a telephone and called the police. Atlanta Police Officers C.C. Craig and R.C. Sampson responded to the call. By this time, Patillo had gone home and parked his car in front of his house. The two officers, accompanied by the driver of the van, walked to Patillo\u2019s front porch and knocked on the door. A friend of Patillo\u2019s answered the door, and Officer Sampson asked for the driver of the car parked out front. Patillo then came to the door, and the driver of the red van said, \u201cThat\u2019s him, he\u2019s the one.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Patillo\u2019s friends began to gather about, and the officers decided to question Patillo away from his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Officer Sampson . grabbed Patillo<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to steady him as they walked down the porch steps; Patillo was quite drunk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Upon reaching the sidewalk Patillo bolted. Sampson caught him and held him by the back of the belt while Officer Craig grabbed his arm. They decided to take him to their patrol car which was parked in an adjacent parking lot. One of Patillo\u2019s friends followed the officers, shouting and excoriating them; they warned him to stand back, and he withdrew. Once again Patillo tried to escape, flailing his arms at the officers. In the struggle that ensued, the officers struck Patillo about the head a number of times with their hands.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">The officers eventually got Patillo to their patrol car. It was parked parallel to a Chevrolet Camaro; the fronts of both cars were against a building. When Officers Craig and Sampson and Patillo entered the space between these two cars Patillo broke away and grabbed Craig\u2019s holstered revolver. The revolver became dislodged and fell to the ground. Patillo lunged at Sampson, who, fearing that Patillo had the gun, reacted by pulling his revolver and firing two shots into Patillo\u2019s abdomen. Patillo collapsed and was declared dead thirty minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">The shooting and the circumstances surrounding it were reviewed by the Internal Affairs Division and the Firearms Review Board of the Atlanta Police Department. Neither found any misconduct on the part of the officers. The Fulton County Grand Jury and the Federal Bureau of Investigation also reviewed the incident and recommended that no action be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Plaintiff, as administratrix of Patillo\u2019s estate, then filed this suit against the City of Atlanta, its Mayor, Public Safety Director, and Chief of Police, and Officers Craig and Sampson. She sought to recover against these defendants, jointly and severally, the money damages her decedent, Patillo, allegedly would have been entitled to recover had he survived.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Her complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>set forth, in separate counts, four discrete causes of action. Count one, the claim that gave the district court subject matter jurisdiction of the case, was brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982); plaintiff alleged that the defendants, acting under color of state law, had deprived Patillo of his life<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and liberty without due process of law, in violation of the fourteenth amendment, and had subjected him to an unreasonable seizure and cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the fourth, eighth and fourteenth amendments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The City allegedly deprived Patillo of these rights by promulgating a policy that permitted the deployment of untrained police officers and the use of excessive force in police-citizen encounters; the Mayor, Public Safety Director and Chief of Police (the supervisors) were allegedly liable because they implemented this policy in a general way. Officers Craig and Sampson deprived Patillo of his rights by beating and shooting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">Counts two, three, and four presented pendent state law claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Count two sought money damages for assault and battery; count three for false imprisonment; count four for false arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">The defendants filed a joint answer to plaintiffs complaint. They denied the material allegations of the complaint and alleged, as affirmative defenses, that no count of the complaint stated a claim for relief and that they had at all times maintained a reasonable good faith belief in the legality of their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">The case was tried to the court. At the close of the plaintiffs case, the defendants moved for dismissal pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 41(b). The court declined to render judgment until the close of all the evidence and therefore denied their motion. At the conclusion of the trial, the court asked the parties to brief the question of whether <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), barred plaintiffs count one section 1983 claim against any of the defendants. The parties submitted their briefs, but, inexplicably, the court did not deal with the <em>Parratt </em>ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>tion in its dispositive findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">In its dispositive order, the district court dealt with count one first. The court denied as meritless plaintiffs fourth and eighth amendment claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It upheld, however, plaintiffs section 1983 fourteenth amendment due process claim, concluding that the. City and Officers Craig and Sampson had deprived Patillo of a protected liberty interest,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the right to be free from the infliction of unnecessary physical force against one\u2019s person in a police-citizen encounter. The court held that one or more of these three defendants had deprived Patillo of this interest on two occasions: when he was struck about the head and when he was shot. The court concluded that Officers Craig and Sampson were the wrongdoers on the first occasion and held them liable for $1,000 in compensatory damages and $4,000 in punitive damages. The court held Sampson and the City liable for the shooting \u2014 Sampson because he performed the act, the City because it had trained him in a grossly negligent manner \u2014 and assessed $20,000 in compensatory damages against them. The court refused to assess punitive damages against either of these defendants because Sampson had acted in good faith, subjectively believing that Patillo had Craig\u2019s revolver in hand, and the City was immune from punitive damage liability under <em>City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., </em>453 U.S. 247, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981). The court found no liability upon the part of the supervisors for violating any of Patillo\u2019s federal constitutional rights because plaintiff failed to prove an \u201caffirmative link\u201d between the supervisors\u2019 conduct and the constitutional injury, as required by <em>Rizzo v. Goode, </em>423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">The district court disposed of plaintiff\u2019s state law claims summarily. The court denied her assault and battery claim on the theory that that claim was identical to, and duplicative of, her count one section 1983 due process claim. The court denied plaintiff\u2019s false imprisonment (count three) and false arrest (count four) claims because the officers had probable cause to arrest and detain Patillo. In a supplemental proceeding, the court awarded plaintiff $28,464.00 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">The City and the officers appeal, contending that the plaintiff\u2019s section 1983 claim against them was insufficient as a matter of law. They ask that we render judgment in their favor. The plaintiff cross-appeals, contending that the court misapplied <em>Rizzo v. Goode </em>in concluding that there was no \u201caffirmative link\u201d between the supervisors\u2019 conduct and Patillo\u2019s constitutional injury, and that we should direct the district court, on remand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>to enter liability and assess damages against the supervisors. The plaintiff also contends that the district court misapplied the law in assessing her attorney\u2019s fees and in disposing of her pendent state law claims against the supervisors and the officers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> She asks us to remand these issues to the district court for further consideration.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">For the reasons we set forth below, we conclude plaintiff failed to establish a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) case (count one) against the City under the standard of <em>Mo-nell v. Department of Social Services; </em>therefore, the City is entitled to judgment on count one of plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The plaintiff also failed to establish a section 1983 case against the officers or the supervisors. Her claim against the former was barred by <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>against the latter by <em>Rizzo v. Goode. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment on count one against the officers is reversed; with respect to the supervisors, the judgment in their favor is affirmed. Because of our disposition of plaintiff\u2019s section 1983 claims, she is not entitled to fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982), and the court\u2019s award thereof is set aside. Plaintiff\u2019s count two state law claim against the officers and the supervisors for assault and battery is remanded to the district court for further proceedings. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief on counts three and four, the state law claims for false imprisonment and false arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We discuss the issues on appeal as follows: in part II, the City\u2019s liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982); in parts III and IY, the officers\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 liability, respectively, under section 1983 and state tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\"><em>Monell v. Department of Social Services </em>holds that a municipality can be sued for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) when \u201cthe action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers\u201d or is \u201cvisited pursuant to governmental \u2018custom\u2019 even though such custom has not received formal approval through the body\u2019s official decision making channels.\u201d <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-36, <em>rev\u2019g in part Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). Thus, <em>Monell </em>imposes liability on municipalities for deprivations of constitutional rights visited pursuant to municipal policy, whether that policy is officially promulgated or authorized by custom. The official policy or custom \u201cmust be _ \u2018the moving force of the constitutional violation\u2019 in order to establish liability of a government body under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 102 S.Ct. 445, 454, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See Williams v. City of Valdosta, </em>689 F.2d 964, 969 (11th Cir.1982), citing <em>Schneider v. City of Atlanta, </em>628 F.2d 915, 920 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see also Hearn v. City of Gainesville, </em>688 F.2d 1328 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\"><em>Monell </em>limits what may constitute \u201ccustom.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Custom consists of those practices of city officials that are \u201cso permanent and well settled\u201d as to have \u201cthe force of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>436 U.S. at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036. In defining custom in this fashion the <em>Monell </em>Court borrowed language from <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 167-68, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1613-14, 26 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>142 (1970),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which defines the term \u201ccustom\u201d as \u201cpersistent and widespread ... practices\u201d or practices that are \u201cpermanent and well settled\u201d or \u201cdeeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out ... policy.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. Accord, Bennett v. City of Slidell, </em>728 F.2d 762 (5th Cir.1984) (en- banc). <em>Monell </em>additionally teaches that' the city custom which may serve as the basis for liability may only be created by city \u201clawmakers or those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.\u201d 436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2037-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Finally, <em>Monell </em>makes clear that a city may not be held liable simply because its. agent causes an injury, even a constitutional injury. As the Court cautioned, a municipality may not be held liable <em>\u201csolely </em>because it employs a tortfeasor \u2014 or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983 on a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036 (emphasis in original). <em>Accord, Owen v. City of Independence, </em>445 U.S. 622, 633, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 1406, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">In this case, plaintiff did not base the City\u2019s liability on the theory that the police officers injured Patillo in the process of executing an officially promulgated \u201cpolicy statement, ordinance, regulation or decision\u201d of the City of Atlanta. 436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-36. Rather, plaintiff sought to hold the City liable on the theory that the police officers injured Patillo while carrying out two alleged customs of the City, both presumably established by the supervisor defendants. The first was the custom of the Atlanta Police Department to encourage the use of excessive force in police-citizen encounters. The second was the Department\u2019s custom of selecting and training its officers improperly.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To prove the existence of each of these customs, the plaintiff had to establish two elements: that the custom had been created, and that it had been created or maintained <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> by one or more \u201clawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2037-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">Addressing the first custom plaintiff cited, the district court concluded that the plaintiff failed to prove the first element, that a police department custom encouraging the use of excessive force actually existed. The plaintiff produced very little evidence of incidents in which Atlanta police officers had used excessive force in citizen encounters and nothing at all to indicate that any policy-setting official had approved of, much less encouraged, such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">As for the second custom, the court made no effort to determine whether it even existed and, if it did, which officials, if any, had established it. Instead, the court focused on the question, irrelevant under the <em>Monell </em>standard, of whether the Atlanta Police Department had been negligent in training Officers Craig and Sampson. The court reviewed the Department\u2019s training programs, most of which were administered by its police academy, and found that the training currently given new officers was satisfactory.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Craig had received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>such training; the court therefore conclud.ed that the Department, and thus the City, had not been negligent in his case. In Sampson\u2019s case, however, the court found that the Department\u2019s training of him had been so lacking as to constitute \u201cgross negligence\u201d or \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d Sampson had joined the Atlanta police force in 1973 and received the police academy training given to new officers at that time. In 1978, he resigned from the force to pursue other unrelated employment. In 1979, Sampson returned to the force.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> At this time he was given a one-day \u201creorientation\u201d program; he then assumed the normal line officer duties. It was this one-day orientation and the Department\u2019s failure to give Sampson a psychological test (then being given to new officers) that the district court found to be \u201cgross negligence\u201d and \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d on the City\u2019s part.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court based the City\u2019s liability for Sampson\u2019s shooting of Patillo solely on this finding.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It made no findings concerning the retraining of other officers who had spent time off the force.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">The district court erred in two significant respects in holding that the Department\u2019s gross negligence in training Officer Sampson would suffice to render the City liable under the <em>Monell </em>standard. First, as we have observed, <em>Monell </em>instructs that, unless the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional deprivation resulted from the execution of official policy or custom, the City cannot be held liable for money damages. Here, the evidence conclusively showed that the City had no official policy or custom to select and train its police officers improperly.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Second, the district court predicated the City\u2019s liability on the doctrine of respondeat superior, a doctrine Mo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number><em>nell </em>explicitly eschewed. It is true that the court, in its dispositive order, did not state that the City was liable solely because of employee gross negligence, but the logic of that order renders this conclusion inescapable: one or more unnamed City employees, probably in the police department, were negligent to the point of indifference in failing to retrain Sampson, and this negligence proximately caused Patillo\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The district court cited no binding precedent from the Supreme Court, the Eleventh Circuit or the former Fifth Circuit for its holding that the gross negligence or deliberate indifference of a city agent or employee will support municipal liability for damages under section 1983, and we have found none. The court, instead, cited <em>Leite v. City of Providence, </em>463 F.Supp. 585 (D.R.I.1978), as the \u201cleading case in this area.\u201d In <em>Leite </em>the plaintiff brought a section 1983 claim against the City of Providence for failing to train properly its police officers, who had beaten the plaintiff. <em>Mo-nell </em>had just been handed down, and the <em>Leite </em>court, struggling with Monell\u2019s parameters, adopted the \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard of <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). <em>Gamble </em>held that a section 1983 eighth amendment claim could be brought against prison officials if they showed \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the medical needs of their inmates, thus constituting cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 97 S.Ct. at 291.'</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\"><em>Gamble </em>is factually and legally inappo-site, as it had nothing to do with municipal liability. Moreover, neither the Supreme Court nor this circuit has made the <em>Gamble </em>\u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d test applicable to fourteenth amendment due process claims against municipalities. Since <em>Gamble </em>preceded <em>Monell, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Mo-nell </em>easily could have incorporated the \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard into the municipal liability calculus had it wished to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">The district court cited other cases besides <em>Leite, </em>but none fully supports its finding of liability in this case. <em>See Edmonds v. Dillin, </em>485 F.Supp. 722, 727 (N.D.Ohio 1980) (\u201c \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 is not an apt standard for defining the degree of municipal culpability required under <em>Monell </em>\u201d); <em>Spriggs v. City of Chicago, </em>523 F.Supp. 138, 142 (N.D.Ill.1981) (\u201cproof of culpable policy or custom must be shown\u201d); <em>cf. Popow v. City of Margate, </em>476 F.Supp. 1237, 1246 (D.N.J.1979) (single brutal incident insufficient to give rise to liability, but relying on <em>Leite). See also Jackson v. City of Joliet, </em>715 F.2d 1200 (7th Cir.1983) (rejecting gross negligence theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">The legal prerequisite in this circuit for a finding of municipal liability under section 1983 remains that stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Monell </em>and by this court in <em>Hearn v. City of Gainesville, </em>688 F.2d 1328 (11th Cir.1982), and <em>Williams v. City of Valdosta, </em>689 F.2d 964 (5th Cir.1980). \u201cGross negligence\u201d or \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is simply not the proper test for adjudging a due process section 1983 claim against a municipality.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">In summary, the plaintiff in this case presented, at best, an isolated incident in which the police officers used excessive force to restrain an arrestee. The plaintiff did not present an incident that was the product of a City or police department custom to use excessive force. As the new Fifth Circuit recently observed, such \u201c[isolated violations are not the persistent, often repeated, constant violations that constitute custom and policy. Occasional acts of untrained policemen [standing alone] are not attributable] to city policy or custom.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>728 F.2d 762, 768 at n. 3. <em>Accord Berry v. McLemore, </em>670 F.2d 30, 32 (5th Cir.1982) (single improper arrest not custom); <em>McClelland v. Facteau, </em>610 F.2d 693 (10th Cir.1979); <em>see also Turpin v. Mailet, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>619 F.2d 196, 202 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Turpin v. City of West Haven, </em>449 U.S. 1016, 101 S.Ct. 577, 66 L.Ed.2d 475 (1980) (failure to discipline officer for single incident of illegality was.not official policy). Patillo\u2019s injury at the hands of Officers Craig and Sampson was not caused by their execution of official municipal policy or of custom. Accordingly, the judgment against the City of Atlanta must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Plaintiff claimed that Officers Craig and Sampson denied Patillo three federal constitutional rights: the fourth amendment right to be free, from unreasonable seizure, the eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and the fourteenth amendment right to due process of law. It is clear, as the district court found, that the officers had probable cause to arrest Patillo, or at least to make a brief forcible investigative detention under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), once the driver of the red van said, \u201cThat\u2019s him, he\u2019s the one.\u201d Thus, Patillo was not seized in violation of the fourth amendment. Plaintiff\u2019s eighth amendment claim was equally unavailing. The proscription against cruel and unusual punishment applies only after a criminal conviction. <em>See United States v. Lovett, </em>328 U.S. 303, 317-18, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 1079-80, 90 L.Ed. 1252 (1946); <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1872 n. 16, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Since Patillo did not occupy a convict status, he could not have had an eighth amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment states, \u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of Law____\u201d U.S. Const. amend. XIV \u00a7 1. Plaintiff made no claim that the officers deprived Patillo of his life or property without due process of law;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> rather, she claimed that the officers deprived Patillo of a protected liberty interest, one\u2019s interest in being free from the government\u2019s use of unnecessary physical force against his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">There is no dispute that the plaintiff\u2019s proof satisfied three prerequisites of a valid fourteenth amendment due process claim: the officers acted under color of state law; they infringed a protected liberty interest; and the injuries Patillo suffered amounted to a deprivation. \u201cStanding alone, however, these three elements do not establish a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nothing in that Amendment protects against all deprivations of life, liberty, or property by the State. The Fourteenth Amendment protects only against deprivations \u2018without due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 537, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1913-14, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), citing <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 145, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2695, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979). Our inquiry \u201ctherefore must focus on whether [the plaintiff\u2019s decedent] suffered a deprivation of [liberty] without due process of law.\u201d Specifically, we must decide \u201cwhether the tort remedies which the State of [Georgia] provides as a means of redress for [liberty] deprivations satisfy the requirements of procedural due process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">At the time of Patillo\u2019s deprivation, and, as well, at the time his administratrix instituted this action, Georgia provided tort remedies precisely for the sort of injuries Patillo sustained at the hands of the officers here. <em>See, e.g., Stewart v. Williams, </em>243 Ga. 580, 255 S.E.2d 699 (Ga.1979) (discussing state torts of intentional and negligent false imprisonment); Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-601, 602 (1968 &amp; 1981 Supp.) (battery); <em>Thomas v. Williams, </em>105 Ga.App. 321, 124 S.E.2d 409 (1962) (police officer negligently permitting battery). The narrow question we must decide is whether these post-deprivation remedies satisfied the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>The Supreme Court has made it plain that a post-deprivation remedy will not suffice if \u201cthe deprivation ... was pursuant to some established state procedure and \u2018process\u2019 could be offered before any actual deprivation took place.\u201d <em>Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 537, 101 S.Ct. at 1914. <em>See, e.g., Mullane v.

In each of these cases, the deprivation was authorized by an established state procedure and due process was held to require predeprivation notice and hearing in order to serve as a check on the possibility that wrongful deprivation would occur. <em>See also Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 537-38, 101 S.Ct. at 1914 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The Supreme Court has held, however, that a post-deprivation remedy can satisfy due process when quick action by the government is necessary or the provision of predeprivation process is impracticable, if the post-deprivation remedy is afforded \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 101 S.Ct. at 1915, citing <em>Armstrong v.

The conduct was also random; neither the City nor the officers could have predicted precisely when it could occur. Indeed, Patillo\u2019s deprivation, although under color of state law, was beyond the control of the government. In sum, \u201cit [was] not only impracticable, but impossible, to provide a meaningful hearing before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>the deprivation.\u201d 451 U.S. at 541, 101 S.Ct. at 1916.

Justice Blackmun gave no reason for treating \u201cliberty\u201d different from \u201cproperty\u201d under the fourteenth amendment,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and such a distinction is contrary to <em>Ingraham v. </em>Wright,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> 430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977), in which the Court held that post-deprivation common law remedies provided all the process due a school child whose liberty has been deprived by (intentional) paddling by school authorities. The <em>Parratt </em>majority said that its analysis was \u201cquite consistent\u201d with the analysis it adopted in <em>Ingraham. </em>451 U.S. at 542, 101 S.Ct. at 1916. We think a proper reading of <em>Parratt </em>and its predecessors, and the better reasoned lower court cases and scholarly articles, support the application of Parratt\u2019s rationale to cases involving intentional deprivations of liberty.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>But cf. </em>text at 910. The due process claim in <em>Ingraham </em>failed even though the plaintiff proved an intentional deprivation of liberty.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>See also Smolla, supra </em>at 874 n. 185. Moreover, <em>Parratt </em>itself held that the defendant\u2019s state of mind is irrelevant in assessing whether the plaintiff has a cause of action under section 1983, 451 U.S. at 534, 101 S.Ct. at 1912. Whether a deprivation is sudden and intentional or merely negligent, the state cannot practically provide pre-deprivation process.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Finally, we find nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>in the debates that surrounded the adoption of the fourteenth amendment that indicates that the framers intended that liberty and property interests receive different treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Having denied plaintiffs constitutional claim against the officers, we must add a caveat. Section 1983 creates no substantive rights. <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>441 U.S. 600, 617, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1916, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979). Plaintiff filed suit in federal court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) seeking a review under the U.S. Constitution of the deprivation of Patillo\u2019s liberty. Except for matters the district court dismissed as frivolous, the plaintiff did not allege any violation of <em>substantive </em>guarantees of the federal Constitution. Like the plaintiff in <em>Parratt, </em>the plaintiff here \u201creferred] to no other right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or federal laws other than the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment <em>simpliciter.\u201d Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 536, 101 S.Ct. at 1913. <em>See Williams v. Kelley, </em>624 F.2d 695, 697 (5th Cir.1980) (death-causing chokehold by police stated no section 1983 claim; \u201cfederal [civil] rights protection [is] far less extensive than that afforded by the common law of battery and negligence\u201d). Thus our holding today is in line with <em>Duncan v. Poythress, </em>657 F.2d 691, 704 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), where the plaintiffs claim was held to be <em>not </em>barred by <em>Parratt </em>because it was based on the substantive due process right to vote. <em>See </em>Wells &amp; Eaton, <em>Substantive Due Process and the Scope of Constitutional Torts, </em>18 Ga.L.Rev. 201 (1984). Additionally, the acts of the police here, although most unfortunate, did not \u201coffend those canons of decency and fairness which express the notions of English-speaking peoples even toward those charged with the most heinous offense\u201d or \u201cshock the conscience,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> so as to violate the .substantive due process guarantees \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">The district court denied plaintiffs pendent state law claims against the officers for false imprisonment and false arrest because they were frivolous. We affirm this holding. The court held that the pendent assault and battery claim (count two) had merit, but denied the claim because it would result in damages duplicative of those awarded for the fourteenth amendment due process violation (count one). This was error; the facts the court found concerning the beating and shooting supported state tort liability. Assuming that the elements of compensatory and punitive damages under the section 1983 and assault and battery claims were the same, the court should have given the plaintiff one money judgment, based on both claims. The parties have not briefed this damages issue, however; therefore, we remand it to the district court for further exploration.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s count one 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) claim against the supervisors is subject to the same <em>Parratt </em>analysis we applied to her claim against the police officers; we look to Georgia law to determine, what post-deprivation tort remedies were available to the plaintiff and whether those remedies were adequate. Our canvas of the Georgia statutory and case law leaves us in considerable doubt as to whether the plaintiff had adequate remedies against the supervisors for the injury Patillo sustained. <em>Compare Massey v. Perkerson, </em>129 Ga.App. 895, 201 S.E.2d 830 (1973) (police chief not liable for tort of subordinate unless he was present, ordered, or supervised the conduct) <em>with </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 24-2812 (1981) (sheriff liable for tortious conduct of deputies in the line of duty). We need not resolve this doubt, however, because another issue is dispositive of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The district court denied the plaintiff\u2019s due process claim against the supervisors because there was no \u201caffirmative link\u201d between their alleged negligence and the deprivation of Patillo\u2019s liberty. <em>Rizzo v. Goode, </em>423 U.S. 362, 371, 96 S.Ct. 598, 604, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976), teaches that to prevail against persons in a supervisory role the plaintiff must demonstrate an \u201caffirmative link\u201d between his deprivation and \u201cthe adoption of [a] plan or policy by [the supervisors] \u2014 express or otherwise\u2014 showing their authorization or approval of such misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>A \u201cmere right to control\u201d is not enough. <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694 n. 58, 98 S.Ct. at 2037 n. 58, citing <em>Rizzo, </em>423 U.S. at 370-71, 96 S.Ct. at 602. The district court found no such link; its findings of fact on this issue are not clearly erroneous, Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and its conclusions of law were correct. The court\u2019s judgment in favor of the supervisors on count one must, accordingly, be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s pendent state law claims against the supervisors, which the district court summarily rejected, it is clear from the record that the plaintiff cannot prevail on her claims of false imprisonment (count three) and false arrest (count four). We cannot determine, however, from the court\u2019s dispositive findings and conclusions the basis for such rejection of plaintiff\u2019s assault and battery claim against the supervisors (count two) and thus cannot review the sufficiency of that claim. We therefore vacate the court\u2019s judgment in favor of the supervisors on count two and remand it for further findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"AgqL\">In conclusion, as to the City of Atlanta, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment on count one and direct the court, 6n receipt of the mandate, to enter judgment for the City.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">As to Officers Craig and Sampson, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment on count one and direct the court, on receipt of the mandate, to enter judgment in the officers\u2019 favor; we VACATE the court\u2019s judgment on count two and REMAND the case as to that count, directing the court to hold the officers liable to the plaintiff, in accordance with the court\u2019s previous findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to assess plaintiff\u2019s damages against them in accordance with Georgia law; we AFFIRM the court\u2019s judgment on counts three and four.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">As to the supervisors, the Mayor, Public Safety Director and Chief of Police, we AFFIRM the court\u2019s judgment on counts one, three, and four; we VACATE the court\u2019s judgment on count two and REMAND the case as to that count for the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">We REVERSE the district court as to the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982). against the City of Atlanta and Officers Craig and Sampson.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">We REVERSE the judgment of costs against the City of Atlanta; we VACATE the judgment of costs against Officers Craig and Sampson, without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s right to seek the taxation of costs at the conclusion of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Before GODBOLD, Chief Judge, RONEY, TJOFLAT, HILL, FAY, VANCE, KRAV-ITCH, JOHNSON, HENDERSON, HATCHETT, ANDERSON and CLARK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<author id=\"b976-5\">BY THE COURT:</author>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">A member of this court in active service having requested a poll on the application for rehearing en banc and a majority of the judges in this court in active service having voted in favor of granting a rehearing en banc,</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">IT IS ORDERED that the cause shall be reheard by this court en banc <em>with </em>oral argument on a date hereafter to be fixed.

Sampson had been a police officer from 1973-1978. He quit the force as an officer in good standing in 1978 to pursue another career but was rehired in 1979. When he came on the force in 1973 he completed the then-standard six-week academy training. He received no psychological testing. When Officer Craig was hired, some time later, he received 13 weeks\u2019 academy training and was tested psychologically. During Sampson\u2019s five years as an officer, from 1973-1978, two citizen complaints were filed against Sampson; he was cleared on each occasion. The two performance evaluations introduced into evidence showed that Sampson scored average and above average marks, although one of the evaluations suggested that he could \"mature\" and \"curb his temper.\u201d There was also evidence concerning Sampson\u2019s many speeding tickets and pilfering from work before becoming an officer and his casual marijuana use while on the force.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Sampson\u2019s employment record also contained high praise for him as an officer. One month his zone commander nominated him for officer of the month due to his \"determination and dedication to his duty\u201d in clearing 30 robberies in Southwest Atlanta. He received a written commendation for a \u201cjob well done\u201d from his lieutenant for apprehending a band of violent purse snatchers who preyed on elderly women. This arrest closed 23 cases. Before he was rehired, Sampson\u2019s former immediate supervisors were requested to comment upon his work as an officer from 1973-1978. A sergeant who supervised Sampson on morning watch described him as \"one of the best officers [I] have ever known ... a very conscientious worker, very reliable and cleared as many burglaries as the rest of the watch combined.\" A second lieutenant described Sampson as \u201cvery knowledgeable, conscientious and a very good worker ... we ' need more officers like Sampson and [I] would like to see him back.\" After he was rehired, the Chief of Police wrote Sampson, in 1979, to convey thanks from two citizens, who \u201cwere highly complimentary, citing your kindness and efficiency\u201d in a suicide case. In a November 1978 polygraph test, taken when he was seeking readmission to the police force, Sampson admitted to infrequent use of marijuana, the most recent episode being 10 months before. The polygraph report stated that \"no deception\u201d was indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b967-10\">.

Ironically, the district court found that the supervisors, the Mayor, the Public Safety Director, and the Chief of Police, were not responsible for the poor refresher training given Sampson. The district court hypothesized that the plaintiff may simply have named the wrong supervisors as parties defendant and as those responsible for city policy under the <em>Monell </em>standard. According to the court, Patillo\u2019s beating was caused by Craig and Sampson\u2019s vexation at Patillo, not Sampson\u2019s poor training.

The <em>Parratt </em>holding did not come as a total surprise. The Supreme Court had been developing the <em>Parratt </em>analysis for a number of years prior to <em>Parratt. See </em>cases cited <em>supra </em>text at 905-906 and accompanying notes. In <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), the Chief of Police of Louisville, Kentucky, had circulated Davis picture to local merchants on a flyer purporting to identify \"ACTIVE SHOPLIFTERS.\u201d Davis was, in fact, not a shoplifter. Rather than suing for defamation in state court, Davis brought a 1983 action, alleging that his liberty and property were denied under color of state law without due process. Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, noted that the complaint was \u201cnothing more than a claim for defamation under state law\u201d and the due process clause did not <em>\"ex proprio vigore </em>extend to him a right to be free of injury wherever the State may be characterized as the tortfeasor.\u201d 424 U.S. at 698, 701, 96 S.Ct. at 1159-60. To hold otherwise would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvT\">make of the Fourteenth Amendment a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States. We have noted the \"constitutional shoals\" that confront any attempt to derive ,from congressional civil rights statutes a body of general federal tort law____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-8\"><em>Id., </em>citing <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 101-02, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 1797-98, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971). The Court then went on to hold that Davis had stated no claim under section 1983 because reputation, alone, is not broad enough to constitute a liberty or property interest. For an excellent analysis of <em>Paul, see </em>Smolla <em>supra </em>note 13, at 836-40.</p>\n<p id=\"AI1\">In the next case, <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977), <em>aff'g </em>525 F.2d 909 (5th Cir.1976), a case from the former Fifth Circuit, the Supreme Court encountered a section 1983 class action brought on behalf of school children, who alleged that their liberty was curtailed without due process when their public school teachers paddled them for disciplinary reasons without affording them a prior hearing. The Court agreed that the children had a constitutionally protected liberty interest in bodily security but, just as in <em>Paul, </em>the Court noted that a time-tested and fully effective remedy for the injury existed in state law: the tort of assault and battery. The Court held that because a predeprivation hearing before every school paddling was impractical, the state remedies provided the only \"process\u201d which was due. The Court relied on the openness of our schools and the historically low incidence of paddling abuse by teachers to conclude that \"the Fourteenth Amendment's re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>quirement of procedural due process is satisfied by Florida\u2019s preservation of common law constraints and remedies.\" 430 U.S. at 676, 97 S.Ct. at 1419. <em>Ingraham </em>thus stands for the proposition that when a predeprivation process is impracticable a state may, at least in some situations, still intentionally deprive a person of liberty so long as the state provides adequate and effective post-deprivation remedies, usually in the form of a tort.action. Because of the undesirability or impracticality of affording pre-dep-rivation process, full process is available <em>after </em>the deprivation and the procedural protections of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment are not impaired. The <em>Ingraham </em>analysis is consistent with prior Supreme Court cases where pre-deprivation hearings were impractical or impossible. <em>See </em>cases cited <em>supra </em>text at 905-906; <em>see abo Fahey v. Mallonee, </em>332 U.S. 245, 67 S.Ct. 1552, 91 L.Ed. 2030 (1947); (bank failing); <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) (termination of Social Security benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">The Supreme Court encountered a third section 1983 deprivation of liberty case in <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979), <em>rev'g McCollan v. Tate, </em>575 F.2d 509, 511 (5th Cir.1978). In that case the plaintiff was arrested on a facially valid warrant which was intended for his brother. The mistake was caused because the brother had used the plaintiff's driver\u2019s license which was altered so that it sported the brother\u2019s photograph. The plaintiff protested his innocence for eight days and was released when the sheriff finally discovered that he had the wrong man. In addressing this case the former Fifth Circuit relied totally upon tort law principles, in effect reading the false imprisonment portion of the <em>Second Restatement of Torts </em>into the fourteenth amendment. <em>See </em>575 F.2d at 512-13. The Supreme Court, again through Justice Rehnquist, reversed; the High Court held that plaintiff may have made out a prima facie case for the state tort of false imprisonment, but that claim did not rise to a fourteenth amendment claim just because the defendant was a state official. The Court stated, \"[sjection 1983 imposes liability for violations of rights protected by the Constitution, not for violations of duties of care arising out of tort law. Remedy for the latter type of injury must be sought in state court under traditional tort-law principles.\" 443 U.S. at 146, 99 S.Ct. 2696-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">The Court then surveyed the sheriffs procedures for verifying the identity of his prisoners. Although the procedures did not totally eliminate the chance of error, they were found adequate and the warrant was facially valid; thus, plaintiff had not been deprived of due process. The Court made clear that it was aware of existing remedies in state court although this was not a main basis for the holding. One perceptive commentator has noted that in <em>McCollan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-13\">The only place that adequate due process could have existed ... was after-the-fact, in the form of money damages. No pre-deprivation due process could possibly have been provided, since the state officials thought that they had their man. The state officials, because of the warrant, thought that pre-depri-vation process <em>had </em>taken place____ In such a situation the only relief that can be afforded ... is money damages, and ... state tort remedies alone ought to be sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">Smolla, <em>supra </em>note 13, at 853 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">The <em>Parratt </em>holding was also foreshadowed by <em>Bonner v. Coughlin, </em>517 F.2d 1311 (7th Cir.1975) <em>modified en banc, </em>545 F.2d 565 (1976), <em>cert. denied </em>435 U.S. 932, 98 S.Ct. 1507, 55 L.Ed.2d 529 (1978), a case written by Justice Stevens when he sat on the Seventh Circuit. There, a prisoner claimed in a section 1983 due process suit that his jailers negligently caused the loss of his property. The <em>Bonner </em>court, 517 F.2d at 1319, dismissed the claim, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-17\">[Tjhere is an important difference between a challenge to an established state procedure as lacking in due process and a property damage claim arising out of the misconduct of state officers____ For in [the latter case] ... the law of Illinois provides, in substance, that the plaintiff is entitled to be made whole for any loss of property occasioned by the unauthorized conduct of the prison guards____ [T]he existence of an adequate state remedy to redress property damage inflicted by state officers avoids the conclusion that there has been any constitutional deprivation of property without due process of law____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-22\">The <em>Parratt </em>Court cited <em>Bonner </em>as the \"proper manner\u201d in which to approach the plaintiff's due process claim. The Court also noted that <em>Bonner </em>was \"quite consistent\u201d with the approach taken in <em>Ingraham </em>even though <em>Ingraham </em>involved intentional invasions of a liberty interest rather than negligent loss of property. 451 U.S. at 542-43, 101 S.Ct. 1916. The <em>Parratt </em>Court added emphasis to a quote from <em>Ingraham </em>showing that the key to <em>Ingraham </em>\u2014like <em>Bonner </em>\u2014was <em>\"the common law safeguards that already </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number><em>exist.\" Id. </em>at 543, 101 S.Ct. at 1917 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b972-10\">. <em>See supra </em>text at 905.

The Ninth Circuit addressed this issue in <em>Rutledge, </em>660 F.2d at 1345, a case where a football player for Arizona State University brought a due process section 1983 action against a coach when the coach assaulted him. Assuming that the coach deprived the player of constitutionally protected liberty, the court held that the deprivation was not without due process as defined by <em>Parratt. </em>The liberty denial was random, could not have been accompanied by predepri-vation process, and post-deprivation state remedies were sufficient. 660 F.2d at 1352. Accordingly, Parratt, as applied to the facts of <em>Rutledge, </em>impelled the conclusion \"that the alleged deprivation was not without due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. Wakinekona v.

Olim </em>has been subjected to some very telling criticism in this regard. <em>See </em>Smolla, <em>supra </em>note 14, at 863-65.

Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion and was joined without comment by the Chief Justice and Justices Brennan and Stevens. Justice Powell concurred only in the result, because to him mere negligence could not cause a constitutional deprivation. Justice Stewart concurred briefly, stating that the injury was not of constitutional proportions. Justice Marshall concurred in part and dissented in part; he viewed the state remedy as inadequate.

One reason given for subjecting property interests but not liberty interests to the <em>Parratt </em>analysis is that property, once taken away, can be fully recompensed later through post-deprivation money damages, while liberty, once taken, cannot be returned to the <em>status quo ante </em>because liberty cannot be adequately valued or measured. For example, a person struck by a policeman cannot be \"un-struck,\u201d but if a policeman merely destroys the person\u2019s car, the car can be fully replaced by state tort law damages. This argument, suggested by Professor Irene Rosenberg in Ingraham v. Wright: <em>The Supreme Courtis Whipping Boy, </em>78 Colum.L.Rev. 75, 90-91 (1978), is contrary to elementary notions of tort law and was clearly foreclosed by <em>Ingraham, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b973-11\">. <em>See also, e.g., </em>Monaghan, <em>Of \u201cLiberty\u201d and \"Property\u201d, </em>62 Cornell L.Rev. 405, 431 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-12\">[p]rior hearings might well be dispensed with in many circumstances in which the state\u2019s conduct, if not adequately justified, would constitute a common-law tort.

See </em>Smolla, <em>supra </em>note 13, at 859-62. The <em>Logan </em>Court also distinguished <em>Ingraham. Ingraham </em>differed from <em>Logan </em>because state tort remedies provided adequate post-deprivation process. The state system in <em>Ingraham </em>\"preserved what \u2018has always been the law of the land'\" while the property in <em>Logan </em>was terminated haphazardly by an established state procedure, \"hardly a practice in line with our common-law traditions.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1158 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Summarizing the relationship of <em>Parratt </em>to <em>Logan </em>in his trenchant essay Professor Smolla stated: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-10\">Random and unauthorized harm caused by the state, for which the state itself provides a remedy, does not implicate the Constitution. But when the state consciously enacts a system that places its imprimatur on arbitrary conduct ... through ... a capricious administrative structure for handling handicap discrimination, federal court intervention under the due process clause is warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">Smolla, <em>supra </em>note 13, at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">In the instant case, unlike the situation in <em>Logan, </em>the plaintiff did not prove a deprivation caused-by an established state procedure. The deprivation was caused instead by an unpredictable and unauthorized act. <em>Parratt </em>shows that in such a case due process can be satisfied by an adequate post-deprivation hearing, <em>e.g., </em>a state tort suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b974-13\">. <em>Rochin v.
