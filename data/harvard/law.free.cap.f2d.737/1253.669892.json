Basing its decision on New York state law and the federal Constitution, the court found that the defendant officials of the State of New York had maintained living conditions at the Suffolk Developmental Center (SDC) that failed to meet statutory and constitutional standards. It ordered extensive changes in the operations and facilities at SDC and the community placement of 400 SDC residents by 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">In <em>Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, </em>737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984), we vacated the district court\u2019s order. We held that parts of the order could not be justified on federal constitutional grounds. We could not discern whether the remainder of the order was predicated on federal constitutional grounds or state law grounds. Because the Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from granting state law relief in actions against state officials, <em>see Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), we remanded so that the district court could determine which parts of its order were mandated by the federal Constitution. Finally, because the district court did not consider any of the plaintiffs\u2019 federal statutory claims, we held that it was free to consider those claims on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">The instant appeal and cross-appeal concern the district court\u2019s November 30, 1983 award of attorney\u2019s fees based on its August 10 order. Because we vacated the entire order in <em>Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, </em>737 F.2d 1239 (2d Cir.1984), plaintiffs have not yet prevailed on the merits in any way. An award of attorney\u2019s fees is available under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (Supp. IV 1980) \u201conly to a party who has established his entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims.-\u2019 <em>Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 757, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 1989, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980) (per curiam). While our earlier opinion may make it seem likely that plaintiffs will be entitled to some relief, it is impossible to be certain how much \u2014 if any \u2014 will eventually be granted. Therefore, an award of attorney\u2019s fees at this point would be premature. The order of class certification which we affirmed does not constitute \u201crelief on the merits,\u201d and cannot be the basis of an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-9\">Defendants are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, as plaintiffs\u2019 action was not groundless. <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 14-15, 101 S.Ct. 173, 178-179, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">The order of the district court, 574 F.Supp. 994, is vacated. The case is remanded with instructions to deny the motion for attorney\u2019s fees, without prejudice to its subsequent renewal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
