MARTIN, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AE6l\">Terrance Alan Eddy appeals his conviction for perjury pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">Whoever under oath ... in any proceeding before ... any court of the United States knowingly makes any false material declaration ... shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">In October 1982, Eddy was indicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 for knowingly making a false report or statement for the purpose of influencing the action of a federally insured bank. <em>See United States v. Terrance Alan Eddy, </em>Pikeville, Kentucky, Eastern District of Kentucky Indictment No. 82-14. Eddy was acquitted by a jury of the charge. On May 2, 1983, Eddy was indicted on two counts of perjury. He was charged with giving false testimony while being cross-examined during an <em>in camera </em>hearing in the earlier criminal case. In response to the perjury indictment, Eddy filed several pretrial motions, including motions to dismiss the indictment because the prosecutor\u2019s questions were ambiguous, the indictment failed to set forth the precise falsehoods charged, and the decision to prosecute Eddy was motivated by vindictiveness. All of Eddy\u2019s motions were overruled on the first day of trial, July 26, 1983. On July 27, a verdict of guilty was returned on both counts. Eddy was sentenced to five years in prison on each count, with directions that a psychiatric study be conducted within ninety days pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(c). The district judge also directed that after the psychiatric study Eddy be returned to the district court for a possible modification of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">The statements which were the basis of the perjury indictment were made in a hearing in chambers where the United States sought to prove that Eddy had used an Ohio State University College of Medicine diploma and an Ohio State University college transcript in efforts to enlist as a physician in the United States Navy. Count I of the indictment for perjury was based upon the following dialogue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-15\">PROSECUTOR: Are you the same Terrance Alan Eddy that on or about March 20, 1981, contacted the Navy Medical Programs Recruiter for the Navy Recruiting District of Jacksonville, Florida?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-16\">EDDY: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-17\">PROSECUTOR: Claiming to be a doctor graduated from the Ohio State University School of Medicine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-18\">EDDY: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-19\">PROSECUTOR: And expressing a desire to join the Navy as a doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-20\">EDDY: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-21\">PROSECUTOR: And as proof or as part of your personal history submitted a diploma from the Ohio State University College of Medicine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-22\">EDDY: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-23\">PROSECUTOR: And official college transcript?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-24\">EDDY: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-25\">Count II was based on the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-26\">PROSECUTOR: Mr. Eddy, do you think if you applied for staff privileges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>at a hospital as a physician, do you think you would remember doing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">EDDY: I would suppose so, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">PROSECUTOR: Do you think you would remember doing an act like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">EDDY: Do I remember? No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">PROSECUTOR: Do you think you would remember doing it, if you did it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">EDDY: I would guess so, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">PROSECUTOR: In that ease, I would ask you the question again. Are you the same Terrance Alan Eddy who attempted to gain staff privileges at the Putnam County Community Hospital in Palatka, Florida, and in doing so showed credentials from the Ohio State University and a certificate from the Board of Medical Examiners from the State of Florida indicating that you were licensed to practice medicine in that state? And I think we can take that to mean you represented yourself as a physician. Did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">EDDY: Like I said, I don\u2019t remember going there. I don\u2019t remember doing this action. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Here, Eddy argues the United States failed to prove that his declarations were false. In response it is argued that Eddy\u2019s claims that his declarations were literally true provide no protection from a perjury conviction because the falsity of the statements and the questions were sufficiently clear to withstand a vagueness challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">We address first the argument by Eddy that his testimony was the literal truth. In <em>Bronston v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973), the Court held a witness may not be convicted of \u201cperjury for an answer, under oath, that is literally true but not responsive to the question asked and arguably misleading by negative implication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 93 S.Ct. at 597. In <em>Bronston, </em>the defendant had petitioned for an arrangement with creditors under old Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. At a hearing to determine the location of certain assets connected with the company, the following exchange between Bronston and a lawyer occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">Q. Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr. Bronston?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-14\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-15\">Q. Have you ever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-16\">A. The company had an account there for six months, in Zurich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-17\">Q. Have you any nominees who have bank accounts in Swiss banks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-18\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-19\">Q. Have you ever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-20\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">As a matter of later proven fact, Bron-ston once had a personal Swiss bank account, but did not have one at the time of his testimony. Bronston was later charged with and convicted of perjury based on the government\u2019s theory that he had answered the second question with \u201cliteral truthfulness but unresponsively addressed his answer to [his] company\u2019s assets and not to his own \u2014 thereby implying that he had no personal Swiss bank account at the relevant time.\u201d <em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 355, 93 S.Ct. at 598. Acknowledging that Bron-ston\u2019s testimony was not responsive and subject to conflicting interpretations when viewed as casual conversation, the Court nonetheless stated that \u201cwe are not dealing with casual conversation and the statute does not make it a criminal act for a witness to willfully state any material matter that <em>implies </em>any material matter that he does not believe to be true.\u201d 409 U.S. at 357-58, 93 S.Ct. at 599-600 (emphasis in the original). The Court noted that it is the \u201clawyer\u2019s responsibility to recognize [evasive testimony] and to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 93 S.Ct. at 600. Also rejected was the claim that a perjury conviction could be founded upon an attempt by a witness to mislead his examiner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-22\">A jury should not be permitted to engage in conjecture whether an unresponsive answer,- true and complete on its face, was intended to mislead or divert the examiner; the state of mind of the witness is relevant only to the extent that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>bears on whether \u201che does not believe [his answer] to be true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 359, 93 S.Ct. at 600. The Court dismissed the contention that the perjury statute could be broadly construed to apply to a situation where a witness makes \u201caffirmative statements of one fact that in context constituted denials by negative implication of a related fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 93 S.Ct. at 601. It noted the perjury statute was not intended to cover unresponsive testimony that is untrue only by \u201cnegative implication,\u201d despite the misleading nature of such testimony. \u201cIt does not matter that the unresponsive answer is stated in the affirmative, thereby implying the negative of the question actually imposed.\u201d 409 U.S. at 362, 93 S.Ct. at 602. Where a witness initially succeeds in avoiding direct answers to an examiner\u2019s questions, it is the questioner\u2019s burden \u201cto pin the witness down to the specific object\u201d of his inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 93 S.Ct. at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Although <em>Bronston </em>dealt with a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, it's reasoning has been extended to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623, the provision involved here. <em>United States v. Cowley, </em>720 F.2d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Finucan, </em>708 F.2d 838, 847 (1st Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Niemiec, </em>611 F.2d 1207, 1210 (7th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Tonelli, </em>577 F.2d 194, 198 n. 3 (3d Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Crippen, </em>570 F.2d 535, 537 (5th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Paolicelli, </em>505 F.2d 971, 973 (4th Cir.1974). As the Third Circuit has noted, in perjury cases, \u201c[n]o guessing is tolerated [in the drafting of a perjury indictment] and the indictment must set out the allegedly perjurious statements and the objective truth in stark contrast so that the claim of falsity is clear to all who read the charge.\u201d <em>United States v. Tonelli, supra, </em>577 F.2d at 195. In order to sustain a perjury conviction, the questions and answers which support the conviction must demonstrate both that the defendant was fully aware of the actual meaning behind the examiner\u2019s questions and that the defendant knew his answers were not the truth. <em>Bronston, supra, </em>409 U.S. at 358-59, 93 S.Ct. at 599-600. \u201cOnce a defendant raises the affirmative defense of his belief in the truth of a statement, the burden is on the government to disprove this belief beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Stassi, </em>443 F.Supp. 661, 666-67 (D.N.J.1977). Vague and ambiguous questions are not acceptable. <em>See United States v. Wall, </em>371 F.2d 398, 399-400 (6th Cir.1967), <em>cited with approval in Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 360, 93 S.Ct. at 600; <em>United States v. Finucan, supra, </em>708 F.2d at 846-48; <em>United States v. Tonelli, </em>577 F.2d at 200; <em>United States v. Cook, </em>497 F.2d 753, 764 (9th Cir.1972) (Ely, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>But cf. United States v. Bell, </em>623 F.2d 1132, 1136 (5th Cir.1980) (defendant\u2019s understanding of the question is a matter for the jury to decide).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Count I of the indictment charges that Eddy\u2019s declarations were false because he did contact the Navy Recruiting District in Jacksonville, Florida, claiming to be a doctor, and \u201cdid submit a diploma from the Ohio State University College of Medicine and [an] official college transcript.\u201d Eddy, however, argues he spoke the literal truth because, though he concedes contacting the Navy, he maintains that he did not submit an \u201cofficial\u201d medical diploma or an \u201cofficial\u201d college transcript. He claims that the documents he submitted were novelty items not meant to be taken seriously. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Therefore, according to Eddy, his negative response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions were the literal truth. Indeed, the record supports Eddy\u2019s claims. At the suppression hearing in question, the following exchange occurred between Eddy and the prosecutor concerning Eddy\u2019s activities in Florida in trying to join the Navy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">PROSECUTOR: Are you the same Terrance Alan Eddy who, on March 20, 1981, contacted the Navy Medical Programs Recruiter for the Navy Recruiting District of Jacksonville, Florida, claiming to be a doctor graduated from the Ohio State University of Medicine and expressing a desire to join the Navy as a doctor; and as proof of your credentials submitted a diploma from the Ohio State University College of Medicine and official college transcript?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">THE COURT: Do you want to confer with Mr. Johnson [Eddy\u2019s trial counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">DEFENDANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">PROSECUTOR: That\u2019s on or about March 20, 1981.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">DEFENDANT: My attempt to join the Navy-, yes, but conferring myself as a physician, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, may I ask with regard to his understanding of that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">THE COURT: Yes, sir. Repeat that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">PROSECUTOR: Mr. Eddy, do you understand what I asked you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">DEFENDANT: (Nodded his head)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">PROSECUTOR: Okay, I will repeat the question. Are you the same Terrance Alan Eddy that on or about March 20, 1981, contacted the Navy Medical Programs Recruiter for the Navy Recruiting District of Jacksonville, Florida, claiming to be a doctor graduated from the Ohio State University School of Medicine and expressing a desire to join the Navy as a doctor; and as proof of your credentials, provided a diploma from the Ohio State University College of Medicine and an official college transcript?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-14\">DEFENDANT: (There was no response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-16\">THE COURT: If you want to confer with Mr. Johnson, sir, the Court will give you an opportunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-17\">DEFENDANT: No, sir. It\u2019s a loaded question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-18\">THE COURT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-19\">DEFENDANT: The reason being I applied to the Navy but not as a physician. I went, I wanted to go into the Navy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-20\">PROSECUTOR: Mr. Eddy, you understand my question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-21\">THE COURT: Let him answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-22\">PROSECUTOR: I am sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-23\">DEFENDANT: I wanted to go into the Navy into the medical program, but not as a doctor. I never told them I was a doctor. I told them I wanted to go into their medical program because I understood they had a very good program. I did not apply as a physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-24\">PROSECUTOR: Did you represent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-25\">yourself as a physician?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-26\">DEFENDANT: Not unless they took it different than I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-27\">PROSECUTOR: Submit false documentation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-28\">DEFENDANT: Do they have false documentation that I did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-29\">PROSECUTOR: I asked you the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-30\">DEFENDANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-31\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t submit a diploma to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-32\">DEFENDANT: It is not my recollection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-33\">THE COURT: Read specifically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-34\">PROSECUTOR: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-35\">THE COURT: Read specifically the documentation he was supposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-36\">PROSECUTOR: The documentation I am talking about, if we are talking about the entire documentation that was submitted, a statement of personal history, a diploma from the Ohio State University College of Medicine, official college transcripts. Those are the pertinent documentation. There is other documentation that was submitted I will read the Court, if the Court would like to hear it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>THE COURT: That is sufficient. Do you understand the question, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">THE COURT: Do you desire to talk to Mr. Johnson, your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">DEFENDANT: I am fine, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">PROSECUTOR: One other question, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">THE COURT: Wait just a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">DEFENDANT: I have one answer to that. You have brought in as your witness yourself, a registrar, I believe, from Ohio State University who has stated I am not a doctor and I am not certified as a physician. If I am not certified as a doctor, how would I have an official transcript?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">PROSECUTOR: Mr. Eddy, I simply asked you a question. You answered it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a1c-dedup-0\">As is evident from this dialogue, which occurred shortly before the testimony which was the basis of Count I of the perjury indictment, Eddy attempted to communicate that the documentation submitted to the Navy was falsified. Later it was admitted in the hearing that there was no evidence to rebut Eddy\u2019s claim that the documents were false. This admission resulted in the denial of the request to question Eddy, before the jury, concerning the questions which were the basis of Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">At the perjury trial, all witnesses agreed with Eddy\u2019s assertion that the documents he presented were not authentic. The Assistant United States Attorney in conceding this fact at a bench conference during the trial, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">I don\u2019t think there is any doubt that the testimony adduced at trial has shown in fact that was not an actual OSU diploma and those are not actual copies of OSU transcripts. I obviously concede that. But the questions were asked at trial, the questions were asked at trial based upon the best available information to the United States at the time. I don\u2019t think that the fact that the evidence has developed that those were not an actual diploma and not an actual transcript is enough to support a motion for a judgment of acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">Thus, it is undisputed that Eddy did not submit an \u201cofficial\u201d Ohio State University diploma and a genuine university transcript during his meetings with naval recruiters. Hence, Eddy\u2019s negative responses to the prosecutor\u2019s questions were the literal truth \u201cin light of the meaning that <em>he, </em>not his interrogator, attributed to the questions and answers,\u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>497 F.2d at 773 (emphasis in original), and therefore, could not support a perjury conviction. <em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 359, 93 S.Ct. at 600; <em>see also United States v. Wall, </em>371 F.2d at 400 (\u201c[T]he essence of the crime of perjury ... is the belief of the witness concerning the veracity of his testimony.\u201d) It is no answer to argue that Eddy\u2019s testimony was unresponsive or intentionally misleading. An \u201cintent to mislead\u201d or \u201cperjury by implication\u201d is insufficient to support a perjury conviction. <em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 359, 93 S.Ct. at 600; <em>United States v. Slawik, </em>548 F.2d 75, 83-84 (3d Cir.1977). \u201c[I]f the prosecutor never asks the critical question and never presses for an unequivocal answer the defendant may not be convicted of false swearing.\u201d <em>Slawik, supra, </em>548 F.2d at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">Nor can Eddy\u2019s conviction be upheld because, as the United States contends, Eddy understood, or should have understood, the import behind the prosecutor\u2019s questions. \u201cPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury.\u201d <em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 362, 93 S.Ct. at 602. If the Assistant United States Attorney sought to inquire about Eddy\u2019s submitting false documents, the burden was on the United States, and not the witness, to be concise and to the point. The perjury statute was not intended to extend situations where \u201ca wily witness succeeds in derailing the questioner \u2014 so long as the witness speaks the literal truth. The burden is on the questioner to pin the witness down to the specific object of the questioner\u2019s inquiry.\u201d <em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 360, 93 S.Ct. at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>We also reject the argument that, when a witness is confronted with ambiguous questions, it is for the jury to decide whether the witness has committed perjury. <em>Bronston </em>discredited this type of jury conjecture which is now contended should be permissible. <em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 359, 93 S.Ct. at 600. A contrary rule would allow a jury to infer from a witness\u2019 unresponsive answer to a vague question that the witness knew his testimony to be false. In expressly rejecting this, <em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 358, 93 S.Ct. at 600, the Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">Under the pressures and tensions of interrogation, it is not uncommon for the most earnest witnesses to give answers that are not entirely responsive. Sometimes the witness does not understand the question, or may in an excess of caution or apprehension read too much or too little into it____ It is the responsibility of the lawyer to probe; testimonial interrogation, and cross-examination in particular, is a probing, prying, pressing form of inquiry. If a witness evades, it is the lawyer\u2019s responsibility to recognize the evasion and to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"alz-dedup-0\"><em>See also United States v. Tonelli, </em>577 F.2d at 200; <em>United States v. Slawik, supra, </em>548 F.2d at 84 (petit jury should not be permitted \u201cto resolve not only ambiguity of the interrogator\u2019s question and the defendant\u2019s response, but also the ambiguity of the grand jury\u2019s understanding of both question and response.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Similarly, Eddy\u2019s conviction under Count II of the indictment must also be reversed and the indictment dismissed. The testimony charged to have been perjured, and used as the basis for Count II also occurred during the suppression hearing during Eddy\u2019s original trial. At one point Eddy was asked if he had applied for staff privileges at a hospital, would he remember doing so. Eddy responded in the affirmative. The following question was then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">PROSECUTOR: In that case, I would ask you the question again. Are you the same Terrance Alan Eddy who attempted to gain staff privileges at the Putnam County Community Hospital in Palatka, Florida, and in doing so showed credentials from the Ohio State University and a certificate from the Board of Medical Examiners from the State of Florida indicating that you were licensed to practice medicine in that state? And I think we can take that to mean you represented yourself as a physician. Did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">EDDY: Like I said, I don\u2019t remember going there. I don\u2019t remember doing this action. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The indictment charges that Eddy\u2019s response was false because he \u201cdid make [an] application for staff privileges at the Putnam Community Hospital, Palatka, Florida, and in so doing, represented himself to be a physician, showed credentials from the State of Florida indicating that he was licensed to practice medicine in that state.\u201d As with the situations in <em>Slawik, supra, </em>548 F.2d at 83, and <em>Tonelli, supra, </em>577 F.2d at 198, the second count in Eddy\u2019s indictment fails to specify the alleged falsehood in his testimony. The indictment does not precisely allege what was false about Eddy\u2019s response. It cannot be determined whether Eddy testified falsely because (1) he failed to remember going to Florida when in fact there was sufficient proof that he had remembered going there, or because (2) he denied ever going to Florida when in fact he knew he had been there. If the former, there is no factual basis in the indictment or the record itself to demonstrate the untruthfulness of Eddy\u2019s declaration. Because the indictment does not allege that Eddy\u2019s failure to remember was perjurious, it will not be so assumed. <em>United States v. Brumley, </em>560 F.2d 1268, 1277 (5th Cir.1977). Nor is the latter interpretation appropriate in' view of Eddy\u2019s equivocal response. Concededly, Eddy\u2019s answer was obscure, and may have misled the casual observer. Nevertheless, it was the Assistant United States Attorney\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to recognize [Eddy\u2019s] evasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>and bring him back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination.\u201d <em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 359, 93 S.Ct. at 600. This was not done. Here, the crucial question was hardly precise. In fact, it was a multiple question with at least four separate inquiries. Understandably, Eddy\u2019s answer reflected the same imprecision. \u201cA charge of perjury, however, is not a substitute for careful questioning on the part of a prosecutor.\u201d <em>United States v. Tonelli, supra, </em>577 F.2d at 198. In a perjury case, the defendant \u201cmay not be assumed into the penitentiary.\u201d <em>United States v. Brumley, supra, </em>560 F.2d at 1277. Any reading of the charges found in Count II of the indictment leads one to believe that it has failed to set forth with sufficient clarity the precise falsehood alleged, the factual basis of that falsehood and the objective truth in \u201cstark contrast so that the claim of falsity is clear to all who read the charge.\u201d <em>Tonelli, </em>577 F.2d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The response to this argument is that as to both Count I and II, the holdings in <em>Bronston </em>and <em>United States v. Wall, supra, </em>are not applicable because neither dealt \u201cwith the situation where a defendant has given a \u2018yes or no\u2019 answer, the truth of which can be ascertained only in the context of the question posed.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cuesta, </em>597 F.2d 903, 920 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 964, 100 S.Ct. 451, 62 L.Ed.2d 377 (1979); <em>United States v. Kehoe, </em>562 F.2d 65, 68-69 (1st Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Chapin, </em>515 F.2d 1274, 1280 (D.C.Cir.1975). We disagree. Although the facts in <em>Bronston </em>reveal that Bronston\u2019s conviction was based upon a response that was not a \u201cyes or no\u201d answer, the decision in no way indicates its reasoning is inapplicable to situations where a defendant\u2019s \u201cyes or no\u201d responses are literally true but unresponsive to the examiner\u2019s question. In <em>United States v. Abrams, </em>568 F.2d 411, 421-23 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 903, 98 S.Ct. 3089, 57 L.Ed.2d 1133 (1978), the court applied <em>Bronston </em>to reverse a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 where the defendant\u2019s \u201cyes or no\u201d answers were not \u201cliterally false.\u201d In <em>Abrams, </em>as in the situation here, the questioner failed to \u201cpin Abrams down\u201d with precise questions concerning the charges raised against him. <em>Abrams, supra, </em>568 F.2d at 423. Nothing in <em>Bronston </em>compels us to find that Eddy\u2019s literally true but unresponsive declarations are not covered by the rule set forth there. Criminal statutes generally are to be \u201cstrictly construed, and any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d <em>United States v. Emmons, </em>410 U.S. 396, 411, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 1015, 35 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973). <em>Cf. Williams v. United States, </em>458 U.S. 279, 102 S.Ct. 3088, 3092, 73 L.Ed.2d 767 (1982) (when interpreting a criminal statute, courts should be reluctant \u201cto base an expansive reading on inferences drawn from subjective and variable \u2018understandings\u2019 \u201d). Neither the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(a), nor the reasoning of <em>Bronston </em>support the government\u2019s contention that a defendant\u2019s \u201cyes or no\u201d answers, literally true but unresponsive, are sufficient to form the basis of a perjury conviction. The problem and annoyance of Eddy\u2019s unresponsive statements should have been \u201cremedied through the \u2018questioner\u2019s acuity\u2019 and not by a federal perjury prosecution.\u201d <em>Bronston, </em>409 U.S. at 362, 93 S.Ct. at 602; <em>see also United States v. Cook, </em>497 F.2d at 765 (\u201c[Imjproper to indict and prosecute an individual for perjury where the questions forming the basis of the charge are so vaguely and inarticulately phrased <em>by the interrogator </em>as to require the jury to probe the inner workings of the accused\u2019s mind to seek to ascertain which of several plausible meanings he attributed to the ambiguous inquiries when he gave the allegedly perjurious responses.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">A troubling aspect of this ease concerns what we believe to be a \u201crealistic likelihood of vindicativeness\u201d in the institution of the perjury charges against Eddy after he had been \u00e1cquitted of the initial criminal charges. <em>See United States v. Andrews, </em>633 F.2d 449, 453 (6th Cir.1980) (en banc). While we recognize that an acquittal of a defendant following a trial on criminal charges is not a <em>per se </em>bar to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>subsequent perjury prosecution, <em>United States v. Sarno, </em>596 F.2d 404, 407 (9th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Fayer, </em>573 F.2d 741, 745 (2d <em>Cir.), cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 831, 99 S.Ct. 108, 58 L.Ed.2d 125 (1978), we also recognize where the facts indicate no perjury indictment would have been brought had there been no acquittal of the defendant, a presumption of vindicativeness is raised. <em>See United States v. McFadyen-Snider, </em>590 F.2d 654, 655 (6th Cir. 1979) (perjury indictment would probably not have been brought had defendant not succeeded in her appeal from an initial conviction); <em>cf. United States v. Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 2489, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982) (presumption of vindictiveness applies only in cases in which a \u201creasonable likelihood of vindictiveness\u201d exists).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">This presumption is strengthened by a review of the record of Eddy\u2019s perjury prosecution. The declarations alleged to be perjurious in Count I of the indictment were in fact answers that were literally true. The declaration alleged to be perjurious in Count II was an obscure response to a multiple question which was inherently confusing and vague. In other words, the perjurious nature of Eddy\u2019s testimony was not manifest. This fact, combined with the knowledge that the initial criminal charges against Eddy resulted in the defendant\u2019s acquittal, leaves us convinced that there existed a \u201crealistic likelihood of vindictiveness\u201d in the institution of Eddy\u2019s perjury prosecution, and therefore, provides a second reason why his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the indictment against Eddy is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">. The reasoning of Judge Ely\u2019s dissenting opinion eventually became the controlling authority in the <em>Cook </em>decision. Shortly after the Ninth Circuit issued its initial slip opinion in <em>Cook, </em>in which Judge Ely dissented, the Supreme Court decided <em>Bronston. </em>The <em>Cook </em>case was then remanded to the district court for reconsideration in light of <em>Bronston. </em>The district court again affirmed Cook\u2019s conviction and a second appeal followed. On that appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed, noting that <em>Bronston </em>\"essentially, tracked the reasoning set forth by Judge Ely in this case.\u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>489 F.2d 286, 287 (9th Cir.1973). The Ninth Circuit then directed the publication of its initial opinions in <em>Cook </em>\"believing that they, when reviewed in connection with <em>Bronston, </em>may be of some worth to those concerned with the law of perjury in the federal courts.\" Those opinions appear at <em>United States v. Cook, </em>497 F.2d 753 (9th Cir.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
