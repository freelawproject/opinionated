BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b333-30\">The facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute. The IRS is conducting an investigation to determine the accuracy of Aristotle Stamatien\u2019s financial income tax returns for taxable years 1979, 1980 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>1981. In furtherance of that investigation, on February 17, 1983, Special Agent Mercugliano issued an administrative summons to appellee First Bank (\u201cBank\u201d), a Connecticut bank and trust company, pursuant to \u00a7 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(a) (1982). The summons ordered the Bank to produce \u201c[a]ll records pertinent to all financial transactions of ARISTOTLE STAMATIEN at your institution\u201d for the taxable years under investigation. The summons also stated that notice had been served on Stamatien, in accordance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(a). Although Stamatien elected not to exercise his right under \u00a7 7609(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Code to institute suit to challenge the summons, the Bank, by letter dated March 15, 1983, informed the IRS that it was unable to comply with the summons because the account held by Stamatien was held jointly with another individual, and no notice had been given to the co-owner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">On July 29, 1983, the Government filed a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 7402(b) and 7604 of the Code, seeking enforcement of the summons. In response to the district court\u2019s order to show cause why it should not be compelled to obey the summons, First Bank asserted that since there had been no notice to the co-owner of the subject account, it could not make the requested disclosure without violating Connecticut\u2019s Financial Privacy Act. Conn. Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 36 \u2014 9j <em>et seq. </em>(West 1981 &amp; Supp.1984). Under that statute, in the absence of (1) customer authorization, (2) service upon the customer of any disclosure request at least ten days prior to the date on which disclosure is to be made, or (3) a waiver of the prior notice requirement for good cause by a court of competent jurisdiction, a financial institution may not disclose its customers\u2019 financial records. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 36-9k &amp; 36-9/. The Government, in response to First Bank\u2019s assertion, argued that under the Supremacy Clause, art. VI, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution, the Federal Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3401 <em>et seq., </em>preempts the Connecticut statute. In addition, the Government argued that \u00a7 7609(a) of the Code does not require that notice be given to the joint owner of the records summoned since the joint owner was not identified in the. summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">In an opinion filed on September 27, 1983, the district court agreed with the Government that the provisions of the state statute were preempted by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(a). However, after reviewing \u00a7 7609 and its legislative history, Judge Burns concluded that Congress did not intend to limit the notice requirement of that section to the taxpayer who is the immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ate subject of the summons. Therefore, the district judge held that a co-owner who is not the target of an IRS investigation and who is not identified in the summons, must also receive notice of the summons, because that person\u2019s interest in the account is coextensive with the taxpayer\u2019s interest. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s petition to enforce the summons was denied without prejudice to reissuance with the requisite notice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The Government argues that the district court erred by interpreting \u00a7 7609(a) to require the IRS, when it serves an administrative summons on a third-party record-keeper, to notify the co-owner of the records summoned, when the co-owner is not under investigation and is not identified in the summons. First Bank, on the other hand, urges us to adhere to the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 7609(a) and, in addition, contends that Judge Burns erred in holding that the Connecticut Financial Privacy Act is preempted by the notice provisions of the Code. While we agree with Judge Burns that the state privacy statute is preempted by the provisions of the Code, we hold that a co-owner of a joint bank account who is not identified in the summons is not entitled to notice when an administrative summons is served on a third-party recordkeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 7602 of the Code, the IRS has broad powers to summon information which is relevant to determining whether a taxpayer has complied with the federal tax laws. The IRS may obtain records held by the taxpayer under investigation, or, it may summon, question, and require production from \u201cany person\u201d who holds records \u201crelating to the business of the person liable for [the] tax.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602. However, when the IRS seeks to examine a person\u2019s records which are in the possession of a third-party recordkeeper,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> such as First Bank, it must comply with the special procedures outlined in \u00a7 7609, including the notice provisions of \u00a7 7609(a). According to \u00a7 7609(a)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">(1) In general. \u2014 If\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">(A) any summons described in subsection (e)[e.g., a \u00a7 7602 summons] is served on any person who is a third-party recordkeeper, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">(B) the summons requires the production of any portion of records made or kept of the business transactions or affairs of any person (other than the person summoned) <em>who is identified in the description of the records contained in the summons then notice of the summons shall be given to any person so identified </em>within 3 days of the day on which such service is made, but no later than the 23rd day before the day fixed in the summons as the day upon which such records are to be examined. Such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the summons which has been served and shall contain an explanation of the right under subsection (b)(2) to bring a proceeding to quash the summons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(a)(1) (1982) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">The Government argues that the plain meaning of \u00a7 7609(a) requires that notice be given only to the person or persons \u201cidentified\u201d in the summons, and since Stamatien was the only person identified therein, it was not required to give notice to any co-owner of Stamatien\u2019s account as a pre-condition to obtaining the records summoned. We agree. Paying \u201cstrict adherence\u201d to Congress\u2019 chosen words, <em>see Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, </em>447 U.S. 807, 826, 100 S.Ct. 2486, 2497, 65 L.Ed.2d 532 (1980), there is nothing in the statute\u2019s language that supports a contrary reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">While the district court herein recognized that a literal interpretation of \u00a7 7609(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>requires that notice be given only to persons identified in the summons, it interpreted the legislative history as compelling a different reading. Upon careful consideration of the variegated legislative history of \u00a7 7609(a), we are convinced that Congress intended the literal dictates of the statute to be controlling. Indeed, our reading of the legislative history indicates that Congress did not explicitly address the issue of notice to a joint bank account owner, and that the legislative history provides little guidance on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">Prior to 1976, the IRS had the authority to issue a summons to any person having custody of records relating to the business <em>o\u00ed </em>a person liable for taxes without notifying the taxpayer or any other person to whose business transactions the summoned records related. S.Rep. No. 938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 367-68, <em>reprinted0 in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3439, 3796-97; H.R.Rep. No. 658, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 306-07, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2897, 3202-03. The person whose tax habihty was under mves\u00fcgation, but who was not the reeordkeeper, had no opportunity to prevent compliance with the summons by asserting possible deficiencies in its issuance. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 938 at 367-68; H.R.Rep. No. 658 at 306-07. Because Congress believed that the procedures which existed at that time did not protect adequately the civil rights of taxpayers, including their right to privacy, <em>see </em>S.Rep. No. 938 at 368; H.R.Rep. No. 658 at 307, it enacted \u00a7 7609 as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-455, 90 Stat. 1520 (1976). The legisl\u00e1tive history accompanying that section demonstrates that Congress was aware that while the third-party reeordkeeper could challenge the summons, its interest \u201cin protecting the privacy of the records in question is frequently far less intense than that of the person to whom the records pertain.\u201d S.Rep. No. 938 at 369; H.R.Rep. No. 658 at 307. U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 3203, 3798. Therefore, Congress, through \u00a7 7609, sought \u201cto provide limited protection against unreasonable infringements upon the civil rights of taxpayers.\u201d <em>United States v. New York Telephone Co., </em>682 F.2d 313, 315 (2d Cir.1982). Congress apparently believed that the increased involvement of the taxpayer, who had a direct interest in the records sought, would aid in curbing some of the pre-1976 abuses in third-party summons procedure. S.Rep. No. 938 at 368-69; H.R.Rep. No. 658 at 307-08. As we have noted previously, \u201c[t]he new procedure was not designed to give the taxpayer new substantive rights, on|y provide an early opportunity for him, as the person with the greatest interest in protecting the existing substantive rights, to secure recognition of those rights.\u201d <em>United States v. New York Telephone Co., </em>644 F.2d 953, 956-57 (2d Cir. 1981) (footnote and citations omitted). A literal construction of \u00a7 7609(a), by requir-\u00a1ng the IRS to notify the person identified jn the summons as the person whose transactions are to be inspected, and thus pro-yjdjng that person with a right to intervene and challenge the summons, is not at odds with the legislative intent underlying the enactment of the section,</p>\n<p id=\"A2v\">We do not interpret the references in the legislative history to \u201cthe taxpayer <em>and other noticees,\" </em>le.g., S.Rep. No. 938 at 369-70 (emphasis added); H.R.Rep. No. 658 at 308-09, to indicate that all co-owners of the records summoned must be notified, In our view, that language merely indicates that the person identified in the summons may be a person <em>other than </em>the taxpayer under investigation. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 938 at 370 n. 4 (\u201c[T]he protection of these rules extends even if the <em>person identified </em>in the summons <em>(i.e., the noticee) </em>is not a taxpayer whose tax liability is under current investigation.\u201d) (emphasis added); H.R.Rep. No. 658 at 308 n. 3, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 3205 (same), For example, both the House and Senate Reports accompanying \u00a7 7609 discuss \u201ccases where the noticee within the meaning of these rules is also the taxpayer whose tax liability is under investigation in connection with the summons\u00a1\u201d S.Rep. No. 938 at 371; H.R.Rep. No. 658 at 309, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 3205-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>06, 3800. These discussions clearly indicate that the \u201cnoticee\u201d may well not be the \u201ctaxpayer\u201d and, hence, the references to \u201cthe taxpayer and other noticees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Further, our conclusion that \u00a7 7609(a) does not require the IRS to give notice to a co-owner of a joint bank account who is not identified in the summons is not altered by the somewhat conflicting comments gleaned from the legislative history. The Senate Committee on Finance and the House Ways and Means Committee, while discussing the proposed \u00a7 7609, stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201c[T]he Service is to be required to send notice of the summons ... to the person (or persons) who is identified in the description of the books and records contained in the summons ____ Where more than one person is identified in the description of the records as a person the records of whose transactions are to be inspected, then all such persons are to have the right to receive notice under these provisions____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">S.Rep. No. 938 at 369; H.R.Rep. No. 658 at 307-08, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 3204, 3798-99. The implication of this statement is that only where persons are identified in the summons, are those persons entitled to receive notice. However, the Committee reports also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aev-dedup-0\">[Mjany of the problems in this area would be cured if the parties to whom the records pertain were advised of the service of a third-party summons, and were afforded a reasonable and speedy means to challenge the summons where appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">S.Rep. No. 938 at 368; H.R.Rep. No. 658 at 307, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 3203, 3798.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, while the legislative history of \u00a7 7609 is not conclusive on the question of notice to an unidentified co-owner of a joint account, the language employed by Congress in drafting \u00a7 7609 clearly does provide that \u201cnotice ... shall be given to any person ... <em>identified.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Accordingly, \u201c[o]ur analysis is constrained by a fundamental rule of statutory construction: when the express language of a statute is clear,' a court will not adopt a different construction absent clear legislative history contradicting the plain meaning of the words.\u201d <em>United States v. Holroyd, </em>732 F.2d 1122 at 1125 (2d Cir.1984). Because the relevant legislative history does not contradict a literal construction of \u00a7 7609(a), we hold that the district court erred by \u201cdeviating from the words chosen by Congress, which set out the scope of the provision with patent clarity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">Furthermore, our construction of \u00a7 7609(a) is consistent with the well-established rule enunciated by the United States Supreme Court that the summons power of the IRS should be construed broadly and that a deferential standard must be applied when construing congressional intent regarding the scope of the IRS\u2019s summons power. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 104 S.Ct. 1495, 1501, 79 L.Ed.2d 826 (1984) (the summons power must be construed broadly since it is \u201ccritical to the investigative and enforcement functions of the IRS\u201d); <em>United States v. Euge, </em>444 U.S. 707, 711, 100 S.Ct. 874, 878, 63 L.Ed.2d 141 (1980) (\u201cabsent express statutory prohibition or substantial countervailing policies,\u201d the summons power of the IRS should be construed broadly); <em>United States v. Bisceglia, </em>420 U.S. 141, 150, 95 S.Ct. 915, 921, 43 L.Ed.2d 88 (1975) (\u201c[sjettled principles of statutory interpretation\u201d require a broad construction of the IRS\u2019s summons authority \u201cabsent unambiguous directions from Congress\u201d). Applying this deferential standard of review, we find that there is clearly no express statutory prohibition against the enforcement of the summons at issue herein. In addition, we find that the primary purpose behind \u00a7 7609 \u2014 \u201cto require that the target taxpayer be given notice, so that he would be able to assert appropriate defenses,\u201d <em>United States v. Pittsburgh Trade Exchange, Inc., </em>644 F.2d 302, 305 (3d Cir.1981); <em>accord United States v. New York Telephone Co., </em>644 F.2d 953, 956-57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>(2d Cir.1981) \u2014 is consistent with our interpretation of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"afo-dedup-0\">We do not mean to imply that this broad summons power is without bounds. As we noted in <em>United States v. Tiffany Fine Arts, Inc., </em>718 F.2d 7, 12-13 (2d Cir.1983), in enacting \u00a7 7609 Congress balanced the IRS\u2019s interest in the effective enforcement of the tax laws against the privacy interests of unnamed taxpayers to be free from governmental interference in their financial records. We hold only that because there is no clear congressional indication in the circumstances before us that the balance be tipped in favor of the privacy interest, we are bound to follow the literal mandate of \u00a7 7609(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We recognize that our literal interpretation of \u00a7 7609(a)\u2019s notice provision may lead to situations where in response to an IRS administrative summons a third-party recordkeeper may well find itself disclosing records in which there is a joint owner and, unless the joint owner is identified in the summons, he will not be notified of the issuance of the summons. In our view, however, this possibility was not thought by Congress to create a sufficient infringement to warrant the inclusion of additional statutory notice requirements for unidentified persons. We believe this view to be reasonable. We agree with the Eleventh Circuit, which recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">When a taxpayer\u2019s records are in the hands of a third-party recordkeeper, there are numerous situations in which the taxpayer\u2019s records may be disclosed to other parties during the ordinary course of the recordkeeper\u2019s business. For example, taxpayers are not protected from disclosure of their records to the third-party recordkeeper\u2019s certified public accountants during an annual audit of the recordkeeper. Similarly, taxpayers whose records are in the possession of a bank/third-party recordkeeper risk disclosure of their records to federal regulatory agencies conducting routine inspections of the bank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>United States v. Gottlieb, </em>712 F.2d 1363, 1369 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">As a final matter, we agree with the district court that the notice provisions of Connecticut\u2019s Privacy Act are preempted by \u00a7 7609(a) of the Code. The state privacy act requires that at least 10 days\u2019 notice be given to a co-owner of a joint savings account before the records of that account are turned over to the IRS, regardless of whether the co-owner is identified in the summons. That requirement is in \u201cconflict\u201d with our interpretation of \u00a7 7609(a) and, therefore, under the Supremacy Clause, must give way to the federal scheme. <em>See Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>435 U.S. 151, 158, 98 S.Ct. 988, 994, 55 L.Ed.2d 179 (1978) (\u201cEven if Congress has not completely foreclosed state legislation in a particular area, a state statute is void to the extent that it actually conflicts with a valid federal statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s ruling, and we grant enforcement of the IRS summons issued to appellee First Bank on February 17, 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-5\">. Section 7609(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Right to intervene; right to proceeding to quash\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">(1) Intervention. \u2014 Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, any person who is entitled to notice of a summons under subsection (a) shall have the right to intervene in any proceeding with respect to the enforcement of such summons under section 7604.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">(2) Proceeding to quash.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">(A) In general. \u2014 Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, any person who is entitled to notice of a summons under subsection (a) shall have the right to begin a proceeding to quash such summons not later than the 20th day after the day such notice is given in the manner provided in subsection (a)(2). In any such proceeding, the Secretary may seek to compel compliance with the summons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">(B) Requirement of notice to person summoned and to Secretary. \u2014 If any person begins a proceeding under subparagraph (A) with respect to any summons, not later than the close of the 20-day period referred to in subparagraph (A) such person shall mail by registered or certified mail a copy of the petition to the person summoned and to such office as the Secretary may direct in the notice referred to in subsection (a)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">(C) Intervention; etc. \u2014 Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, the person summoned shall have the right to intervene in any proceeding under subparagraph (A). Such person shall be bound by the decision in such proceeding (whether or not the person intervenes in such proceeding).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-16\">. The Government does not dispute the fact that the bank account for which the disclosure is sought is a joint account. Under Connecticut law, co-holders of a joint account are each considered owners of the entire account, with access to the entire amount therein. <em>See </em>Conn. Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 36-3(1) (West 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b335-8\">.
