In doing so, appellant defied proper notices, confirmed agreements and court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-25\">While we agree that the sanction of dismissal is a most extreme remedy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>one not to be imposed if lesser sanctions will-do, <em>see Marshall v. Segona, </em>621 F.2d 763, 766-67 (5th Cir.1980), the district court retains the discretion to dismiss a complaint where the party\u2019s conduct amounts to \u201cflagrant disregard and willful disobedience\u201d of the court\u2019s discovery orders. <em>See Phillips Insurance Company of North America, </em>633 F.2d 1165, 1167 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-5\">Although appellant argues that the district court should have conducted a hearing prior to dismissing the complaint, we note that the district court conducted an earlier hearing. At that time, appellant represented to the court that he would appear for a scheduled deposition. He did not appear, nor did he adequately explain his reasons for absenting himself from later scheduled depositions. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint without conducting a hearing and AFFIRM on the basis of the district court order, see 572 F.Supp. 331.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1602-12\">. The district court entered judgment against appellant on the dismissal order. In <em>Czeremcha v. International Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, </em>724 F.2d 1552, 1554-55 (11th Cir.1984), this court held that the dismissal of a complaint \"does not automatically terminate the action unless the court holds either that no amendment is possible or that the dismissal of the complaint also constitutes a dismissal of the action.\u201d (footnote omitted). We do not read <em>Czermecha </em>to control a case in which the district court has entered judgment on the dismissal order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
