Following a jury trial, the trial court rendered judgment for actual and exemplary damages against defendants, but denied any recovery for usury. Defendants appeal, and the Trustee cross-appeals the denial of its usury claim. We affirm the denial of the usury claim and reverse in part and affirm in part as to the remainder of the case, remanding for the entry of judgment consistent with our holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-18\">CONTEXT FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-19\">General Nature of Suit</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-20\">This complex case primarily concerns the financing of the dairy cattle operations of the now bankrupt corporation, Dairyland, Inc. (\u201cDairyland\u201d) and of its acquisition of the Bosque County ranch on which such operations were conducted. Defendant Equico Lessors, Inc. (\u201cEquico\u201d) provided part of the financing both for Dairyland\u2019s operations and for its acquisition of the ranch from plaintiff Brazos Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cBrazos\u201d), a corporation wholly owned and controlled by G.J. Roberts (\u201cRoberts\u201d). Defendants Wade Newton (\u201cNewton\u201d) and Bill Mesker (\u201cMesker\u201d) were principals in Dairyland, and were also owners of a separate business, a partnership known as Dairy Cows. Equico likewise provided financing to Dairy Cows, and Dairy Cows was also partially financed by Misco Leasing (\u201cMisco\u201d), an unrelated concern. The affairs and debts of Dairyland and Dairy Cows became intertwined. Involuntary bankruptcy proceedings were instituted against Dairyland on December 23, 1975, and it filed voluntary proceedings in February 1976. This suit by Dairyland\u2019s Trustee in Bankruptcy (\u201cthe Trustee\u201d) and Brazos generally claimed that Newton and Mesker transferred Dairyland cows mortgaged to Equico without applying the proceeds to the mortgage debt, and that Equi-co conspired with them and applied Dairy-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>land assets to discharge unsecured Dairy-Cows indebtedness to Equico, to the prejudice of both of Dairyland\u2019s general creditors and of Brazos in its capacity as a holder of a lien on the ranch inferior to that of Equico. The Trustee also asserted a usury claim against Equico respecting its loan to Dairyland.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">In 1972 Roberts, Newton, and Mesker formed Dairyland. Roberts then owned and controlled Brazos. At the same time, Newton and Mesker were partners in Dairy Cows, a business that involved buying cows and then \u201cleasing\u201d them to dairy farmers who would make assignments of milk to Dairy Cows and make payments on the leases. The \u201cleases\u201d or \u201ccow contracts\u201d were in effect sales with a retention of a security interest or mortgage. Dairy Cows financed its operations by assigning these \u201clease\u201d contracts to lenders at a discount. Although the partnership borrowed money from Misco (and from Seneca State Bank and First National Bank of Waco), the principal lender with which Dairy Cows did business was Equico. The basic arrangement entered into by Roberts, Newton, and Mesker in the formation of Dairyland was that Roberts, through Brazos, would furnish the land and equipment for the Dairy-land operations, and Newton and Mesker would furnish their know-how in the dairy business and their ability to obtain financing. Roberts received fifty percent of the original Dairyland stock, and Newton and Mesker each received twenty-five percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-7\">As part of the agreement between Roberts, Newton, and Mesker, Brazos sold a some 816 acre ranch it owned in Bosque County to the recently incorporated Dairy-land for approximately $1,000,000. The purchase price was payable $200,000 in cash, with a note for $772,050. At the time of this sale John Hancock Life Insurance Company (\u201cHancock\u201d) had a lien on the ranch, and Brazos was indebted to Hancock for approximately $280,000. Dairyland financed the down payment for the ranch with a $200,000 loan from Equico. Dairy-land was to have 49 acres free and clear of the Hancock lien. In order to secure the $200,000 loan, Dairyland gave Equico a first lien on the 49-acre tract and a lien second to that of Hancock on the remaining 767 acres. Brazos subordinated its vendor\u2019s lien on the entire ranch to the lien in favor of Equico. Brazos also agreed to continue making payments on the Hancock note. Dairyland would pay interest only on its $772,050 note to Brazos for the first eleven years, but in the twelfth year the Hancock note would be paid off and the balance on Dairyland\u2019s note to Brazos would become due. The status, then, of the ranch as of May 10, 1972 was that on the 49 acres Equico had a first lien securing its $200,000 purchase price advance and Brazos had a second lien securing its $772,-050 note; and on the remaining 767 acres Hancock had a $280,000 first lien, Equico had a second lien, and Brazos had a third lien and the obligation to pay off the Hancock note as it matured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-9\">In order for Dairyland to obtain a dairy herd, the parties structured a transaction in which Dairyland bought 626 Holstein heifers with money borrowed from the First National Bank in Waco, Texas. Dairyland then sold these cows to Dairy Cows, repaying the First National Bank in Waco with the proceeds of this sale, and Dairy Cows in turn \u201cleased\u201d the cows back to Dairyland, and subsequently assigned these leases to Equico, which provided $313,000 to finance the acquisition of these cows. The cow leases assigned to Equico were secured by the deed of trust on the ranch which primarily secured the $200,000 land acquisition debt from Dairyland to Equico, by virtue of the general \u201cother indebtedness\u201d provisions of that deed of trust. Brazos also subordinated its liens on the ranch to the cow debt of Dairyland to Equico. Furthermore, Roberts, Newton, and Mesker individually guaranteed Dairy-land\u2019s debts to Equico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-10\">In addition to its own herd, Dairyland took in \u201ccustom\u201d grazing, allowing cattle owned by third parties to graze on the ranch, for which the owners paid Dairyland a rental fee. Beginning in February 1973, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>Dairyland also received, for grazing on the ranch, cattle owned by Dairy Cows. These cattle had been repossessed by Dairy Cows from its defaulting lessees. A number of the leases had been collaterally assigned by Dairy Cows to Misco as security for Dairy Cows\u2019 indebtedness to Misco. Dairyland paid the lease payments on these repossessed cattle and in turn kept any milk they produced in addition to a $10 per month rental fee per nonmilk-producing cow that was to be paid by Dairy Cows. There was also evidence that, as between Dairyland and Dairy Cows, Dairyland had the option to assume the lease payments and become the owner of the cows subject to the leases, or to turn the cows back to Dairy Cows without further obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">Although Roberts was initially president of Dairyland, as a result of disagreements with Newton and Mesker he eventually resigned as president in July 1973. The Dairyland herd had declined to some 286 by December 3, 1974, and at that time there were also approximately 760 Dairy Cows cows on the ranch, some mortgaged to Equico, some to Misco, and some to others. On December 4, 1974, 356 of the Dairy Cows cows were rebranded by Newton and Mesker as Dairyland cows, bringing the Dairyland total to 632. On January 30 or 31, 1975, Newton and Mesker caused Dairyland to buy out all of Roberts\u2019 stock, so Newton and Mesker became the sole Dairyland shareholders, and at the same time they adopted a resolution dispensing with directors\u2019 meetings and providing that either alone could act for Dairyland.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">This suit was filed in March 1976 by Dairyland\u2019s Trustee in Bankruptcy against Newton, Mesker, Equico, and Misco. The Trustee later asserted claims against Roberts and Brazos, as also did Newton and Mesker. Roberts and Brazos also asserted claims against Newton, Mesker, and Equi-co. In 1978 the Trustee dropped all claims against Misco, and it passed out of the suit. Just prior to trial, the Trustee, Roberts, and Brazos settled all claims between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-10\">Jury Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-11\">The jury found in relevant substance (interrogatory numbers indicated in parentheses) as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-12\">(1 &amp; 2) on December 4, 1974 Dairyland was insolvent and Equico then knew, or should have known, that it was;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-13\">(3) Newton and Mesker (but not Roberts), in their capacity as officers of Dairyland and with \u201cactual intent to hinder, delay or defraud existing or future creditors\u201d of Dairyland, caused Dairy-land to cease doing business as an ongoing concern \u201con January 31, 1975,\u201d and Equico, with like \u201cactual intent,\u201d conspired with them to do so;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-14\">(4 &amp; 5) \u201con and after January 31, 1975\u201d Newton and Mesker, with \u201cactual intent to hinder, delay or defraud existing or future creditors\u201d of Dairyland, caused Dairyland to transfer cows it. owned (of unspecified number and value) to Dairy Cows \u201cwithout fair consideration\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-15\">(6) Equico \u201cfirst\u201d knew on December 4, 1974 that Dairyland \u201chad transferred any\u201d of its 626 cows to Dairy Cows;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-16\">(7) Equico \u201cfailed to act\u201d respecting the 626 Dairyland cows \u201cmortgaged\u201d to it \u201cwith the ordinary degree of care that would be expected from a creditor in [its] ... position under the same or similar circumstances\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-18\">(8 &amp; 9) \u201cNewton and Mesker caused Dairyland to transfer\u201d an unspecified number of cattle \u201cowned by Dairyland and mortgaged to Equico without applying the proceeds [of the transfer] to reduce the mortgage\u201d debt, and Equico conspired with them to do so, each party in so conspiring having acted \u201cwantonly, maliciously or oppressively,\u201d and the fair market value \u201cof the cattle so transferred\u201d being $280,108;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-19\">(12 &amp; 13) \u201cNewton and Mesker transferred\u201d 206 Dairy Cows cattle covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>leases to Misco which Dairyland had assumed, \u201cwithout applying the proceeds [of the transfer] to reduce the [lease] debt owed to Misco,\u201d and Equico conspired with them to do so, each party so conspiring having acted \u201cwantonly, maliciously or oppressively,\u201d the difference between the fair market value of such 206 cattle ($103,000) and \u201cthe balance remaining due to Misco on the cattle so transferred\u201d ($64,692) being $38,308;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-5\">(14 &amp; 15) out of the money that \u201cwas received by Equico from the sale or other disposition of Dairyland cattle,\u201d the amount which was so received by Equico but was \u201cnot applied to reduce the debt of Dairyland to Equico on those cows\u201d was $150,193;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-6\">(18) Roberts did not consent to any of the transfers made by Dairyland \u201con or after January 31, 1975 without applying the proceeds to Dairyland\u2019s secured debt\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-7\">(11) Newton and Mesker, acting wantonly, maliciously or oppressively, and without the consent of Brazos, transferred Dairyland equipment having a fair market value of $50,000, on which Brazos had a lien, without applying the proceeds to the thus secured debt of Dairy-land to Brazos;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-8\">(19) between May 20, 1972, when Dairyland was formed, and December 23, 1975, when it went into bankruptcy, Newton and Mesker \u201cadvanced to Dairy-land\u201d $280,738;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-9\">(16) Newton and Mesker should pay in punitive damages $150,000 to Brazos and $300,000 to the Trustee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-10\">(17) Equico should pay in punitive damages $150,000 to Brazos and $300,-000 to the Trustee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1413-13\">Trial Court Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-14\">The trial court\u2019s judgment awarded damages as follows. First, the Trustee was given judgment against Equico, Newton, and Mesker, jointly and severally, in the amount of $372,087.74, consisting of $300,-000 exemplary damages (jury findings 16 &amp; 17) and $72,087.74 actual damages. The trial court calculated the $72,087.74 actual damages as follows. The $280,108 value of the Dairyland cows which were transferred, pursuant to the Equico-Newton-Mesker conspiracy, without applying the transfer proceeds to the secured debt on such cows owed by Dairyland to Equico (jury findings 8 &amp; 9), plus the $38,308 \u201clost\u201d Dairyland \u201cequity\u201d in the 206 cows leased to Misco which were transferred, pursuant to the Equico-Newton-Mesker conspiracy, without applying the transfer proceeds to the lease debt to Misco (jury findings 12 &amp; 13), gave the trial court a total of $318,416 \u201cgross\u201d actual damages. From this $318,-416 figure the trial court subtracted the sum of $273,361.16 which it found to be the amount which Dairyland owed to Equico, secured by Equico\u2019s liens, as of May 1975, leaving a \u201cnet\u201d of $45,054.84 as of May 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This $45,054.84 net, plus prejudgment interest thereon from May 1975 to December 1981 in the amount of $27,-032.90, produced the total actual damage award of $72,087.74. No party objected to this setoff procedure or concept (though Equico does complain of the amounts and the May 1975 date).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-15\">Nextj the trial court awarded the Trustee an additional $18,425 actual damages against Equico, representing sums<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court found the Trustee had mistakenly paid Equico since bankruptcy in respect to the Dairyland debt to Equico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-16\">Judgment was awarded Brazos against Equico, Newton, and Mesker, jointly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>severally, for $150,000 exemplary damages (jury findings 16 &amp; 17). Brazos was also awarded $80,000 in actual damages against Newton and Mesker, jointly and severally, consisting of the $50,000 worth of Dairy-land equipment which those two transferred, without applying the proceeds to reduce the Dairyland debt to Brazos secured by this equipment (jury finding 11), plus $30,000 prejudgment interest thereon from January 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">Prior to trial, the entire ranch had been sold by the Trustee to a third party in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings with the approval of the bankruptcy court and Brazos. From the sales proceeds the Hancock first lien had been completely paid off, and the remaining net proceeds, apparently something slightly in excess of $300,000,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were being held in the bankruptcy court pending the outcome of the trial below. In its judgment here, the trial court wholly cancelled all liens held or claimed by Equico on the ranch \u201cor the sales proceeds thereof,\u201d and further decreed that the lien reserved by Brazos in its deed of the ranch to Dairyland and the lien of the deed of trust on the ranch from Dairyland to Brazos \u201care hereby declared to be valid and effective against all parties hereto, save and except the purchaser from the Trustee in Bankruptcy and those holding under such purchaser.\u201d No party has objected to this procedure as such; that is, there has been no question as to the propriety of applying whatever recovery the Trustee may have been entitled to on its substantive claims against Equico to the reduction (and extinguishment) of Dairyland\u2019s debt to Equico secured by Equico\u2019s lien on the ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">By consent of the parties, the trial court determined the usury issue. It denied- the Trustee any recovery against Equico on this basis, ruling that the Dairyland note and deed of trust to Equico were not usurious, and that Equico did not charge Dairy-land usurious interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-8\">Equico, Newton, and Mesker appeal,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the Trustee cross-appeals the denial of its usury claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-10\">EVIDENTIAL BASIS OF FINDINGS ON WHICH TRUSTEE\u2019S RECOVERY PREDICATED</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-11\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-12\">In evaluating the defendants\u2019 claim that the jury findings were not supported by sufficient evidence, we do not reweigh evidence or set aside the jury findings complained of merely because we might draw different inferences or conclusions from the evidence. Rather, we sit to determine whether there was any substantial evidence in the record that fairly tends to support the verdict. <em>Gross v. Black &amp; Decker (U.S.), Inc., </em>695 F.2d 858 (5th Cir.1983). Furthermore, we must consider all reasonable inferences from the evidence which support the challenged findings. <em>Pope v. Rollins Protective Services Co., </em>703 F.2d 197 (5th Cir.1983). We also bear in mind that a conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>See Lenard v. Argento, </em>699 F.2d 874, 883 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 69, 78 L.Ed.2d 84 (1983) (quoting <em>Hoffman-La-Roche, Inc. v. Greenberg, </em>447 F.2d 872, 875 (7th Cir.1971)); <em>Fisher v. Shamburg, </em>624 F.2d 156, 162 (10th Cir.1980); <em>Industrial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number><em>Building Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., </em>437 F.2d 1336, 1343 (9th Cir.1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-5\">\u201cSince conspiracies, whether among businessmen or others, are rarely evidenced by explicit agreements, the determination of whether a conspiracy existed almost inevitably rests on the inferences that may fairly be drawn from the behavior of the alleged conspirators. At a minimum, their actions, to support a finding of a conspiracy, must suggest a commitment to a common end. \u2018[T]he circumstances [must be] such as to warrant a jury in finding that the conspirators had a unity of purpose or a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement.\u2019 <em>American Tobacco Co. v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 781, 810, 66 S.Ct. 1125, 1139, 90 L.Ed. 1575, 1594 (1946).\u201d <em>Michelman v. Clark-Schwebel Fiber Glass Corp., </em>534 F.2d 1036, 1043 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 885, 97 S.Ct. 236, 50 L.Ed.2d 166 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">Nevertheless, \u201c[a] mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury,\u201d and \u201c[t]here must be a conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question.\u201d <em>Boeing Company v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 375 (5th Cir.1969). Moreover, \u201c[a] jury may not rest its verdict on speculation and conjecture,\u201d <em>Gulf Coast Real Estate Auction Co. v. Chevron Industries, Inc., </em>665 F.2d 574, 577 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Fenner v. General Motors Corp., </em>657 F.2d 647, 651 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982), and the jury\u2019s freedom to draw inferences from the evidence does not extend so far as to allow a wholly \u201cunreasonable inference\u201d or one which amounts to \u201cmere speculation and eonjec-ture.\u201d <em>Bridges v. Groendyke Transport, Inc., </em>553 F.2d 877, 878-79 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-11\">Basic Liability Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-12\">The judgment for actual damages in favor of the Trustee rests essentially on two sets of jury findings: <em>first, </em>that Equico, Newton, and Mesker conspired to cause Dairyland to transfer cattle worth $280,108 owned by it and mortgaged to Equico without applying the proceeds to the mortgage (findings 8 &amp; 9); and, <em>second, </em>that they conspired to cause Dairyland to transfer 206 cows mortgaged to Misco, and worth $38,308 more than the Misco mortgage debt that Dairyland had assumed, without applying the proceeds to reduction of the Misco debt (findings 12 &amp; 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-13\">The total of the two sums ($280,108 and $38,308) produced the amount of actual damages awarded the Trustee, namely, $318,416.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In each of the two referenced conspiracies all defendants were found to have acted \u201cwantonly, maliciously or oppressively,\u201d but there was no finding of any intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors or others in either connection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The findings concerning the transfer of the cattle worth $280,108 mortgaged to Equico and of those mortgaged to Misco in which Dairyland\u2019s \u201cequity\u201d was $38,308, do not speak to the identity of the transferee, the adequacy of the consideration, or who ultimately received it, except that it was not applied to the respective mortgage debts. However, the jury also found that out of the monies Equico received from disposition of Dairyland cattle the amount thereof which was not applied to reduce the Dairy-land debt to Equico was $150,193 (findings 14 &amp; 15).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>Equico Mortgaged Cattle Conspiracy ($280,108)</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">As noted, the principal component of the Trustee\u2019s actual damage recovery was based on the findings that Newton and Mesker, pursuant to a conspiracy with Equico, transferred Dairyland cattle mortgaged to Equico, and worth $280,108, without applying the proceeds to the Equico mortgage.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">The factual theory on which the Trustee tried the case and argued it to the jury, and the statement of the Trustee\u2019s position in this respect as set out in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, were that these cattle were comprised of three distinct groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">(1) The first group consists of 188 cows transferred from Dairyland to Dairy Cows and then promptly sold by Dairy Cows (under security interest \u201cleases\u201d which were in effect mortgages) in negotiated transactions to various individual third-party purchasers. The transfers from Dairyland to Dairy Cows were in consideration of reduction of preexisting Dairyland debt to Dairy Cows. When Dairy Cows sold the cows to the third parties, the latter executed \u201cleases\u201d in favor of Dairy Cows which were immediately assigned by Dairy Cows to Equico. Equico thereupon' gave Dairy Cows credit for the purchase price of the \u201clease,\u201d the credit going to reduce Dairy Cows\u2019 outstanding debt to Equico. The third-party purchasers thereafter made their \u201clease\u201d payments to Equico. These transactions took place in February, March, and April 1975. The total amount credited by Equico to Dairy Cows in connection with Equieo\u2019s \u201cpurchase\u201d of these \u201cleases\u201d was $150,193. None of the amounts received in these transactions was credited to Dairyland or applied on its debt to Equico. It is to be noted that the $150,193 figure in relation to these 188 cattle corresponds exactly with the jury findings (numbers 14 &amp; 15) that of the monies Equico received from the disposition of Dairyland cattle, $150,193 thereof was the amount which Equico did not apply to Dairyland\u2019s debt to it. We hold there is ample evidence to support this figure. Equico\u2019s principal claim, however, is that there is no evidence it knew the cows were Dairyland cows. We reject this contention. There is ample evidence that Equico then knew Dairyland was insolvent and that Dairy Cows was in serious financial difficulty. In connection with the third-party lease transactions on these 188 cows, Dairy Cows furnished Equico documentation indicating that the cows had Dairyland brands and had just been transferred by Dairyland to Dairy Cows for preexisting indebtedness. Additionally, there was evidence that in late April 1975 Equico had agreed that the proceeds of the lease assignments covering some 100 of these cattle would be credited to Dairyland\u2019s debt, but instead subsequently applied those sums to the Dairy Cows debt. The jury was not required to credit the explanations made by Equico. Since the indebtedness of Dairy Cows to Equico was inadequately secured, while that of Dairyland was secured by a lien on the ranch, it was to Equico\u2019s advantage to in effect use Dairyland cows to reduce Dairy Cows\u2019 debt to Equico rather than Dairyland\u2019s. As to these 188 cows and the related $150,193 we hold that the jury finding of conspiracy is adequately supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">(2) The second component of the $280,-108 worth of cattle consists of approximately 275 Dairyland cows mortgaged to Equico which were sold by Dairyland at auction at various times commencing December 7, 1974 and extending into April or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>May 1975, for a total <em>of </em>$64,465 cash. The evidence shows that these sums were received by Dairyland and used by it in its operations. There is no evidence or claim that any of the funds went to Equico (and indeed jury findings 14 &amp; 15 are in effect to the contrary) or Dairy Cows, or that the consideration was inadequate (and indeed jury findings 8 &amp; 9, stating the fair market value of all the transferred cattle, are implicitly to the contrary). There was evidence from which the jury could infer that Equico knew of at least some of these sales and did not object to them. While it is questionable that the jury could legitimately find that Equico actually conspired to effect these sales, we do not reach that question because, for the reasons stated below, we hold that in any event the Trustee\u2019s recovery in respect to these transactions may not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">(3) The third and final group of cattle making up the $280,108 is comprised of some 114 Dairyland cows mortgaged to Equico which Dairyland transferred to Dairy Cows in consideration of preexisting indebtedness and were then promptly sold by Dairy Cows to various individual third parties in transactions of the same type as those involving the 188 cattle described in (1) above. However, in the transactions involving these 114 cows, Dairy Cows assigned the \u201cleases\u201d given by the third-party purchasers not to Equico but rather to Misco. Misco paid Dairy Cows a total of $65,450 for these cow leases (and we reject appellants\u2019 assertion that there is insufficient evidence to support this amount). One of these transactions occurred on January 31, 1975, and the other two in February 1975. There is no evidence or finding that any of this $65,450 ever reached Equico\u2019s hands, and jury findings 14 and 15 are at least an implicit determination to the contrary. Moreover, there is no substantial evidence that Equico knew that Dairy-land cattle on which it had a mortgage were being sold by Dairy Cows in sales financed by Misco. The Trustee argues that this would be to Equico\u2019s advantage, as it brought fresh money to its debtor Dairy Cows. However, Equico\u2019s security was impaired to the same extent. We conclude that the finding that Equico conspired to have these 114 cattle disposed of without applying the proceeds to reduce the Dairyland debt to Equico is based on no more than speculation and conjecture and cannot stand. The evidence is, however, sufficient to support the conspiracy finding in this respect as to Newton and Mesker, who acted for both Dairyland and Dairy Cows in these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">Misco Assumption Cattle Conspiracy ($38,308)</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-8\">The remaining portion of the Trustee\u2019s actual damage recovery was based on the jury findings (numbers 12 &amp; 13) that Newton and Mesker, pursuant to a conspiracy with Equico, transferred 206 cows, worth $103,000, on which Misco held mortgages or leases having a balance of $64,692 which Dairyland had \u201cassumed,\u201d without applying the proceeds of the transfer to reduce the lease debt. The Trustee\u2019s theory in this regard was that Dairyland thus lost its $38,308 \u201cequity\u201d in these cows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-9\">There was testimony that Dairy Cows would periodically repossess cattle it had owned and leased to various farmers, with Dairy Cows\u2019 having assigned the leases to Misco. Dairy Cows entered into arrangements with Dairyland concerning some of these repossessed cows by which Dairyland agreed to graze the cattle and make the lease payments to Misco, in return for which Dairyland would be entitled to the milk produced plus $10 per month to be paid by Dairy Cows for nonmilk-producing cows. The agreements provided that Dairyland could assume the unpaid lease balance at any time and in effect become the owner of the cattle subject to the lease debt; it could also \u201cquit renting the cows or bulls at any time without further obligation.\u201d Dairyland made payments on the leases for a considerable time. Though somewhat unclear, the evidence indicates that in the spring of 1975 these cows ended up with Dairy Cows. Newton testified by deposition that this came about because \u201cDairyland couldn\u2019t continue making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>payments.\u201d However, as the cattle were worth $38,308 more than the debt against them,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it could be found that Dairyland was able to sell these cattle and net that amount, but that Newton and Mesker caused Dairyland to instead transfer the cattle to Dairy Cows, without fair consideration, so that the latter could realize this $38,308 equity. What happened to the cows thereafter is unclear. Dairy Cows seems to have leased some to third parties and sold some at auction. There is no showing of how much Dairy Cows actually realized on these cows. There is no evidence or finding that Equico took leases on any of them or received any of the proceeds of their disposition, or that Equico was privy to the details of the arrangements between Dairyland and Dairy Cows in this respect. We hold that findings that Equico conspired with Newton and Mesker respecting these cows is based on no more than speculation and conjecture, and cannot stand. However, there is evidence to support the findings as to Newton and Mesker regarding these Misco \u201cassumption\u201d cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">THE TRUSTEE\u2019S LEGAL BASES FOR RECOVERY</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">Equico, Newton, and Mesker further argue that the findings and evidence present no legal basis on which the Trustee\u2019s actual damages recovery can be sustained. The Trustee advances three basic legal theories in support of its recovery, namely, conversion, civil conspiracy, and fraudulent conveyance under both the Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Texas fraudulent conveyance statute. We consider these in the order indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-7\">Conversion</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-8\">The Trustee has focused its arguments before this Court on the theory of conversion. For several reasons, we find that none of the recovery can be sustained on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-11\">To begin with, we note that the jury made no finding of any conversion. The Trustee points out that the trial court\u2019s judgment makes reference to the $318,416 (the $280,108 and the $38,308), on the basis of which the Trustee\u2019s actual damage award was calculated, as \u201crepresenting the fair market of cattle converted by\u201d Newton, Mesker, and Equico, and correctly urges that the absence of jury findings is not fatal due to the provisions of Fed.R. Civ.P. 49(a). Nevertheless, we hold that there is insufficient evidence to sustain the conversion theory of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-12\">With respect to that portion of the $280,-108 worth of cattle represented by the some 275 cattle sold at auction for $64,465 cash, the evidence shows that these cattle were sold by Dairyland and the proceeds of sales were placed in its bank account and used by it in its operations. This is simply no character of conversion. All of the other Dairyland cattle making up the cattle worth $280,108 were transferred by Dairy-land on or after January 31, 1975. The transfers were made by bills of sale, executed by Newton or Mesker, from Dairy-land to Dairy Cows, in consideration of cancellation of preexisting Dairyland indebtedness to Dairy Cows. Regardless of the adequacy of the consideration, there is no basis for any determination that the transfers were not duly made, fully authorized, and consented to by Dairyland. Newton and Mesker were the sole owners of Dairyland and had full and complete authority to act for it. \u201cConversion involves a taking of property without the owner\u2019s consent; hence there can be no conversion where the owner has expressly or impliedly assented to the taking or disposition.\u201d 15 Tex.Jur.3d, Conversion \u00a7 3 at 11. Since Dairyland consented to, indeed made, the transfers, there was no conversion. The same principle applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>the Misco \u201cassumption\u201d cattle which Dairy-land let go back to Dairy Cows in the spring of 1975 thereby losing $38,308 of \u201cequity.\u201d Again, Newton and Mesker acted for Dairyland, were its sole owners, and were fully authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">The Trustee, however, apparently seeks to avoid the effect of the foregoing on the theory that he stands in the position not of Dairyland but of its general creditors, and that hence Dairyland\u2019s consent does not vitiate the conversion. We hold that this theory is without merit. Under Texas law it is well settled that in order to recover on a theory of conversion one must at the time of the conversion either have some character of ownership interest in the specific property converted or be in legal possession of it or then entitled to its possession. <em>Catania v. Garage De Le Paix, Inc., </em>542 S.W.2d 239, 242 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Tyler 1976, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.) (\u201cA plaintiff who has not shown title or some other right to possession of the property allegedly converted may not maintain a suit in conversion.\u201d); <em>Lone Star Beer, Inc. v. Republic Nat. Bank of Dallas, </em>508 S.W.2d 686, 687 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Dallas 1974, no writ) (\u201c \u2018In order to recover on a theory of conversion, it is necessary that ... [the plaintiff] allege and prove one of three things, that being, that it is the owner of the property converted or that it had legal possession of the property so taken or that it is entitled to possession.\u2019 \u201d (quoting with approval <em>Lone Star Beer, Inc. v. First National Bank of Odessa, </em>468 S.W.2d 930, 934 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 El Paso 1971, no writ)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dairyland\u2019s general creditors did not, at the time of the alleged conversions, have any ownership interest in the specific cattle allegedly converted or the possession, or right to immediate possession, thereof. <em>See Estate of Stonecipher v. Estate of Butts, </em>591 S.W.2d 806, 808 (Tex. 1979), in which the Texas Supreme Court quoted with approval a passage from the annotation in 2 A.L.R. 287-93 including the statement that \u201c \u2018... it is clear that a mere general creditor without a lien has no interest in the debtor\u2019s property,\u2019 \u201d and went on to state, \u201cIn <em>Le Gierse et al. v. Whitehurst, </em>66 Tex. 244, 18 S.W. 510 (1886), it was held that a general creditor has no right in or lien upon property of the debtor ____\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Trustee cannot avoid the effect of Dairyland\u2019s consent on the theory that its general creditors did not consent, for the general creditors, so far as they did not stand in Dairyland\u2019s position, had no interest sufficient to support an action for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-10\">This result is not altered by the provisions of section 70c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110c (1976), generally giving the Trustee \u201cas of the date of bankruptcy the rights and powers of\u201d a creditor \u201cwho upon the date of bankruptcy obtained\u201d either a judgment or execution returned unsatisfied against the bankrupt or a lien by legal or equitable proceedings on all property on which a simple contract creditor of the bankrupt could have obtained a lien. The Trustee's rights under these provisions \u201care to be ascertained as of \u2018the date of bankruptcy,\u2019 not at an anterior point of time.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, </em>364 U.S. 603, 607, 81 S.Ct. 347, 349, 5 L.Ed.2d 323 (1961) (footnote omitted). The date of bankruptcy for these purposes is the date the petition is filed, <em>id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>at 607 n. 5, 81 S.Ct. at 349 n. 5, which in this case was December 23, 1975, many months after the \u201cconversions,\u201d the last of which was in May 1975. The hypothetical creditor who first acquired a judgment or lien against Dairyland and its property in December 1975 could not maintain an action for a claimed conversion in May 1975 of Dairyland property, for the creditor would have had, at the time of the conversion, no interest in or right of possession of the property allegedly converted. Further, \u201cSection 70c ... has no application as to rights other than rights against <em>property.\u201d </em>1 Collier Bankruptcy Manual \u00a7 70.30[2] at 1018 (2d ed. 1978) (footnote omitted). It does not give to the Trustee \u201cthe creditor\u2019s right to an in personam judgment.\u201d <em>First National Bank of Herkimer v. Poland Union, </em>109 F.2d 54, 56 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>309 U.S. 682, 60 S.Ct. 723, 84 L.Ed. 1026 (1940).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">Accordingly, we reject the Trustee\u2019s conversion theory of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">Civil Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-6\">Nor do we find that the Trustee has any cause of action for civil conspiracy. The Texas Supreme Court has held that a general creditor does not have a cause of action for civil conspiracy when a debtor\u2019s property is conveyed to others to evade payment. <em>Estate of Stonecipher v. Estate of Butts, supra. </em>The essence of a cause of action for conspiracy is damage resulting from the commission of a wrong which injures another, and not the conspiracy itself. The damage suffered by a general creditor when property is fraudulently conveyed to another to evade payment is the deprivation of an opportunity to make a levy on the property. This damage, however, is too remote to support recovery. <em>Stonecipher, </em>591 S.W.2d at 808. Therefore, since the Trustee is a representative of Dairyland\u2019s general creditors in this action, it has suffered rio damage for which it may recover under a cause of action for civil conspiracy as such. For the reasons discussed above in connection with the Trustee\u2019s conversion theory, the Trustee\u2019s civil conspiracy theory of recovery is not enhanced here by section 70c of the Bankruptcy Act, nor by sections 67 or 70e. However, recovery under the latter sections themselves is a different matter, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-10\">Fraudulent Conveyance</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-11\">We finally consider the Trustee\u2019s fraudulent conveyance theory of recovery. This recovery is premised on sections 67d and 70e of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107d &amp; 110e (1976), and on the Texas fraudulent conveyance statute, Tex.Bus. &amp; Comm.Code Ann. \u00a7 24.02 (Vernon 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-12\">Bankruptcy Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-13\">We first consider the claim under the Bankruptcy Act. Section 67d(2) describes the following \u201ctransfer[s] made ... by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>debtor within one year prior to\u201d the date of bankruptcy as being \u201cfraudulent\u201d:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-5\">\u201cEvery transfer made and every obligation incurred by a debtor within one year prior to the filing of a petition initiating a proceeding under this title by or against him is fraudulent (a) as to creditors existing at the time of such transfer or obligation, if made or incurred without fair consideration by a debtor who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent, without regard to his actual intent; or (b) as to then existing creditors and as to other persons who become creditors during the continuance of a business or transaction, if made or incurred without fair consideration by a debtor who is engaged or is about to engage in such business or transaction, for which the property remaining in his hands is an unreasonably small capital, without regard to his actual intent; or (c) as to then existing and future creditors, if made or incurred without fair consideration by a debtor who intends to incur or believes that he will incur debts beyond his ability to pay as they mature; or (d) as to then existing and future creditors, if made or incurred with actual intent as distinguished from intent presumed in law, to hinder, delay, or defraud either existing or future creditors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-12\">The rights of the trustee in bankruptcy respecting fraudulent transfers are specified in sections 67d(6) and 70e.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 67d(6) states that such transfers \u201cshall be null and void against the trustee.\u201d This same language (with \u201cas against\u201d substituted for \u201cagainst\u201d) is repeated in section 70e(l). Section 70e(2) further states that \u201c... every such transfer or obligation shall be avoided by, the trustee for the benefit of the estate\u201d and that \u201c[t]he trustee shall reclaim and recover such property or collect its value from and avoid such transfer or obligation against whoever may hold or have received it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-13\">However, the general rule under the Bankruptcy Act is that one who did not actually receive any of the property fraudulently transferred (or any part of a \u201cpreference\u201d) will not be liable for its value, even though he may have participated or conspired in the making of the fraudulent transfer (or preference). The reasons for this rule are well explained in <em>Elliott v. Glushon, </em>390 F.2d 514 (9th Cir.1967). There the. Court noted that \"[t]he literal terms of the sections [sections 60, 67 and 70] suggest with some certainty that recovery may be had only against persons who have received the property in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It specifically rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>argument, \u201cbased on the general principle that joint tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable,\u201d that \u201cin the case of a conspiracy all conspirators should be held subject to \u2018recovery\u2019 under the quoted sections regardless of whether they have physically received the property in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-4\">\u201cThe purpose of those sections of the Bankruptcy Act which are here relevant is clearly to preserve the assets of the bankrupt; they are not intended to render civilly liable all persons who may have contributed in some way to the dissipation of those assets. The Act carefully speaks of conveyances of property as being \u2018null and void,' and authorizes suit by the trustee to \u2018reclaim and recover such property or collect its value.\u2019 The actions legislated against are not \u2018prohibited\u2019; those persons whose actions are rendered \u2018null and void\u2019 are not made \u2018liable\u2019; and terms such as \u2018damages\u2019 are not used. The legislative theory is cancellation, not the creation of liability for the consequences of a wrongful act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">The Ninth Circuit has reaffirmed <em>Elliott, see In re Christian &amp; Porter Aluminum Co., </em>584 F.2d 326, 339 (9th Cir.1978), and it has been followed by the First, Second, and Eighth Circuits. <em>See Robinson v. Watts Detective Agency, </em>685 F.2d 729, 737-38 (1st Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1105, 103 S.Ct. 728, 74 L.Ed.2d 953, 459 U.S. 1204, 103 S.Ct. 1191, 75 L.Ed.2d 436 (1983); <em>Klein v. Tabatchnick, </em>610 F.2d 1043, 1048 n. 4 (2d Cir.1979); <em>Jackson v. Star Sprinkler Corp., </em>575 F.2d 1223, 1234 (8th Cir.1978). We are aware of no case which has declined to follow <em>Elliott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\">There is an exception to the general <em>Elliott </em>rule for those cases in which a person does not actually directly receive the transferred property, but nevertheless indirectly receives it or receives its proceeds or value. Thus, in <em>Duell v. Brewer, </em>92 F.2d 59, 61 (2d Cir.1937), the Court noted that under both New York law and the Bankruptcy Act one \u201cwho takes active part in procuring a preference,\u201d though not liable for all resulting loss, \u201cmust be liable for any part of the property which he actually receives,\u201d and continued by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1422-10\">\u201c[I]f the transferee directed the property to be turned over to his creditor, he would be as much liable as though he received it himself____ Similarly, if a creditor of the transferee joins with the transferee to secure the preference, and receives it in discharge of the debt, he must be liable, at least to the extent that the transferee cannot respond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1422-13\"><em>See also Aulick v. Largent, </em>295 F.2d 41 (4th Cir.1961); <em>National Bank v. National Herkimer County Bank, 225 </em>U.S. 178, 32 S.Ct. 633, 56 L.Ed. 1042 (1911); 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 547.53[1] at 547-160.10 (15th ed. 1984). Another example of this exception is illustrated by <em>Brainard v. Cohn, </em>8 F.2d 13 (9th Cir.1925), where there had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>been an \u201cintentional intermixture of the goods of the debtor with the goods of those acting in collusion with him, so that separation is practically impossible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">We now apply these principles to the various transfers found by the jury and shown by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">We hold that the Trustee made out a case against Equico, Newton, and Mesker under sections 67d and 70e with respect to the 188 Dairyland cattle, worth $150,193, mortgaged to Equico which were transferred from Dairyland to Dairy Cows and thereupon sold by the latter to third parties, with the $150,193 proceeds going to Equico and being applied to reduce Dairy Cows\u2019, rather than Dairyland\u2019s, debt to it. As noted, there was sufficient evidence of a conspiracy for this purpose, respecting these transactions, between Newton, Mesker, and Equico, as found by the jury. While the jury did not find that the transfers were made either without fair consideration or with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> one or the other of which findings is required under section 67d(2), nevertheless such findings can be implied in support of the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a), there being adequate supporting evidence and the failure to submit these matters to the jury not having been objected to below.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On the same basis, we also imply, to the extent necessary, findings that these transfers were in effect received by Equico as the proceeds were paid to it,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and that they were likewise received by Newton and Mesker as the proceeds were applied to reduce the debt of Dairy Cows <em>(i.e., </em>Newton and Mesker individually) to Equico. Accordingly, we sustain the Trustee\u2019s recovery against Equico, Newton, and Mesker under sections 67 and 70 with respect to these particular 188 cattle worth $150,193.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-10\">We next consider the some 275 Dairyland cows which were mortgaged to Equico and were sold at auction to third parties by Dairyland for $64,465 cash which was deposited in the Dairyland bank account and used by it in its operations. As previously observed, the jury found that these sales were made pursuant to a conspiracy between Newton, Mesker, and Equico. However, there is no finding, nor any sufficient evidence on which an implied finding can be based, that any of the defendants ever received,, directly or indirectly, any of these cattle. Dairyland itself received the proceeds, and there is no finding or evidence any of the defendants did so, directly or indirectly. The jury in effect found that Equico did not (findings 14 &amp; 15). There Was no \u201cintermingling,\u201d except with Dairyland\u2019s own funds. The Trustee argues that the defendants received a benefit from the fact that these funds helped Dairyland continue to operate. While this-may be so, such a benefit does not suffice to take the situation out of the <em>Elliott </em>rule. <em>Elliott </em>rests on the proposition that \u201c[t]he legislative theory is cancellation, not the creation of liability for the consequences of a wrongful act.\u201d 390 F.2d at 516. The exceptions are essentially consistent with this \u201cdisgorging\u201d approach: one must return what one has wrongfully received. The Trustee\u2019s theory is inconsistent with this: it is based on an incidental, unquanti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>fiable, and remote benefit bearing no necessary correspondence to the value of the property transferred or received. Hence it essentially is no more than \u201cthe creation of liability for the consequences of a wrongful act.\u201d It would, at the least, turn the <em>Elliott </em>doctrine from the general rule into a narrow, difficult to apply, and essentially meaningless exception. This we decline to do.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the Bankruptcy Act does not afford the Trustee any basis for recovery against any of the defendants in respect to these cattle sold at auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">The remainder of the $280,108 worth of Dairyland cattle transferred were those approximately 114 head mortgaged to Equico which were transferred to Dairy Cows and thereupon sold by it to diverse third parties on \u201cleases\u201d which Dairy Cows promptly assigned to Misco for $65,450. With respect to Newton and Mesker, we imply findings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a) that these transfers were without fair consideration to Dairyland, were made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, and were received by Newton and Mesker, who, as Dairy Cows, received both the cattle and the proceeds thereof. Accordingly, we sustain the Trustee\u2019s recovery under the Bankruptcy Act against Newton and Mesker respecting these 114 cattle worth $65,450. However, as to Equico the result must be different. We have held that there is insufficient evidence to link Equico to a conspiracy respecting the fraudulent transfer of these cattle. Moreover, there is no evidence (nor any finding) that Equico directly or indirectly received any of these cattle or any of the proceeds thereof. As noted, the jury found that Equico received and did not apply to Dairy-land\u2019s debt only $150,193 out of the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of Dairyland cattle (findings 14 &amp; 15). The $150,193 plainly refers to the 188 cattle discussed above. For the reasons previously stated, we reject the Trustee\u2019s theory that Equico is nevertheless liable because the transactions benefited its debtor Dairy Cows. There is no finding of any benefit to Equico, nor any evidence that any of the proceeds ended up with Equico. The Trustee has not established liability under the Bankruptcy Act against Equico as to the transactions involving these 114 cows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-7\">The remaining transfers involved are those concerning the Misco \u201cassumption\u201d cattle in which Dairyland had a $38,-308 \u201cequity.\u201d We determine that findings may be implied that these cattle were transferred to Dairy Cows without fair consideration, that Newton and Mesker acted in this regard with actual intent to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors, and that Newton and Mesker (Dairy Cows) received the transfers. Accordingly, we sustain the Trustee\u2019s Bankruptcy Act recovery against Newton and Mesker in respect to these cows. There is, however, no basis for such a recovery against Equico. As previously stated, there is insufficient evidence to link Equico to a conspiracy respecting the fraudulent transfer of these cattle. Moreover, there is no evidence, nor any finding, that Equico directly of indirectly received any of these cattle or the proceeds thereof. And, for the reasons given above, we reject the Trustee\u2019s theory that Equico is nevertheless liable because the transactions benefited its debtor Dairy Cows. There is no finding of any benefit to Equico, nor any evidence that any of the proceeds ended up with Equico. We hold that the Trustee has not established Equico\u2019s liability to it. under the Bankruptcy Act respecting these Misco \u201cassumption\u201d cows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">Summarizing our disposition of the Trustee\u2019s claims in this regard, we sustain recovery under the Bankruptcy Act against Newton and Mesker as to all claims except only those respecting that portion of the cattle mortgaged to Equico that Dairyland sold at auction and for which it received the $64,465 sales proceeds; we further hold that the Trustee\u2019s recovery on its claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>against Equico under the Bankruptcy Act may be sustained only in respect to the 188 Dairyland cattle worth $150,193, mortgaged to Equico, the proceeds of which were received by Equico but not applied to Dairyland\u2019s debt to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-4\">Texas Fraudulent Conveyance Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">We now turn to the Texas fraudulent conveyance statute<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> to determine whether it provides a basis on which the Trustee\u2019s recovery may be sustained on those claims as to which we have denied recovery under the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">Although we have found no Texas decision in point, we are persuaded that the Texas statute, like the Bankruptcy Act, does not provide for recovery other than recovery of the property transferred or its value from one who is, directly or indirectly, a transferee or recipient thereof. The Texas statute does not purport to do anything other than render the transfer \u201cvoid\u201d with respect to designated persons. It operates against the title of an \u201cinnocent\u201d transferee who has not paid value just as fully as against the title of a transferee who has participated in a fraud. It does not purport to vary its operation on the basis of participation in wrongdoing or the lack thereof. Nowhere does it purport, to prohibit any transfers or to render the making or receiving of them illegal or wrongful. The statute contains no words such as \u201cdamages\u201d or \u201cliability\u201d or \u201cactionable.\u201d The reasoning of <em>Elliott </em>is hence fully applicable here. See 390 F.2d at 516-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-14\">Moreover, we note that this construction appears to be in accord with the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-15\">\u201c[I]n no event can the fraudulent grantee be held liable in an amount greater than the value of the property transferred to him, without regard to how scandalous the fraud may be.\u201d 37 C.J.S. \u00a7 444 at 1297-98 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-16\">Further, decisions construing the Texas bulk sales law<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> reinforce our conclusion in this regard. The transferee of property sold in violation of the Texas bulk sales statute has no personal liability unless he converts the property to his own use so as to place it beyond the reach of the creditors. B <em>&amp; H Auto Supply, Inc. v. Andrews, </em>417 S.W.2d 341 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Dallas 1967, no writ). <em>See also Hollis v. Boone, </em>315 S.W.2d 350 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 El Paso 1953, no writ) (any liability of buyer of assets of another to seller\u2019s creditors under bulk sales law would not be a personal liability); <em>Phillips v. Cargill, </em>131 S.W.2d 775 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 El Paso 1939, no writ) (transferee not personally liable under bulk sales law to creditor of transferor beyond the value of property transferred). Even where personal liability arises in those cases in which a purchaser disposes of or converts to his own use property acquired in violation of the bulk sales law, or places it beyond the reach of creditors, recovery will be limited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>value actually received. <em>Settegast v. Second National Bank, </em>126 Tex. 330, 87 S.W.2d 1070, 1073 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Finally, a mere general creditor may take advantage of the Texas fraudulent conveyance statute,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but, as we have seen, may not recover damages for conspiracy to commit a fraudulent conveyance. It would essentially render meaningless the rule of <em>Stonecipher, supra, </em>that a general creditor may not recover damages under a civil conspiracy cause of action, if recovery could be had under the fraudulent conveyance statute for an amount in excess of the proceeds received by the defendant.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">We therefore conclude that. as to the claims at issue here the Texas fraudulent conveyance statute does not broaden the Trustee\u2019s right of recovery beyond that afforded him by the Bankruptcy Act. Accordingly, we deny the Trustee recovery under the Texas fraudulent conveyance statute for the same claims as to which we deny recovery under the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"A6b\">Conclusion Respecting Trustee\u2019s Recovery</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">Accordingly, our disposition of the Trustee\u2019s claims of recovery is as follows: as against Equico the Trustee\u2019s recovery of $150,193 on its claim respecting the 188 Dairyland cows mortgaged to Equico is sustained, but the Trustee is denied recovery on all its other above-discussed claims against Equico; as against Newton and Mesker, the Trustee\u2019s claim of recovery respecting the some 175 Dairyland cows sold at auction is denied, but recovery on all its other mentioned claims is sustained. We turn now to consideration of the Trustee\u2019s entitlement to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-10\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-11\">THE TRUSTEE\u2019S RECOVERY OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES AGAINST EQUICO</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-12\">Equico complains of the Trustee\u2019s award of punitive damages against it. No complaint has been made by Newton and Mesker respecting the Trustee\u2019s award of punitive damages against them. Consequently we examine the punitive damage issue solely as it relates to Equico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-13\">In light of the legislative theory behind the fraudulent conveyance provisions of the Bankruptcy Act as articulated in <em>Elliott v. Glushon, </em>390 F.2d 514, 516 (9th Cir.1967), quoted above, we find that punitive damages are not recoverable under sections 67 or 70 of the Bankruptcy Act. <em>See also In re Checkmate Stereo and Electronics, Ltd., </em>9 B.R. 585 (N.Y. Bankr.Ct.1981); <em>Chichester v. Golden, </em>204 F.Supp. 634 (S.D.Cal.1962), <em>aff'd. in part </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>and <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>321 F.2d 250 (9th Cir.1963). Further, our holdings concerning the Trustee\u2019s substantive claims against Equico reduce the Trustee\u2019s \u201cgross\u201d recovery from Equico below the amount of Dairyland\u2019s secured debt to Equico allowed as an offset, so that the Trustee has suffered no actual loss. In these circumstances, recovery of exemplary damages would be particularly inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">As for the recovery of punitive damages under the Texas fraudulent conveyance statute, we have found no case precisely on point. Based on our foregoing analysis of the Texas statute in relation to the Trustee\u2019s substantive claims, we have considerable doubt that exemplary damages are any more recoverable under it than under the Bankruptcy Act. It is true that Texas courts, contrary to what appears to be the majority rule, <em>see </em>48 A.L.R.2d 947, 949, will hot deny exemplary damages simply because an action is equitable, rather than legal. <em>See, e.g., International Bankers Life Insurance Co. v. Holloway, </em>368 S.W.2d 567 (Tex.1963). However, the main question concerning exemplary damages under the Texas statute arises not because the statute is equitable, as opposed to legal, but rather because, as previously observed, its text purports merely to declare certain transfers \u201cvoid\u201d as to specified persons, without providing that the making of the transfer is wrongful or illegal. <em>Cf. Elliott. </em>Also, in this circumstance <em>Stonecipher </em>points away from allowing a character of relief neither implicit in the statute itself nor available apart from it. Nevertheless, we need not resolve this question, as we hold that here the Trustee\u2019s recovery of exemplary damages from Equico under Texas law is in any event barred by the recognized Texas rule that \u201cexemplary damages cannot be recovered unless the plaintiff is shown to have sustained actual loss or injury____ A verdict of <em>nominal </em>actual damages is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Fort Worth Elevators Co. v. Russell, </em>123 Tex. 128, 70 S.W.2d 397, 409 (1934). <em>See also Forbau v. Producers Gas Co., </em>601 S.W.2d 550, 552 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Amarillo 1980, no writ); 28 Tex.Jur.3d Damages \u00a7 188 (\u201cExemplary damages may not be recovered unless plaintiff is shown to have sustained actual loss or injury____ [Njominal damages is not sufficient____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-12\">Hence, even while allowing exemplary damages in equitable actions, Texas courts have also stated that such recovery must be supported by a finding of actual loss or damage. <em>See National Bank of Commerce v. May, </em>583 S.W.2d 685, 691-92 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Eastland 1979, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.); <em>Bibby v. Preston, </em>555 S.W.2d 898, 903 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Tyler 1977, no writ); <em>Adam v. Harris, </em>564 S.W.2d 152, 156 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1978, writ ref\u2019d n.r. e.). The Texas Supreme Court stated in <em>Holloway </em>that \u201cthe remedy selected <em>in relation to the actual harm done the plaintiff, </em>together with the nature of the acts of the defendants, ... may be such as not to justify an award of exemplary damages.\u201d 368 S.W.2d at 584 (emphasis added). The Texas Court of Civil Appeals has also declared, in considering those cases allowing an award of exemplary damages in suits for equitable relief, that \u201cthe rule is that a litigant may recover exemplary damages in actions for equitable relief, but in order to do so, there must be some actual loss or injury to support such recovery.\u201d <em>Adam v. Harris, supra, </em>564 S.W.2d at 156. <em>See also Teas v. Republic National Bank of Dallas, </em>460 S.W.2d 233, 244 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014Dallas 1970, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-13\">Accordingly, many Texas appellate decisions have held that a plaintiff, though properly recovering equitable or similar relief, is nevertheless not entitled to exemplary damages where he has not shown that he in fact sustained actual loss or injury. Thus, in <em>City Products Corp. v. Berman, </em>610 S.W.2d 446 (Tex.1980), the plaintiff tenant was held entitled to an injunction against his landlord and a competing tenant because the latter\u2019s lease from the landlord constituted a willful violation of the prohibited competition clause of the plaintiff\u2019s lease. Nevertheless, the Texas Supreme Court held that, it not having been found that the plaintiff sustained ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>tual damage, exemplary damages could not be recovered, since for such recovery \u201cthe complainant must prove that he suffered some actual damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450. Other cases to like effect are cited in the margin.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">Texas cases that have allowed recovery of exemplary damages in equitable actions all seem to be ones where either the plaintiff also either has been properly awarded an actual monetary judgment (apart from the exemplary damages) against the defendant or has otherwise proved that he in fact suffered actual loss or injury. <em>See Holloway, supra </em>(judgment for amount of profits received and withheld in breach of fiduciary duty); <em>Russell v. Truitt, </em>554 S.W.2d 948, 955 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Fort Worth 1977, writ refd n.r.e.) (judgment for amount of agency fees received and withheld in breach of fiduciary duty); <em>Nolan v. Bettis, </em>577 S.W.2d 551, 554-55 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Austin 1979, writ refd n.r.e.) (damages for actual loss of use of land resulting from accomplished foreclosure).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">Applying these cases to the present facts, we hold that the Trustee is not entitled to recover exemplary damages from Equico. The Trustee has not demonstrated that Dairyland\u2019s general creditors, which it represents, have experienced any actual harm as a result of the occurrences giving rise to the Trustee\u2019s single substantive claim against Equico which we have sustained. <em>Cf. Stonecipher. </em>The Trustee\u2019s only valid substantive claim against Equico is for the $150,193 which it did not apply to Dairyland\u2019s secured debt to it. Had Equico applied these sums as it should have, nevertheless there would at all times have remained a significant secured debt owing from Dairyland to Equico. The potential harm to Dairyland\u2019s creditors would have been actually realized only if Equico had foreclosed or had received fraudulently transferred sums in excess of Dairyland\u2019s outstanding debt to it. It is true that the Trustee had to resort to court proceedings to prevent actual damage from occurring and to establish the credit to which Dairy-land was entitled. But the same sort of situation was present in <em>City Products Corp. v. Berman, supra, </em>where an injunction was necessary to prevent harmful competition, and is likewise present in, for example, any action to remove cloud from title or to reform a deed. <em>See </em>note 26, <em>supra. </em>As long as the plaintiff has not in fact suffered actual harm or loss, the mere need to judicially \u201ccorrect\u201d the \u201crecord\u201d or the \u201cbooks\u201d or the like so that actual harm will not occur does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-8\">For these reasons we set aside the Trustee\u2019s recovery of exemplary damages against Equico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">THE $18,425 REIMBURSEMENT TO THE TRUSTEE</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">Equico asserts that the $18,425 adjustment allowed the Trustee for sums it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>paid Equico since bankruptcy in respect to the Dairyland debt to Equico <em>(see </em>note 3, <em>supra </em>and accompanying text) is unsupported by the evidence. With one. minor exception, we reject this contention. Equico\u2019s own answer establishes this $18,425 amount. Equico asserts its answer cannot be considered because it was not introduced in evidence. While this argument would have some merit had the answer been a superseded pleading, <em>see Borel v. United States Casualty Co., </em>233 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.1956), it was, on the contrary, Equico\u2019s current pleading and hence did not have to be put in evidence in order to be considered against Equico. <em>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Tompkins, </em>117 F.2d 596, 598 (5th Cir.1941). <em>See also Scott v. Commissioner, </em>117 F.2d 36, 40 (8th Cir.1941); 4 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1064 at 67 (Chadbourn rev. 1972); McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 265 at 633 (E. Cleary ed. 1972). The adjustments in question were apparently made by the trial court for the wholly proper purpose of preventing Equico from getting \u201cdouble\u201d credit for the secured debt owed it by Dairyland, <em>i.e., </em>both getting a credit or setoff on account of that debt and <em>also </em>getting paid it. However, the portion of the $18,425 adjustment represented by the $4,250 payment to Equico on the \u201cbailer-head cutter\u201d debt relates to a debt not included in the $273,361.16 secured debt allowed by the trial court as an offset. Hence the $18,425 adjustment should have been $14,175. We sustain Equico's point to this extent only, and in all other respects overrule it.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">YI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">DISPOSITION OF TRUSTEE\u2019S CLAIMS AGAINST EQUICO</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">We have set aside the Trustee\u2019s award of exemplary damages against Equico, and all its substantive claims against Equico except that for the $150,193 which Equico received from the proceeds of the Dairy-land cows mortgaged to it and did not apply to the Dairyland debt. As noted, the trial court applied the amount of the Trustee\u2019s substantive recovery against Equico first to the reduction of Dairyland\u2019s debt to Equico secured by its lien on the ranch. This extinguished the debt so secured, and the trial court cancelled Equico\u2019s lien on the ranch and its sales proceeds and declared, in effect, that Brazos\u2019 lien thereon was superior to that of all parties/ Our reduction of the Trustee\u2019s claim against Equico to $150,193, however, changes the results of the procedure employed by the trial court and leaves something in the neighborhood of $100,000 still owing on the Dairyland debt to Equico secured by the latter\u2019s lien on the ranch. Therefore, following the same procedure would require the trial court\u2019s judgment to be modified so as to reduce the Dairyland debt to Equico only by the referenced $150,193 and to correspondingly reduce the amount secured by Equico\u2019s lien on the ranch proceeds, rather than wholly cancelling such lien.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We remand the Trustee\u2019s suit against Equico for entry of proper judgment consistent with the foregoing and for any further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>proceedings appropriate in that connection as are not inconsistent herewith.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-5\">THE UNSECURED CLAIM OF NEWTON AND MESKER AGAINST THE TRUSTEE</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">Newton and Mesker argue that the trial court should have offset Dairyland\u2019s recovery against them by the $280,738 which the jury found had been advanced to Dairyland by Newton and Mesker or Dairy Cows during the period from May 20, 1972 to December 23, 1975. We disagree for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-7\">First, the jury finding was not a finding of the debt owed by Dairyland to Newton, Mesker, or Dairy Cows. No finding was made as to whether any of the sums advanced were repaid. Newton and Mesker have therefore failed to establish a claim against the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-8\">Second, the evidence shows that any debt that Dairyland owed to Newton, Mesker, or Dairy Cows was wholly unsecured. It would defeat the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act\u2019s provisions relating to fraudulent transfers to allow Newton and Mesker to offset the value of the property thus transferred to them by the amount of their unsecured claim against Dairyland. With reference to preferential transfers this Court has previously declared in <em>Walker v. Wilkinson, </em>296 F. 850 (5th Cir.1924):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axk-dedup-0\">\u201cThe reason is, to permit this to be done would defeat the right to recover the preference and render the statute futile. In such a case the transaction is single, and results in a depletion of the fund that would otherwise have gone to creditors to the extent of the preferential payment. Allowing the creditor to set off the debt due him against the payments received by him would leave the preference unremedied. In this class of cases, the right to offset is denied, because the estate has been depleted to the detriment of creditors of like class, and to allow the right of set off would perpetuate the depletion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-12\">This reasoning is at least equally applicable to fraudulent transfers. Moreover, section 57(g) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 93(g) (1976), would likewise appear to bar any such set off. <em>See Katchen v. Landy, </em>382 U.S. 323, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-13\">We affirm all the Trustee\u2019s recovery against Newton and Mesker except only that respecting the some 275 Dairyland cattle sold at auction, the $64,465 proceeds of which sales were' paid to Dairyland and used by it in its operations. We reverse the case as against Newton and Mesker and remand for the entry of judgment consistent herewith and for any further proceedings as may be appropriate in that connection and not inconsistent herewith.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-14\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-15\">THE AWARD OF EXEMPLARY DAMAGES TO BRAZOS AGAINST EQUICO</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-16\">Equico challenges that award against it and in favor of Brazos of exem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>plary damages, on the ground that no actual damage to Brazos, in respect to any matter involving Equico, was proved or found by either the trial court or the jury. We sustain this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">We recognize that Brazos, as a junior lienholder, has standing to complain of, and recover any actual damages in fact occasioned by, Equico\u2019s misapplication of the $150,193. <em>Cf. Stonecipher. </em>However, this does not take Brazos out of the rule, discussed in part IV above in connection with our denial of the Trustee\u2019s claim against Equico for exemplary damages under the Texas fraudulent conveyance statute, that exemplary damages are not available unless the plaintiff has in fact sustained actual loss or injury. None such has been or will be suffered by Brazos. There has been no foreclosure by Equico; Brazos\u2019 lien has not been extinguished; Brazos has not paid, or been denied possession of, anything to which it was entitled.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Moreover, the trial court\u2019s judgment has protected and will protect Brazos\u2019 lien on the ranch sales proceeds from being inferior to that portion of the original Dairyland debt to Equico which should have been, but was not, credited with the $150,193 Equico received from the proceeds of the 188 Dairy-land cattle mortgaged to it. This, it seems to us, is analogous to the protection, and prevention of the suffering of actual loss or injury, resulting from the injunction and declaratory relief in <em>City Products Corp. v. Berman, supra, or </em>from an order removing a cloud on title or the like. <em>See </em>note 26, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1431-8\">The injury to junior lienholder Brazos from Equico\u2019s failure to apply the $150,193 to the debt secured by Equico\u2019s superior lien was only potential. No actual loss or injury ever resulted. Brazos therefore may not recover exemplary damages from Equico, and we reverse so much of the judgment as so provides. This part of the case will also be included in our remand for the entry of appropriate judgment consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-9\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-10\">THE USURY ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"aoy-dedup-1\">By agreement, the parties submitted separately to the trial court the Trustee\u2019s usury claim against Equico. In its Memorandum Opinion and Order, the trial court found that Equico had advanced $200,000 to Dairyland, for which Dairyland had executed in May 1972 a promissory note to Equico for $296,600 payable in eighty-four equal monthly installments. The face amount of the note represented $200,000 in principal with $96,600 as \u201cadd on interest\u201d calculated at a rate of twelve percent per annum over eighty-four months. The note was secured by deeds of trust on the ranch and equipment owned by Dairyland.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The note contained the following printed acceleration clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-11\">\u201cIt is expressly provided that upon, default in the punctual payment of this note or any part thereof, principal or interest, as the same shall become due and payable, or upon failure to comply with any of the covenants, terms or conditions of any deed of trust or other lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>securing the payment of this note, the entire indebtedness secured by the hereinafter mentioned lien shall be matured, at the option of the holder____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">The deeds of trust each contained the following printed provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-5\">\u201cThat in any of the following events [of default] the Beneficiary may elect to declare the entire indebtedness hereby secured, with all interest and all other sums hereby secured, immediately due and payable,____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">The trial court ruled that the applicable maximum lawful rate of interest was the eighteen percent per annum provided for corporations, their successors, assigns, and guarantors by article 1302-2.09, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. (Vernon 1980), and that at no time did Equico receive or collect interest at a greater rate than this maximum. The trial court likewise determined that if the note had been paid off according to its specified installment schedule, no interest in excess of this maximum rate would have been paid or received. None of these determinations are in any way challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-7\">The Trustee, however, bases its claim of usury on two theories. First, it claims that the note, read in connection with the deeds of trust, is usurious on its face because it constitutes a contract for usurious interest <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> in that it allows the noteholder, in the event the maker defaults in the payment of any of the installments, to accelerate the maturity of the entire note and collect the full amount (including the then unearned portion) of the \u201cadd on\u201d interest included in the face amount of the note. It is not disputed that if the Trustee\u2019s construction of the note is correct then it is indeed usurious on the basis urged. <em>Smart v. Tower Land and Investment Co., </em>597 S.W.2d 333 (Tex.1980). The trial court, however, rejected this construction of the note. For the reasons stated below, we are in agreement with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-9\">The second basis of the Trustee\u2019s usury claim is that Equico in fact charged usurious interest by statements made by its officer Lantz in a May 30, 1975 telephone conversation with Roberts, after Dairyland had defaulted on its note payments, and by Lantz\u2019s June 6,1975 handwritten memorandum of this conversation which was placed in Equico\u2019s file on this note. The Trustee asserts in this connection that a demand for payment is a charge and that Lantz in substance demanded full payment of the note, including all the unearned interest. Again, it is not disputed that if such a demand were made, Equico would be guilty of usury. The .trial court, however, found that no such demand was made and that Equico did not on the referenced occasions make any charge of the unearned interest. For the reasons stated below, we determine that the trial court\u2019s findings in this respect are not clearly erroneous and we sustain its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-10\">We first consider whether the acceleration clauses in the note and deeds of trust rendered the transaction usurious on its face. The rule enunciated in <em>Walker v. Temple Trust Co., </em>124 Tex. 575, 80 S.W.2d 935, 936-37 (Comm.App.1935) (opinion adopted), is applicable to the facts of this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayj-dedup-0\">\u201cIt is presumed that in contracting parties intend to observe and obey the law. For this reason the court will not hold a contract to be in violation of the usury laws unless, upon a fair and reasonable interpretation of all its terms, it is manifest that the intention was to exact more interest than allowed by law____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-14\">\u201c[U]nless the contract by its express and positive terms evidences an intention which requires a construction that unearned interest was to be collected in all events, the court will give it the construction that the parties intended that the unearned interest should not be collected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>Texas courts interpreting notes or deeds of trust involving acceleration clauses using words equivalent to \u201centire indebtedness\u201d have found that these clauses did not authorize collection of unearned interest. <em>See, e.g., Clements v. Williams, </em>136 Tex. 97, 147 S.W.2d 769 (1941) (maturity of \u201cdebt\u201d indicates unearned interest not collectible); <em>Davis v. Volunteer State Life Insurance Co., </em>135 S.W.2d 588 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Texarkana 1939, writ ref'd) (acceleration of \u201call sums herein agreed to be paid\u201d does not call for the collection of unearned interest); <em>Southland Life Insurance Co. v. Egan, </em>126 Tex. 160, 86 S.W.2d 722, 724 (1935) (acceleration of \u201cwhole debt herein secured\u201d does not provide for the collection of unearned interest); <em>Marble Savings Bank v. Davis, </em>124 Tex. 560, 80 S.W.2d 298, 299 (1935) (acceleration of \u201cthe whole of the indebtedness\u201d does not provide for collection of unearned interest); <em>Belzung v. Capital Bank, </em>598 S.W.2d 14, 15 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Dallas 1980, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.) (acceleration of \u201cthe indebtedness secured hereby\u201d does not include unearned interest). <em>See also Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Schuenemann, </em>668 S.W.2d 324, 328 (Tex.1984) (\u201cA provision which states that a \u2018debt\u2019 may be matured does not call for the collection of unearned interest, because interest does not become part of the \u2018debt\u2019 until it is earned.\u201d). Under these authorities, it is clear that the acceleration clause in the note, providing only for the acceleration of \u201cthe entire indebtedness,\u201d did not authorize the collection of unearned interest and did not render the note usurious. We hold that the note on its face was not usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">The Trustee, however, points to the acceleration clause in the deeds of trust, each speaking of \u201cthe entire indebtedness hereby secured, <em>with all interest </em>and all other sums hereby secured\u201d (emphasis added). The Trustee relies on <em>Clements v. Williams, supra, </em>which held that a clause authorizing acceleration of the \u201cnote\u201d provided for the collection of the unearned interest which was included in the face amount of the note. The decision in <em>Jim Walter Homes, Inc. </em>is to the same effect. In the deed of trust clause here, however, there is no statement that the \u201cnote\u201d will be matured. The phrase \u201cwith all interest\u201d can very well be taken to mean all <em>earned </em>interest.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>See Shropshire v. Commerce Farm Credit Co., </em>120 Tex. 400, 39 S.W.2d 11, 12, <em>cert. denied, </em>284 U.S. 675, 52 S.Ct. 130, 76 L.Ed. 571 (1931) (\u201cIf the contract ... contained no language other than that, if default was made ... the principal of the note, \u2018with interest,\u2019 should be collectible ... such language would be fairly susceptible of the meaning that unearned interest was to be abated.\u201d); <em>Belzung </em>at 16. Nevertheless, we do not determine whether this deed of trust clause, if it stood alone, would authorize the collection of unearned interest. It does not stand alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-8\">To begin with, the deed of trust acceleration clause must be read in connection with the note, particularly as each refers to the other. <em>See e.g., Walker v. Temple Trust Co., supra, </em>80 S.W.2d at 936; <em>Nevels v. Harris, </em>129 Tex. 190, 102 S.W.2d 1046 (1937). <em>See also Jones v. Kelly, </em>614 S.W.2d 95, 98 (Tex.1981); <em>Miles v. Martin, </em>159 Tex. 336, 321 S.W.2d 62, 65 (1959); <em>Veal v. Thomason, </em>138 Tex. 341, 159 S.W.2d 472, 475 (1942); <em>Spanish Village, Ltd. v. American Mortgage Co., </em>586 S.W.2d 195, 199-200 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Tyler 1979, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.). We are thus faced with two applicable acceleration clauses; one in the note providing for the acceleration of \u201cthe entire indebtedness,\u201d which does not authorize the collection of unearned interest and is not usurious; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>one in the deeds of trust which arguably authorizes the collection of unearned interest so as to be usurious. Our case is thus analogous to <em>Belzung, </em>where the note contained two acceleration clauses: one which, similarly to that in the note here, related to \u201cthe indebtedness secured hereby\u201d and hence did not authorize the collection of unearned interest and was not usurious; and the other which authorized collection of \u201cthe whole of this note\u201d on acceleration, and hence was clearly usurious. The <em>Bel-zung </em>court held that in this situation the \u201clegal\u201d clause must prevail over the illegal clause, and accordingly ruled that the note was not usurious! <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. <em>Belzung </em>controls here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">Indeed, the present case is a stronger one for the nonusurious nature of the instruments than <em>Belzung, </em>in at least three respects. First, in <em>Belzung </em>one of the clauses, standing alone, was <em>clearly </em>usurious. As we have noted, the deed of trust acceleration clause here is, if usurious, certainly much less clearly so than the \u201cwhole of this note\u201d clause in <em>Belzung. </em>Second, in <em>Belzung </em>both clauses were in the note, while here the acceleration clause in the note is plainly not usurious, while the questionable clause is in the deeds of trust. This circumstance brings into operation the statement in <em>Walker v. Temple Trust Co., supra, </em>that it is preferable to look to the note rather than to \u201cthe acceleration clause contained in the instrument [the deed of trust], which is intended primarily to furnish <em>security </em>rather than create an additional obligation of liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>80 S.W.2d at 937. Finally, in <em>Belzung </em>the deed of trust apparently did not contain a usury savings clause. Each of the deeds of trust here do, as more fully discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-5\">We do not regard the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jim Walter Homes, Inc. </em>as in any way undermining <em>Belzung. </em>In <em>Jim Walter Homes, Inc. </em>the Court considered a building contract, a note, and the mechanic\u2019s lien contract which secured the note, all executed at the same time and in reference to the same transaction. The note was an installment note with \u201cadd on\u201d interest included in its face amount. The note and mechanic\u2019s lien contract each contained acceleration clauses authorizing collection of the entire \u201cnote,\u201d and were thus held to be usurious under <em>Clements v. Williams, supra. </em>The creditor, however, pointed to the provision in the building contract which stated that the note and mechanic\u2019s lien contract \u201cshall provide\u201d that on default in any installment the creditor may declare \u201call of the remainder of said debt immediately due.\u201d Relying on <em>Belzung, </em>it was argued that this building contract clause was not usurious and should govern over the usurious clauses in the note and mechanic\u2019s lien contract. The Texas Supreme Court did not dispute that the building contract was not usurious, but declined to allow it to prevail over the usurious clauses in the note and mechanic\u2019s lien contract. In so holding, however, it did not question <em>Belzung, </em>but rather distinguished it, observing that <em>\u201cBelzung </em>differs from this case in two significant ways.\u201d 668 S.W.2d at 331. The first difference was that in <em>Belzung </em>the nonusurious acceleration provision \u201cwas an actual, operative agreement\u201d in contrast to \u201cthe nonusurious language in the building contract [which] is merely an inaccurate description of the acceleration terms actually agreed upon by the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case the nonusurious acceleration language in the note <em>is </em>\u201can actual, operative agreement,\u201d and is <em>not </em>a description of another agreement. \u201cSecond, the note involved in the <em>Belzung </em>case showed on its face that part of the payments required by the note were for interest,\u201d while the note in <em>Jim Walter Homes, Inc. </em>gave \u201cno indication whatever\u201d that it included any interest, which was described as \u201ca crucial difference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, of course, the note, both on its face and as described in the deeds of trust, specifically states that its face amount includes interest. <em>See </em>note 32, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, we regard <em>Belzung </em>as representing the law of Texas and as requiring us to hold that the note and deeds of trust here are not facially usurious..</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>This conclusion is reinforced by the presence in each deed of trust of a printed usury savings clause reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjFb\">\u201cNothing herein or in said Note shall ever entitle the Beneficiary, upon the arising of any contingency whatsoever, to receive or collect interest in excess of 10% per annum on the principal indebtedness hereby secured and in no event shall Grantors be obligated to pay interest thereon in excess of such rate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">In the face of this clause in the deeds of trust, it would indeed be anomalous to allow another clause (also printed) in the same instruments to overcome the nonusu-rious acceleration provision of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">Texas courts have repeatedly given effect to usury savings clauses to defeat a construction of a contract that would violate state usury laws. <em>See, e.g., Nevels v. Harris, </em>129 Tex. 190, 102 S.W.2d 1046 (1937); <em>Tanner Development Co. v. Ferguson, </em>561 S.W.2d 777 (Tex.1977); <em>Spanish Village, Ltd. v. American Mortgage Co., </em>586 S.W.2d 195 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Tyler 1979, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.). <em>See also Rickman v. Modern American Mortgage Corp., </em>583 F.2d 155 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 962, 99 S.Ct. 2406, 60 L.Ed.2d 1066 (1979); <em>Imperial Corp. of America v. Frenchman\u2019s Creek Corp., </em>453 F.2d 1338 (5th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-7\">We recognize that the mere presence of a usury savings clause will not rescue a transaction that is necessarily usurious by its explicit terms, <em>see Nevels, supra, </em>102 S.W.2d at 1050, but this is not such a case. The savings clause reinforces our conclusion that the note and the deeds of trust are not facially usurious.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-10\">We turn now to the Trustee\u2019s claim that Equieo charged usurious interest by means of Lantz\u2019s May 30, 1975 conversation with Roberts. Dairyland had been in default on. the note since April 1975. Roberts, in mid-May 1975, wrote Equieo requesting a pay-off figure on the note. The Lantz-Roberts telephone conversation resulted. Lantz testified that he got from \u201cthe computer run\u201d the figures for the Dairyland \u201caccount balances\u201d and gave them to Roberts on the telephone. These figures for \u201caccount balances\u201d included the unearned interest. However, Lantz also testified that he \u201cexplained to him [Roberts] these were account balances,\u201d as distinguished from pay-off figures. Lantz replied \u201cYes\u201d when asked, \u201cDid you explain to him' what you were giving to him was the balance, and not the pay-off figure.\u201d On June 6, 1975 Lantz made a handwritten memorandum to the Equieo file noting the figures he had given Roberts as \u201cbalances \u2022on Dairyland.\u201d The memorandum does not purport to show a pay-off figure. The trial court found, with ample support in the evidence, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-11\">\u201cOn at least five occasions following Dairyland\u2019s default in April 1975, defendant Equieo calculated the amount of unearned interest to be refunded in the event of foreclosure of its various notes with Dairyland. Equieo computed the net pay-off balance on the land note to be $145,581.14 as of the date of default____ Equieo computed the balance to be $151,-968.00 as of May 1975____ These fig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>ures were updated on three subsequent occasions____ At all times in the bankruptcy proceeding, Equico took the position that Dairyland was indebted to it in an amount in excess of $300,000.00 which is consistent with a claim for the sum of the net pay-off figures of all Dairyland notes after reduction for unearned interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">The trial court likewise found (and it is not disputed) that each of these net pay-off figures calculated by Equico reflected a rate of interest not in excess of the eighteen percent legal maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s implied finding that the May 30 conversation did not constitute a charging or demand for payment of the account balances, which included all the interest, and its finding that the June 6 file memorandum did not constitute such a demand for payment, or such a charging, are not clearly erroneous. We therefore sustain the trial court\u2019s determination that Equico did not charge usurious interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">Accordingly, we reject the Trustee\u2019s appeal for the denial of its usury claim, and sustain the trial court\u2019s rejection of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-8\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-10\">We hold that the Trustee is not entitled to recover exemplary damages from Equi-co, and is not entitled to recover on any of its substantive claims against Equico except for its fraudulent conveyance claim, under the Bankruptcy Act and the Texas statute, respecting the $150,193 which Equico received on the 188 Dairyland cattle mortgaged to it and did not apply to the Dairyland debt. Except to hold that the sum should be $14,175 instead of $18,425 as determined by the trial court, we reject Equico\u2019s complaints as to the $18,425 which the trial court allowed the Trustee. We hold that the Trustee is not entitled to recover on its usury claim against Equico, and sustain the trial court\u2019s ruling in this respect. We further hold that .Brazos is not entitled to recover exemplary damages from Equico. We set aside the trial court\u2019s judgment cancelling Equico\u2019s lien on the ranch and its proceeds and declaring that Brazos\u2019 lien is superior to that of all parties except the ranch purchaser, but hold that Equico\u2019s lien is reduced by the referenced $150,193. We reject all of Equico\u2019s other complaints on appeal. Respecting Newton and Mesker\u2019s complaints on appeal as to the Trustee\u2019s recovery against them, we sustain only the assertion that the Trustee may not recover in regard to the some 275 Dairyland cattle sold at auction for $64,465 cash paid to Dairyland and used by it in its operations. We set aside the Trustee\u2019s recovery against Newton and Mesker of such $64,465; otherwise we make no modification in the Trustee\u2019s recovery from Newton and Mesker. Our holdings respecting the Trustee\u2019s recovery from Equico and Newton and Mesker will require other modifications in the judgment <em>(see </em>notes 28, 29, and 81, and accompanying text, <em>supra). </em>Newton and Mesker do not complain of Brazos\u2019' recovery against them, and hence we do not disturb the holdings below in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-12\">The case is accordingly reversed and remanded to the trial court for the entry of judgment in conformity with our holdings herein and for any further proceedings as may be appropriate in that connection and not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">. Some nineteen special interrogatories were submitted, several having two or more separate subparts. What we have set out is, we believe, a fair summary, paraphrasing and combining the relevant interrogatories and answers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1413-11\">. Actually, the trial court, due to a $10 computational error, used a gross figure of $318,406, instead of $318,416, but this was cancelled out when an offsetting $10 error was made in subtracting the $273,361.16, so that the $45,054.84 net was in any event correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-12\">The referenced $273,361.16 which the trial court found Dairyland owed Equico as of May 1975 was apparently comprised of the following items: $152,604 ranch acquisition debt; $27,-261.79 equipment lease debt; and, $93,495.37 cow lease debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1413-18\">. This $18,425 consisted of: $7,425 ranch acquisition debt; $6,750 equipment lease debt; and, $4,250 on a bailer-head cutter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">. There was some testimony at trial that the remaining proceeds were also reduced by approximately $30,000 for commissions on the sale of the ranch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">. Newton and Mesker are represented by the same counsel as Equico, and, other than adopting Equico\u2019s brief, raise only one contention, namely, that they are entitled to a credit for the $280,738 the jury found they had advanced to Dairyland (jury finding 19). Equico's brief raises no question whatever about any of the exemplary damages awarded against Newton and Mesker nor about the actual damages awarded Brazos against Newton and Mesker, and for the most part its other contentions relate solely to its own special situation as a lender to and secured creditor of Dairyland, rather than to legal or factual theories commonly applicable to both it and Newton and Mesker. Consequently, respecting the defendants\u2019 appeals our analysis will primarily focus on Equico.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1415-7\">. This amount was then reduced by the amount of Dairyland\u2019s debt to Equico to produce the net actual damage award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1415-8\">. However, the jury did find that Equico, Newton, and Mesker also conspired to cause Dairy-land to cease doing business as an ongoing concern \"on January 31, 1975\u201d with \"actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud existing or future creditors\u201d of Dairyland (finding 3), and that Equico knew or should have known Dairy-land was insolvent on December 4, 1974 (findings 1 &amp; 2). The jury also found Equico had failed to act with ordinary care respecting the Dairyland cows mortgaged to it (finding 7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1415-15\">. Further, the jury found that Newton and Mesker (not Equico) \"on and after January 31, 1975\u201d caused Dairyland to transfer cattle (of unspecified value and number) owned by it to Dairy Cows \"without fair consideration\u201d and \"with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud existing or future creditors\u201d of Dairyland (findings 4 &amp; 5).</p>\n<p id=\"avi-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>The undisputed evidence is that all transfers from Dairyland to Dairy Cows on or after January 31, 1975 were made in consideration of the cancellation of Dairyland's preexisting indebtedness to Dairy Cows, and that at the time (on or \u2022after January 31, 1975) Newton and Mesker were the sole owners and principals of both Dairyland and Dairy Cows. The jury also found that from the May 1972 formation of Dairyland to December 1975, when it went in bankruptcy, Newton and Mesker had advanced $280,738 to Dairyland (finding 19). The jury did find that Equico on December 4, 1974 first knew that Dairyland \"had transferred any\u201d of its cows to Dairy Cows (finding 6), but there was no finding of want of fair consideration or improper purpose in respect to any pre-January 31, 1975 transfers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">.

Equico also claims that its secured debt from Dairyland was greater than the $273,361.16 allowed it by the trial court. We reject this contention, as the trial court's factual determination in this regard is supported by sufficient evidence and is not clearly erroneous. We likewise reject Equico's claim that the trial court should have used a date later than May 19, 1975 to calculate its debt for setoff purposes. This was a reasonable date for the purpose since the trial court could properly find it was shortly after the last of the challenged transfers. However, as our holdings reduce the amount of the Trustee\u2019s substantive claims against Equico below the amount of the secured debt owed it by Dairyland, there remains no basis for the allow-anee of the $27,032.90 prejudgment interest against Equico, and we set that portion of the judgment aside. However, Equico's May 19, 1975 debt figure should exclude not only the $150,193 but also any interest thereon. We observe that the case has been tried, and briefed and argued on appeal, by all parties on the assumption that the set-off procedure is appropriate (though Equico complains of the details of its implementation) in respect to the substantive claims against Equico and the secured debt owed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1429-10\">.

We reject Equico\u2019s remaining claims of error respecting the Trustee\u2019s suit against it. The submission of interrogatory 7, inquiring if Equico exercised \"the ordinary degree of care,\u201d whether or not proper, was in any event not prejudicial to Equico. No part of the judgment was based on this finding. Equico\u2019s claim that it did not receive a fair trial is refuted by the record, and we reject it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">. We note that the trial court\u2019s judgment in effect gave Newton and Mesker the benefit (respecting the Trustee\u2019s substantive claims) of the setoff allowed Equico for the secured debt owed it by Dairyland; this was doubtless done because the trial court held Newton, Mesker, and Equico all jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the same claims of the Trustee and in order to prevent a double recovery on the part of the Trustee (by both receiving a credit on the secured debt to Equico and a separate judgment against Newton and Mesker). As to the substantive claims of the Trustee for which we have held Newton and Mesker are liable and Equico is not <em>(L&amp;, </em>all such claims except that for the $150,193), however, there appears no reason to make this provision allowing Newton and Mesker an offset for the secured debt owed Equico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-18\">Newton and Mesker do not challenge the judgment in favor of Brazos and against them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">. <em>Carruth v.

The present case is also far removed from the facts considered by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Smart v. Tower Land and Investment Co., </em>597 S.W.2d 333 (Tex.1980). In that case, the Texas Supreme Court considered a promissory note that expressly provided that \"the payees or other holders of this note shall never be obligated to refund any payment of interest or principal after such payment has been made.\" The court found that \"[i]n the absence of a savings clause [the] expressed authorization to retain excess unearned interest overcomes the presumption of legality accorded to allegedly usurious contracts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">. We recognize that the printed savings clause in each deed of trust speaks of limiting the interest to ten percent, while the note states its interest is calculated at twelve percent and this is also reflected in the description of the note contained in each deed of trust. We do not think this requires us to disregard the printed savings clause in preference to the printed acceleration clause in the same instrument. The ten percent printed figure was obviously included simply as part of a form prepared by the local bar association (as appears from the face of the instruments) for general individual use at a time when the maximum legal rate for individuals was, as it had long been, ten percent. <em>See </em>Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5069-1.02 (Vernon 1971). Virtually all lawyers in Texas know the purpose of such a clause. Paraphrasing <em>Walker v. Temple Trust Co., supra, </em>we can say that it is \"obvious\u201d that the appearance of the printed figure \u201c10%\u201d in the savings clause \"was due to the use of a printed form, without an intention that the literal ... [figure in] the form was to\u201d destroy the plain intent of the savings clause to prevent a usurious application of the deed of trust and its acceleration clause. <em>Id. </em>80 S.W.2d at 939. The savings clause can fairly be construed as representing the intent of the parties to limit the interest to the then allowable maximum rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
