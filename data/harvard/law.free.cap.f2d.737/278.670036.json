Leo Glas-ser, J., affirming the determination of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that appellant and her two children were not entitled to Social Security survivors insurance benefits. The district court held that, although appellant\u2019s husband had been absent and not heard from for at least seven years, his death would not be presumed under the applicable regulation because the record supplied a sufficient reason other than death to explain his absence. Appellant argues that the existence of a reasonable explanation other than death for her husband\u2019s absence does not prevent the presumption from arising and that the Secretary did not introduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">For reasons given below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Appellant applied for survivors insurance benefits on behalf of herself and her children in April 1980. Since she did not have direct proof of her husband\u2019s death, she sought to rely on the presumption of death provided by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.721(b). That regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">If you cannot prove the person is dead but evidence of death is needed, we will presume he or she died at a certain time if you give us the following evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">(b) Signed statements by those in a position to know and other records which show that the person has been absent from his or her residence for no apparent reason, and has not been heard from, for at least 7 years. If there is no evidence available that he or she is still alive, we will use as the person\u2019s date of death either the date he or she left home, the date ending the 7 year period, or some other date depending upon what the evidence shows is the most likely date of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">Appellant claimed that her husband disappeared on October 13, 1972, and has not been heard from since.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">After appellant\u2019s application was denied initially and on reconsideration, she received a hearing before the administrative law judge (AU). At that time, she introduced documentary and testimonial evidence as follows: She and her husband were married in 1969. He had held a succession of low paying jobs, yet had been able to support his family comfortably and to buy his wife \u201c[ejxpensive jewelry and ... nice clothes.\u201d Appellant expressed her belief that her husband was involved in \u201csome other type of business that he never told me about\u201d because he spent much more than the income from his low-paying jobs. He would go back to his old neighborhood, East New York, daily to see friends and to attend to \u201cbusiness\u201d, which he refused to discuss with her because he did not want \u201canybody to mess with me\u201d if anything went wrong. He introduced her to some of the people he associated with, who dressed expensively and appeared to her to be \u201cgangster types of people\u201d involved in \u201csome kind of racket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">When her husband left home for the last time on the morning of October 13, 1972, appellant was seven months pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child. Her husband told her he had to see someone to take care of some business and departed with nothing other than the clothes he was wearing. He was last seen when he borrowed his brother-in-law\u2019s car, which was later found abandoned at LaGuardia Airport. He telephoned that evening and told\u2019 appellant he would be home in about an hour. He also asked her what she was doing, and as she described the conversation, \u201cI told him I was painting the ceiling in the bathroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>and he says to get off the ladder ... I might fall, I was pregnant and he didn\u2019t want to chance that.\u201d There was uncontested evidence that her husband loved her and their daughter, was a good family man and was looking forward to the arrival of their second child, who he hoped would be a boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Though somewhat alarmed, appellant did not immediately report her husband missing because occasionally in the past he had unexpectedly left for a day or two, sometimes with the explanation that he was going to a card game. Two days later, appellant\u2019s sister-in-law filed a missing person report with the police. Appellant submitted documents indicating that \u201c[a]ll efforts\u201d by the Missing Persons Bureau of the New York City Police Department had produced no result, that the case was still active, that her husband was not an inmate in a New York State correctional institution and that no earnings had been posted to his Social Security record after 1967, five years prior to his disappearance. In May 1980, appellant made a search of death records, which produced no results. She also provided statements from her husband\u2019s mother, brother, sister, father-in-law and landlord in which each affirmed that he or she had not seen, heard from or heard about her husband since his disappearance and did not know of his whereabouts. For example, his brother stated that \u201c[t]he circumstances [of] his disappearance seem questionable to me, but I\u2019m certain that I would have heard or seen him.\u201d His brother also stated that \u201c[h]e knew people I would not associate with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Appellant expressed her assumption that her husband had been involved with organized crime and suggested the possibility that he had been killed. In a written statement, appellant said that on the same day that her husband was reported missing to the police, she went to the neighborhood in East New York frequented by her husband to search for him and questioned people who knew the two of them. In her words, \u201cThey acted as if they didn\u2019t know my husband [and] me. I persisted in my questioning \u2014 telling them I had been out to dinner [with] them. They finally admitted they knew us. They said they didn\u2019t know where he was. The last they saw of him was on 10/13/72 [and] he had told them he had to go meet someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Appellant also testified, however, that before his disappearance her husband had pled guilty to a gun possession charge, that he was on parole at the time and that he had said \u201che might go away for a long time\u201d but did not tell her any other details of the imminent sentencing. He failed to appear for his sentencing hearing on October 20, one week after his disappearance, and was declared' a fugitive. Appellant\u2019s counsel theorized to the AU that her husband had been killed by the Mafia so that he would not \u201ctalk\u201d to the authorities. The AU rejected this as \u201cinteresting and imaginative [but] in my opinion ... not plausible.\u201d He held that appellant\u2019s husband was a fugitive and thus his absence \u201ccan be reasonably explained without inferring his death, ... notwithstanding its duration.\u201d The presumption of death under the regulation, therefore, did not arise because the absence was \u201cnot unexplained or the result of no apparent reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The AU stated in his decision that he had carefully considered all of the testimony, documents and arguments presented, but he did not discuss the evidence in any detail. On this appeal, the Secretary has marshalled the evidence supporting a finding that the absence of appellant\u2019s husband is explained by his being a fugitive as follows: There were important facts that he did not reveal to his wife, including his having been in prison, the nature of his \u201cbusiness\u201d activities and the source of his money. He was about to be sentenced on a felony charge for which he expected to receive a long prison term. Appellant testified that the call she received on the night he disappeared \u201cin itself was odd since he never called me\u201d and that he had worn jeans that day when he would normally be dressed up. Appellant also stated in one of her written submissions that her husband told her \u201cthat he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything just in case the police came around.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>had a tendency to engage in secretive ways and to lead a double life. The car he borrowed was found at the airport, where people literally take flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The AU held that the presumption did not arise because \u201clogical reasons exist to explain [Mr. Mando\u2019s] absence other tha[n] death.\u201d This decision became the final decision of the Secretary when the Appeals Council denied appellant\u2019s request for review on the same basis. In doing so, the Council stated that the Social Security Administration \u201cdoes not acquiesce\u201d in <em>Johnson v. Califano, </em>607 F.2d 1178, 1182 (6th Cir.1979), a decision relied on by appellant\u2019s attorney, under which appellant would have been entitled to the presumption of death despite the existence of a possible explanation, and the burden of rebutting the presumption would be on the Secretary. As noted earlier, the district court affirmed on the same ground. It also stated in dictum that \u201ca rational explanation that the wage earner was attempting to avoid court process can rebut the presumption of death,\u201d but it held that the presumption was \u201cinapplicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The arguments on appeal have focused on the proper standards for raising and rebutting the presumption of death under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.721(b). The Secretary concedes in her brief to us that five circuit courts have interpreted \u00a7 404.721(b) as not requiring a claimant to prove that no explanation exists for a seven-year absence, but placing the burden on the Secretary to rebut the presumption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under these decisions, to raise the presumption a claimant apparently need show only that the wage earner has been absent and unheard of for at least seven years. See <em>Skelnutt v. Heckler, </em>723 F.2d 1131, 1133 (3d Cir.1983). The Secretary argues, however, that these decisions are incorrect and that under the regulation the claimant must also show that there is \u201cno apparent reason\u201d for the absence. The Secretary cites <em>Blew v. Richardson, </em>484 F.2d 889 (7th Cir.1973), written by then Judge Stevens, and the Secretary\u2019s long-standing administrative interpretation of the regulation as authority for her position. The Secretary and appellant also disagree over the standard for rebutting the presumption, if it is raised. On the view we take of this case, however, we find it unnecessary to resolve for this circuit either the standard for raising or for rebutting the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Assuming arguendo that the standards urged by appellant are correct and thus that she has made an adequate showing to raise the presumption of death, we conclude that the Secretary has offered sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption under the rebuttal standard articulated in <em>Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare v. Meza, </em>368 F.2d 389 (9th Cir.1966), which is urged by appellant: \u201cproof of facts that rationally explain the anomaly of the disappearance in a manner consistent with continued life.\u201d Id. at 392. A rational explanation for the disappearance and absence of appellant\u2019s husband other than death is that he fled to avoid a lengthy prison sentence on the gun possession charge. In addition to his motive to flee, there was other circumstantial evidence of flight, including his unusual dress and phone call on the day of disappearance and the discovery of the borrowed car at the airport. With this evidence, the Secretary met the burden of going forward and thus rebutted the presumption. See <em>Johnson v. Califano, </em>supra, 607 F.2d at 1181-83; <em>Sinatra v. Heckler, </em>566 F.Supp. 1354, 1358-60 (E.D.N.Y.1983) (Weinstein, Ch.J.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The AU and the district court erred, however, in apparently assuming that the case was over once the presumption of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.721(b) was held to be inoperative. We believe that the consequence of rebutting the presumption here \u2014 or failing to successfully invoke it in the first instance \u2014 is simply that it is not in the case. See <em>Sinatra v. Heckler, </em>supra, at 1360 (remand for finding on fact at issue after presumption rebutted); 1 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 300[01], at 300-4 (1982). This leaves appellant with the burden of proving death. Cf. <em>Eisenhauer v. Mathews, </em>535 F.2d 681, 687 (2d Cir.1976). In the more usual case where a claimant seeks to invoke the presumption of death, the claimant has no evidence other than the fact that the wage earner unexpectedly disappeared and has not been heard from for over seven years, let alone affirmative evidence of death. E.g., <em>Autrey v. Harris, </em>639 F.2d 1233 (5th Cir.1981). Indeed, often the only other evidence tends to suggest flight rather than death. <em>Shelnutt v. Heckler, </em>supra. The claimant can only speculate as to how the wage earner might have met an untimely end. E.g., id. The presumption embodies various considerations of policy, fairness and probability, 1 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, supra, \u00b6\u00b6 300[01]-301[03]; see Allen, Presumptions in Civil Actions Reconsidered, 66 Iowa L.Rev. 843, 847 (1981),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and responds to the more. usual situations, where evidence one way or the other is essentially lacking and the decision turns on how the presumption allocates various burdens of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">That is not the situation here. In addition to showing that her husband has been absent for at least seven years without having been heard of, appellant has introduced substantial circumstantial evidence in support of her theory that her husband may have been \u201crubbed out\u201d by his underworld acquaintances. With the presumption out of the case, the AU as factfinder should have weighed the evidence and decided between the competing explanations for the absence of appellant\u2019s husband, specifically whether appellant had shown that it was more probable than not that her husband was killed by his \u201cbusiness\u201d contacts. In doing so, the AU should consider the lengthy absence and the other evidence offered by appellant in support of the probability of \u201cdeath in the light of all the known facts.\u201d See <em>Gardner v. Wilcox, </em>370 F.2d 492, 494-95 (9th Cir.1966). Were we the finders of fact, we would be inclined on this record to find that appellant\u2019s husband was killed, but this is the province of the AU. We, therefore, remand for the AU to perform the fact-finding function.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">On remand, the AU should discuss the evidence and indicate in his decision the basis for reaching his factual conclusion, including an assessment of the credibility of any witnesses. In this regard, the AU\u2019s decision was too sketchy. We also note that the record does not indicate exactly what the charge was on which appellant\u2019s husband faced sentence, after a guilty plea, or what the possible sentence was. It would also be useful to know whether there had been any offer or discussion of cooperation in return for a reduced sentence. Accordingly, the remand is also for the purpose of taking additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded to the district court with a direction that it be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>remanded to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\">. See <em>Autrey v. Harris, </em>639 F.2d 1233 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Edwards v. Califano, </em>619 F.2d 865 (10th Cir.1980); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>607 F.2d 1178 (6th Cir.1979); <em>Aubrey v. Richardson, </em>462 F.2d 782 (3d Cir.1972); and <em>Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare v. Meza, </em>368 F.2d 389 (9th Cir.1966). See also, <em>Shelnutt v. Heckler, </em>723 F.2d 1131 (3d Cir.1983) (applying <em>Aubrey </em>analysis).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-11\">. The Secretary has introduced evidence supporting flight rather than death that goes well beyond mere speculation. On this record, we do not need to decide the threshold showing that would be sufficient to meet the burden of going forward to rebut the presumption. Some of the cases appear to set this rebuttal threshold fairly high, almost to the point of placing, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>effect, a burden of persuasion on the Secretary. E.g., <em>Shelnutt v. Heckler, </em>supra. See 1 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 300[02] at 300-9 to 300-10 (1982); cf. <em>Johnson v. Califano, </em>supra, at 1183-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">. After seven years of unbroken absence and silence, the legal system will proceed as if the person were dead. The policy behind the rule is that it is unfair to require that the affairs of other persons affected by those of the missing person be held in abeyance indeterminately, especially when there is a good chance that the missing person is in fact dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">66 Iowa L.Rev. at 847 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b347-4\">OAKES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AS_\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">I would follow the cases, note 1 majority opinion, which place the burden on the Secretary to rebut the presumption of death arising on a showing of seven years\u2019 unexplained absence. Then I would say that the Secretary failed to produce sufficient evidence \u201cto explain the anomaly of the disappearance,\u201d especially given that at the time of the hearing almost nine (now almost twelve) years had elapsed since Mr. Mando vanished. The man did not take a suitcase with him. Concerned lest his pregnant wife fall off a ladder, he never approached anyone to inquire about her or the children. And when she went to his haunts in East New York their old \u201cfriends\u201d pretended not to know her or to have known him. By far the most likely scenario is that he was thought by his gangster friends to be cooperating with the \u201claw,\u201d in view of his upcoming sentencing, and he was therefore \u201crubbed out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">I do not know what a remand will accomplish other than to prolong this already rather ancient case. I would, therefore, simply reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
