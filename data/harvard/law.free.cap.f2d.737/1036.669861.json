We have now heard that argument and conclude that a certificate of probable cause and stay should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-22\">A certificate of probable cause must issue in a habeas corpus case if the petitioner has made \u201ca \u2018substantial showing of the denial of a federal right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3394, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983) (citations omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>In this case, the record demonstrates that petitioner has made a substantial showing that he was denied his sixth and fourteenth amendments right to the effective assist-anee of counsel at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">The district court, in considering the ha-beas petition yesterday, indicated that it was considerably troubled by petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, especially in view of the fact that the state courts have never held an evidentiary hearing on the claim and the historical facts germane to the claim have never been es-tabhshed. Nonetheless, the district court refused to hold an evidentiary hearing to develop the true factual setting m which this claim must be judged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">A strong argument can be made that one aspect of this claim in particular cannot be resolved without an evidentiary hearing in the district court. This aspect concerns the validity of petitioner\u2019s confessions made in the absence of and without notice to counsel after petitioner was charged with murder and counsel\u2019s failure to argue the point in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"AnK\">jn our view petitioner should have the right to present the merits of this question and the need for an evidentiary hearing to a panel of this court in a regular appeal,</p>\n<p id=\"AH0\">ln granting this certificate of probable cause and stay pending appeal, we intimate n0 view whatever as to the appropriate final disposition on appeal of petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim or of any 0f the other claims he has presented,</p>\n<p id=\"Ahn\">A CERTIFICATE OF PROBABLE CAUSE rg GRANTED; PETITIONER\u2019S EXECUTION IS STAYED PENDING THE DIgPOsiTION OF HIS APPEAL OR UNTIL FURTHER ORDER OF THE COURT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
