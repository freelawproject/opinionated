Jail\u201d or \u201cthe Jail\u201d), brought suit for damages and injunctive relief against four correctional officers at the Jail, the acting Director of the District\u2019s Department of Corrections, the May- or, and the District, alleging deprivation of his constitutional rights redressable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>alleged that on one occasion during his confinement in the D.C. Jail, appellee correctional officers, without provocation, maced, beat, and kicked him; the resulting injuries, Norris alleged, included temporary-blindness, a burning sensation in his face, immediate pain which subsided after several hours, lingering blurred vision, and a bruised and swollen left arm. Pursuant to appellees\u2019 Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 motion, the District Court dismissed Norris\u2019 complaint against the correctional officers on the ground that \u201c[pjlaintiff received medical attention promptly and suffered no permanent injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the District Court erroneously stated and applied the legal standard governing section 1983 liability for prison officer batteries, we reverse its decision granting summary judgment to appellees and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">The events giving rise to appellant\u2019s complaint occurred either in the late evening of January 17, 1982, or in the early morning of January 18. As Norris described the incident, appellee correctional officers were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ari-dedup-0\">mov[ing] me from the dormitory area of [one] eellblock ... to a single cell in the same eellblock. I was following their directions and I was not resisting. As I stepped into the single cell, [one of the appellees] sprayed mace on the right side of my face. At about the same time, the officers grabbed my arms .from behind, handcuffed me, and began punching and kicking me and pushing me so that I banged into things in the cell. After this, they took me to the jail infirmary, where I was examined and treated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqr-dedup-0\">Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Defendants\u2019 Interrogatories, No. 38 (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Response No. \u2014\u201d). Norris recounted that the pain he suffered as an immediate result of the beating subsided \u201cafter several hours.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Response No. 18. The mace spraying, he stated, produced burning in his \u201ceyes, nose, throat and skin,\u201d blinded him \u201cfor about twenty minutes,\u201d and caused continuing \u201cspells of blurred vision.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Response Nos. 11, 12. The residua] effect of the kicking and punching, Norris reported, was a bruise on his left arm. Plaintiff\u2019s Response No. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">Norris\u2019 <em>in propria persona </em>complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages from the correctional officers allegedly involved in his beating. Subsequently, appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel filed an amended complaint alleging, additionally, that the Mayor and the acting Director of the District of Columbia\u2019s Department of Corrections \u201cfail[ed] and neglect[ed] ... adequately to supervise, train, instruct and control correctional officers at the District of Columbia Detention Facility in the performance of their duties [including the use of mace].\u201d Amended Complaint at 3, 4. Supplementing Norris\u2019 initial prayer for relief, the complaint drawn by counsel sought to enjoin appellees from summarily punishing prisoners and to proscribe the issuance of mace to correctional officers at the Jail. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 5. Appellant then sought to discover from appellees, through interrogatories and a request for the production of documents, a description of all training given Jail personnel in the use of mace; all facility rules, regulations, and policies concerning the use of mace; and all complaints and reports related to the use of mace at the Jail. <em>See </em>Letter from St. John Barrett, Attorney for John V. Norris, to E. Huntington Deming, Assistant Corporation Counsel for the District of Columbia (Oct. 29, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>Appellees did not answer Norris\u2019 discovery requests. Instead, they moved to dismiss the amended complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Norris had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, appellees contended, both because the force visited upon him was in response to his refusal to comply peacefully with prison officers\u2019 directions and because \u201cthe alleged assault was of a minor nature resulting in pain for at most several hours and no permanent or significant injury.\u201d .Memorandum in Support of Motion of Defendants to Dismiss Or, In the Alternative, For Summary Judgment, at 2, 4 (\u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d). Further, the suit against the District and its officials must be dismissed, appellees argued, on the bases of <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and of qualified immunity. Motion to Dismiss at 6, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">The District Court, acknowledging its Rule 56(c) obligation to view the facts in a light most favorable to appellant, held that Norris had failed to state a claim for violation of his due process rights. The \u201cpreferable test\u201d for determining the sufficiency of a due process claim based upon prison officer batteries, that Court declared, was \u201cwhether or not the conduct alleged \u2018shocks the conscience\u2019 or is otherwise offensive to the \u2018concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d Memorandum Opinion, Civil Action No. 82-1806, at 3 (D.D.C. Mar. 1, 1983) (\u201cMemorandum Opinion\u201d) (quoting <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 147, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2696, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979) (Blackmun, J., concurring), quoting, in turn, <em>Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 209, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952) and <em>Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937)). Norris had not suffered \u201cpermanent injuries\u201d in the \u201cfracas,\u201d thus indicating that \u201clittle force was actually used,\u201d the District Judge stated. Memorandum Opinion at 3-5. The Court therefore ruled that appellant\u2019s claim did not assume constitutional proportions. Norris\u2019 section 1983 negligent supervision claim against the District and its officials fell along with the underlying due process claim. <em>Id. </em>at 5. The District Court also declined, on the basis of Norris\u2019 isolated allegation of abuse, to consider his plea concerning the use of mace at the Jail. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-11\">The District Court\u2019s holding that permanent injury induced by conduct \u201cshock[ing] the conscience\u201d must be alleged to state a section 1983 claim based on prison officer battery misapprehends the governing law. The leading decision providing instruction for distinguishing a prison officer\u2019s constitutional due process violation from a common law assault and battery is <em>Johnson v. Glick, </em>481 F.2d 1028 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1033, 94 S.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 324 (1973). Judge Friendly there set out the following sensible guidelines, widely adopted by other courts confronting the issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-12\">In determining whether the constitutional line has been crossed, a court must look to such factors as the need for the application of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used, the extent of injury inflicted, and whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvQu\"><em>Id. </em>at 1033. While \u201cthe extent of injury inflicted\u201d is one criterion for determining whether a constitutional violation has occurred, Judge Friendly stated no threshold requirement of \u201cpermanent injuries\u201d for section 1983 liability. <em>See Hodges v. Stanley, </em>712 F.2d 34, 36 (2d Cir.1983) (per cu-riam) (\u201ccomplaint ... alleging] that the use of force was both gratuitous and excessive[,] under <em>Glick, </em>... is enough to withstand dismissal\u201d). Indeed, the plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number><em>Johnson v. Glick </em>alleged no irremediable incapacitation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">We have found no decisions supporting the District Court\u2019s severely restrictive interpretation of deprivations interdicted by the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Many courts have held that a claim is stated under section 1983 based on injuries no more debilitating than those alleged here. <em>See, e.g., Freeman v. Franzen, </em>695 F.2d 485 (7th Cir.1982) (plaintiff kicked and hit many times by several guards; suffered no permanent injuries, but some lingering pain), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 3553, 77 L.Ed.2d 1400 (1983); <em>King v. Blankenship, </em>636 F.2d 70 (4th Cir.1980) (officer slapped plaintiff on head, knocked him down, ripped part of beard from his face, and kicked him); <em>Meredith v. Arizona, </em>523 F.2d 481 (9th Cir.1975) (officer punched plaintiff in solar plexis rendering him \u201ctotally handicapped\u201d momentarily and in need of four hours of oxygen therapy). Indeed, some courts have held macing in the face alone sufficiently severe to state a constitutional claim. <em>See Stringer v. Rowe, </em>616 F.2d 993, 998-1000 (7th Cir.1980) (per curiam); <em>cf. Smith v. Iron County, </em>692 F.2d 685, 686 (10th Cir.1982) (use of mace \u201cconstitute[s] excessive force under most circumstances,\u201d but not those present in this case). In general, courts have indicated that when a prison officer uses force that is \u201cexcessive,\u201d \u201cundue,\u201d or \u201cunjustified,\u201d plaintiff states a constitutional claim regardless of whether an injury of threshold severity and duration is alleged. <em>See, e.g., Putman v. Gerloff </em>639 F.2d 415, 420 (8th Cir.1981); <em>George v. Evans, </em>633 F.2d 413, 416 (5th Cir.1980) (per curiam); <em>Bruce v. Wade, </em>537 F.2d 850, 853 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-11\">The District Court\u2019s \u201cpreferred] test\u201d for gauging constitutional violations apparently rested on <em>Rochin v. California\u2019s </em>\u201cshocks the conscience\u201d standard. <em>See </em>Memorandum Opinion at 3 (quoting <em>Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 209, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952)). We regard <em>Rochin </em>as entirely consistent with <em>Johnson v. Glick\u2019s </em>guidelines for determining constitutional limitations on the use of force by prison officers; so did Judge Friendly\u2014 the author of <em>Johnson </em>\u2014 for in the very same paragraph in which he announced his widely-followed test, he stated that <em>Rochin </em>\u201cpoints the way.\u201d <em>See </em>481 F.2d at 1033. <em>Rochin, </em>and succeeding High Court decisions explicating its meaning,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> all involved criminal defendant challenges to convictions obtained with the aid of arguably unconscionable evidence-gathering tactics. <em>Rochin </em>itself involved a defendant\u2019s successful challenge to a narcotics conviction obtained through the use of evidence retrieved by forcibly \u201cstomach-pumping\u201d the defendant. Thus, <em>Rochin </em>and progeny stand only for the limited principle that government action, even if taken pursuant to legitimate objectives such as evidence gathering, may not proceed via means \u201cthat shock[] the conscience.\u201d <em>See Rochin, </em>342 U.S. at 172, 72 S.Ct. at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-12\">Allegations of unprovoked, brutal beatings by correctional officers implicate a different prime concern. The application of force \u201cmaliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Glick, </em>481 F.2d at 1033, can serve no legitimate governmental objective. Heeding Judge Friendly\u2019s instruction to \u201clook to ... the relationship between the need and the amount of force ... used,\u201d <em>id., </em>courts have implicitly concluded that official force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>directed towards illicit ends may offend the Constitution even though the same amount of force invoked in aid of legitimate official purposes would not. The gratuitous brutalization of prisoners is a proscribed governmental purpose; thus, less force oriented towards that end is needed to shock the judicial conscience than when a valid purpose, <em>e.g., </em>maintaining prison order, is present.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">In accord with numerous other courts, we hold that the amount of force required to state a constitutional claim for prison officer battery varies with the justification for that force.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We also agree with Judge Friendly, however, that minor \u201cpush[es] or shove[s]\u201d in the prison setting, even if completely unprovoked, are not actionable under the Constitution. <em>See </em>481 F.2d at 1033. But Norris has alleged far more: He claims, in essence, that four correctional officers, without cause and for malicious purposes, maced, beat, and kicked him, thereby causing substantial immediate pain as well as lingering ill effects. Such behavior by government officials, if proved, offends the Constitution regardless of whether permanent injuries result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">Because the District Court ruled that Norris had failed to state a constitutional claim against the correctional officers, it also dismissed his dependent negligent supervision claim against the District and its officials. Since we hold that appellant has stated a valid constitutional claim against the individual officers, we must reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the negligent supervision claim as well.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The District Judge also refused to investigate the use of mace at the Jail \u201c[a]bsent allegations of other incidents involving mace or a shocking and offensive use of the substance.\u201d Memorandum Opinion at 6. However, Norris was stymied in his attempt to discover information bearing precisely on that point; the District Court\u2019s March 1, 1983, order granted, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>defendants\u2019 motion to stay discovery. <em>See </em>Order, Civil Action No. 82-1806 (D.D.C. Mar. 1, 1983). Norris should be afforded an opportunity on remand to engage in reasonable discovery directed towards proving his allegations that the District has \u201cfailed adequately to supervise, train, instruct and control correctional officers at the [Jail] in the use of mace.\u201d Amended Complaint at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to reinstate the complaint and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1212-26\">.

Appellees dispute Norris\u2019 assertion that he was peacefully obeying the guards' instructions when beaten. See.Brief for Appellees at 5 n. 7. The District Court made no finding regarding provocation; at this stage of the proceedings, it was not positioned to do so. Cases of allegedly unprovoked attacks by prison guards often produce widely disparate factual accounts, requiring courts to make credibility determinations rarely susceptible to summary judgment. <em>See, e.g., Freeman v. Franzen, </em>695 F.2d 485 (7th Cir.1982), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 3553, 77 L.Ed.2d 1400 (1983); <em>Stringer v.

DOYLE, Senior District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A79\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-13\">I agree the judgment of the district court must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-14\">The interest of persons in the integrity of their bodies is a liberty interest of high order, within the meaning of the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments. The order of this liberty interest is precisely as high among persons accused of crime as among persons unac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>cused of crime. The opinion of the district court implies that, constitutionally speaking, the order of this individual interest among persons accused of crime is to be considered significantly, not to say massively, lower than among persons unac-cused of crime. I write separately to develop the view that recognition of the universality of this individual interest and of the uniformity of its importance among all persons is the key to adjudication of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">Because of ambiguity in the district court opinion as between Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 56 motions, I begin with brief discussion of the amended complaint itself. It alleges explicitly: On January 17, 1982, while plaintiff was confined as a prisoner in the Detention Facility, defendants Green and Frizzell and two unnamed correctional officers sprayed mace in his face, handcuffed him and, while he was handcuffed, kicked him and beat him with their fists, all for the purpose of inflicting summary punishment upon him. As a result of the conduct of the four correctional officers, plaintiff was injured in his person in the amount of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">The amended complaint must be construed liberally to the plaintiff in response to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), and thus to allege, as well, that: On January 17, 1982, plaintiff was being held as a pretrial detainee. The purpose of the defendant correctional officers was to punish plaintiff for the criminal offense stated in the charge on which he was being detained or for some alleged wrongdoing within the Facility in connection with the January 17, 1982 incident or earlier, or for both. No proceeding had been held to determine his guilt or innocence of the underlying criminal charge or of wrongdoing within the Facility, or to determine whether macing and a physical beating would be appropriate punishment if guilt were proved. The physical injury to plaintiff was severe. The infliction of the injury was intentional and deliberate on the part of the defendant correctional officers or was performed with deliberate indifference to the consequences of their acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-10\">When counsel for defendant correctional officers Green and Frizzell moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss this amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, they engaged in frivolity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1217-11\">It is a deprivation of liberty without due process of law to punish a pretrial detainee for the crime alleged in the charge on which she or he is being detained. <em>Bell v.

Although a pretrial detainee is subject to appropriate punishment for violation of otherwise constitutional regulation of conduct within the detention facility, her or his liberty interest requires procedural due process of varying elaborateness, depending upon the severity of the potential punishment, before the punishment is imposed. <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Thus, the amended complaint clearly states a claim against defendants Green and Frizzell under \u00a7 1983 upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-12\">The district court neither granted nor denied the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Rather, it granted defendants\u2019 alternative Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">When counsel for Green and Frizzell elected, alternatively, to move for summary judgment, they knew the factual record in the case as it then stood. On the record as of that time, there was no genuine issue as to the following material facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-5\">As of late evening of January 17, or early morning of January 18, 1982, defendants were employed by and held the offices in the government of the District of Columbia described in the amended complaint. Plaintiff was a pretrial detainee in the Facility. Plaintiff was 37 years of age, was 5 feet 9V2 inches in height, and weighed 145 pounds. Defendants Green and Frizzell and two unnamed correctional officers ordered and escorted plaintiff from a dormitory area in a cellblock to a certain single cell in the same cellblock of the Facility. Plaintiff was following their directions and not resisting. As plaintiff stepped into the single cell, defendant Green sprayed chemical mace on the. right side of plaintiffs face. At about the same time, defendants Green and Frizzell and the other two correctional officers handcuffed plaintiff and began punching and kicking him so that he banged into things in the cell. Plaintiff was pulled from the cell and shoved by defendant Green to the Facility infirmary, where he was taken to a shower to wash the mace from his body, then to a medical examination area, and given Ben-Gay for a bruised swollen left arm. The mace burned plaintiff\u2019s eyes, nose, throat and skin; he was blinded for about 20 minutes and his eyes kept burning for several hours; after the burning stopped, he had spells of blurred vision; as of eleven months later, he had these spells when he read or watched TV, and the spells, were not getting better. The kicking, punching and pushing hurt at the time. They left no bruises other than on plaintiff\u2019s left arm just above the elbow. The pain commenced immediately during the incident and ceased after several hours. Plaintiff was never confined to bed as a result of the injuries. No x-rays were taken. Plaintiff\u2019s health was excellent as of the time of the incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-18\">As against defendants\u2019 Rule 56 motion, these material facts constituted proven facts, as if a trial had occurred. They did not constitute \u201callegations\u201d or \u201cclaims.\u201d They had been testified to by plaintiff, a competent witness, in his verified initial <em>pro se </em>complaint, which serves as an affidavit under Rule 56(e), and in his answers to defendants\u2019 interrogatories. Counsel for defendants disdained to offer factual materials in opposition, in the manner required by Rule 56.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They must have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>aware, also, that even counter-affidavits by competent witnesses, to the effect that plaintiff provoked the use of force and the force was not excessive, would not have entitled defendants to summary judgment, because such allegations would have been at genuine issue by reason of plaintiff\u2019s sworn complaint and answers to interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">Most remarkably, defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was granted. The most sympathetic reading to be afforded the district court\u2019s opinion is that, in its view,' the undisputed facts summarized above supported an inference, beyond genuine issue, of two further factual propositions: (1) there was justification for the use of force; and (2) the force used was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">(1) As to justification, the district court implies provocation by plaintiff. It refers to the incident as a \u201cfracas,\u201d which is defined as a noisy quarrel, brawl, fight or altercation. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1971). There is no evidence whatever of provocation by plaintiff. The uncontradicted evidence is that plaintiff was following directions and not resisting. Also, apparently as justification for the use of force even in the absence of the slightest provocation, the district court refers to the need to prevent escape or other disturbances while moving prisoners from one cell to another. There is no evidence of physical layout or other circumstances bearing on escape or disturbances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">(2) As to non-excessiveness of the force used, assuming justification for some, the district court has inferred that \u201clittle force\u201d was used. It bases this inference on separate findings that there had been a \u201clack of injury\u201d and that plaintiff had \u201csuffered no permanent injuries.\u201d Far from showing beyond genuine issue that there was a lack of injury, the present record shows beyond genuine issue that there was significant injury and \u201cappreciable physical pain,\u201d <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 675, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 1414, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977); while permanence is not shown beyond genuine issue, its absence surely cannot be inferred, beyond genuine issue, from uncontradicted evidence of persistence of spells of blurred vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">A less sympathetic and probably more accurate appraisal of the operative ground for the district court\u2019s decision is that made by the majority of this court: namely, summary judgment was awarded defendants simply because \u201c[pjlaintiff received medical attention promptly and suffered no permanent injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-14\">Although there has been little articulation of its contours, the individual interest in bodily integrity has won high rank among those interests protected by the Constitution of the United States. <em>See, Williams v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 97, 101-104, 71 S.Ct. 576, 579-580, 95 L.Ed. 774 (1951); <em>Screws v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 94, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1032, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945); <em>Jenkins v. Averett, </em>424 F.2d 1228, 1231-1232 (4th Cir.1970); <em>Collum v. Butler, </em>421 F.2d 1257, 1259-1260 (7th Cir.1970). Its constitutionally protected status has become so fixed and familiar as to be reflected in widely used model instructions for juries in federal courts. \u201cThe plaintiff had ... the liberty to be free from unlawful attacks upon the physical integrity of his person____ [Tjhe plaintiff ... had the right under the Federal Constitution not to be deprived of this ... liberty, involving the physical integrity of his person, \u2018without due process of law.\u2019 \u201d 3 Devitt and Blackmar \u00a7 92.11 (3d ed. 1976 &amp; Supp. 1984). <em>See also, </em>II Federal Criminal Jury Instructions of the Seventh Circuit 28 (West 1984).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-17\">In <em>Johnson v. Glick, </em>481 F.2d 1028 (2d Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied sub nom. John v. Johnson, </em>414 U.S. 1033, 94 S.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 324 (1973), upon which the district court here relied heavily, it was held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>this interest in bo.dily integrity is a freestanding liberty interest within the meaning of the due process clause; that is, \u201cquite apart from any \u2018specific\u2019 of the Bill of Rights, application of undue force by law enforcement officers deprives a suspect of liberty without due process of law.\u201d 481 F.2d at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">In the world that lies beyond prisons and jails and as to persons unaccused of crime, it would be bizarre to suggest that the integrity of one\u2019s body enjoys no constitutional protection against deliberate and completely unjustified governmental invasion so long as medical attention is afforded promptly and the injuries prove impermanent. Of course, <em>de minimis </em>applies. Of course, injury beyond <em>de minimis, </em>but minor, may merit only a small sum as damages. But it would be unwise and impractical to attempt to define the perimeter of constitutional protection in terms.of severity of the injury. The effect of such a quantitative severity test may be perceived if one hundred percent is thought to represent the total interest of any member of our society in her or his bodily integrity. Under a quantitative test, such as the district court undertook to apply in the present case, a substantial, deliberate and wholly unjustified diminution of that interest to, say, fifty percent or less could be effected by government without offense to the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">There is a ready and realistic alternative to this bizarre quantitative method of defining the limit of constitutional protection. It is to define the limit in terms of the presence or absence of justification. If there is a complete absence of justification for the application of force, the intentional application of any force, beyond <em>de minim-is, </em>is unconstitutional. Intentional application of that degree of force for which justification exists is constitutional. If the degree of force is unreasonable in response to the justification, the application of the excessive force is unconstitutional. The presence or absence of justification is the test. The degree of severity of the resulting injury is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">If the bulk of the lawsuits seeking to vindicate constitutional protection of bodily integrity had arisen from the world that lies beyond prisons and jails and if they had been brought by persons unaccused of crime, I believe the courts would have readily embraced the viewpoint I have just expressed. I believe judicial resistance has arisen because so frequently it is prisoners who sue to vindicate constitutional protection of their bodily integrity and it is correctional personnel who are the alleged culprits. In <em>Johnson v. Glick, </em>the court seemed discomfited by its recognition of a liberty interest in bodily integrity among pretrial detainees and in the setting of a jail or prison, expressing anxiety about \u201cconsiderable further expansion of actions by state prisoners under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,\u201d observing that prisoners are \u201cnot usually the most gentle or tractable of men and women,\u201d and remarking upon \u201cthe peace of a judge\u2019s chambers\u201d as a distorting factor in the perception of the reality of life in prisons and jails. 481 F.2d at 1030, 1033. Similar intimations dot the opinion of the district court in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">In <em>Johnson </em>this discomfiture with lawsuits by prisoners seems to have ignited an elaborate effort to draw a line between those intentional assaults and batteries by government which violate the constitution and those which violate the common law, but not the constitution. It was not unreasonable for the district court to draw from <em>Johnson v. Glick </em>a suggestion that in prisons and jails, unlike other places, a certain level of intentional and continual official violence, well beyond <em>de minimis, </em>lacking specific justification arising from particular sets of circumstances, is constitutionally acceptable. I understand the <em>Johnson v. Glick </em>concept to be that there is a universe of wrongful invasions of bodily integrity for which courts generally will afford relief to victims. Within that universe, there is a line to be drawn, defining a sector in which the invasions are committed by government. Within this sector of governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>invasions, there is a line to be drawn, defining a sub-sector in which the unlawful governmental invasions violate the constitution. \u201c[I]n determining whether the constitutional line has been crossed,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Glick </em>proposes looking</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARH\">to such factors as the need for the application of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used, the extent of injury inflicted, and whether the force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0a\">481 F.2d at 1033. As the majority opinion notes, these guidelines have been widely adopted by other courts. I do not share the majority\u2019s admiration for them. Taken in context of the discussion surrounding them, they have the potential for the very mischief exemplified in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">I agree that \u201cthe need for the application of force\u201d and \u201cthe relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used\u201d are the tests of the constitutionality of intentional governmental invasions of the bodily integrity of women and men, girls and boys. I agree that \u201cthe extent of injury inflicted\u201d is probative of the amount of force used and that it bears on the sum to be awarded as damages. But, beyond <em>de minimis, </em>it is irrelevant to the issue of constitutionality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s version of the incident is known. From defense counsel\u2019s representations, it is probable that evidence will be offered that plaintiff was resisting a proper transfer from one place of confinement to another within the Facility and Green and Frizzell used only that force necessary to effect the transfer. If, on remand, this defense version is accepted by the fact-finder as the whole truth, a decision on the law should be simple enough. But it is realistic to suppose that some intermediate version may be accepted as true: for example, that plaintiff resisted in some degree, Green and Frizzell responded with force in some degree, and the resulting injury was less than plaintiff alleges but more than defendants concede. Conflicting evidence may need be resolved whether the force applied to plaintiff was excessive and whether Green\u2019s and Frizzell\u2019s purpose was to punish summarily. If some such intermediate version of the facts is accepted as the whole truth, the district court will be in need of better guidance than <em>Johnson v. Glick </em>affords and, I fear, more explicit guidance than is to be found in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">I believe the district court should be instructed explicitly that, absent some immunity, the plaintiff is entitled to prevail against Green and Frizzell, on constitutional grounds, if he proves by a preponderance of the evidence that in the specific circumstances of the particular incident there was no justification for the application of force or if,he proves that in those circumstances some force was justified but the force applied was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">The district court should be instructed explicitly to abandon its effort to require a certain degree of severity of the resulting injury, beyond <em>de minimis, </em>as a condition , to liability of Green and Frizzell under the constitution. It should be instructed explicitly that the importance of the interest of persons in their bodily integrity is uniform, in the eyes of the constitution. Pretrial detainees bleed when pricked. It is true that this uniformity can be honored whether the degree of importance assigned this interest among persons, generally, is high or low. It would be absurd, however, if, to thwart success in constitutional suits by persons accused of crime, a low order of importance was assigned this interest as among persons generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>The just and workable approach is to focus on the justification for the application of force that may arise at a particular time and in a particular setting. Such a focus on the justification for the use of force rather than upon the nature and extent of the resulting injury has been the approach of the American Correctional Association in the promulgation of its Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions (2d ed. 1981),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the American Bar Association in the promulgation of its Standards for Criminal Justice Chapter 23 (Legal Status of Prisoners) (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It has been suggested that justifications may be grouped into: those shared by correctional officers with all persons, such as self-defense; those shared with peace officers acting outside prisons and jails, such as prevention of commission of a crime; and those peculiar to the prison setting, such as regaining control of a part of an institution after an inmate takeover. Gobert &amp; Cohen, Rights of Prisoners 322-324 (1981 and supp.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Depending upon how the facts are found on remand in the present case, it may become of practical importance to explore the presence or absence of justification for the application of force affirmatively to compel compliance with rules and regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 324; A.B.A. Standards, <em>supra, </em>commentary to 23-6.12, p. 23-120. Such applications are uncommon outside prisons and jails, but they occur, for example, and probably justifiably at times, when law enforcement officers must control crowds at parades, athletic events, demonstrations, and so on. The question is not easy. In the initial draft of the A.B.A. Standards, it was provided: \u201cForce should not be used to physically compel compliance with rules or regulations____\u201d Joint Committee on the Legal Status of Prisoners, Tentative Draft of Standards Relating to the Legal Status of Prisoners \u00a7 6.11(b)(iii) (1977). However, this provision was deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">It is difficult to discern whether focus upon justification for the use of force rather than upon severity and duration of resulting physical injury would affect the volume of constitutional lawsuits by persons alleging deprivation of their liberty interest in bodily integrity without due process. Under either focus, complaints could readily survive Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss. It is possible, but far from certain, that if the focus were on the severity and duration of injury, a larger share might be amenable to summary judgment in favor of defendant correctional officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">Obviously, it will be prisoners who will continue to make many such constitutional claims. The reality is that the incidence of direct applications of governmental force is markedly higher in prisons than outside prisons. It is probable that justification for the use of force will be found, properly, more frequently in cases arising in prisons than in those arising elsewhere. \u201cThe relationship of state prisoners and the state officers who supervise their confinement is far more intimate than that of a State and a private citizen.\u201d <em>Preiser v. Rodriquez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 492, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1837, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). \u201cPrison is, after all, the largest power that the state exercises in practice, on a regular basis, over its citizens____\u201d Morris, The Future of Imprisonment 2 (1974). \u201cOpenness\u201d and \u201csupervision by the community\u201d do not mark life within prisons, as the Court has found them to mark life in the public schools. <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 670, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 1412, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977). It is neither surprising nor unwarranted that the courts are required frequently to consider, deliberately and respectfully, allegations that in the prisons the constitutional limit on the power of government has been exceeded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">. Misconduct <em>on </em>the part of four correctional officers was alleged in the complaint, but only Green and Frizzell were identified by name and served. Although there are disturbing passages in the district court\u2019s discussion of its reasons for granting summary judgment to the District of Columbia, Mayor Barry, and Director Holland, I confine this concurring opinion to the grant of summary judgment to Green and Friz-zell.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1217-13\"><em>. </em>The district court's order was accompanied by a memorandum opinion which confirms it was granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, rather than their alternative Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Yet the memorandum opinion states that \"the Court determines that plaintiff has failed to state a claim against the four correctional officers,\u201d \"plaintiff failed to state a claim under the Constitution against the officers involved in the fracas,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>\"plaintiff has failed to present [a claim within the judicial power of the United States] even with all inferences drawn in his favor ____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">Unfortunately, the majority opinion of this court is not expressed in Rule 56 language. It does not isolate the set of material facts of record as to which there is no genuine issue and then review the district court\u2019s determination that those facts entitle defendants to judgment on the merits, as a matter of law. Rather, it indulges frequently in the language of Rule 12(b)(6): \"The preferable test for determining the sufficiency of a due process claim____ The District Court\u2019s holding that permanent injury induced by conduct \u2019shock[ing] the conscience\u2019 must be alleged to state a section 1983 claim____ Many courts have held that a claim is stated under section 1983 based on injuries no more debilitating than those alleged here____ Allegations of unprovoked, brutal beatings by correctional officers implicate____ [W]e hold that the amount of force required to state a constitutional claim for prison officer battery varies____ But Norris has alleged far more: He claims, in essence, that____ Such behavior by government officials, if proven ____ Because the District Court ruled that Norris had failed to state a constitutional claim____ Since we hold that appellant has stated a valid constitutional claim____\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1218-25\">. In a brief filed in the district court, counsel for defendants represented that: \"The plaintiff had requested to be moved to a certain area of the facility, but it was explained to him that no cells were available there.' Plaintiff then simply refused to move to an available cell, became abusive and violent, and resisted efforts to move him. Tear gas and physical force had to be used.\u201d This representation is unsworn and does not show affirmatively that the maker is competent to testify to these matters. Rule 56(e). The district court was bound, as we are, to treat the representation as a nullity!</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">.

The inclusion of good faith, malice, and sadism is thoroughly confusing. They may be factors bearing on some kind of qualified immunity with a subjective component.
