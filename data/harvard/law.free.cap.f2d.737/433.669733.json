Because this court has resolved this issue recently in a criminal appeal, we follow that case and affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Carr\u2019s petition for ha-beas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Carr filed his petition <em>pro se </em>alleging that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of robbery, rape, abduction, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. The matter was referred to a U.S. magistrate, who filed his report on December 6, 1982. The report found no merit to Carr\u2019s claim and recommended denial of relief. The magistrate in his report also notified Carr that written objections to the report could be made within 13 days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No objections were filed within the 13-day period. On December 27, 1982, the district court received a letter from Carr objecting to the report. Carr apparently forwarded to the court a letter he had received from an attorney advising him to object to the magistrate\u2019s report. The district court found the objections untimely, accepted the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations without the <em>de novo </em>determination required for magistrates\u2019 proposed findings and recommendations which are objected to, and dismissed the petition on the merits. Carr now wishes to question, on appeal the merits of the magistrate\u2019s findings which were not objected to within the 13-day period after the magistrate filed his report and which were accepted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">We find the recent opinion in <em>United States v. Schronce, </em>727 F.2d 91 (4th Cir. 1984), dispositive. In <em>Schronce, </em>we held that a criminal defendant was precluded from raising on appeal his claim that evidence seized in a warrantless search should have been suppressed, because he had failed to object to the magistrate\u2019s report which had recommended that his suppression motion be denied. We think that this case and <em>Schronce </em>are indistinguishable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and accordingly hold that Carr is precluded from questioning on appeal the substance of the magistrate\u2019s report, accepted by the district court, because he failed to object to the magistrate\u2019s report in a timely manner in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b498-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\">. Three days were added under FRCP 6(e) for service by mail in addition to the ten days permitted by the statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-12\">. The notice given by the magistrate here said that Carr and the Commonwealth \"may serve ... and file ... objections,\" while the notice in <em>Schronce </em>may have advised the parties they \"had ten days to file written objections.\u201d Assuming this difference of language exists, we think it of no legal consequence, and note that the statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C), uses the words \"[wjithin ten days any party <em>may\" </em>file objections. (Italics added)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-18\">The magistrate \u201cfurther notified\" the parties that \u201cfailure to file timely objections to the findings and recommendations set forth above may result in waiver of right to appeal from a judgment of this court based on such findings and recommendations.\u201d While the right to take an appeal from the final order of a district court, granted by statute, of course cannot be denied by failure to object, the notice given by the magistrate is certainly fair warning of the possible consequences of the failure to object timely. While we do not decide that such a warning is required, if so, it was given in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
