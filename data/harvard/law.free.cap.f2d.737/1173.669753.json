EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1239-14\">This appeal arises from a judgment of the District Court in favor of the defendant in an employment discrimination action brought and prosecuted <em>pro se </em>by appellant Aljoe Poindexter. The appellant\u2019s argument for reversal has been supplemented by the briefing and oral argument of counsel from the Appellate Litigation Clinic of Georgetown University Law Center, appearing as <em>amicus curiae </em>on appeal. The appellant and <em>amicus curiae </em>argue that the District Court erred in failing to grant the appellant\u2019s request for appointment of counsel. Because we cannot discern from this record whether counsel should have been appointed for the appellant we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-20\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-21\">The appellant, a Black male, was hired by the appellee, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), in 1974. On February 27, 1977, he was promoted to a GS-6 position as a coding clerk or \u201creader\u201d in the Automation and Research Section, Identification Division of the FBI. His primary responsibility in this position was to review reports coded by other personnel to insure their accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-22\">The undisputed facts indicate that the appellant\u2019s work record in the Automation and Research Section was at best adequate. In each of four annual evaluations between October 1976 and September 1980, the appellant\u2019s performance was rated \u201csatisfactory.\u201d Joint Stipulation of Material Facts No Longer in Dispute (\u201cJoint Stipulation\u201d) at 1-3, <em>reprinted in Amicus Curiae </em>Appendix (\u201cApp.\u201d), at 74-76. During this period, the appellant received a number of \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d monthly ratings and was censured on two occasions for having an excessive number of such ratings during a twelve-month period. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-23\">On February 27, 1980, the appellant filed a formal Equal Employment Opportunity complaint with the Department of Justice, alleging that the FBI discriminated against Black GS-6 coding clerks in assignments and promotions. The record does not indicate the disposition of this complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>The undisputed facts also indicate that during his six years of employment with the FBI prior to the filing of his administrative complaint, the appellant had never been absent without leave or suspended. Joint Stipulation at 4, App. 77. However, on April 14, 1980 \u2014 less than two months after filing the administrative complaint\u2014 he was charged with fifteen minutes of unauthorized absence\u2019 without leave (\u201cAWOL\u201d) on April 9 for being in the ap-pellee\u2019s cafeteria when he was due at his work station. <em>Id. </em>at 2, App. 75. On September 26, 1980, the appellant was charged with 30 minutes AWOL on September 12, 1980 for leaving work early. <em>Id. </em>On January 22, 1981, the appellant was \u201ccensured, placed on probation for 60 days, and suspended for three days pursuant to his third AWOL within a twelve-month period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, App. 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">The appellant filed a second administrative complaint on February 6, 1981, alleging acts of reprisal by the FBI following the filing of the first complaint. The administrative disposition of this claim also does not appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">On May 1, 1981, the appellant filed a complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981), charging the FBI with race and sex discrimination in making promotions, and acts of reprisal and harassment. On May 29, 1981, the Department of Justice notified the appellant of his right to apply for appointment of counsel pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) (1976). The appellant apparently made this application in an unfiled letter to the court dated July 28, 1981.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-11\">As the only significant issue on appeal concerns the trial court\u2019s treatment of the appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, we will discuss the facts relevant to this issue at some length. In doing so, we are constrained by the incompleteness of the record. Although there is some indication that at one point the trial court did attempt to appoint counsel for the appellant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the record does not indicate the basis for this appointment or even whether the appointment preceded or followed the appellant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">The earliest transcribed record of the District Court proceeding is a September 17, 1981 status call. According to this record, the attorney \u201coriginally appointed\u201d by the court had, at the time of his appointment, indicated his unwillingness to represent the appellant. Transcript of September 17, 1981 Status Call at 3 (Sept. 17, 1981), <em>reprinted in </em>App. 25. Following this attorney\u2019s withdrawal, the trial judge apparently attempted to find a new attorney to represent the appellant. These efforts were unsuccessful because several attorneys who had been contacted \u201cindicated that they could not take a case without doing great hardship to their present schedules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, App. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>The District Court judge then arranged the September 17 status call, and informed the appellant: \u201cI have been unable to find anyone to represent you, and I wanted to call you in together with [the appellee\u2019s attorney] ... to suggest to you several routes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, App. 25. The court first suggested clinical programs and legal services, and then described options available if the appellant believed he could pay for counsel. <em>Id. </em>The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-5\">THE COURT: I have asked several attorneys that I know who handle EEO cases, and all of them have indicated to me that their schedules or calendars are such that they cannot take on another case. So that\u2019s where I stand in my efforts to try to find someone to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-6\">So I will be happy to hear anything you might wish to suggest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-7\">Do you believe that you can afford to pay counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-8\">MR. POINDEXTER: I think I could manage, providing I can keep my job. THE COURT: Well, of course, that\u2019s something the court cannot control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-9\">MR. POINDEXTER: Oh, I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-10\">THE COURT: You see, I can\u2019t control that. Certainly not today I can\u2019t control it. You apparently indicated to one of my clerks that you have attempted to get counsel too, but have been unsuccessful. MR. POINDEXTER: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-11\">THE COURT: Would you mind \u2014 you don\u2019t have to \u2014 but would you mind stating why you have been unable to? Has it been financial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-12\">MR. POINDEXTER: No, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-13\">THE COURT: It has not been financial? MR. POINDEXTER: No. I have had, including the attorney that was here last time we was here, he is the third, the one to refuse materials I have, and said he didn\u2019t want to mess with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 4-5, App. 26-27. Following this discussion, the court outlined at great length the steps the appellant might take to secure counsel. At the conclusion of the status call the District Court judge explained to the appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-16\">... I have, as I said, done my very best, and those lawyers that you know have all said that their schedules just don\u2019t permit, just won\u2019t permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-17\">This is the type of case that requires a lot of work, and a lot of time, and concentrated effort, and I can understand if an attorney says, \u201cwell, my calendar is just too full for me to take something at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-18\">That\u2019s what has happened in this regard ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-19\">.... At any rate, those are the only things I can suggest to you at this time, Mr. Poindexter, and I hope you will be successful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 12-13, App. 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-21\">The appellant did tell the court that he could afford counsel, <em>but only providing that he could keep his job. </em>This qualification is significant because, at the time of the September 17 hearing, there was substantial reason to believe that the appellant\u2019s future in. his job was precarious. In a motion two months earlier to enjoin the appellee from taking administrative action against him, the appellant warned the court \u25a0that he was being subjected to acts of reprisal and claimed that recent events suggested that he might be dismissed. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion For Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (July 8, 1981). In a motion submitted the day before the September 17 status call, the appellant informed the court that he was in the process of being dismissed. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion For Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction at 2 (Sept. 16, 1981), <em>reprinted in </em>App. 89. This latter motion was discussed at the September 17 status call, at which time the appellee\u2019s counsel told the court that \u201cthe agency has recommended that [the appellant] be dismissed.\u201d Transcript of September 17, 1981 Status Call at 8 (Sept. 17, 1981), <em>reprinted in </em>App. 30. After the appellee added that \u201che is not about to be dismissed imminently,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court scheduled a hearing on the motion for September 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>On September 21, the appellee filed a brief, opposing the appellant\u2019s motion for equitable relief. This brief again informed the court that the appellee had recommended the appellant\u2019s dismissal and that the appellant already had been suspended for ten days. It also stated that, on September 14, \u201cplaintiff was presented with a letter from the agency advising him that strong consideration was being given to dismissing him.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion For Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction at 2 (Sept. 21, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">The September 24 hearing was cancelled at the appellant\u2019s request so that he could continue to search for an attorney. Transcript of November 20, 1981 Status Call at 2 (Nov. 20, 1981), <em>reprinted in </em>App. 38. On that same day, the appellant was dismissed from his job. The record does not indicate that the court was informed of the appellant\u2019s dismissal at that time, or that the appellant reiterated his request for appointment of an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">The parties returned to the court for a status call on November 20, 1981. At this proceeding, the appellant informed the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-6\">I am still in process of looking [for an attorney]. I have met with Mr. David Lang\u2019s assistant on several occasions, and he and I have been in the process of contacting quite a few people. But it has been to no avail, and I was dismissed on the 24th of September.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-7\">And most attorneys are hesitant about taking on a client that is not employed, so I have applied for my unemployment. And I also applied for my retirement fund, and it will be eight weeks today, and I haven\u2019t received any unemployment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-8\">... So my hands have just more or less been tied as far as trying to come up with an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 2-3, App. 38-39.- The ensuing discussion focused on what the next step in the litigation should be. After determining that the plaintiff\u2019s motion for equitable relief had been mooted by the dismissal but that the remaining claims were still actionable, the court told the plaintiff that \u201cthe only problem is, Mr. Poindexter, we have just got to move forward. Are you willing to move forward on your own?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, App. 40-41. The appellant replied: \u201cI certainly am. It seems like that\u2019s the only thing I can do, is move forward on my own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, App. 41. The court then instructed that discovery should commence and could continue until February 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">The record indicates little about the period from November 20, 1981 through January 5, 1982. It appears that no discovery was undertaken and it is clear that the appellant did not secure counsel. In subsequent filings and proceedings the appellant claimed that he was unemployed and could not even afford to take a deposition. Transcript of March 2, 1982 Status Call at 2, 5 (March 2, 1982), <em>reprinted in </em>App. 46, 49; Plaintiff\u2019s Motion For Enlargement of Time in Which to Conduct Discovery (Feb. 10, 1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">On January 5, the appellant received 13 unemployment compensation checks for the amount of $196 each. App. 129. He consulted an attorney three days later, and on January 20, 1982 signed a fee agreement with her. The appellant agreed to pay a $1300 retainer, and, pursuant to that agreement, paid a first installment of $800. App. 130-32 (copy of fee agreement). One week later, the attorney returned the retainer and withdrew her representation allegedly because she had insufficient time to prepare for discovery. Transcript of March 2, 1982 Status Call at 4 (statement of Aljoe Poindexter), App. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-13\">Finding himself once again without counsel, the appellant moved for an extension of time for discovery. After this motion was denied, the appellant repeated the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>on February 10, 1982. The appellant reminded the court that he had been unemployed when discovery commenced and that the receipt of his unemployment compensation checks had been delayed. He concluded that he had \u201cfound it virtually impossible to conduct Discovery from November 20, 1981 to January 6, 1982 because of financial reasons and a trip to his hometown.\u201d Plaintiffs Motion For Enlargement of Time in Which to Conduct Discovery at 2 (Feb. 10, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">The appellant\u2019s motion was considered at a status call on March 2, 1982. After the plaintiff explained his financial problems and the court made inquiries about pro-' posed discovery, the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-6\">THE COURT: Now let me say something to you very clearly, Mr. Poindexter, about depositions. I don\u2019t think any depositions will be as inexpensive as $150. All right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-7\">MR. POINDEXTER: Well, I am prepared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-8\">THE COURT: Well, you know, you came in here with that statement, and I just wanted you to know that I think that\u2019s an unreasonable estimate for deposition. It is very likely ... that each deposition could run anywhere from $300 up. I just want you to understand that. All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AII\">Transcript of March 2, 1982 Status Call at 9-10, App. 53-54. The court then granted the motion for an extension of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">During the discovery period that followed this status call, and at trial, the appellant pursued his claims without counsel. The case was tried from the bench, with the District Court judge ultimately entering judgment in favor of the appellee. The court held that the appellee\u2019s decision not to promote or reassign the appellant was explained by the appellant\u2019s inadequate job performance, and indicated that race was not a factor in this decision. <em>Po-indexter, </em>No. 81-1038, mem. op. at 9, <em>reprinted in </em>App. 71. The court also concluded that the appellant had failed to prove reprisal by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>The appellant now seeks review of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">The appellant\u2019s argument on appeal is that the lower court erred in failing to appoint counsel pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) (1976).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The relevant language in this provision is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-14\">Upon application by the complainant and in such circumstances as the court may deem just, the court may appoint an attorney for such complainant and may authorize the commencement of the action without the payment of fees, costs, or security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-15\"><em>Id. </em>While the provision gives plaintiffs a right to request representation, <em>Hilliard v. Volcker, </em>659 F.2d 1125, 1129 &amp; n. 26 (D.C.Cir.1981), it does not create a statutory right to have counsel actually appointed. <em>E.g., Jenkins v. Chemical Bank, </em>721 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir.1983). The decision to appoint rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>E.g., id.; Ivey v. Board of Regents, </em>673 F.2d 266, 269 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Caston v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>556 F.2d 1305, 1308 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-16\">The statute\u2019s stipulation that requests for appointment be granted \u201cin such circumstances as the court may deem just\u201d offers little direction to lower courts confronted with such requests. Many of our sister Circuits have attempted to fill this void by articulating standards to guide lower courts in the exercise of their discretion. <em>E.g., Jenkins, </em>721 F.2d at 880; <em>Bradshaw v. Zoological Society, </em>662 F.2d 1301, 1318 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Caston, </em>556 F.2d at 1309-10; <em>cf. Nelson v. Redfield Lithograph Printing, </em>728 F.2d 1003 at 1004 (8th Cir.1984) (articulating test for appointment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) (1982) in a Title VII <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>case). In so doing, these courts have paid heed to the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that \u201csuch discretionary choices are not left to a court\u2019s \u2018inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 416, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2371, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975) (quoting <em>United States v. Burr, </em>25 F.Cas. 30, 35 (C.C.D.Va.1807) (No. 14,692) (Marshall, C.J.)). Such efforts to insure that requests for appointment are resolved in a principled and consistent manner are particularly essential in cases of the sort before us, for \u201c[t]he decision to deny the assistance of an appointed attorney to a layman unschooled in the law in an area as complicated as the civil rights field\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> frequently leaves the plaintiff with little hope of successfully prosecuting a claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">This court has not heretofore stated the test for adjudicating requests for appointment of counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We do so here because it is necessary for the disposition of this case, and to eliminate uncertainties concerning the law of this Circuit. Our analysis begins with a discussion of the assumptions and goals that underlay Congress\u2019 passage of the attorney appointment provision. This discussion both informs our ensuing delineation of the standards governing requests for appointment and offers general guidance to trial courts exercising the substantial discretion afforded by the statute. We then explain the approach that should be followed in acting on requests for appointment and indicate the range of a trial court\u2019s discretion. In identifying the applicable standards, we have been guided both by the structure and history of Title VII (and the appointment provision in particular), and by the substantial body of case law discussing requests for appointment of counsel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Next, we apply this approach to the case before us and conclude that this case should be remanded for further consideration by the District Court. Finally, because of the unique posture of this litigation, we delineate the procedures that are to be followed by the court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">Although courts have acted on requests for appointment of counsel in numerous Title VII cases, they often have done so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>with surprisingly little discussion of the congressional judgments that underlie the attorney appointment provision. Some of these cases appear to indulge in speculation regarding the utility of judicial appointment of attorneys, almost without regard to congressional preferences on the subject. Thus, several district court opinions may be found to suggest that if plaintiffs cannot secure representation, at least on a contingency fee basis, their claims most likely border on the frivolous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To adherents of this view, the private bar plays an essential role in filtering out meritless cases, and courts would be wise not to override this function by appointing counsel where none can otherwise be secured.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An alternative view reflected in the ease law is that the discretion of the private bar is not an entirely satisfactory means to decide which cases merit the attention of the judiciary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These decisions have recognized that, because it is often difficult to prove discrimination,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and because financial risks will be incurred by attorneys representing indigent clients, one cannot assume that only meritless cases will be filtered out.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Advocates of this second view might conclude that judicial appointment of attorneys in some cases is essential because of both the individual\u2019s and society\u2019s interest in vindicating the right to pursue a livelihood free from discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">We need not express an opinion as to which of these descriptions better comports with reality, or reflects wiser social policy, for our choice has been dictated by Congress. In the words of the Fifth Circuit: \u201cThe clear thrust of the appointment power was to enlist the aid of the district courts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>finding lawyers who would take such cases____\u201d <em>White v. United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., </em>646 F.2d 203, 206 (5th Cir.1981). Indeed, the very fact that the appointment provision was passed reveals that Congress intended courts to play a role in securing counsel for Title VII claimants. As the Ninth Circuit has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"av8-dedup-0\">The only plausible reason for enactment of the provision was Congress\u2019 recognition that some civil rights claimants with meritorious cases would be unable to obtain counsel. The district court\u2019s reasoning would render the statutory provision for appointment of counsel nugatory; the provision for appointment of counsel would be wholly unnecessary if all meritorious claims attracted retained counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agk-dedup-0\"><em>Bradshaw v. Zoological Society, </em>662 F.2d 1301, 1319 (9th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Congress\u2019 belief in the utility of judicial appointment of counsel in Title VII cases is further evidenced by its specific inclusion of such authorization in the Civil Rights Act, when Congress could simply have left plaintiffs to rely on the authority created by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) (1982).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Jenkins v. Chemical Bank, </em>721 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir.1983) (\u201cViewed against the background of the general authorization to courts to request counsel to represent civil litigants, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) (1982), [the attorney appointment provision in the Civil Rights Act of 1964] suggests a special congressional concern with legal representation in Title VII cases.\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>Flowers v.

Volcker, </em>659 F.2d 1125, 1128 n. 24 (D.C.Cir.1981). Senator Humphrey explained that the provision was necessary \u201c[s]ince it is recognized that the maintenance of a suit may impose a great burden on a poor individual complainant.\u201d 110 Cong.Rec. 12,722 (1964). The Senate soundly rejected an amendment to the proposed Act that would have deleted the courts\u2019 authority to appoint attorneys in employment discrimination suits, 110 Cong.Rec. 14,196 (1964), and an amendment that would have specified that a court could not appoint an attorney without the consent of the attorney. 110 Cong.Rec. 14,201 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">Congress\u2019 belief in the importance of attorney appointment in appropriate cases is also apparent in the legislative history of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. Although \u201cCongress amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 extensively, [it] retained the appointment provision in its original language.\u201d <em>Hilliard, </em>659 F.2d at 1128 n. 24. The House Report observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>By including this provision in'the bill, the committee emphasizes that the nature of Title VII actions more often than not pits parties of unequal strength and resources against each other. The complainant, who is usually a member of a disadvantaged class, is opposed by an employer who not infrequently is one of the nation\u2019s major producers, and who has at his disposal a vast array of resources and legal talent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">H.R.Rep. No. 238, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1971), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, 2137, 2148. The Senate\u2019s debate reflects a similar view. After an amendment denying the EEOC the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders inadvertently removed federal employees from the scope of the attorney appointment provision, an amendment remedying this omission was passed in the Senate by \u00e1 voice vote. 118 Cong.Rec. 956 (1972). In arguing that the attorney appointment provision should cover federal employees, Senator Javits emphasized that this</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-6\">is a very important right for the individual ... for the individuals involved are not, in the main, high salaried, in that those who would be likely to sue in these equal employment opportunity cases are fairly modest people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-7\">...

Javits).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">It is thus clear that Title VII\u2019s provision for attorney appointment was not included simply as an afterthought; it is an important part of Title VII\u2019s remedial scheme, and therefore courts have an obligation to consider requests for appointment with care. In acting on such requests, courts must remain mindful that appointment of an attorney may be essential for a plaintiff to fulfill \u201cthe role of \u2018a private attorney general,\u2019 vindicating a policy \u2018of the highest priority.\u2019 \u201d <em>New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 63, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 2030, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980). <em>See also EEOC v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., </em>449 U.S. 590, 602, 101 S.Ct. 817, 824, 66 L.Ed.2d 762 (1981) (private right of action is \u201cimportant part of Title VU\u2019s scheme of enforcement\u201d); <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 418, 98 S.Ct. 694, 699, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (plaintiff is \u201cthe chosen instrument of Congress\u201d to remedy employment discrimination); <em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 45, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1018, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974) (same); <em>Miller v. Staats, </em>706 F.2d 336, 340 (D.C.Cir.1983) (same). <em>See generally Coles v. Penny, </em>531 F.2d 609, 615 (D.C.Cir.1976) (\u201cTitle YII is remedial in character and should be liberally construed to achieve its purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-13\">At the same time, it does not appear that Congress sought to ensure appointment of counsel as a matter of course. To the contrary, the statutory language expressly leaves this decision to the discretion of the trial court. Moreover, the legislative history clearly indicates that Congress\u2019 overriding concerns were the hardship that litigation costs would impose on indigent plaintiffs and the need to minimize the impact of resource imbalances between plaintiffs and defendants on the outcome of Title VII litigation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These concerns are, of course, implicated most seriously when a plaintiff cannot afford to hire counsel. For if plaintiffs are capable of securing counsel on their own, they can accomplish the end sought by judicial appointment of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>without the necessity of judicial involvement with the legal services market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">With the foregoing principles in mind, we turn to the specific approach that should be followed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) pursuant to a request for appointment of counsel. In <em>Hilliard, </em>we rejected the suggestion that courts have a duty to appoint attorneys <em>sua sponte. Hilliard v. Volcker, </em>659 F.2d 1125, 1127-28 (D.C.Cir.1981). We adhere to that view and note initially that the court\u2019s obligation to consider appointment is triggered only if the plaintiff makes a clear request for invocation of the attorney appointment power. <em>See id. </em>at 1128 (\u201cTitle VII imposes a duty on the court to consider an appointment of counsel for a complainant but only upon his application ____\u201d) (footnote omitted); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) (1976) (\u201cUpon application by the complainant ... the court may appoint an attorney\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">Once the plaintiff has triggered the attorney appointment provision, \u201ccourts must give serious consideration\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s request. <em>Jenkins v. Chemical Bank, </em>721 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir.1983). <em>See also Hilliard, </em>659 F.2d at 1128. To facilitate this consideration, the court should provide some guidance to the plaintiff regarding the factors that it may consider in acting on the motion and the showing that will be expected of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The goal, of course, is to make a sound determination as to whether appointment is appropriate. Achievement of this goal is most likely if the relevant information is before the court.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-12\">The trial court\u2019s decision on the request will be overturned only for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, we reiterate that \u201csuch discretionary choices are not left to a court\u2019s \u2018inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 416, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2371, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975) (quoting <em>United States v. Burr, </em>25 F.Cas. 30, 35 (C.C.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>Va.1807) (No. 14,692) (Marshall, C.J.)).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Furthermore, in exercising this discretion, the court should clearly indicate its disposition of the request for appointment and its basis for that disposition.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">The \u201clegal principles\u201d that are relevant to the lower court\u2019s exercise of discretion have been articulated with substantial uniformity by the courts of appeals. Based on the analysis in these cases, and the history and purpose of Title VII and the appointment provision, we believe a. court ought to consider the following factors: (1) the ability of the plaintiff to afford an attorney; (2) the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s case; (3) the efforts of the plaintiff to secure counsel; and (4) the capacity of the plaintiff to present the case adequately without aid of counsel.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> While these factors ordinarily should be considered by the trial court,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> this list is not necessarily ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>elusive. <em>See, e.g., Jenkins v. Chemical Bank, </em>721 F.2d 876, 880 (2d Cir.1983). If the particular facts of a case warrant consideration of additional factors, a court may do so as long \u201cas they are treated in a manner consistent with the policy of the statutory provision.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Zoological Society, </em>662 F.2d 1301, 1318 n. 48 (9th Cir.1981):</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\"><em>The first factor, i.e., </em>plaintiffs ability to afford counsel, normally should serve as the starting point in the trial court\u2019s analysis, largely because the appointment provision is primarily intended to protect plaintiffs with limited economic means. In evaluating the plaintiff\u2019s ability to afford counsel, a court should not insist that a plaintiff be destitute,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> nor should it demand as substantial a showing as that required to proceed <em>in forma </em>pauperis.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Given Congress\u2019 concern about the financial burden resulting from attorneys\u2019 fees, appointment surely should not be refused because of a plaintiff\u2019s income or assets if payment of fees would jeopardize the plaintiff\u2019s ability to maintain the necessities of life.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-10\">If a court finds that a plaintiff <em>can </em>afford to hire counsel, this ordinarily will be a dispositive ground for denying the request for appointment. However, it is at least <em>conceivable </em>that even a plaintiff capable of paying an attorney, and asserting a meritorious claim, will be unable to secure representation.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> If the plaintiff alleges as much, the remedial purposes of Title VII may compel the appointment of counsel. However, before doing so, a court would be wise to look with particular care at both the merits of the case and the diligence of the plaintiff\u2019s search for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-11\"><em>The second factor </em>that a court should consider is the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s case. If a suit has very little prospect of success, the benefit that attorney appointment provides the plaintiff may be offset by the burden of litigation on the judiciary and the defendant, as well as on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>the appointed attorney.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> At the same time, the absence of an attorney for the plaintiff may make it difficult for the court to evaluate the merits of the plaintiffs claim in deciding whether appointment is appropriate. The balancing of these considerations is problematic. Finding no satisfactory guidance in the case law or in the language and history of the appointment provision, we will not attempt to articulate a standard that greatly circumscribes the trial court\u2019s discretion. We will, however, indicate at least the range within which the court\u2019s discretion should be exercised: if the plaintiff\u2019s claim appears to be patently frivolous, appointment should be refused;<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> if, on the other hand, the plaintiff appears to have some chance of prevailing, then appointment should not be refused for want of a meritorious claim.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-11\">In determining the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the trial court should consider the information before it and, if necessary, make further inquiries of the parties.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Often the district court will have before it the EEOC\u2019s determination of whether the plaintiff's claim is reasonable. If the EEOC has found that there was reasonable cause to believe that plaintiff was the victim of discrimination, this finding establishes a strong but rebuttable presumption that the plaintiff\u2019s case has sufficient merit to justify appointment of counsel.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> However, \u201can EEOC determination that no reasonable cause supports the plaintiff\u2019s claim should be approached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>somewhat differently, for the reason that the plaintiff will be without the aid of counsel in challenging the agency\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Zoological Society, </em>662 F.2d 1301, 1309 n. 20 (9th Cir.1981). Such a determination, standing alone, is not a sufficient basis for denying appointment of counsel. <em>Neal v. IAM Local Lodge 2386, </em>722 F.2d 247, 250 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Jenkins v. Chemical Bank, </em>721 F.2d 876, 880 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Jones v. WFYR Radio/RKO General, </em>626 F.2d 576, 577 (7th Cir.1980) (per curiam), <em>overruled on other grounds, Randle v. Victor Welding Supply Co., </em>664 F.2d 1064 (7th Cir.1981); <em>Caston, </em>556 F.2d at 1308; <em>Harris v. Walgreen\u2019s Distribution Center, </em>456 F.2d 588, 590 (6th Cir.1972). However, \u201ca finding that the EEOC determination is <em>supported by substantial evidence </em>in the investigative file <em>and </em>that plaintiff\u2019s objections thereto are <em>patently frivolous </em>would weigh heavily in the scales against appointing an attorney.\u201d <em>Caston, </em>556 F.2d at 1309 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\"><em>The third factor </em>to be considered is the plaintiff\u2019s diligence in searching for counsel.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> While the plaintiff\u2019s showing of diligence requires more than \u201cpassfing] the matter over with ... casual comment,\u201d <em>Arnold v. Speedgrip Chuck, Inc., </em>524 F.Supp. 679, 682 (N.D.Ind.1981), the plaintiff need not \u201cexhaust the legal directory before- a court could appoint him an attorney.\u201d <em>Caston, </em>556 F.2d at 1309. In each case, the question is whether the plaintiff has made \u201cwhat can be considered \u00e1 reasonably diligent effort under the circumstances to obtain counsel.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>662 F.2d at 1319.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The court might consider \u201cthe availability of counsel in its geographical area and the plaintiff\u2019s possible skill or lack of skill at obtaining such help[,] the number of contacts with potential counsel,\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>721 F.2d at 880, as well as other factors relevant to the burden that a more exhaustive search would impose on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">Finally, a court ought to consider the plaintiff\u2019s ability to present the case adequately. As a general matter, it should be recognized that plaintiffs usually will be seriously disadvantaged if they must proceed <em>pro se </em>and, therefore, trial courts should be aware that refusing to appoint counsel may be tantamount to denying them a day in court.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> However, cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>may arise in which the plaintiff\u2019s background and demonstrated skills suggest that appointment of counsel is unnecessary.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> These considerations are certainly pertinent to the court\u2019s disposition of the request for appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Also relevant to this analysis is the degree to which lawyering skills will be required in any particular case. For example, if a case \u25a0 will involve conflicting or complex testimony,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> or difficult legal issues,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> representation by counsel may be' essential. On the other hand, appointment may be inappropriate \u201cwhere the factual issues are uncomplicated or insubstantial\u201d and the law is \u201cso clearly settled that appointment would serve no purpose.\u201d <em>Maclin v. Freake, </em>650 F.2d 885, 888-89 (7th Cir.1981) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">In discussing the preceding four factors at some length, we have attempted to guide the district courts\u2019 exercise of discretion and to indicate the outer limits of that discretion. These limits leave district courts with substantial latitude in evaluating each factor and determining the relative weight of the factors. By clearly explicating the boundaries of this discretion, we mean to insure that the trial level is where the decision to appoint will be made.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We also mean to highlight the significance of the attorney appointment provision in Title VII so that trial judges will give proper attention to requests for appointment.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-14\">We turn now to the facts of the case before us. In considering these facts it should be recognized at the outset that the trial judge considered the appellant\u2019s request for appointment without the benefit of clearly prescribed standards in this Circuit. In our view, the District Court\u2019s pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>ceedings reflect both sensitivity to the problems of a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff and the trial judge\u2019s diligent efforts to secure counsel for the appellant. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the court\u2019s treatment of the appellant\u2019s motion deviates from the standards we articulate today in important respects. Because these departures may have prejudiced the appellant\u2019s right to request counsel, this case must be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">The record reveals that the court originally did appoint counsel for the appellant. We do not know its basis for doing so or whether any showing was required of the appellant. The appointed attorney then withdrew from the case and the court made further efforts to secure counsel for the appellant. On September 17, 1981, after its efforts proved unavailing, the court convened the parties, apparently to discuss further steps that the appellant might take to find counsel. The court did not expressly deny the appellant\u2019s motion for appointment or indicate its reasons for doing so. The court\u2019s discussion did, however, clearly imply that the additional steps needed to secure counsel were to be undertaken by the appellant. Nothing in the record suggests that the court attempted to secure counsel, or considered appointment, after the September 17 status call.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">On this record, no meaningful judgments can be made by this court about whether counsel should have been appointed. Certainly nothing in the record at the time counsel was requested permits an adequate evaluation of three of the four factors we have enumerated: the merits of the case, the diligence of the appellant\u2019s search for counsel, and the capacity of the appellant to present the case adequately. The record also contains no information relating to the appellant's assets, expenses or liabilities. Although it does suggest that the appellant could afford counsel <em>prior to his dismissal </em>on September 24, it also suggests that he could not afford counsel for a significant period after his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-8\">The lower court\u2019s decision cannot be sustained solely on the basis of our assumptions about appellant\u2019s income prior to September 24. For even if appointment should have been denied prior to that date, the appellant might have again moved for appointment following his dismissal.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Hence, the failure to appoint counsel can only be sustained on this record if we conclude that the appellant\u2019s failure to repeat his motion should cause us to disregard the possibility that appointment might have been appropriate as of September 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-9\">On the facts of this case, insisting on such action by the appellant would be unjust and inconsistent with the remedial purposes of Title VIL As a procedural matter, we have grave doubts about the proposition that a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff should be required to repeat an earlier motion, especially when the court has not formally decided the earlier motion. Had the court explicitly decided the motion here, it could easily have explained to the appellant the reasons for its decision and his right to renew his request if circumstances changed. Instead, since the court simply indicated that it had done its best, the appellant might reasonably have concluded that any further requests for appointment would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">Additionally, it appears from the record here that the court had reasons to know of the changes in the appellant\u2019s financial position. As we have delineated, all parties, including the trial judge, understood the precariousness of the appellant\u2019s continued employment. Moreover, the appellant expressly reported his dismissal, and subsequent inability to find counsel, at the November 20 status call.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-11\">In a perfect world, the trial judge might have given more explicit advice to the appellant concerning its appointment power, and the appellant might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>promptly informed the court of the changes in his economic situation. In this case, however, we must review the good faith efforts of a trial judge acting without clearly prescribed standards and the responses of a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff with little understanding of the workings of the judicial system. Mindful of both the policies underlying Title VII\u2019s appointment power and the need to \u201cbe sensitive to the problems faced by <em>pro se </em>litigants,\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> we conclude that the appellant should be given an opportunity to prove that appointment of counsel was appropriate after he was dismissed by the appellee.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand the District Court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">The steps that should be taken by the District Court on remand are as\u2019 follows:</p>\n<p id=\"af1-dedup-0\">(1) The court should determine whether appointment of an attorney for the appellant would have been warranted after his dismissal on September 24, 1981. We have delineated the criteria that should be considered in making this determination in Part B <em>supra. </em>The court\u2019s determination should be based on the evidence in the record after the time of appellant\u2019s dismissal, supplemented by any additional evidence the parties can provide that is relevant to this time period. Because \u201c[t]he question of appointment of an attorney is a preliminary inquiry [it] should not be based upon the evidence adduced at trial.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Chemical Bank, </em>721 F.2d 876, 880 (2d Cir.1983). If the court decides that appointment was unwarranted, the court need not complete the additional steps prescribed <em>infra </em>and may enter judgment for the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">(2) If the court determines that appointment was warranted, further proceedings are necessary. Before scheduling such proceedings, the court should determine whether the appellant <em>presently </em>requires appointed counsel. This determination should be based on the criteria we have enumerated, as applied to the appellant\u2019s situation at the time this case is heard on remand. If appointment of counsel is presently warranted, the court should adhere to the mandate of the statute;<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> if appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>ment is unwarranted at this time, the appellant should secure counsel on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">(3) If the court determines pursuant to step one that appointment would have been warranted after the appellant\u2019s dismissal, the applicant should be \u201cafforded a hearing at which the appellant, or his counsel, might present evidence justifying further proceedings. The district court would then have a firm basis for making a fair determination whether any prejudice resulted from the earlier failure to appoint an attorney. For in the absence of such a showing, judicial resources need not be wasted on duplicative litigation.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>721 F.2d at 880-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the District Court is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1239-17\">.

The appellant\u2019s receipt of 13 unemployment compensation checks, and subsequent unsuccessful effort to hire an attorney, does not dictate a different decision. Absent a finding by the lower court that the appellant was not indigent at this time, or sufficient evidence in the record regarding the appellant\u2019s assets, income and expenses, we will not hold that an appellant\u2019s willingness to expend his unemployment compensation in an effort to vindicate his claims, standing alone, justifies denying appointment of an attorney. This conclusion is particularly warranted in this case because the appellant received his unemployment compensation more than five months after requesting appointment of counsel. The only pertinent evidence in the record indicates that his subsequent attempt to hire counsel was unsuccessful because the attorney believed that the advanced stage of the proceedings left her insufficient time to represent the appellant adequately.

Because the lower court has yet to make a determination of whether appointment was justified following the appellant\u2019s dismissal, we do not decide what action the court may be required to take if it determines this in favor of the appellant. Specifically, we express no view as to whether a court that has found appointment to be justified may decline to appoint counsel because of its lack of success in locating willing counsel, or as to whether the court is empowered to compel representation. Because these questions have not been adequately briefed, arid because on this record we cannot even discern whether appointment is justified, these issues are best left to another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-14\">We do note, however, our strong expectation that members of the local bar will be responsive to judicial requests for representation of claimants in Title VII cases, thereby mooting any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>issues of the sort here mentioned.

I dissent because I believe the record fails to show what I believe to be the prerequisite for invocation of those requirements: an application by the complainant based upon an asserted reason that the statute permits (\u201cI am too poor\u201d or \u201cMy cause is too unpopular\u201d). It may even be that upon application without any stated reason the court must inquire as to what the reason might be. That was done here on September 17. (The Court: \u201cWould you mind ... stating why you have been unable to [get counsel]? Has it been financial?\u201d Mr. Poindexter: \u201cNo.\u201d) At that point, it seems to me, the court\u2019s obligation was clearly at an end. I reject the notion that the plaintiff\u2019s statement immediately before this exchange (\u201cI think I could manage [to pay counsel] providing I can keep my job\u201d) amounted to some sort of springing averment of impecuniousness that took effect when he was dismissed. It is unreasonable to demand that when the district judge next spoke to the appellant \u2014 more than two months later, on November 20, after he had lost his job \u2014 she have had this negative pregnant in mind. Moreover, even if the previous (and, in all likelihood, forgotten) condition ripened into an averment of impecuniousness when he was dismissed, surely that averment was effectively cancelled when he later advised the court that \u2014 unemployed though he was \u2014 he had hired counsel, at an agreed-upon retainer of $1,300, $800 of which had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-13\">Nor would the circumstances have put the court on notice that this litigant could not afford counsel. The plaintiff was neither uneducated nor long unemployed. He had held a steady job at the FBI for seven years, during the last four and a half years at a clerical level. On leaving the government he had withdrawn his accumulated contributions to the retirement fund; and he was entitled to unemployment compensation, apparently in the amount of $196 per week. He claimed to have experienced financial difficulty making it impossible for him to take depositions before January 5, 1982, when his first unemployment checks arrived (though he spent $232 to go by plane to his home town during this period). But this temporary impecuniousness was not brought to the court\u2019s attention until February 10, in explanation of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>tiff\u2019s request to extend discovery time <em>since only now was he financially able to proceed. </em>By this time he had already offered a lawyer a $1,300 retainer, and three weeks later was prepared to go ahead with five depositions at a cost of at least $300 apiece. At no time, therefore, did the court have reason to believe that the plaintiff was currently impecunious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">It appears to me from this record that the district judge went well beyond any requirement of law in attempting to help out a plaintiff who <em>never </em>claimed impecuniousness, who had every appearance of solvency, and whose main problem seemed to be the legal unattractiveness of his case. The portions of the majority opinion dealing with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) will be of great benefit to our district judges; the portion dealing with its application here will teach them only one unhappy lesson: never be a volunteer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
