The federal defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court granted their motion, and we affirm its decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1595-21\">Although the plaintiffs originally asserted claims against the federal defendants based on a variety of statutes, for the purposes of this appeal we can confine our attention to the question of whether their complaint states a cause of action against the federal government under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (Title VIII), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 <em>et seq. </em>The plaintiffs place their principal reliance on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3608(d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1532\">*1532</page-number>(d) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1596-4\">(3) cooperate with and render technical assistance to Federal, State, local, and other public or private agencies, organizations, and institutions which are formulating or carrying on programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1596-5\">(5) administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of this sub-chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1596-6\">The plaintiffs contend that the federal defendants failed to carry out their responsibilities under these sections, arguing that although they knew or should have known that public officials in north Fulton County had a history of excluding public housing on racial grounds, HUD took no action to counter the deliberate foot-dragging of local governments. Because of these alleged past sins of omission, the plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring HUD to \u201ctake all necessary, appropriate and effective actions, including the provision of the first available funds and technical assistance, to insure the development of public housing\u201d in the areas in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-7\">In order to appreciate the nature of the claim advanced by the plaintiffs here, it is necessary to quickly sketch the factual background of this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The present controversy originated in 1971, when a federal district court found that Fulton County officials had deliberately obstructed attempts to place low-income public housing in unincorporated areas of the county for racially motivated reasons. <em>Crow v. Brown, </em>332 F.Supp. 382 (N.D.Ga.1971). The Housing Authority of Fulton County was created the following year, and the Authority and the County Commission soon concluded a cooperation agreement whereby the Commission agreed to adjust zoning where necessary and to provide water and sewer services to as many as one thousand public housing units on a nondiscriminatory basis. The Housing Authority apparently took no action to effectuate this agreement until 1978, when it submitted an application to HUD for federal financial assistance to construct two hundred units of low-income family housing on four sites in north Fulton County. HUD set aside certain funds for use in developing the project, then awaited the required \u201ccommitment letter\u201d from the County Commission indicating that it was willing to supply the necessary water and sewer services for the proposed sites of the units. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1439(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-12\">Although the Housing Authority first requested the commitment letter from the Commission in January 1979, the letter was not finally provided until March 1980. By this time, unfortunately, two of the four sites proposed in the original application were no longer available. In April 1980, HUD granted its preliminary approval to the Housing Authority\u2019s request for federal assistance with regard to the two remaining sites, and authorized the Authority to proceed with site appraisal and acquisition. According to the plaintiffs, however, the long delay in the County Commission had permitted opposition to the plan to jell in the community, and the City of Alpharet-ta moved to frustrate the Housing Authority\u2019s plans by annexing a third proposed site at Hopewell Road and rezoning it for commercial development on highly favorable terms. The final remaining site also became unavailable for reasons that do not appear in the complaint. Thus frustrated, the Housing Authority decided to amend its initial request to provide for only one hun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1533\">*1533</page-number>dred units of low-income family housing and another one hundred units of low-income housing for the elderly. Efforts to locate suitable sites continued during the rest of 1980, and at one point the Housing Authority managed to secure a commitment letter from the Commission for a site that was proposed for family housing. \u201c[F]or reasons which are unclear to Plaintiffs,\u201d HUD refused to approve the site. The Housing Authority then managed to locate two further sites, proposing that one be developed for family and the other for elderly housing. Eventually, the Authority was successful in obtaining a commitment letter for the latter, but not for the former. HUD then informed the Authority that the funds allocated in the original reservation were only sufficient to permit the development of one site. Shortly thereafter HUD redesignated the Authority\u2019s fund reservation solely for elderly housing. One hundred units of housing for the elderly have been completed since the initiation of this litigation, but the unincorporated areas of north Fulton County otherwise remain as destitute of low-income multi-family public housing as they were when Judge Eden-field issued his order in <em>Crow v. Brown </em>almost thirteen years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-5\">As we have seen, plaintiffs essentially allege that the federal defendants did not do what they ostensibly ought to have done under sections 3608(d)(3) and (5). Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that HUD should have pressured the County Commission into supplying the commitment letter for the Hopewell Road site in a reasonable time, or alternatively should have either waived its commitment letter requirement or authorized the Housing Authority to take legal action to obtain the commitment letter. The plaintiffs also suggest that HUD should have allowed the Housing Authority to exercise condemnation powers to secure the necessary sites, and they denounce HUD for agreeing to the Housing Authority\u2019s subsequent amendment changing the nature of the proposal to a mix of family units and housing for the elderly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Housing Authority itself is not named as a defendant in this case, so it appears that this is not an instance where the plaintiffs accuse HUD of closing its eyes to the discriminatory practices of a grantee. Instead, the plaintiffs contend that HUD violated its obligation under section 3608(d)(5) to \u201cadminister the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies\u201d of the Fair Housing Act because it failed to do what the grantee was unable to do for itself. They further assert that there is an implied private cause of action under the statute which permits them to bring suit to specifically enforce the \u201cassistance\u201d provision of section 3608(d)(3). These are both novel contentions, and we do not find the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1534\">*1534</page-number>It is of course true that section 3608(d)(5) has been recognized as imposing an affirmative duty upon the Secretary of HUD to work toward the goal of desegregation in housing. <em>See, e.g., Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, </em>564 F.2d 126, 139-40 (3d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 1457, 55 L.Ed.2d 499 (1978); <em>Acevedo v. Nassau County, </em>500 F.2d 1078, 1082 (2d Cir.1974); <em>Otero v. New York City Housing Authority, </em>484 F.2d 1122, 1133-34 (2d Cir.1973); <em>Shannon v. HUD, </em>436 F.2d 809, 816 (3d Cir.1970). Most actions in which private plaintiffs have brought suit against HUD pursuant to section 3608(d)(5) have involved challenges to funding decisions made by HUD officials, usually on the grounds that the grantee has either engaged in discriminatory practices or proposes to locate a new low-income housing project in an area where there is already a heavy concentration of economically disadvantaged or minority citizens. <em>See, e.g., Clients\u2019 Council v. Pierce, </em>711 F.2d 1406, 1422-25 (8th Cir.1983); <em>Alschuler v. HUD, </em>686 F.2d 472, 475 (7th Cir.1982); <em>Business Association v. Landrieu, </em>660 F.2d 867, 870-71 (3d Cir.1981); <em>Shannon v. HUD, </em>436 F.2d at 811-12; <em>King v. Harris, </em>464 F.Supp. 827, 837 (E.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd without opinion sub nom. King v. Faymor Development Corp., </em>614 F.2d 1288 (2d Cir.1979), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>446 U.S. 905, 100 S.Ct. 1828, 64 L.Ed.2d 256 (1980). In these cases, the courts have considered whether HUD\u2019s decision could be sustained under the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) in view of the stated objectives of the Fair Housing Act. The plaintiffs in this case, in contrast, cannot point to any decision by HUD which might lend itself to judicial review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They allege not that HUD has acted wrongly, but that it has not acted at all, and that this constitutes a breach of its obligations under sections 3608(d)(3) and (5). In their view, HUD is guilty of a violation of these sections of the Fair Housing Act whenever it simply \u201cmaintains a \u2018low profile\u2019 in the face of known racial opposition to the construction of public housing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-7\">This is a potentially sweeping re-interpretation of the nature of the affirmative duty imposed upon HUD by the Fair Housing Act, and we conclude that it has no support either in the terms of the statute, the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1535\">*1535</page-number>tory history, or the applicable case law. The remarks of the principal sponsors of the Fair Housing Act during the Senate debate suggest that they thought the provisions at issue were necessary because federal housing administrators had traditionally given little consideration to the impact of their decisions on the racial or socio-eco-nomic composition of a given neighborhood. As Senator Edward Brooke stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1599-5\">Today\u2019s Federal housing official commonly inveighs against the evils of ghetto life even as he pushes buttons that ratify their triumph \u2014 even as he ok\u2019s public housing sites in the heart of Negro slums, releases planning and urban renewal funds to cities dead-set against integration, and approves the financing of suburban subdivisions from which Negroes will be barred. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1599-6\">In other words, our Government, unfortunately, has been sanctioning discrimination in housing throughout this Nation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1599-7\">114 Cong.Record 2281 (1968). Later in the debate, Senator Brooke reiterated this point: \u201cRarely does HUD withhold funds or defer action in the name of desegregation ... It is clear that HUD is determined to speak loudly and carry a small stick.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2527-28. The bill\u2019s sponsors sought to remedy this bureaucratic myopia by requiring federal housing administrators to take account of the effect of their funding decisions upon the racial and socioeconomic composition of affected areas. <em>Otero, </em>484 F.2d at 1133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-8\">There is a vast difference, however, between requiring HUD\u2019s officials to include a particular consideration in their decision-making calculus, and suggesting that a federal agency has an affirmative legal duty to correct injustice wherever it exists. The latter interpretation of HUD\u2019s mission under section 3608(d) goes far beyond the concerns that Senator Brooke expressed about misguided bureaucratic decision-making, and it is unsupported by the language of the statute itself. Section 3608(d)(3) simply requires HUD to supply \u201ctechnical\u201d assistance to other agencies or organizations that are concerned with the problem of fair housing, while section 3608(d)(5) appears to pertain only to the \u201cprograms and activities\u201d which HUD itself is directly responsible for administering. In addition, the statute provides HUD with few weapons to employ against wrongdoers. The Secretary is clearly empowered to \u201cwithhold funds or defer action in the name of desegregation,\u201d 114 Cong.Record 2527-28 (1968), and Title VIII admittedly places fewer administrative and statutory constraints upon his ability to revoke funding than apply under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-l. <em>See Young v. Pierce, </em>544 F.Supp. 1010, 1017 (E.D.Tex.1982). Beyond that, however, the Secretary\u2019s powers are quite limited. As the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>409 U.S. 205, 93 S.Ct. 364, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1599-10\">It is apparent ... that complaints by private persons are the primary method of obtaining compliance with the [Fair Housing] Act____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1599-11\">The design of the Act confirms this construction. HUD has no power of enforcement. So far as federal agencies are concerned only the Attorney General may sue; yet, as noted, he may sue only to correct \u201ca pattern or practice\u201d of housing discrimination. That phrase \u201ca pattern or practice\u201d creates some limiting factors in his authority which we need not stop to analyze. For ... most of the fair housing litigation conducted by the Attorney General is handled by the Housing Section of the Civil Rights Division, which has less than two dozen lawyers. Since HUD has no enforcement powers and since the enormity of the task of assuring fair housing makes the role of the Attorney General in the matter minimal, the main generating force must be private suits____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1599-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 209-11, 93 S.Ct. at 366-367. Thus, there is little that HUD can do beyond exerting moral suasion to \u201cpressure\u201d local officials into compliance with the goals of the Fair Housing Act when it is not currently funding a local agency. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>tiffs suggest that this would leave citizens without redress where local officials have engaged in discriminatory practices and HUD is not involved, but this contention is clearly incorrect. As <em>Trafficante </em>suggests, they are encouraged to bring suit as private attorneys general, and the effectiveness of the statutory scheme is in fact dependent on their willingness to do so. Where HUD is not supporting discrimination through its funding practices, there is little to be gained by naming it as a defendant. <em>See, e.g., Otero v. New York City Housing Authority, </em>354 F.Supp. 941, 957 &amp; n. 18 (S.D.N.Y.) (dismissing claims against HUD where full relief sought by plaintiffs could be obtained by decree against local housing authority and no claim was made of affirmative discriminatory action by HUD), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>484 F.2d 1122 (2d Cir.1973). We conclude that the drafters of the Fair Housing Act did not intend for HUD to be subjected to liability under circumstances such as these.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-4\">Further support for this construction of the intent of section 3608(d) can be found in the applicable case law. The plaintiffs contend that there are essentially two different lines of eases interpreting HUD\u2019s duties under section 3608(d). The first of these involves challenges to \u201cthe routine approval process for public housing applications\u201d and is governed by the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard, while a second group comprises situations where \u201cit is alleged that HUD failed to act, or even compounded the effects of racial opposition by its own actions, knowing or forewarned of racial barriers to fair housing.\u201d The plaintiffs suggest that this second group of cases is subject to judicial scrutiny under a heightened \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard, and that liability can be found on HUD\u2019s part if it fails to use its \u201cbest efforts\u201d to see that low-income housing is constructed or simply maintains a \u201clow profile\u201d in the face of known racial opposition to fair housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-7\">Unfortunately, this interpretation of the ease law does not stand up upon closer examination. The first difficulty with the argument advanced by the plaintiffs is that it would be anomalous to subject HUD to a tougher standard of judicial scrutiny in cases in which its involvement is marginal or non-existent than applies when HUD is accused of supporting discrimination through its financial assistance to local governmental entities. In addition, a careful reading of the cases cited in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief provides little support for their analysis. All of the cited eases involved situations where HUD either was accused of taking discriminatory action itself or was actively involved in financing local public housing authorities who had poor records on fair housing. These decisions are therefore not analogous to the present case. For example, the plaintiffs rely heavily on Judge Justice\u2019s statement in <em>Young v. Pierce </em>that \u201cviolations of [HUD\u2019s affirmative duty] through inaction or indolence must be actionable.\u201d 544 F.Supp. at 1018. Elsewhere, however, Judge Justice makes it plain that <em>Young </em>is simply another case where HUD was accused of closing its eyes to the discriminatory practices of one of its grantees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority, </em>432 F.Supp. 25 (N.D. Ohio 1977), HUD was charged with continuing its support for the TMHA despite that agency's failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>make serious efforts to locate low-income housing in suburban areas. There, however, the plaintiffs further alleged that \u201cHUD [had] <em>instructed </em>TMHA not to seek cooperation agreements from other local governing bodies outside the City of Toledo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27 (emphasis added). The plaintiffs also cite <em>Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, </em>where the complaint alleged that HUD had refused to consider terminating its support of other city programs despite the city\u2019s staunch opposition to a proposed low-income housing development. 564 F.2d at 137. Finally, in <em>King v. Harris, </em>the plaintiffs were contesting HUD\u2019s decision to provide financial support for a low-income housing project in an integrated neighborhood with a delicate racial balance. 464 F.Supp. at 830. Thus, none of these cases support the plaintiff\u2019s argument that HUD can be found liable for a violation of section 3608(d)(5) where it is not currently involved in providing federal financial assistance to local housing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-5\">A more plausible interpretation of the case law indicates that HUD is subject to liability under section 3608(d)(5) only where it has disbursed federal funds to local housing authorities who are engaged in activities that will \u201cestablish and add to segregation in housing patterns.\u201d <em>Garrett v. City of Hamtramck, </em>503 F.2d 1236, 1247 (6th Cir.1974). This approach \u2014 which does not impose liability on HUD where it is not yet directly involved \u2014 is both logical and fair. It recognizes that, since the termination of federal funds is virtually the only weapon available to HUD in its efforts to enforce the Fair Housing Act, there is little to be gained by holding HUD accountable in situations where it lacks even this leverage. This principle was recognized by the Sixth Circuit in <em>Garrett, </em>where it found that HUD could be held jointly liable with the city with regard to one housing project which HUD had approved even after it became aware of the city\u2019s discriminatory practices. The court refused to hold HUD liable with regard to two other pending projects, however, because \u201c[s]ince neither [project] has been approved by HUD, or, in fact, submitted to it for approval, HUD cannot be held responsible for any wrongs suffered by the residents of these areas at the hands of the City.\u201d 503 F.2d at 1247-48. Similarly, the Second Circuit stressed in <em>Acevedo v. Nassau County, </em>500 F.2d 1078, 1082 (2d Cir.1974), that although section 3608(d)(5) imposes a duty on HUD to administer its programs and activities in such a way as to further the goal of integration, \u201c[t]he Fair Housing Act does not impose any duty upon a governmental body to construct or to \u2018plan for, approve and promote\u2019 any housing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-8\">Under our interpretation of the statute and case law, therefore, HUD\u2019s affirmative obligation under section 3608(d)(5) may subject it to liability in two types of situations: first,' when HUD has taken discriminatory action itself, such as approving federal assistance for a public housing project without considering its effect on the racial and socio-economic composition of the surrounding area, <em>see, e.g., Shannon v. HUD, </em>436 F.2d at 811-12; and second, when HUD is aware of a grantee\u2019s discriminatory practices and has made no effort to force it into compliance with the Fair Housing Act by cutting off existing federal financial assistance to the agency in question. <em>See, e.g., Client\u2019s Council v. Pierce, </em>711 F.2d at 1422-23; <em>Gautreaux v. Romney, </em>448 F.2d 731, 739 (7th Cir.1971). Since the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in this case fall into neither of these categories, we conclude that they have not stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The decision of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1595-12\">. The dismissal of the federal defendants from this action still leaves the plaintiffs free to proceed against the city and county officials whose alleged recalcitrance is the core of the problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1595-13\">. The plaintiffs also contend that they have claims against the federal defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3604 and 3617, but we do not find their arguments persuasive. Section 3604 prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of housing, while section 3617 provides that it shall be unlawful \"to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with\u201d any person\u2019s exercise or enjoyment of the rights secured by the other provisions of Title VIII. The plaintiffs do not allege that HUD was involved in the sale or rental of housing in north Fulton County, and we do not believe that the language \"or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race\u201d can be extended to cover the action or inaction of the federal defendants in this case. We believe it is equally clear that the allegations against the federal defendants in the plaintiffs' complaints are in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1532\">*1532</page-number>sufficient to establish a violation of section 3617. Finally, the plaintiffs also originally sought relief under Title VI, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d, et seq. but they now concede that in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last Term in <em>Guardians Association v. Civil Service Commission, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 3221, 77 L.Ed.2d 866 (1983), this claim is no longer tenable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1596-13\">. Of course, when reviewing the propriety of a dismissal under F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), all of the allegations of the complaint must be construed in the light most favorable to the pleader and accepted as true. 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil </em>\u00a7 1363 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1597-6\">. The plaintiffs do not indicate what steps they believe HUD should have taken to \"pressure\u201d the county commission into providing the required commitment letter, and it is not easy to imagine what leverage the federal defendants could have used. As the district court correctly pointed out, \"there is no allegation [in the complaint] that HUD failed to use the only enforcement mechanism at its disposal, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000(d)-l, to force Fulton County to act, and it is not alleged that the Secretary had any other authority over the county.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Alpharetta, </em>Nos. C81-461A <em>&amp; </em>C81-1547A, slip, op. at 6 (N.D.Ga. Sept. 30, 1982). The other allegations made by the plaintiffs against HUD in their complaint are equally perplexing. Since section 1439(c) mandates that \"the Secretary shall not approve an application for housing assistance unless he determines ... that there is or will be available in the area public facilities and services adequate to serve the housing proposed to be assisted,\u201d we cannot understand the plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that the Secretary's failure to waive the commitment letter requirement constituted a breach of a legal duty. Similarly, it is not apparent why the Housing Authority should have needed authorization from HUD before undertaking legal action on its own to secure the commitment letter. The plaintiffs have also failed to draw our attention to any provision of the Fair Housing Act which grants the Secretary the power of acquiring property through eminent domain, and we do not believe that the language of section 3608(d)(3) can be stretched to encompass such a grant of authority. <em>Cf. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1502(b) (explicitly granting the Secretary of HUD power to secure property for use in housing military personnel through eminent domain).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1598-4\">. The only positive steps taken by HUD that might arguably be held to have contributed to the failure to develop public housing in north Fulton County were: (1) its decision to approve the substitution of one hundred units of elderly housing for half of the family units originally proposed (assuming that family units would more thoroughly integrate public schools and neighborhoods); (2) HUD\u2019s refusal to approve one site slated for family housing after the Commission issued the required commitment letter; and (3) HUD\u2019s action in redesignating the Authority's fund reservation to apply only to housing for the elderly in early 1981. With regard to the first of these, however, HUD was simply acting at the request of a grantee which is not accused of discrimination in either action. Although HUD might have refused to permit the change, it is hard to understand how this would have improved the situation; HUD could not force the Authority to build any units while prospective sites remained unavailable and the statutory requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1439(c) remained unfulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-5\">The second action cited above is more troublesome. If the plaintiffs had alleged that HUD\u2019s decision to deny approval to the site in question was motivated by either a discriminatory purpose or even simple indifference to the affirmative mandate of \u00a7 3608(d)(5), this might supply a basis for their claim against the federal defendants. Unfortunately, the plaintiffs here have done neither, instead merely stating that they do not know why HUD refus'ed to approve the site in question. HUD\u2019s answer states that the proposed site \"did not meet project and site criteria mandated by HUD regulations and guidelines\u201d; for all that appears in the complaint, HUD may have concluded that the proposed site was too close to an existing pocket of minority residents \u2014 a conclusion that would have been completely in accord with the requirements of \u00a7 3608(d)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-9\">Finally, HUD\u2019s action in redesignating the fund reservation to apply solely to the construction of elderly housing appears from the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to have been the product of financial exigencies and the difficulties encountered in obtaining a site and a commitment letter for family housing, rather than from any lack of sensitivity to the requirements of Title VIII. The basic problem here appears to have been the obstructionist tactics of local officials. In the absence of a showing that HUD had any real ability to shape their decisions, the federal defendants cannot be held liable for actions they were compelled to take as a result of the recalcitrance of the city and county governments.

LANIER ANDERSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Asu7\">Circuit Judge, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-11\">I agree with much of what the majority has written. In particular, the majority is correct in noting that the appellants\u2019 allegations focus principally on wrongdoing by local defendants. I do not, however, agree that the federal defend\u00e1nts can be properly dismissed in the present Rule 12(b)(6) posture of the case. I respectfully submit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>the majority has erroneously drawn inferences in favor of the federal defendants (ie.g., that the appellant\u2019s failure to include the local housing authority as a defendant constitutes an admission that the authority is free from discrimination; see also footnote 5 of the majority opinion for inferences drawn in favor of the federal defendants). While further development of the record may justify these inferences, I cannot conclude that it is \u201cbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v.
