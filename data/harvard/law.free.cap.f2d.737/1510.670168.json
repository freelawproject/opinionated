Because the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s challenge to the settlement agreement, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-24\">On August 24, 1982, while working as a seaman aboard a tug owned by defendants, plaintiff Russell was struck in the left arm by a \u201cpee-vee,\u201d or wooden lever. Russell sued under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, claiming that his injured arm disabled him as a seaman. At his deposition, Russell stated that he could not straighten his left arm and had difficulty lifting objects. He made similar statements to medical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1511\">*1511</page-number>vocational experts hired by defendant, and at a later conference with defendant\u2019s attorneys claimed that his activity was so limited that even getting dressed caused him pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-5\">On September 16, 1983, the parties agreed to settle Russell\u2019s claim for $275,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-6\">Within the following week, private investigators who had been hired by defendant to observe Russell and who were not notified of the settlement agreement, \u201cnoted substantial increase in [Russell\u2019s] use of his left arm\u201d. Motion pictures were taken of Russell lifting various sorts of building materials. On viewing these films, defendants\u2019 medical and vocational experts stated that they would revise their opinions of Russell\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-7\">On October 17, 1983, defendant moved for recission of the settlement agreement and asked the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing at which it might present, among other things, the new motion picture evidence. The district court, without holding a hearing, denied the motion and entered judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-8\">The denial of appellant\u2019s motion without a hearing was an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. Summary enforcement of a settlement agreement \u201cis ill-suited to situations presenting complex factual issues related either to the formation or the consummation of the [settlement] contract, which only testimonial exploration in a more plenary proceeding is apt to satisfactorily resolve.\u201d <em>Antera v. Robinson, </em>419 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C.Cir. 1969). <em>See also Millner v. Norfolk &amp; W.R. Co., </em>643 F.2d 1005, 1009 (4th Cir.1981); <em>Kukla v. National Distillers Products Company, </em>483 F.2d 619, 621 (6th Cir.1973); <em>Massachusetts Casualty Insurance Co. v. Forman, </em>469 F.2d 259, 260 (5th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-9\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED with instructions to hold an evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s claimed grounds for recision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
