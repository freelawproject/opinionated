(Supp. V 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">After the lawsuit was filed, defendants agreed to modify the contract to include the correct schedule, and so stated to the court. Record, vol. 3, at 832. The wages were subsequently modified and the contractor who had been awarded the contract in question corrected the payrolls and fully compensated all employees under the correct wage rate. The modification was made without the district court having to rule on the merits of plaintiff\u2019s Davis-Bacon Act claim. The court then set a status report hearing, which was held approximately seven months after defendants modified the wage rates. At the hearing, plaintiff requested leave to file, and did file, an amended complaint. The amended complaint sought the injunctive relief originally requested and, for the first time, alleged a civil rights deprivation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. V 1981). The amended complaint also sought attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (Supp. V 1981). Defendants moved for summary judgment, and plaintiff moved for attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d) (Supp. V 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">The district court, 541 F.Supp. 486, granted defendants motion for summary judgment and denied attorney\u2019s fees under both section 1988 and the Equal Access to Justice Act. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-19\">Plaintiff argues at length on appeal that the defendants violated the Davis-Bacon Act by refusing to modify the prevailing wage rates in the bid package. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>ever, it is unclear what relief plaintiff seeks even if we were to reach the merits of this claim and find that defendants did indeed violate the Davis-Bacon Act. As the trial court found, and plaintiffs counsel admitted, defendants\u2019 concession to modify the contract to include the correct wage rate afforded plaintiff all of the substantive relief sought. Record, vol. 3, at 833. Thus, by the time defendants\u2019 moved for summary judgment, plaintiff\u2019s substantive claims were moot. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Plaintiff contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of mootness. Apparently, plaintiff is arguing that the granting of summary judgment defeated its claim for attorney\u2019s fees. However, the trial court ruled only that the substantive claims were moot and specifically stated that granting summary judgment did not affect plaintiff\u2019s status as a prevailing party for purposes of attorney\u2019s fee award statutes. <em>See Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 129, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2574, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980) (attorney\u2019s fee award not conditioned on a full litigation of the issues or on a judicial determination that plaintiff\u2019s rights have been violated). Plaintiff cites <em>County of Los Angeles v. Davis, </em>440 U.S. 625, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979); <em>Gurule v. Wilson, </em>635 F.2d 782 (10th Cir.1980); and <em>Davis v. Village Park II Realty Co., </em>578 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.1978), to support the position that the case is not moot because the plaintiff still had an interest in the outcome of the attorney\u2019s fee issue. This argument is not persuasive however, since the district court held only the substantive issues moot and then proceeded to carefully consider the merits of the attorney\u2019s fee issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. <em>See Christiansburg Garment Co. v. E.E.O.C., </em>434 U.S. 412, 423-24, 98 S.Ct. 694, 701, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). The court denied plaintiff\u2019s section 1988 attorney\u2019s fee claim because the court found that plaintiff did not meet the two-part catalyst test of <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 280-81 (1st Cir.1978). Under this test, a plaintiff who brings an action alleging a civil rights violation, but who does not receive a judgment on the merits is still a prevailing party for section 1988 purposes if he makes two showings. First, plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit must be causally linked to the securing of the relief obtained. Second, the defendant\u2019s conduct in response to the lawsuit must be required by law. <em>Id. </em>at 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The trial court found that although the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit caused them to receive all of the relief sought, the causation prong of the <em>Nadeau </em>test was not met because the defendants capitulated before the plaintiff ever raised its 1983 claim \u2014 i.e., there was no causal connection between the section 1983 claim and the plaintiff receiving the relief sought. The court also found that plaintiff failed to meet the second prong of the <em>Nadeau </em>test. Defendants were not confronted with the section 1983 claim at the time they voluntarily complied with plaintiff\u2019s request and had virtually no chance of attacking the validity of the claim on the merits because all of the relief sought by plaintiff had already been conceded. The court went on to discuss the problem of whether plaintiff had any right to bring a section 1983 action for violation of the Davis-Bacon Act, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to imply a private right of action under the Act. <em>See Universities Research Association v. Coutu, </em>450 U.S. 754, 772, 101 S.Ct. 1451, 1462, 67 L.Ed.2d 662 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">We hold that the proper time for determining whether a party is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988 is when all of the substantive relief sought by the plaintiff has been achieved or when the case has been fully adjudicated on the merits. Here, when the substantive relief was achieved, this case was postured as a Davis-Bacon Act case. No civil rights violation was even alleged. We find no persuasive reason for opening the door to allow a plaintiff who did not initially plead or argue a civil rights violation to subsequently force what would essentially be an adjudication on the merits after the action has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>become moot. Thus, in light of the trial court\u2019s careful analysis, we find no abuse of discretion and affirm the denial of attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The district court also properly denied plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees against the federal defendants under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court found that the plaintiff was a prevailing party for purposes of this section and was therefore entitled to attorney\u2019s fees \u201cunless the position of the United States was substantially justified\u201d or \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d existed. The court held that the term \u201cposition\u201d refers to the government\u2019s conduct during the lawsuit, and not to the government\u2019s pre-litigation position. Based upon this interpretation, the court found that the government\u2019s position was substantially justified and, therefore, plaintiff was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA. Further, the court found that there were no special circumstances involved which would give rise to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Plaintiff challenges the district court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cposition.\u201d Plaintiff contends that - it is the government\u2019s conduct giving rise to the lawsuit, not its conduct during litigation, which is dispositive to an analysis of section 2412(d)(1)(A). We settled that argument in <em>United States v. 2,116 Boxes of Boned Beef, </em>726 F.2d 1481 (10th Cir.1984). We there held that the position of the United States, for purposes of the EAJA, means the arguments relied upon by the government in litigation, rather than the governmental behavior that precipitated the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 1487. Upon institution of the lawsuit, defendants modified the wage schedule. The trial court did not err in finding that the government\u2019s action exemplified the behavior the EAJA seeks to</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">encourage. Record, vol. 3, at 847. Thus, the government\u2019s position was substantially justified. Further, we do not find evidence in the record sufficient to contradict the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendants did not act in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-6\">.
