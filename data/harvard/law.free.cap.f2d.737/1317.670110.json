BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1383-14\">Today we address the issue whether a state supported university violates the First Amendment rights of this gay student organization and three of its members by refusing to afford it official recognition. The District Court found that the University\u2019s refusal to recognize the group was not based on the content of the group\u2019s ideas about homosexuality. Instead, the trial court found that the group had been denied recognition due to the University\u2019s long standing policy of refusing to recognize fraternal organizations whose principal purpose is to hold social gatherings to encourage friendship and personal affinity. Finally, the Court held that the University had not created a forum open to fraternal or social groups. Thus, on appeal, the University contends that it never created a generally open forum for First Amendment expression. For these reasons, the District Court concluded and the University argues that there was no constitutional deprivation. We think those findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous and reverse. We affirm, however, the Court\u2019s conclusion that recovery of monetary damages is prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-19\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGX\">In April of 1976, a group of students on the Texas A &amp; M University (TAMU)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> campus met with Dr. John Koldus, the University\u2019s Vice President for Student Affairs, to discuss with him the possibility of using University facilities to conduct the business of a group they had formed, Gay Student Services (GSS).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The students informed Koldus that they did not at that time seek official recognition, but merely wished to post notices on school bulletin boards, meet on campus, and have access to the student newspaper and radio.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>not seeking official recognition included their wish to maintain the anonymity of some of their members as well as their understanding that the group\u2019s existence might pose an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d problem in the conservative TAMU community.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">Koldus advised the students that no form of limited recognition was available and referred them to Dr. Carolyn Adair, Director of Student Affairs, to receive information regarding the requirements for official recognition. Dr. Adair advised the students to apply for recognition as a service group rather than a political or social group because there would be fewer problems. Accordingly, the goals and purposes reflected on GSS\u2019s application were service-related. The application, dated April 5, 1976, stated the following goals and purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-5\">1) To provide a referral service for students desiring professional counseling including psychological, religious, medical, and legal fields.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-6\">2) To provide to the TAMU community information concerning the structures and realities of gay life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-7\">3) To provide speakers to classes and organizations who wish to know more about gay lifestyles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-8\">4) To provide a forum for the interchange of ideas and constructive solutions to gay people\u2019s problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-19\">Dr. Koldus directed Dr. Adair to forward GSS\u2019s application directly to him rather than to the Student Organization Board, which is ordinarily the first step in attaining recognition. Koldus, who is responsible for the final decision regarding recognition, stated that this was his usual procedure when dealing with applications presenting special problems. Sherri Skinner, one of the group\u2019s founding members, testified that Koldus had informed the students at the initial meeting that the University would deny their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-20\">On May 4, 1976, the student representatives of GSS again met with Koldus, who told them that he had written a response to their application. Koldus stated that University officials had asked him to delay release of the response until Jack Williams, President of the University, and the University legal staff had had an opportunity to study the request. A memorandum dated May 28, 1976 from Williams to Koldus indicated that Koldus had provided information regarding other Texas universities\u2019 treatment of similar situations. Furthermore, Williams\u2019 memo stated that TAMU would not recognize GSS \u201cuntil and unless we are ordered by higher authority to do so.\u201d The students met with Koldus in June and September of 1976, again requesting action on their application. Finally, Dr. Koldus issued a letter denying recognition on November 29, 1976.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>Dr. Koldus\u2019 denial was premised on two points. First, Koldus asserted that because homosexual conduct was illegal in Texas at that time,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it would be inappropriate for TAMU officially to support an organization likely to \u201cincite, promote and result\u201d in homosexual activity. Second, Koldus stated that the TAMU staff and faculty, not TAMU student organizations, were responsible for providing referral services, educational information, and speakers to students and the larger public. Thus, Koldus concluded that the stated purposes and goals of TAMU were not \u201cconsistent with the philosophy and goals\u201d of TAMU. Nowhere in the letter did Koldus assert that denial of recognition was premised on the fraternal nature of GSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-4\">This lawsuit, seeking declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, was filed in February of 1977. In November of 1977, the District Court granted TAMU\u2019s motion to dismiss without stating its reasons for doing so, and GSS appealed. We vacated and remanded, finding that none of the asserted bases for dismissal were proper. <em>Gay Student Services v. Texas A &amp; M University, </em>612 F.2d 160 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1034, 101 S.Ct. 608, 66 L.Ed.2d 495 (1980). The District Court held a bench trial in November of 1981. The evidence presented at trial consisted almost solely of medical testimony from specialists in human sexuality regarding the effect the presence of a homosexual student group might have on a university campus. The defense in particular centered on statistics and opinions documenting increased crime rates and severe emotional problems found within the homosexual community. The defense presented no testimony at trial regarding whether GSS functioned as a purely social organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-11\">On May 19, 1982, the District Court entered a final judgment for TAMU, along with findings of fact and conclusions of law. On appeal, GSS asserts that these findings and conclusions were erroneous and require reversal. We agree, for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-12\">\n<em>The Nature of GSS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-13\">In its findings of fact, the District Court found that TAMU \u201cdid not and has not to the time of trial in this case, recognized fraternal organizations, i.e. student groups whose principal if not sole purpose is to hold social gatherings to encourage friendships and personal affinity.\u201d The record shows that in October 1977, Dr. Koldus denied recognition to Sigma Phi. Epsilon, a national social fraternity, by stating the following policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-14\">For over one hundred years, Texas A &amp; M has chosen not to include the national social fraternity and sorority system as an official part of its educational program. The University has. supported the premise that its social character was developed in the concept of togetherness in that all students were Aggies and that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>social caste system would detract from this most important concept which welded together the students that attended Texas A &amp; M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-5\">As an administrator, it is my responsibility to attempt to perpetuate these traditions which have added not only to the character of the institution but to its strength. It is upon this premise that I deny official university recognition of Sigma Phi Epsilon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-6\">At the heart of the findings and conclusions of the District Court was its decision that GSS was merely a \u201cfraternal or social\u201d group \u201cwhose message is mere friendship and personal affinity.\u201d This led the Court to conclude that GSS was not denied recognition \u201cbased upon the content of [its] ideas about homosexuality, since the group is not trying to convey any message about homosexuality,\u201d but rather because GSS was a \u201cfraternal\u201d organization subject to TAMU\u2019s traditional ban. We think this factual finding was clearly erroneous, for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-7\">Such a finding is utterly at odds with the asserted purposes of GSS, which sought recognition to provide services and information regarding gay issues to gay persons and to the general public. <em>See </em>Statement of Goals and Purposes, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, Dr. Koldus\u2019 asserted reasons for denying recognition were clearly based on his perception that the organization <em>would </em>attempt to convey ideas about homosexuality. Nowhere in his letter of November 29 does Koldus state that the University\u2019s refusal to recognize GSS was based on anything other than reasons tied to the homosexual nature of the group.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>text of letter at footnote 4, <em>supra. </em>Further evidence of TAMU\u2019s opposition to recognizing a gay student group is found in a resolution passed by the TAMU Board of Regents following the filing of this lawsuit in 1977. The minutes of the Board\u2019s meeting of March 22, 1977 state that the following \u201cpolicy position\u201d was approved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-13\">So-called \u201cgay\u201d activities run diabolically <em>\\sic </em>\u2014 diametrically?] counter to the traditions and standards of Texas A &amp; M University, and the Board of Regents is determined to defend the suit filed against it by three students seeking \u201cgay\u201d recognition and, if necessary, to proceed in every legal way to prohibit any group with such goals from organizing or operating on this or any other campus for which this Board is responsible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-14\">Moreover, TAMU presented no evidence at trial regarding the \u201cfraternal\u201d nature of GSS. Such a theory for denying recognition was-never advanced in the case until TAMU filed its post-trial brief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>the sole evidence alleged to support the theory was advanced by GSS itself, in its attempt to show that GSS was a \u201cnormal\u201d student group rather than a hotbed of deviant homosexuals anxious to influence the morals of impressionable TAMU students at on-eampus meetings. TAMU relies, for example, on the testimony of Dr. Kenneth Nyberg, who agreed to become GSS\u2019 faculty advisor and attended some of its early meetings. Dr. Nyberg stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-4\">Theirs was a quintessent typical student group____ What you are talking about are students so their interests are those of students____ How do you, you know, how do you get registered? What person to take for a class, what person not to take for a class. What did you do last week? It was mostly concerning ... student issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-9\">s(c *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-10\">They reflected most of the same goals and aspirations and concerns almost all my students did. They subsequently looked into most of the same issues. The singular exception was, of course, the homosexual aspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1387-11\">It later became clear that GSS elicited such testimony from Dr. Nyberg in order to contravene a later opinion by defense witness Dr. Cameron,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> who opined that in light of statistical evidence regarding homosexual behavior, \u201cit would be a shock really, if there were not homosexual acts engaged in at or immediately after\u201d a meeting of a homosexual, student organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-17\">Apparently relying upon the testimony of Dr. Sherri Skinner, the District Court also found that GSS was a fraternal group that was \u201cnot trying to convey any message about homosexuality\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because it was \u201cnot organized for political advocacy\u201d and had \u201cno official position regarding repeal of Tex.Penal Code Ann., \u00a7 21.06; which makes homosexual conduct a misdemeanor.\u201d Dr. Skinner\u2019s testimony, like that of Dr. Nyberg, was elicited by GSS for the express purpose of showing that GSS was a typical student service group deserving recognition rather than a substitute for a gay singles bar. Moreover; Dr. Skinner emphasized that any political or social goals GSS may have had were intentionally eliminated from the application for recognition because Dr. Adair had advised the students to seek recognition as a service-type group. What Dr. Skinner actually said, in the context of emphasizing the service-related purposes of GSS, was that while the individual members of GSS would probably support repeal of the anti-homosexuality laws, \u201cthe organization itself has been very careful to keep clear of political action or activism, per se.\u201d In light of the fact that TAMU recognizes more service-related student organizations than it does political ones,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>simply cannot agree that GSS\u2019s failure to organize as a political group renders it a social or fraternal group subject to the TAMU ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">Finally, we point out that recognition was denied before GSS ever had the opportunity to function as the service-type group it sought to become. The Court\u2019s determination regarding the nature of the group was based on how it functioned as an off campus group that had been denied the benefits and privileges of official recognition. The minutes of GSS\u2019s meetings reveal that much of the group\u2019s meeting time was consumed by discussion of the pending lawsuit. We think evidence concerning how GSS functioned as an off campus group is irrelevant to the determination whether GSS, as it sought to exist, was entitled to official recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s factual findings with regard to the nature of GSS were clearly erroneous. We think it clear from the facts that TAMU refused officially to recognize GSS based upon the homosexual content of the group\u2019s ideas \u2014 which it sought to convey through implementing its stated goals and purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-6\">\n<em>Background: The First Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-7\">At least three times in the recent past, this Court has seen fit to make \u201cmajor expansions in the First Amendment rights of students.\u201d <em>University of Southern Mississippi Chapter of the Mississippi Civil Liberties Union v. University of Southern Mississippi, </em>452 F.2d 564, 565 (5th Cir.1971). In <em>Dixon v. Alabama State Board of Education, </em>294 F.2d 150 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 930, 82 S.Ct. 368, 7 L.Ed.2d 193 (1961), we held that the due process rights of six black students were violated by their expulsion without a hearing from a state supported university following their participation in a Montgomery lunch counter sit-in. That decision has since been interpreted to mean that no longer is \u201cattendance at a state university ... a privilege granted by the state ... subject to whatever conditions the state [seeks] to impose.\u201d <em>University of Southern Mississippi, supra, </em>452 F.2d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-10\">Next, in <em>Burnside v. Byars, </em>363 F.2d 744, 749 (5th Cir.1966), we paved the way for the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District, </em>393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), when we held that students\u2019 rights to freedom of expression could not be abridged absent material and substantial interference with discipline and order in the school. <em>Burnside, </em>like <em>Tinker,</em><footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was a \u201csymbolic speech\u201d case, where students were suspended from school for wearing \u201cfreedom\u201d buttons. The Supreme Court cited <em>Burnside </em>when it held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACM8\">In order for the State in the person of school officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion, it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint. Certainly where there is no finding and no showing that engaging in of the forbidden conduct would \u2018materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school,\u2019 the prohibition cannot be sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-11\"><em>Tinker, supra, </em>393 U.S. at 509, 89 S.Ct. at 738, <em>citing Burnside, supra, </em>363 F.2d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-12\">Finally, despite Judge Wisdom\u2019s statement that the decision \u201crequire[d] us to break no new ground,\u201d in <em>University of Southern Mississippi </em>itself we foreshadowed the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Healy v. James, </em>408 U.S. 169, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>University of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number><em>Southern Mississippi, </em>we held that the University\u2019s denial of official recognition to a chapter of the Mississippi Civil Liberties Union violated the First Amendment. <em>Id., </em>452 F.2d at 568. The District Court had found that the \u201clitigious orientation\u201d of the MCLU might result in frivolous, vexatious and harassing lawsuits likely to impede the legitimate function of the University. We disagreed, after stating the following standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-4\">Student rights of free expression may be prohibited only if they \u2018materially and substantially [interfere] with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.\u2019 ... When the restriction upon student expression takes the form of an attempt to predict in advance the content and consequences of that expression, it is tantamount to a prior restraint and carries a heavy presumption against its constitutionality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A72\"><em>University of Southern Mississippi, supra, </em>452 F.2d at 566, <em>quoting Tinker, supra, </em>393 U.S. at 509, 89 S.Ct. at 738. We distinguished the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Healy </em>on its facts,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> while pointing out that we in no way implied our approval of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">These three decisions required this Court to extend its own precedent as well as that of the Supreme Court to encompass the then-timely First Amendment problems of days gone by. Our earlier decisions, and certainly their Supreme Court counterparts, remain such an effective weapon against the infringement of fundamental rights that our task today is small in comparison. Moreover, - we need not take the extra step of extending those precedents to today\u2019s problem by ourselves, for three other Circuit Courts and at least two federal District Courts have marked our way.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In treading the First Amendment path, we are ever-mindful of the words of Mr. Justice Jackson in <em>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, </em>319 U.S. 624, 640-42, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1186-87, 87 L.Ed. 1628, 1639 (1943):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anj-dedup-1\">Struggles to coerce uniformity of sentiment in support of some end thought essential to their time and country have been waged by many good as well as by evil men____ As governmental pressure toward unity becomes greater, so strife becomes more bitter as to whose unity it shall be____ The ultimate futility of such attempts to compel coherence is the lesson of every such effort from the Roman drive to stamp out Christianity as a disturber of its pagan unity, ... down to the fast failing efforts of our present totalitarian enemies. Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves exterminating dissenters. Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-15\">4: sfc sfs ' * sfc *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-16\">... the First Amendment to bur Constitution was designed to avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-17\">Jfc * * * sis 5k</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>...

This fact finding precluded it from reaching any other First Amendment issues, so the Judge thought. We have already determined that the Court erred in finding that TAMU\u2019s reasons for the denying recognition to GSS were not based on the content of its message. Thus, we need only determine whether such a denial violated appellants\u2019 rights under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">In <em>Healy v. James, </em>408 U.S. 169, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972), the Supreme Court was faced with a situation nearly identical to that before us today. In <em>Healy, </em>a state supported college refused to recognize a group of students who wished to organize a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) during the late 60s, when SDS groups on some campuses had been a \u201ccatalytic force\u201d in \u201cwidespread civil disobedience\u201d on college campuses. <em>Id., </em>402 U.S. at 170-72, 92 S.Ct. at 2341. The benefits of recognition in <em>Healy </em>were nearly identical to the benefits of which GSS was deprived, as was at least one of the asserted reasons for the denial: \u201cthe organization\u2019s philosophy was antithetical to the school\u2019s policies.\u201d <em>Id., </em>402 U.S. at 175-76, 92 S.Ct. at 2343. The students sued, basing their claims on the denial of First Amendment rights of expression and association. <em>Id., </em>402 U.S. at 177, 92 S.Ct. at 2344.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-9\">The Court began its analysis by pointing out that while a university certainly has the right to \u201c \u2018prescribe and control conduct\u2019 \u201d on its campus, the \u201c \u2018vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>402 U.S. at 180, 92 S.Ct. at 2345-46, <em>citing Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District, </em>393 U.S. 503, 507, 89 S.Ct. 733, 737, 21 L.Ed.2d 731, 738 (1969); <em>Shelton v. Tucker, </em>364 U.S. 479, 487, 81 S.Ct. 247, 251, 5 L.Ed.2d 231, 236 (1960). Perceiving college classrooms and their \u201csurrounding environs as a \u2018marketplace of ideas,\u2019 \u201d the Court reaffirmed \u201cthis Nation\u2019s dedication to safeguarding academic freedom.\u201d <em>Healy, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 180-81, 92 S.Ct. at 2346, <em>quoting Keyishian v.

Patterson, </em>357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958), Justice Harlan for a unanimous Court articulated the basis for recognizing the freedom of association that has since become firmly embodied in our First Amendment jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-11\">Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association____ It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the \u2018liberty\u2019 assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech____ Of course, it is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters, and state action which may have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-16\"><em>Id., </em>357 U.S. at 460-61, 78 S.Ct. at 1163, 1171. Thus, as the <em>Healy </em>Court held, free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>dom of association is \u201cimplicit\u201d in the specified First Amendment freedoms. <em>Healy, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 181, 92 S.Ct. at 2346.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">In <em>Healy- </em>the Court stated that there \u201ccan be no doubt that denial of official recognition, without justification, to college organizations burdens or abridges\u201d the First Amendment freedom of association. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The university bears the burden of justifying its decision rejecting the application for recognition. <em>Id., </em>408 U.S. at 184, 92 S.Ct. at 2347. Although university authorities have a legitimate interest in prohibiting student activities intended to and likely to incite or produce imminent lawless action or those that materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school, the record in <em>Healy </em>disclosed only an unsubstantiated fear or apprehension that recognition of the group would produce such a result. <em>Id., </em>408 U.S. at 188-190, 92 S.Ct. at 2349-50, <em>citing Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1829, 23 L.Ed.2d 430, 434 (1969); and <em>Tinker, supra, </em>393 U.S. at 513, 89 S.Ct. at 740. Thus, the Court found the University\u2019s asserted reasons for denying recognition insufficient to meet its \u201cheavy burden\u201d of justifying the infringement on the students\u2019 right to freedom of expression. <em>Healy, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 184, 92 S.Ct. at 2348.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">We think that the standards enunciated in <em>Healy </em>are precisely on point in this case. We therefore turn to TAMU\u2019s asserted reasons for denying recognition to GSS to determine their constitutionality under <em>Healy. </em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">\n<em>Asserted Justifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ajz-dedup-0\">In his letter denying GSS official recognition, Dr. Koldus stated that GSS\u2019s goals and purposes were not consistent with the philosophy and goals of TAMU. This alone as a reason for denying recognition is clearly forbidden by <em>Healy, </em>where the Court specifically rejected for constitutional purposes the college president\u2019s statement that SDS\u2019s philosophies of destruction, violence and disruption were \u201c\u2018counter to the official policy of the college.\u2019 \u201d <em>Healy, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 187, 92 S.Ct. at 2349. The Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>The mere disagreement of the President with the group\u2019s philosophy affords no reason to deny it recognition. As repugnant aS these views may have been ..., the mere expression of them would not justify the denial of First Amendment rights. Whether petitioners did in fact advocate a philosophy of \u2018destruction\u2019 thus becomes immaterial. The College, acting here as the instrumentality of the State, may not restrict speech or association simply because it finds the views expressed by any group to be abhorrent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\"><em>Id:, </em>408 U.S. at 187-88, 92 S.Ct. at 2349.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">Dr. Koldus proffered two additional, more specific reasons for denying recognition to GSS. First, he stated that because homosexual conduct was illegal in Texas, it would be inappropriate for TAMU to recognize a group likely to \u201cincite, promote, and result\u201d in homosexual acts. Second, he stated that student organizations did not have the \u201ceducational experience, the responsibility or the authority to educate the larger public.\u201d The District Court did not reach these issues because its findings of fact precluded analysis under any form of heightened scrutiny.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">As to TAMU\u2019s asserted interest in preventing expression likely to \u201cincite, promote, and result\u201d in then-illegal homosexual activity, we emphasize that while Texas law may prohibit certain homosexual practices, no Texas law makes it a crime to <em>be </em>a homosexual. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any illegal activity has taken place as a result of GSS\u2019s existence in the past, \u00f1or is there any evidence that GSS is an organization devoted to advocacy and incitement of imminent illegal, specifically proscribed homosexual activity. Consistent with <em>Healy, </em>we cannot conclude that the \u201ccritical line ... between advocacy and action\u201d has been violated in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">We are not alone in reaching this conclusion. In <em>Gay Students Organization of the University of New Hampshire v. Bonner, </em>509 F.2d 652 (1st Cir.1974), the University suspended its earlier recognition of a gay group (GSO) and ordered a strict ban on the group\u2019s social functions after a GSO sponsored dance resulted in unfavorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>media coverage and criticism by the Governor of New Hampshire. The First Circuit held that the asserted interest in preventing illegal deviate sex acts was insufficient to justify impairment of the group\u2019s First Amendment rights because there were neither allegations nor evidence of any illegal or improper acts at GSO\u2019s social functions. The Court stated that mere \u201c \u2018undifferentiated fear or apprehension\u2019 of illegal conduct ... is not enough to overcome First Amendment rights, and speculation that individuals might at some time engage in illegal activity is insufficient to justify regulation by the state.\u201d <em>Id., </em>509 F.2d at 662, <em>citing Tinker, supra, </em>393 U.S. at 508, 89 S.Ct. at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">Similarly, in <em>Gay Alliance of Students v. Matthews, </em>544 F.2d 162 (4th Cir.1976), the Fourth Circuit concluded that because there was no evidence that the gay group in that case was \u201can organization devoted to carrying out illegal, specifically proscribed sexual practices,\u201d the University\u2019s argument that recognition of the group would increase the opportunity for illegal homosexual contact was insufficient to justify the infringement on First Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>at 166. Finally, in <em>Gay Lib v. University of Missouri, </em>558 F.2d 848 (8th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1080, 98 S.Ct. 1276, 55 L.Ed.2d 789, <em>reh. denied, </em>435 U.S. 981, 98 S.Ct. 1632, 56 L.Ed.2d 74 (1978), the District Court had held that nonrecognition of Gay Lib was justified by medical testimony showing that \u201crecognition of Gay Lib would probably result in ... violations of Missouri [sodomy] law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850. The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that even \u201caccepting the opinions of defendants\u2019 experts at face value, we find it insufficient to justify a governmental prior restraint on the right of a group of students to associate for the purposes avowed in their statement ... of purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-14\">With regard to Koldus\u2019 assertion that GSS lacked the experience to educate the public or provide referral services,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we point out that even if Koldus was correct in arguing that the University faculty and staff are better equipped to perform these functions, \u201cthe state and its agents are forbidden from usurping the students\u2019 right to choose.\u201d <em>Gay Alliance, supra, </em>544 F.2d at 166. At the heart of the freedom guaranteed by our Constitution is the freedom to choose \u2014 even if .that choice does not accord with the state\u2019s view- as to which choice is superior.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>Gay Students Or</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number><em>ganization, supra, </em>509 F.2d at 660, the First Circuit held that the gay group\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7p6\">efforts to organize the homosexual minority, \u201ceducate\u201d the public as to its plight, and obtain for it better treatment from individuals and from the government thus represent but another example of the assoeiational activity unequivocally singled out for protection in the very \u201ccore\u201d of association cases decided by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\"><em>Id. </em>More important, TAMU presented no evidence, nor did the District Court find, that such a goal would \u201cinfringe reasonable campus rules, interrupt classes, or substantially interfere with the opportunity of other students to obtain an education.\u201d <em>Healy, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 189, 92 S.Ct. at 2350.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">We therefore conclude that none of the reasons for nonrecognition proferred by Dr. Koldus are sufficient to justify the infringement on appellants\u2019 First Amendment rights. At trial, however, TAMU asserted yet another alleged justification.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It claimed that recognition of GSS would encourage more homosexual conduct, resulting in an increase in the number of persons with the psychological and physiological problems TAMU\u2019s experts claimed were more prevalent among homosexuals than among heterosexuals. Thus, TAMU argued that denial of recognition was justifiable as an appropriate means of protecting public health. The District Court stated that this testimony was \u201ccredible\u201d although it declined to rely on the evidence, pointing out that the University did not offer such a rationale as a basis for Kol-dus\u2019 decision in 1976;</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-9\">This asserted justification must fail for the same reasons the others did: TAMU has simply not proven that recognition will indeed imminently result in such dire consequences. The speculative evidence offered by the defendants\u2019 experts \u201cfor which no historical or empirical basis is disclosed,\u201d cannot justify TAMU\u2019s content-based refusal to recognize GSS. <em>Gay Lib, supra, </em>558 F.2d at 854. We think that on this record TAMU\u2019s public health argument is precisely the kind of \u201cundifferentiated fear or apprehension\u201d that the Supreme Court has repeatedly held \u201cis not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression.\u201d <em>Tinker, supra, </em>393 U.S. at 508, 89 S.Ct. at 737; <em>Healy, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 191, 92 S.Ct. at 2351.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-10\">In <em>Gay Lib, supra, </em>the Eighth Circuit concluded that denying recognition to a gay group \u201csmacks of penalizing persons for their status [as homosexuals] rather than their conduct, which is constitutionally impermissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 856, <em>citing Robinson v. California, </em>370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962). We similarly conclude that none of TAMU\u2019s asserted justifications are sufficient to overcome the violation of GSS\u2019s rights under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-11\">This leaves TAMU\u2019s final argument: that because it never created a forum open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>for First Amendment discourse, no First Amendment violation has taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-4\">\n<em>Public Forum</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">The District Court found that TAMU had not \u201ccreated a forum that is generally open to student groups\u201d because it had traditionally refused to recognize fraternal organizations. Finding that GSS was such a fraternal group, the Court concluded that GSS failed to come within the class of student groups entitled to First Amendment protection under <em>Widmar v. Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). This conclusion was erroneous. As we have already found, GSS was not merely a fraternal group and was not denied recognition on that basis. Rather, we think that GSS is similar to many other student groups that have received recognition in the TAMU forum<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u2014 except, of course, for the pro-homosexual nature of its message.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">Moreover, we do not agree that by virtue of its traditional exclusion of social fraternities, TAMU may escape the constitutional dictates of <em>Widmar, supra. </em>In <em>Widmar </em>the Supreme Court held that where a state supported university opens its facilities for use by student groups, it may not exclude a particular group based on the content of the group\u2019s intended speech absent a compelling state interest and proof that the interest would not be served by a less restrictive alternative. <em>Widmar, supra, </em>454 U.S. at 269-70, 102 S.Ct. at 274, 70 L.Ed.2d at 447-48, <em>citing Carey v. Brown, </em>447 U.S. 455, 461 &amp; 464-65, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2290 &amp; 2292, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980). As we interpret it, one of TAMU\u2019s arguments on appeal is that because it has traditionally refused to recognize fraternal groups, it has not created a \u201cgenerally open forum\u201d within the meaning of <em>Widmar; </em>thus it can refuse to recognize <em>any </em>group \u2014 not merely fraternal or social groups. In support of this argument, TAMU relies upon <em>Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Association, </em>460 U.S. 37, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although we have grave doubt that this really presents an arguable contention in view of TAMU\u2019s recognition of so many other similar groups, we assume that <em>Perry </em>requires us to reach the issue and proceed to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>whether <em>Perry </em>compels reversal or remand \u2014 or both.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">In <em>Perry, </em>the Supreme Court held that a public school district could constitutionally limit union use of its internal teacher mailbox system to the exclusive bargaining representative of its teachers. The <em>Perry </em>Court relied heavily on its finding that the mailbox system was not a \u201cpublic forum\u201d within the scope of <em>Widmar </em>\u2014 nor was it a \u201climited public forum\u201d open only to certain groups or for the discussion of certain subjects. 103 S.Ct. at 955, n. 7, 74 L.Ed.2d at 805, n. 7. We think that even if TAMU has not created a generally open forum, as in <em>Widmar, </em>it has at the very least created a limited public forum \u2014 which <em>Perry </em>tells us is \u201climited\u201d in the sense that \u201cthe constitutional right of access would ... extend only to entities of similar character\u201d to those granted access. <em>Id., </em>103 S.Ct. at 956, 74 L.Ed.2d at 806. Thus, the <em>Perry </em>Court held that if the school had opened its mailboxes to the Cub Scouts or the YMCA, it could not restrict access by \u201cother organizations that engage in activities of interest and educational relevance to students.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, then, because TAMU has opened its forum to other similar student groups, <em>see </em>n. 10, <em>supra, </em>it may not close the forum to GSS without a compelling reason for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">The conclusion that TAMU is at minimum a limited public forum is buttressed by our recent opinion in <em>Ysleta Federation of Teachers v. Ysleta Independent School District, </em>720 F.2d 1429, 1433 (5th Cir.1983), where we had occasion to interpret and apply <em>Perry </em>to a slightly different fact situation. In <em>Ysleta, </em>an employee organization\u2019s access to the school district\u2019s internal mail system was suspended by the school superintendent, who stated that certain materials distributed in the boxes by the appellant did not accord with his interpretation of school policy on a particular issue. <em>Id. </em>at 431. We began by recognizing that under <em>Perry, </em>the internal mail system of a public school is not a traditional public forum. <em>Id. </em>at 1432. We added, however, that such a mail system might become a designated public forum if the system is open for use by the general public. Similarly, it might become a \u201climited public forum by designation\u201d if the school opens it for use by certain groups or for the discussion of certain subjects. <em>Id., citing Perry, supra, </em>103 S.Ct. at 955 &amp; n. 7, 74 L.Ed.2d at 805 &amp; n. 7. We concluded that the Ysleta mail system was a \u201climited public forum by designation,\u201d for reasons similar to those that convince us that <em>Perry </em>presented a different forum than that we confront in the instant case.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">More important, and in our opinion dis-positive, is the fact that <em>Perry </em>squarely held that if the selective access policy adopted by the <em>Perry </em>schools functioned to \u201cdiscourage one viewpoint and advance another,\u201d strict scrutiny would apply \u201cregardless of whether a public forum [was] involved.\u201d <em>Perry, supra, </em>103 S.Ct. at 957, 74 L.Ed.2d at 807. The five member majority concluded that the schools\u2019 denial of access to all but one union was based on the unions\u2019 \u201cstatus,\u201d i.e., rival unions as opposed to exclusive bargaining unit, not their views.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Concluding that the access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>policy was viewpoint neutral, the Court questioned only whether the restriction was \u201creasonable in light of the purpose which the forum at issue serves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Contrastingly, in this case TAMU admits and the District Court found that TAMU allows other views of homosexuality to be presented on its campus. Moreover, the record shows that TAMU recognized other groups that sought acceptance and integration of their particular lifestyle in the University community.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We think that the denial of recognition to a student group wishing to express its own views on the same or similar subjects is clearly the sort of viewpoint based discrimination forbidden by <em>Perry </em>in any type of public forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-4\">This leads us to consider whether any of the asserted reasons for the denial of recognition constitute a sufficiently narrow and compelling state interest to uphold the denial under the public forum analysis we have discussed <em>supra. </em>We reach and decide the issue for the same reasons discussed at footnote 17, <em>supra. </em>As already determined, all of TAMU\u2019s asserted reasons for nonrecognition were insufficient to justify infringement of GSS\u2019s rights under the straightforward First Amendment analysis. For the same reasons, they are insufficient to state a compelling interest for content-based regulation in TAMU\u2019s forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-10\">\n<em>Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-11\">GSS also asserts that the District Court erred in finding that, any award of damages was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Appellants urge us to \u201ccarefully craft\u201d a judgment wherein monetary damages would come from bookstore profits or from student service fees, neither of which funds are kept in the state treasury. They cite, however, no authority that convinces us that a federal court should exercis\u00e9 any such power to avoid the proscription of the Eleventh Amendment. We are convinced that the District Court properly applied Supreme Court precedent in <em>Zentgraf v. Texas A &amp; M University, </em>492 F.Supp. 265 (S.D.Tex.1980), a sex discrimination suit brought against TAMU. After examining the legal relationship between the state and TAMU,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the Court concluded that because TAMU was an alter ego of the State of Texas, \u201cany suit against the University or its officials for monetary relief is a suit against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>the state and thereby barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">TAMU\u2019s refusal to recognize GSS as an on-campus student organization impermissibly denied appellants their First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The judgment of the District Court is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for the entry of appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1383-15\">.

That this theory was an afterthought is supported by the fact that the parties appear to have agreed at the start of the trial that GSS had stated a prima facie First Amendment case merely by introducing in' evidence the application for recognition and Koldus\u2019 letter of denial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-10\">Defense Counsel: I think, your Honor, as a matter of fact, I think he might have accomplished his burden____ It is up to us then to show that there was a good reason not to grant the permit. And we propose to do that for two reasons. One, our expert testimony will show that this recognition will lead to increased homosexual conduct which is presently against the laws of Texas. And, too, the venereal disease rate as well as other health problems of the homosexuals is much greater than the normal population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-16\">The Court: ... so truly it seems to me the only issue to be tried is whether or not there is a compelling state interest that would override the First Amendment right that you all allege to have been denied and which are admittedly denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-17\">Defense Counsel: I think we have got the big burden in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-18\">The parties then agreed that counsel for GSS would begin with a \"bare bones\u201d or \"brief presentation\u201d of the prima facie case and then put on expert testimony, anticipating the, need to rebut the defense\u2019s evidence of compelling state interest. As late as the third day of trial, the trial judge stated, \"I think we all agreed that there was at least a prima facie case and that [counsel for GSS] had the problem of putting on as an initial proposition his witnesses to refute and rebut what [the defense witnesses] are going to do.\u201d Thus, because the case was tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>with the parties apparently agreeing that a pri-ma facie case was stated, we cannot fault GSS for failing to present further evidence of the service-related nature of the group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1387-13\">.

Could we see no reason in the record to overturn this finding of fact, logic would compel us to find it clearly erroneous. At a very minimum, GSS's quest for recognition, coupled with its desire to publicize its meetings and activities \u2014 indeed the very filing of this lawsuit \u2014 is clearly a \"message\u201d that its members reject society\u2019s traditional expectations that they associate furtively and in fear that their homosexuality will be detected. Dr. Skinner\u2019s testimony that the group desired to convince the greater public that they are \"different\u201d only with respect to their choice of a romantic partner bears this out. <em>See </em>note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1387-18\">. The <em>1981 </em>TAMU Student Organizations Guide lists 21 service organizations, including three national service fraternities or sororities, while listing only six political groups. TAMU has also recognized a Women's Awareness Group, which is described as \"a group of women <em>and </em>men who discuss women's role in society and especially how women\u2019s rights relate to life\u201d at TAMU. The MSC Black Awareness Group \"promotes a better understanding of the heritage and culture of Black Americans through cultural and social programs.\u201d When asked how she would describe GSS\u2019s \"message,\u201d Dr. Skinner replied that GSS \"seeks to inform the students who would not otherwise have any idea of what goes on of the fact that gay people live and function primarily the same as anyone else with the exception that their choice of romantic partner is one of the same gender.\" In our view, this description is highly similar to that put forth by the officially-recognized Women\u2019s and Black students' groups.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1388-8\">.

The Court also observed that use of campus bulletin boards and the school newspaper were essential to the group\u2019s associational interest as devices for communication. <em>Id. </em>Finally, \"the organization's ability to participate in the intellectual give and take of campus debate, and to pursue its stated purposes, is limited by denial of access to the customary media for communicating with the administration, faculty members, and other students.\u201d <em>Id., </em>408 U.S. at 181-82, 92 S.Ct. at 2346.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">In the instant case, the benefits of recognition denied to GSS included all of the above, as well as the right to receive a portion of the TAMU bookstore profits. The <em>Healy </em>Court stated that the record did not enable it to consider the inability to receive funding from the school budget a factor. In this case, then, GSS was denied at least one additional benefit specifically found lacking in <em>Healy. Healy, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 182 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. at 2346 n. 8. <em>See also </em>list of benefits of gaining recognition at note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">. The Court remanded, however, because it was unable to ascertain from the record whether the college\u2019s requirements for recognition included that the group formally affirm its willingness to abide by reasonable campus regulations, or whether the group intended to abide by those regulations. Thus, the Court concluded that recognition \"may be denied to any group that reserves the right to violate any [constitutionally] valid campus rules with which it disagrees.\u201d In <em>Healy, </em>however, on-campus SDS representatives had \u201cequivocated\u201d during a hearing before the Student Affairs Committee when asked whether the group could ever envision interrupting a class and when asked other similar questions. This, coupled with SDS participation in unrest on other campuses, raised the \u201cconsiderable question\u201d whether they intended to abide by reasonable regulations regarding campus disruption. <em>Id., </em>408 U.S. at 193-94, 92 S.Ct. at 2252-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">In the instant case, on the other hand, Dr. Skinner specifically testified that GSS was willing to agree to all reasonable restrictions imposed by TAMU. Moreover, there was no testimony that gay organizations on other campuses had failed to comply with university regulations. Perceiving no evidence in this case that GSS intends to flaunt constitutionally valid TAMU regulations, we see no reason to follow the <em>Healy </em>Court\u2019s lead in remanding on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">. At oral argument, counsel for TAMU argued that remand for new findings and conclusions would be necessary were we to hold that the District Court erred in failing to apply heightened scrutiny to the facts of this case. We do not agree, for several reasons. First, during trial, the District Court permitted full development of appellees' asserted compelling state interests. Indeed, the case went forward upon an understanding that this was the sole issue before the Court. See discussion at notes 7 and 8, <em>supra. </em>Inexplicably, the Court made only passing mention of its conclusions with regard to any of the evidence adduced during the entire trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-7\">At trial, Defendants did offer evidence that recognition of Gay Student Services would tend to encourage more homosexual conduct, resulting not only in violations of the penal code but also in an increase in the number of persons with psychological and medical problems associated with homosexuality. The Court finds the testimony that male homosexuals pose a significant public health problem because they have greater incidence of venereal disease to be credible. While the compelling need for all state agencies, including Texas A &amp; M University, to discourage this public health risk might be a sufficient basis for denial of recognition o.f Gay Student Services, the University did not offer this reason as a basis for Koldus\u2019 decision in 1976, and the Court does not rely upon this evidence as a basis for its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-12\">Instead of basing its conclusions on the theories and evidence before it, the Court adopted TAMU's after-the-fact asserted justification \u2014 that recognition was denied because the \"fraternal\u201d and \"social\" nature of GSS was not \u201cconsistent with the goals and philosophies\u201d of TAMU. We have already found this conclusion clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-13\">Faced with a fully developed record upon which the trial court deliberately chose not to rule, an eight year old case before us for the second time, and a long overdue request for injunctive relief from violation of a fundamental constitutional right, we decline the opportunity of a second remand. Lest we be criticized for our perhaps overzealous approach, we point out that the Supreme Court did much the same thing in <em>First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 786-87, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1421, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). There, the Court merely observed that the lower court had failed to subject the statute at issue to the appropriate level of scrutiny \"because of its view that the First Amendment does not apply to appellants\u2019 proposed speech,\u201d and moved on to examine the state\u2019s asserted interests in regulating corporate speech. <em>Id., </em>435 U.S. at 787, 98 S.Ct. at 1421.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">. GSS\u2019s education and referral goals are consistent with the aims of the three gay groups in the other Circuit Court cases- we have discussed. In <em>Gay Students Organization, </em>the group\u2019s purposes included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-7\">3) In an effort to educate the public about bisexuality and homosexuality, this organization will attempt to affect social changes through public relations measures such as guest lecturers, free literature, films, newspaper articles and radio programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-8\">4) Not the least important reason for establishing a gay organization is to give bisexual and homosexual members of the college community a place to communicate with each other and form discussion groups so that a healthy gay consciousness can evolve among students.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-9\">509 F.2d at 654, n. 1.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-10\">Similarly, in <em>Gay Alliance, </em>the group sought (a) to develop a supportive community among individuals who believe in the right of self-determination with regard to sexual orientation, [and] (b) to convene educational situations for members of GAS and for members of the university community regarding homosexual life____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-15\">544 F.2d at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-16\">Finally, in <em>Gay Lib </em>the students\u2019 aims included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-17\">(a) To provide a dialogue between the homosexual and heterosexual members of the university community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-18\">(b) To dispel the lack of information and develop an understanding of the homosexual at the University of Missouri.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-19\">(c) To alleviate the unnecessary burden of shame felt by the local homosexual population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-20\">(d) To help education, the community and the homosexual to understand the social roles that the homosexual now plays in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-21\">(e) To work closely with established university and community groups for a broader sharing of knowledge and information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-22\">558 F.2d at 850.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1393-23\">. In finding that \u201c'affiliation of individuals with homosexual activist organizations may have adverse consequences to some individuals involved,\u2019 \u201d was an insufficient reason for nonrecognition of a gay group, the Court in <em>Gay </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number><em>Alliance </em>stated that the \u201cvery essence of the First Amendment is that each individual makes his own decision as to whether joining an organization would be harmful to him, and whether any countervailing benefits outweigh the potential harm.\" 544 F.2d at 165.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1394-7\">. Amicus Lambda Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund argues that it was reversible error for the District Court to admit evidence concerning this \"hindsight\" justification over GSS's objections. Because the speech violation occurred at the time recognition was denied, Amicus argues, efforts by the state to \u201cfabricate\u201d some compelling interest \u201cyears after\u201d the denial should be ignored by the Court. <em>See Van Ooteghem v.

In addition to the groups described at n. 10, <em>supra, </em>we point out that O.A.S.I.S., a TAMU-rec-ognized religious group, was apparently authorized to present the view that homosexuality conflicted with the teachings of the Bible. The group publicized its presentation on TAMU bulletin boards with large posters displaying chained hands, captioned \u201cHomosexuality \u2014 Not so Gay.\u201d It therefore appears that TAMU did not object to the presentation of negative ideas about homosexuality by its recognized student groups.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">. In <em>Perry, </em>the Supreme Court laid out three types of public property \u201cforums\u201d for expressive activity. States may not completely prohibit communication in \"quintessential public forums,\u201d such as streets and parks.

Justice Brennan, joined by three other Justices, dissented strongly, believing that the majority's First Amendment analysis was flawed by its initial focus on the public forum doctrine. The dissent favored the direct approach to what it termed \"discrimination [that] amounts to censorship\u201d \u2014 a clear content-based violation of the First Amendment. The majority was apparently unconvinced. It is unclear after <em>Perry, </em>then, whether application of the public forum doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>trine set out therein must precede direct First Amendment analysis in cases where the doctrine is implicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">.

Although the record supports the finding that several classes have had speakers on homosexuality, the conclusion that this factor alone makes TAMU a place where ideas about homosexuality are \"freely presented\u201d is clearly belied by the fact that recognition was denied to GSS. <em>See abo </em>discussion regarding other student groups at nn. 10 &amp; 21, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1397-12\">.
