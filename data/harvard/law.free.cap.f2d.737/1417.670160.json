Crain asserts that he \u201cis not subject to the jurisdiction, taxation, nor regulation of the state,\u201d that the \u201cInternal Revenue Service, Incorporated\u201d lacks authority to exercise the judicial power of the United States, that the Tax Court is unconstitutionally attempting to exercise Article III powers, and that jurisdiction over his person has never been affirmatively proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-26\">We perceive no need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning and copious citation of precedent; to do so might suggest that these arguments have some colorable merit. The constitutionality of our income tax system \u2014 including the role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>played within that system by the Internal Revenue Service and the Tax Court\u2014has long been established. We affirm the dismissal of Crain\u2019s spurious \u201cpetition\u201d and the assessment of a penalty imposed by the Tax Court for instituting a frivolous proceeding. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-4\">The government asks us to assess penalties against Crain for bringing this frivolous appeal, as is authorized by Fed.R.App.P. 38. In <em>Parker v. C.I.R., </em>724 F.2d 469, 472 (5th Cir.1984), we sounded \u201ca cautionary note to those who would persistently raise arguments against the income tax which have been put to rest for years. The full range of sanctions in Rule 38 hereafter shall be summoned in response to a totally frivolous appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-5\">We are sensitive to the need for the courts to remain open to all who seek in good faith to invoke the protection of law. An appeal that lacks merit is not always\u2014 or often\u2014frivolous. However, we are not obliged to suffer in silence the filing of baseless, insupportable appeals presenting no colorable claims of error and designed only to delay, obstruct, or incapacitate the operations of the courts or any other governmental authority. Crain\u2019s present appeal is of this sort. It is a hodgepodge of unsupported assertions, irrelevant platitudes, and legalistic gibberish. The government should not have been put to the trouble of responding to such spurious arguments, nor this court to the trouble of \u201cadjudicating\u201d this meritless appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-6\">Accordingly, we grant the government\u2019s request. The United States shall recover from appellant Crain twice its cost of this appeal. Additionally, we assess against Crain a damage award of $2000 in favor of the appellee United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
