PETERSON, Petitioner, v. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, Respondent.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b1085-7\">Appeal No. 84-1035.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b1085-8\">United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b1085-9\">June 15, 1984.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1085-14\">Before RICH, DAVIS and BALDWIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1085-15\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-16\">Petitioner, Catherine L. Peterson (Peterson), by this appeal seeks review of the accounting method employed by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) for calculating attorney fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g). Peterson is represented by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-18\">NTEU, on April 23, 1984, moved this court to add the MSPB as party-respondent in the above captioned case, seeking to correct its naming of the Department of Energy (DOE), the employing agency, as respondent, in light of the recent ruling of this court in <em>Hopkins v. MSPB, </em>725 F.2d 1368, 1372 n. 3 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-19\">Also, on April 24, 1984, the MSPB and DOE jointly moved for a <em>ruling </em>that DOE, the agency which took the <em>underlying </em>personnel action, is the proper respondent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-20\">The footnote in <em>Hopkins </em>relied on reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-21\">3. While we need not reach the issue here, we believe it . useful to address the question of who is respondent in appeals to this court for review of MSPB decisions granting or denying attorney fee requests \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d under \u00a7 7701(g)(1). This issue would have arisen here, for example, if Hopkins had timely filed his fee request, the MSPB had rejected it on the merits, and he had appealed that rejection to this court. In that situation, for the same reasons as enunciated above, we believe that the MSPB should be named respondent since it is the \u201cagency responsible for taking the <em>action\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., requiring the employing agency to pay attorney fees. \u00a7 7701(g)(1). We recognize that the plain language of \u00a7 7703(a)(2), referring to a final order or decision \u201cissued by the Board under section 7701,\u201d could be construed the other way, since attorney fee requests are filed under \u00a7 7701. Nevertheless, the \u201cagency responsible for taking the action\u201d is not the employing agency but the MSPB, where \u201caction\u201d is interpreted to mean action on the attorney fee request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>NTEU interprets this footnote, saying, \u201cThe Court there states that appeals from MSPB attorney\u2019s fees decisions must name the MSPB as respondent. In order to comply with this <em>[Hopkins] </em>decision, NTEU files the instant motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">While the footnote referred to is admittedly dictum, it follows the dispositive reasoning of the case which held, \u201cIn short, the touchstone for determining who is to be named respondent is Congress\u2019 own words, \u2018the agency responsible for taking the action.\u2019 [5 USC] \u00a7 7702(a)(2) [sic \u00a7 7703(a)(2)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">The issue before us is whether the <em>method </em>of calculation employed by the MSPB was correct. We find that the MSPB is responsible for taking the action in issue according to the statute, i.e., selecting the method of calculation. Accordingly, we find that the MSPB is the proper party and NTEU\u2019s motion to add the MSPB as party respondent is <em>granted. </em>The joint motion of MSPB and DOE to rule that DOE, rather than the MSPB, is the proper respondent is <em>denied.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
