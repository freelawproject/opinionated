Taylor\u2019s complaint against Gallagher alleged negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">The essential facts are not in dispute. Taylor owned two IHOP franchises and in the early 1970\u2019s had a dispute with IHOP concerning money owed IHOP under the franchise agreements. On March 15, 1974, the parties entered into an agreement under which Taylor paid IHOP $5,000 and signed a promissory note for $35,000, an amount representing a preliminary determination of Taylor's indebtedness to IHOP as of December 9, 1973. The parties also agreed to submit the issue of Taylor\u2019s indebtedness prior to December 9, 1973, to arbitration and to substitute the arbitrators\u2019 determination of Taylor\u2019s indebtedness as of December 9, 1973, if any, for the promissory note figure of $35,000. The March 15, 1974, agreement also obligated Taylor to pay on a current basis all open account indebtedness arising on or after December 10, 1973. The agreement gave IHOP judgments for possession of both of Taylor\u2019s franchises, but the judgments were to be stayed so long as Taylor remained in compliance with the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">In January 1975, IHOP took possession of one of Taylor\u2019s franchises and gave notice that it intended to take possession of the other. Gallagher filed suit on Taylor\u2019s behalf in Worcester Superior Court to enjoin IHOP from taking possession. IHOP counterclaimed in three counts: two counts claiming recovery for Taylor\u2019s open account indebtedness incurred since December 10, 1973, and the third count claiming approximately $17,000, the amount allegedly remaining due on the $35,000 promissory note. The superior court appointed a master.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">In December 1976, the arbitrators found that the net amount owed by Taylor to IHOP as of December 9, 1973, equalled $13,025.23. Under the March 15, 1974, agreement, this figure should have replaced the $35,000 amount in the promissory note. On February 14, 1977, Gallagher had the arbitral award confirmed in a separate action in superior court. The next day the master in Taylor\u2019s suit against IHOP filed a report essentially adverse to Taylor on each of IHOP\u2019s three counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">Gallagher then filed two motions, with accompanying briefs and attachments, that attempted to convince the superior court to substitute, pursuant to the parties\u2019 March 15, 1974, agreement, the arbitral award for the $35,000 promissory note. The present suit focuses on the adequacy <em>vel non </em>of Gallagher\u2019s attempts to bring the arbitral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>award and its significance to the attention of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Gallagher filed the first motion, a \u201cMotion for Leave to File Supplemental Pleading \u2014 Answer to Counterclaim\u201d, on February 23, 1977. The supplemental pleading alleged overpayment on the modified promissory note as a further defense to IHOP\u2019s third counterclaim. The superior court denied this motion on April 15, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">A year later, on May 1, 1978, Gallagher filed a \u201cMotion for Judgment\u201d. The proposed judgment would have dismissed IHOP\u2019s third counterclaim and awarded Taylor a sum equivalent to his alleged overpayments on the promissory note. The superior court denied this motion on May 9, 1978. Soon thereafter, the court entered judgment in favor of IHOP as recommended by the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Taylor then retained a new attorney, Douglas Moxham of Hale &amp; Dorr, for his appeal from the superior court judgment. On appeal, Taylor (through Moxham) did not challenge the superior court\u2019s failure to substitute the arbitral award for the $35,-000 promissory note. The appeals court affirmed, <em>Taylor v. International Industries, Inc., </em>8 Mass.App. 865, 398 N.E.2d 501 (1979), and the Supreme Judicial Court denied further appellate review. 379 Mass. 928 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Undaunted, Taylor (through Moxham) filed a motion for relief from judgment in the superior court, arguing that the superi- or court record \u201cdid not include reference to an arbitration award and judgment\u201d. The court denied this motion, and Taylor again appealed. While the appeal was pending, Taylor, who by this time had replaced Moxham with another attorney, filed the instant action against Gallagher in federal district court. The state appellate court summarily affirmed the denial of Taylor\u2019s motion for relief from judgment and assessed double costs and 12% interest against Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Taylor\u2019s main criticism of Gallagher\u2019s performance in the original superior court action concerns Gallagher\u2019s failure explicitly to mention the arbitral award on the face of either the supplemental pleading or the proposed judgment. Taylor argues that in Gallagher\u2019s two attempts to notify the superior court of the arbitral award, Gallagher did \u201cno more than briefly note\u201d in accompanying memoranda the existence or outcome of the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">If by \u201cbriefly noted\u201d Taylor means that Gallagher noted the arbitral award only in a brief, then Taylor may have a point. But Taylor\u2019s factual claims and legal analysis otherwise have no merit, as an examination of the superior court record amply demonstrates. In briefs accompanying both motions, Gallagher clearly explained the significance of both the arbitral award and the promissory note under the March 15, 1974, agreement. In both briefs, Gallagher noted the amount of the arbitral award and stated, \u201cIt is this figure [$13,-025.23] which should be substituted for the $35,000.00 note.\u201d Gallagher attached to his briefs copies of the arbitrators\u2019 decision and of the separate superior court judgment confirming the arbitrators\u2019 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">Despite Gallagher\u2019s efforts, the superior court entered judgment for IHOP in an amount that did not reflect the arbitrators\u2019 decision. While the record contains no explanation of why the superior court ignored the arbitrators\u2019 decision, we suppose that if Gallagher\u2019s performance had been so egregiously inadequate as to cause the superior court to treat Taylor unjustly, then Taylor\u2019s new attorney Moxham would have mentioned the arbitral award in Taylor\u2019s first appeal. But he did not. The state appellate court found Taylor\u2019s second appeal, which focused on the superior court\u2019s lack of recognition of the arbitral award, to be frivolous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">In the present action, the district court held, in granting Gallagher\u2019s motion for summary judgment, that \u201cthese facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>reveal no genuine issue of material fact for a jury to resolve\u201d. We agree. Taylor\u2019s conclusory (mis)characterizations of Gallagher\u2019s submissions to the superior court do not suffice to raise genuine issues of material fact that would preclude summary judgment against Taylor. <em>See Over the Road Drivers, Inc. v. Transport Insurance Co., </em>637 F.2d 816, 819-20, (1st Cir. 1980) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Given the absence of genuine, material factual issues, summary judgment is appropriate where, as here, only one inference can be drawn from the facts. <em>See, e.g., Wallace v. Shade Tobacco Growers Agricultural Ass\u2019n, </em>642 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>O\u2019Neill v. Dell Publishing Co., </em>630 F.2d 685, 690 (1st Cir.1980). Taylor argues that the district court usurped the jury\u2019s role in determining that the facts presented by Taylor could not prove malpractice. Taylor contends that a malpractice suit \u201crequires a determination as to reasonableness, which determination must be left to the jury and is therefore wholly inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Although a court may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations in granting summary judgment, the court may end a suit before trial if the court determines that, taking the facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, no reasonable juror could find for that party. <em>E.g., O\u2019Neill v. Dell Publishing Co., </em>630 F.2d at 690; <em>Manganaro v. Delaval Separator Co., </em>309 F.2d 389, 392-93 (1st Cir.1962). Summary judgment is inappropriate in negligence actions only if genuine issues of material fact exist or if reasonable jurors could draw different inferences from agreed facts. <em>See Croley v. Matson Navigation Co., </em>434 F.2d 73, 75 (5th Cir.1970). If the facts of this case admitted of more than one inference regarding the reasonableness of Gallagher\u2019s actions, then the issue of reasonableness should have gone to the-jury. However, on the record before us, we see no facts that could reasonably contradict the inference that Gallagher acted with skill and diligence in apprising the superior court of the arbitral award and its significance. Taylor may not create the possibility of conflicting inferences through wishful thinking about how a sympathetic jury might justify ordering Gallagher to compensate Taylor for the superior court\u2019s alleged oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Under the circumstances, the district court did not err in denying Taylor\u2019s request for discovery. A court may grant summary judgment despite an opposing party\u2019s claim that discovery would yield additional facts where the opposing party has not alleged specific facts that could be developed through such discovery. <em>See, e.g., Santoni v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., </em>677 F.2d 174, 179 (1st Cir. 1982); <em>Neely v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., </em>584 F.2d 341, 344 (9th Cir. 1978). Taylor did not show, through a Rule 56(f) affidavit or otherwise, how discovery could have breathed life into his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">In this appeal, Taylor understandably has attempted to shore up his malpractice claim by faulting not merely Gallagher\u2019s failure to bring the arbitral award to the superior court\u2019s attention, but, also Gallagher\u2019s tardiness in doing so. However, Taylor is the tardy one: He did not mention in his complaint the timeliness of Gallagher\u2019s submission of claims to arbitration or of Gallagher\u2019s attempts to bring the arbitral award to the superior court\u2019s attention. Taylor made only a passing reference to timeliness in his 19-page memorandum in opposition to Gallagher\u2019s motion for sum-, mary judgment. Taylor\u2019s affidavit made no mention of timeliness. In sum, the record on which the district court awarded summary judgment did not adequately present Taylor\u2019s current argument that Gallagher moved too slowly in asserting Taylor\u2019s rights in the superior court. <em>See Over the Road Drivers, Inc. v. Transport Insurance Co., </em>637 F.2d at 818-19 (summary judgment appropriate where opposing party was unable \u201cto point to specific facts that were properly asserted in its affidavits and supporting materials which, if estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>lished at trial, would entitle it to prevail ...\").</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\n<em>The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Costs to appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\">. The appellate court awarded double costs and interest on the amount of the judgment against Taylor, thus implying that the appeal was frivolous. <em>See </em>Mass.R.App.P. 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
