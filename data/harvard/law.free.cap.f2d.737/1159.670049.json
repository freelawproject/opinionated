Because we find the Commission had no authority to vacate the exemptions, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-29\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-30\">This court explained the procedure by which certain hydroelectric projects are exempted from the licensing requirements of the Federal Power Act in <em>Hirschey v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number><em>FERC, </em>701 F.2d 215 (D.C.Cir.1983). Part I of the Federal Power Act makes it unlawful for any person, \u201cfor the purpose of developing electric power, to construct, operate, or maintain a dam ... across, along, or in any of the navigable waters of the United States, ... except under and in accordance with the terms of a ... license granted pursuant to [the Act].\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 817 (1982). But FERC may relieve hydroelectric projects below a certain size from the Act\u2019s requirements. Section 405 of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 2705 (1982), allows the Commission, by rule or order, to \u201cgrant an exemption ... from the requirements (including the licensing requirements) of Part I of the [Act] to small hydroelectric power projects having a proposed installed capacity of 5,000 kilowatts [5 MW] or less....\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 2705(d) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">The exemption procedures are governed by regulation. Applications are initially reviewed by the Commission staff to ensure compliance with the filing requirements. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 4.105(b), 4.31(c)-(g) (1983). If the filing is in compliance, the Commission notifies the applicant that its application has been accepted for filing. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.31(c)(1). Acceptance for filing does not preclude the Commission from later rejecting the application; however, it does indicate that the applicant has conformed to the Commission\u2019s rules for exemption applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-11\">FERC then gives public notice of the filing and invites protests, petitions to-intervene, or competitive proposals. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.31(c)(2). Under its own rules, the Commission has 120.days to act on an application for an exemption. Unless the Commission affirmatively acts to grant the exemption in whole or in part, deny the exemption, or to suspend the 120-day rule, the application is automatically \u201cdeemed to be found consistent with the public interest and granted.\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.105(b)(4)-(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">That decision is final unless a rehearing is allowed. Any party may petition for rehearing within 30 days after the grant of an exemption; if no rehearing petition is timely filed, however, the exemption grant becomes unreviewable. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>825 l </em>(1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-13\">Commission rules also provide that where mutually exclusive license applications are filed, the first-filed applicant will be favored \u201cunless the Commission determines the plans of the subsequent applicant would better develop the ... affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>water resources.\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.104(e)(2) (the \u201cfirst-in-time\u201d rule). Notwithstanding FERC\u2019s representation to the contrary, <em>see </em>Brief for Respondent at 21-24, this rule does not mandate a comparative evaluation of the competing applications, <em>Hirschey, </em>701 F.2d at 219; the decision to engage in formal comparative evaluation is a \u201cpurely discretionary matter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">In <em>Hirschey, </em>petitioner had applied for, and received, a license exemption pursuant to the automatic exemption rule. Although no party had sought rehearing, the Commission <em>sua sponte </em>vacated the exemption. FERC asserted that it had inadvertently failed to suspend the 120-day rule and that because mutually exclusive applications had been filed, a comparative evaluation of the competing proposals was required. According to the Commission, vacating Hir-schey\u2019s exemption was therefore necessary. 701 F.2d at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">On appeal, FERC contended that it had authority to vacate petitioner\u2019s exemption under sections 313(a) and 309 of the Federal Power Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court rejected these contentions. Section 313(a), the court said, gave the Commission power to correct its orders before the record on appeal had been filed or \u201c <em>\u2018the time for filing a petition for judicial review ha[d] expired.\u2019 \u201d </em>701 F.2d at 218 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. FPC, </em>322 F.2d 999, 1004 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 941, 84 S.Ct. 346, 11 L.Ed.2d 272 (1963)). Because the time for seeking appellate review had expired, the court held that \u201csection 313(a) provide[d] no authority for the FERC\u2019s action ____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">Resort to section 309 was equally unavailing. That section, the court found, simply had no application to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-13\">The general authority of section 309 does not empower the FERC to vacate final and nonreviewable license exemptions. To imply such authority from section 309 would make a sham of the carefully crafted license exemption regulations and render superfluous the <em>specific </em>revocation procedures set forth in 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.106.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-14\">701 F.2d at 218 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-15\">According to the <em>Hirschey </em>court, \u201cthe grant of exemption marks the end of the application proceeding.\u201d 701 F.2d at 218. While FERC had statutory authority to act upon the application \u2014 even to reject it\u2014 within the 120-day period, when the Commission did not act within the relevant time, \u201cpetitioner\u2019s application was automatically granted by virtue of Commission inaction with respect to a purely discretionary matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219. The opinion\u2019s conclusion as to the Commission\u2019s power to vacate an exemption was unequivocal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-16\">The exemption, when finally granted and the time fixed for rehearing it has passed, is not subject to revocation in whole or in part except as <em>specifically </em>authorized by Congress. Consequently, the Commission was without authority to revoke the exemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 218 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-18\"><em>Hirschey </em>rejected the Commission\u2019s argument that a comparative evaluation of competing applications was required: \u201cFERC can point to nothing in the relevant statutes or regulations, or in any proven agency practice, that <em>requires </em>comparative evaluation of mutually exclusive applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>tions for exemptions. Although 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.104(e)(2) contemplates the filing of competing applications, that provision simply provides that the first filed will be favored <em>unless </em>the FERC <em>affirmatively finds </em>that the later filed application is measurably better.\u201d 701 F.2d at 219 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">The opinion concluded that strong policy reasons underlie the requirement that the Commission be bound by its own rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYW_\">There is a strong interest in repose under any regime of legal rules. And particularly in this context \u2014 given the expense of developing hydroelectric projects \u2014 applicants, other potential investors and lending institutions must be able confidently to rely on the predictability of the FERC\u2019s procedural rules. To sustain the sudden reversal of a final and nonreviewable FERC decision on nothing more than an <em>assertion </em>of inadvertent error would run contrary to these important interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">701 F.2d at 219-20 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">This dispute is identical in all material respects to the <em>Hirschey </em>case. On December 14, 1981, International Paper filed applications for exemptions for two distinct projects which would use already-existing dams on the Lachute River in New York State. Those applications competed with the previously-filed license applications of the intervenors, Long Lake Energy Corporation and the State of New York. Both intervenors were served with notice of petitioner\u2019s filing. Brief for Petitioner at 7-8. Long Lake moved, at that time, to have petitioner\u2019s applications rejected, arguing that International Paper's two proposals were, in effect, a single project that exceeded the 5 MW limit for exemptions. Long Lake also asserted that petitioner did not possess the requisite property interests to qualify for an exemption. Brief for Respondent at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-12\">The Commission did not respond to Intervenor\u2019s objections; instead, FERC notified International Paper on February 11, 1982 that its applications had been accepted for filing, and that both exemptions would automatically be granted unless the Commission acted upon them within 120 days. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 35-40.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-13\">The Commission did not act within the 120-day period. International Paper\u2019s exemption applications were thus \u201cdeemed ... consistent with the public interest and granted\u201d by operation of law on June 11, 1982. On that date the thirty-day period for filing petitions for rehearing began to run. Despite having filed competing license applications and having notice of the Commission\u2019s prior acceptance, neither intervenor filed a petition for rehearing to contest the automatic grant of petitioner\u2019s exemptions. Petitioner\u2019s exemptions became nonreviewable on July 11, 1982. <em>See Hirschey, </em>701 F.2d at 217.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>On July 20, 1982, the Commission, <em>sua sponte, </em>vacated the exemptions granted to International Paper.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Resorting to the same rationale it used to justify its actions in <em>Hirschey, </em>the Commission explained that it had inadvertently failed to suspend the 120-day rule and that where competing license applications were on file, the Commission had to perform a comparative analysis of those applications. FERC maintained that section 313(a) of the Federal Power Act and its inherent authority to remedy mistakes empowered it to correct its failure to suspend the 120-day rule and return the parties to the <em>status quo ante. See Long Lake Energy Corp., </em>20 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,058 (July 20, 1982); Brief for Respondent at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">On September 20, 1982, FERC granted International Paper\u2019s petition for rehearing solely for the purpose of further consideration. Following the rejection of its position in <em>Hirschey, </em>however, the Commission sought to limit that case to its own facts and denied International Paper\u2019s petition stating that it was \u201cclearly ministerial error for an exemption to be granted when there were two earlier-filed license applications pending.\u201d J.A. at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">On appeal, FERC seeks to avoid the force of the <em>Hirschey </em>decision just as it did in the order denying International Paper\u2019s petition for reconsideration. Abandoning the reasoning articulated in its July 20, 1982 order revoking petitioner\u2019s exemptions, the Commission now asserts that it has the power to vacate an otherwise final and nonreviewable order under the \u201cministerial\u201d or \u201cclerical\u201d error doctrine. <em>See </em>Brief for Respondent at 18-28.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s claim appears to be that its failure to suspend the 120-day rule and conduct a comparative evaluation of the competing license applications within the time permitted by the rule was excusable because the Commission committed some sort of clerical or ministerial error. At oral argument, the Commission asserted that it had committed three separate ministerial errors in this case \u2014 its \u201cutter disregard\u201d of the first-in-time preference accorded Long Lake under 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.104(e)(2), its failure to consider the dam safety regulations, and its failure to consider the intervenor\u2019s arguments on the merits of petitioner\u2019s exemptions even though those arguments had been raised before, and never reasserted after, the Commission accepted petitioner\u2019s applications for filing. Only the first two \u201cerrors\u201d were specified in the Commission\u2019s briefs. Making these mistakes, the Commission contends, conferred upon it the power to revoke petitioner\u2019s exemptions and order a comparative evaluation of the several projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\">The argument is specious. The Commission has pointed to no clerical mistake or ministerial oversight that prevented or excused it from acting on petitioner\u2019s applications within the allowable time. Indeed, the Commission has offered no explanation for its failure to suspend the 120-day rule. The Commission took no action, and apparently did not attempt to take any action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>during the 120 days which could have been frustrated by some clerical error. And, although FERC assures us that it intended to review the safety concerns it now finds so troublesome within the 120 days, we find no record support for this assertion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We cannot excuse FERC from compliance with its own rules merely because it chooses to label that failure a \u201cministerial error.\u201d In these circumstances, the expansion of the clerical error doctrine to permit revocation of petitioner's exemptions validly granted by operation of law would leave the Commission free to disregard any statutory or regulatory requirement. We agree with the <em>Hirschey </em>court\u2019s refusal to \u201csustain the sudden reversal of a final and nonreviewable FERC decision on nothing more than an assertion of inadvertent error ....\u201d 701 F.2d at 220.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">The contours of the ministerial error doctrine need not be precisely defined to show that .the \u201cerrors\u201d alleged by the Commission fail to fall within those boundaries. The <em>Hirschey </em>court cited <em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. Frisco Transportation Co., </em>358 U.S. 133, 79 S.Ct. 170, 3 L.Ed.2d 172 (1958), as an example of the operation of the doctrine. In that case, a railroad affiliate (Frisco) had acquired several independent motor carriers pursuant to a statute that had long been construed to limit such acquisitions to \u201c \u2018operations which are auxiliary or supplementary to train service,\u2019 at least in the absence of special circumstances which might justify less restrictive operations.\u201d 358 U.S. at 135 n. 2,141, 79 S.Ct. at 172 n. 2, 175. The <em>Frisco </em>Court upheld the ICG\u2019s power to correct the affiliate\u2019s operating certificate which \u2014 due solely to a clerical error \u2014 had allowed the affiliate to engage in unrestricted motor carrier services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">Since <em>Frisco </em>illustrates what the <em>Hir-schey </em>court meant by a ministerial error, the case deserves a rather full explanation. In administrative hearings to determine whether the proposed acquisitions met applicable statutory standards, the affiliate, Frisco, requested unrestricted operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>authority, but took the position that the proposed acquisitions would enable it to establish coordinated truck service with the train service of its parent railroad. 358 U.S. at 136, 79 S.Ct. at 172. The hearing examiner recommended approval of each acquisition \u201csubject to such further limitations, restrictions, or modifications as the Commission may hereafter find necessary ... to insure that the service shall be auxiliary to the train service of the [parent] railroad ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 79 S.Ct. at 172. A division of the Commission subsequently adopted the examiner\u2019s recommendations, including the above-quoted reservation. Although Frisco had sought unrestricted authority, it did not seek full Commission review of the division\u2019s report and, instead, notified the Commission that it would consummate the proposed acquisitions \u201csubject to the terms prescribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 79 S.Ct. at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">The operating certificates eventually issued by the Commission staff did not contain the original reservation of authority. 358 U.S. at 137, 79 S.Ct. at 173. The division subsequently reopened the acquisition proceedings and expressly limited Frisco\u2019s motor carrier authority to those services \u201cauxiliary or supplementary\u201d to the rail services of its parent. <em>Id. </em>at 137-39, 79 S.Ct. at 173-74. In an \u201cexhaustive report,\u201d the division concluded that the original reservation of authority had been inadvertently omitted from the certificates. The division also explained the mechanics of its internal practices relating to the issuance of certificates and pointed out how the error probably had occurred. <em>Id. </em>The full Commission affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">Frisco sought judicial review and, when the case reached the Supreme Court, argued that the Commission had no power to modify unconditional certificates. The Supreme Court found, however, that Frisco knew that the reservation of authority was included in the original grant of operating power; in fact, because the decisions of the hearing examiner and the division were not appealed to the full Commission, the Court concluded that Frisco acceded to the approval of \u201climited operations on the routes in question.\u201d 358 U.S. at 141, 79 S.Ct. at 175. Moreover, Frisco\u2019s initial position before the agency reflected congressional intent and long-standing agency practice to confine acquisitions of motor carriers by railroads to operations that would- supplement the services provided by the railroad. The original authority clearly stated that the right to impose future conditions on the certificates was reserved and was thus consistent with Frisco\u2019s understanding of Commission policy. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41, 79 S.Ct. at 174-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">It was only when the original authority was formally set into an operating certificate by the Commission\u2019s staff that the reservation was omitted. The Court found persuasive the Commission\u2019s explanation of how the omission occurred. The staff had no substantive authority to amend original orders; in fact, the Commission could not change its original decision without notifying the competing carriers who had protested the initial decision: \u201cThis factor militates strongly in favor of the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the reservations inadvertently were omitted____\u201d 358 U.S. at 143, 79 S.Ct. at 176. The publishing of certificates by the Commission staff was purely a mechanical task, limited to the reproduction of the original order. Because the staff usually dealt with certificates authorizing unrestricted service by non-rail affiliated motor carriers, however, the Court found that the reservation in these certificates was \u201cunusual, and it is easy to see how the restrictions were omitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143-44, 79 S.Ct. at 176-77. The Court concluded, therefore, that the Commission had statutory authority to correct Frisco\u2019s certificates to include the restrictions originally understood to be part of Frisco\u2019s operating authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">Cases decided by this circuit also demonstrate the limited character of the clerical error doctrine. In <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. FERC, </em>617 F.2d 809 (D.C.Cir.1980), the Commission had formally failed to. suspend one of petitioner\u2019s proposed rate schedules within the 30 days allowed for such action by the statute. 617 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>817. However, it was not disputed that FERC \u201cdecided to suspend the proposed schedule and amendment [within the 30 days] ... at a public hearing which [petitioner]^ counsel attended, nor that the Commission instructed [its] ... Secretary to issue the order on that day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-4\">There is no dispute in this case that the Commission <em>intended to act within the 30-day limit and thought that it had. </em>There is no question of prejudice to the petitioners, who were present at the meeting and who knew from three previous proceedings how the Commission would rule on its filing. In such circumstances, we hold that the Commission acted within the 30-day limit, even though the order expressing that action was, due to a clerical oversight, published one day late.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\"><em>Howard Sober, Inc. v. ICC, </em>628 F.2d 36 (D.C.Cir.1980) is to a similar effect. In that case, the ICC had ordered a modification of Sober\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity to include a restriction on Sober\u2019s authority that had been implicitly imposed in a prior proceeding but had not been \u201cinelude[d] on the certificate due to a ministerial error.\u201d 628 F.2d at 40-41. In the earlier proceeding, the Commission had prohibited Dealers Transit, Inc. and all its affiliates from engaging in secondary driveaway movements. Although Sober was an affiliate of Dealers when that restriction had been imposed, it argued that the Commission could not alter its certificate once granted without complying with the statute\u2019s specific revocation procedures. <em>Id. </em>The court held, however, that the proposed modification did not involve a \u201csubstantive change[ ] in the authority granted to the carrier[].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41 n. 16.

Brief for Long Lake at 7-11. That letter was sent, however, and to use Long Lake's own language, only in \"response to a letter addressed to [the Commission] from International Paper\u201d in which petitioner requested that the Commission confirm the grant of its exemptions. In the letter, counsel for Long Lake pointed to an alleged inconsistency between the Commission\u2019s \"first-in-time\u201d rule and the operation of the automatic exemption rule in the circumstances of this case. J.A. at 51. The correspondence concludes with a \u201crequest ] that the Commission confirm that its automatic exemption provision, \u00a7 4.105(b)(4), does not pertain in this case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-15\">Long Lake concedes that its letter did not comply with the many procedural requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>governing petitions for rehearing at that time and the Commission \"did not treat [the letter] as a petition for rehearing\u201d because it \"did not comply with the Commission\u2019s rules ____\u201d Brief for Respondent at 31 n. 16. Moreover, there is no evidence that Long Lake intended that letter to be considered a petition for rehearing. Because intervenor made no proper effort to protect its rights, we, along with the Commission, reject Long Lake\u2019s belated attempt to convert its correspondence into a petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">. July 20, 1982 was a somber day for several other applicants whose exemptions had been automatically granted. In addition to International Paper\u2019s exemptions, FERC also revoked the exemptions it had granted to Mary Jane Hirschey, the Crown Zellerback Corp., and the Hydro Development Group, Inc. <em>See </em>Hydro Development Group Inc., 20 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,-059 (July 20, 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1227-15\">. This argument apparently found its genesis in <em>Hirschey </em>dicta where that court noted it was not presented with \u201ca case in which the FERC has acted to correct some ministerial error____ Indeed, the FERC does not even claim that the asserted error \u2014 failure to engage in a comparative evaluation of competing applications \u2014 was ministerial in nature.\u201d <em>Hirschey, </em>701 F.2d at 219 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">. In fact, we note that petitioner's original applications must have contained, in accordance with 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.107, not only a \"description of any existing dam or impoundment to be utilized by [its] ... project\u201d but also a \u201cdescription of the nature and extent of any repair, reconstruction, or other modification of a dam that would occur in association with [its] ... project.\" FERC makes no allegation that petitioner\u2019s applications were deficient in any respect; indeed, without this safety-related information the Commission could not have accepted the applications for filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">. FERC argues that <em>Hirschey </em>is distinguishable because the exemption applicant in that case was also the first-filed applicant. According to the Commission, <em>Hirschey </em>held that the expiration of the 120-day period resulted in the automatic grant of Ms. Hirschey's application <em>only </em>because she also happened to have been the first-filed applicant. In <em>Hirschey, </em>therefore, there was no conflict between the first-in-time rule and the operation of the automatic exemption rule. <em>See </em>J.A. at 75. The intervenors adopt a similar position. <em>See </em>Brief for Long Lake at 6; Brief for New York State at 10-11. In truth, however, <em>Hirschey's </em>interpretation of the effect and operation of the automatic exemption rule is distinct from, and in no way dependent on, its reading of the first-filed rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">FERC's attempt-to distinguish the present case from <em>Hirschey </em>on its facts and equities suffers a similar flaw. In the briefs and at oral argu-</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">ment, Commission counsel asserted that all the parties, including International Paper, had suspected FERC committed some type of ministerial error by allowing the exemption applications to take effect automatically. This suspicion, according to FERC, led International Paper to \"immediately ask[] the Commission to clarify the situation.\u201d Brief for Respondent at 30. We think the Commission's representation is misleading. The operative portion of petitioner\u2019s letter stated only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-11\">We have caused the docket to be examined and find that as of today the Commission has not taken any action. Therefore, <em>in view of the size of the projects </em>we would appreciate confirmation that the exemptions have been automatically granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">J.A. at 48 (emphasis added). This letter obviously represents nothing more than good business practice. The company wanted its understanding of the situation confirmed in writing before spending large sums. While we recognize the obligation of an advocate to put the best face on legal and factual materials that they will bear to advance his client\u2019s cause, there are also limits to that obligation imposed by countervailing obligations to the court and to the judicial process. Here we think that the representation about the letter, in particular, pressed against, if it did not transgress, the limits of acceptable advocacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">. There remains the question of whether the Commission can modify International Paper\u2019s exemptions to include terms and conditions related to dam safety at the two proposed projects. International Paper concedes the agency\u2019s power to order such modifications and such action seems an appropriate exercise of Commission power. Because petitioner has agreed to modification of its exemptions, <em>see </em>Reply Brief for Petitioner at 18, 24, we need not decide whether FERC\u2019s failure to implement these conditions within the regulatory framework can be excused under the clerical error rule. We note, however, that FERC\u2019s failure to impose safety-related conditions on petitioner's exemptions is analogous to the ICC staff's omission of the reservation of authority in <em>American Trucking Assns, Inc. v. Frisco Transportation Co. </em>International Paper knew that these safety-related conditions were to be included in the original exemptions and the company suffers no prejudice by their inclusion at this time. We also note that the modifications proposed and approved by this court\u2019s decision appear to be reflected in Proposed Rule 4.106(h) which will require periodic safety inspections and remedial measures to ensure dam safety as a term of all exemptions under the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
