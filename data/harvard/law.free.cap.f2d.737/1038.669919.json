On consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-16\">ORDERED by the Court <em>en banc </em>that the suggestion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-17\">WALD and MIKYA, Circuit Judges, concurring in the denial of the motion to rehear en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-18\">We want to emphasize the limited reach of the holding in this case. As we read <em>Walters, </em>the panel opinion, 725 F.2d 107 (D.C.Cir.1983), merely holds that, in <em>independent civil actions </em>brought to correct a serviceman\u2019s record, the six-year statute of limitations found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a) applies. <em>Walters </em>explicitly does not speak to the altogether distinct question of what time period governs when <em>review </em>is sought of administrative discharge decisions. <em>See </em>at 115 (\u201cNor do we address the <em>reviewability </em>of such an administrative decision in federal court.\u201d) (emphasis added). Congress has granted discharged service members 15 years from discharge to petition a review board for an upgrade, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1553(a), and this court has expressly held that Congress did not intend to preclude judicial review of decisions reached by those review boards. <em>Van Bourg v. Nitze, </em>388 F.2d 557, 564 n. 14 (D.C.Cir.1967). As a result, we do not believe <em>Walters </em>in any way limits jurisdiction to <em>review </em>a correction board\u2019s treatment of a petition for a discharge upgrade that is timely filed, under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1553(a), with the relevant administrative body.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
