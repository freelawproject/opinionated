(\u201cBlendingwell\u201d), and Cashwest Productions, Inc. (\u201cCashwest\u201d), appeal from so much of a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>New York, Robert W. Sweet, <em>Judge, </em>as granted certain claims asserted by plaintiff Ingrid Croce as the heir of the popular singer and songwriter Jim Croce who died in 1973 (collectively \u201cCroce\u201d) for royalties due Croce, and dismissed a counterclaim asserted by Blendingwell to recover alleged overpayments of royalties to Croce. Following a jury trial as to certain issues and a bench trial as to others, the court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff in the total amounts of $348,359.93 against Blending-well and $359,008.81 against Cashwest; the court dismissed Blendingwell\u2019s counterclaim for $334,024 in royalty overpayments to Croce. On appeal, Blendingwell and Cashwest attack so much of the judgment as awarded plaintiff a total of $102,543 against Blendingwell and $181,161 against Cashwest, on the grounds that the court erred in not submitting certain questions to the jury and in not upholding Blending-well\u2019s counterclaim as a matter of law. Finding no merit in these contentions, we affirm the judgment. 565 F.Supp. 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Blendingwell is a corporation of which defendant Philip S. Kurnit was president and defendants Thomas R. Picardo, Jr., a/k/a Tommy West (\u201cWest\u201d), and Dennis Minogue, a/k/a Terry Cashman (\u201cCash-man\u201d), were officers. Cashwest is a corporation of which Kurnit, Cashman, and West were also officers. The pertinent events and controversies are summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">A. <em>The Agreements and the Events</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In 1968 Jim Croce entered into contracts with Blendingwell pursuant to which Blendingwell became the exclusive publisher of his compositions and his personal manager, and a contract with a corporate predecessor of Cashwest (hereinafter also \u201cCashwest\u201d) for the recording of his compositions. Jim Croce and Blendingwell executed a document entitled \u201cStandard Songwriters Contract\u201d (hereinafter \u201cSongwriting Agreement\u201d), paragraph 3 of which provided that Blendingwell would pay Croce royalties in the amount of, <em>inter alia, </em>three cents per copy of pianoforte copy (more commonly called \u201csheet music\u201d) sold by Blendingwell, \u201c50% of the net sums actually received\u201d by Blendingwell from mechanical licenses, and 50% of the net amounts received by Blendingwell from any sources or rights not specifically provided for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">3. In consideration of this agreement, and conditioned upon the compliance by the WRITER with each and every of the terms, conditions and warranties of this agreement to be performed and observed, the COMPANY agrees to pay, during the term of the copyright owned by it, to the WRITER ..., and the WRITER will accept in full payment the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">A. 03$ per copy for each and every complete pianoforte copy of the composition sold by the COMPANY, and paid for in the United States of America and Canada.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">E. 50% of the net sums actually received by the COMPANY from mechanical, transcription and synchronization licenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-13\">G. 50% of the net sums actually received from any other sources or rights now known or which may hereafter come into existence not specifically provided for herein----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">New York law was to govern matters of interpretation, performance, and breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">In 1969, Blendingwell entered into an agreement with Robbins Music Corp. (\u201cRobbins\u201d) granting Robbins a license to sell Croce compositions in sheet music form. Until 1976 Blendingwell paid Croce 50% of the amounts it received from Robbins under this agreement. In 1976, Blend-ingwell commenced to pay Croce instead three cents per copy of sheet music sold by Robbins. In addition, Blendingwell claimed that prior amounts paid to Croce for sheet music sales by Robbins were overpayments to the extent that they exceeded three cents per copy, and it accordingly deducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>$70,992 from Croce\u2019s then-current royalties in order to recoup the alleged overpay-ments.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Jim Croce\u2019s career had begun to flourish in 1972. In that year Cashwest and Blendingwell entered into agreements with ABC Records, Inc. (\u201cABC\u201d), and ABC\u2019s affiliate, Wingate Music Corp. (\u201cWingate\u201d), giving ABC a mechanical license, <em>i.e., </em>the right to manufacture, distribute, and sell Croce\u2019s recordings, and requiring ABC to pay royalties to Cashwest and Blendingwell. Under these agreements (collectively the \u201cABC Agreements\u201d), Blendingwell \u201cassigned to [Wingate] 50% of Blendingwell\u2019s share in publishing income generated by the Croce compositions under the Songwriting Agreement.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 brief on appeal at 7.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, if Blendingwell received royalties for Croce compositions from a record company other than ABC, it would pay 50% to Croce, keep 25%, and pay 25% to Wingate. As to the royalties payable to Blendingwell by ABC, Blendingwell agreed that ABC could pay 25% of the gross amount directly to Wingate and simply remit to Blendingwell the 75% remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Thereafter, until 1980, Blendingwell paid Croce as royalties under the Songwriting Agreement 50% of the gross amounts ABC was required to pay to Blendingwell. In 1980, however, Blendingwell decided to pay plaintiff instead only 50% of ABC\u2019s 75% cash payments made to Blendingwell and to exclude from consideration the amounts paid by ABC to Wingate for Blendingwell\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In the meantime, in the mid 1970\u2019s a controversy had arisen between Cashwest and Blendingwell on the one hand and ABC on the other, and Cashwest engaged accountants to audit ABC\u2019s royalty payments through December 31, 1975. The auditors\u2019 reports stated' that ABC owed Cashwest more than $4.5 million and owed Blending-well some $223,000. The audits also revealed that Blendingwell owed Wingate\u2019s corporate successor (hereinafter also \u201cWin-gate\u201d) approximately $326,000 under the ABC Agreements. In 1979, Cashwest, Blendingwell, ABC, and Wingate entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which, <em>inter alia, </em>ABC paid Cashwest some $1,920,000 for past royalties, and both ABC\u2019s debt of $223,000 to Blending-well and Blendingwell\u2019s debt of $326,000 to Wingate were extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">B. <em>The Present Lawsuit and the Decision Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Ingrid Croce commenced the present lawsuit in 1978 against, <em>inter alia, </em>Blending-well, Cashwest, Kurnit, West, and Cash-man, claiming principally that the defendants had acted unconscionably and had breached their fiduciary duties to Croce. Jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">The second amended complaint, upon which the parties proceeded to trial, asserted three claims that are at issue on this appeal: (1) a claim against Blendingwell for 50% of the gross amounts payable to it by ABC under the ABC Agreements since 1979 (\u201cABC Royalty claim\u201d); (2) a claim against Cashwest on the ground that the extinguishment of Blendingwell\u2019s $326,000 debt to Wingate in 1979 occasioned a reduction in ABC\u2019s royalty payment to Cashwest and that, under the Croce-Cashwest recording contract, Croce was entitled to % of the amount of the reduction (\u201cABC Settlement claim\u201d); and (3) a claim against Blending-well for 50% of the net amounts received by Blendingwell for sales of sheet music by Robbins, less the three-cents per copy already paid. With respect to Croce\u2019s ABC Royalty claim, Blendingwell counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>claimed for $334,024 in claimed overpay-ments under the ABC Agreements between 1972 and 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">These contract claims were tried to a jury. After the close of the evidence the court directed a verdict in favor of Croce for $31,591 on the ABC Royalty claim and for $70,992 on the sheet music claim, and it dismissed Blendingwell\u2019s counterclaim. The ABC Settlement claim was submitted to the jury on special interrogatories agreed to by the parties. The jury found that as a result of the extinguishment of Blendingwell\u2019s debt to Wingate, ABC had reduced its royalty payment to Cashwest. The jury had not been asked to determine the amount by which ABC had reduced its payment, and the court itself found that the amount of the reduction was $326,000 and that Croce was entitled to recover $181,161. Appellants\u2019 motion to vacate the court\u2019s decisions was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Blendingwell and Cashwest have appealed these portions of the judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cash-west contends that after the jury found that ABC had reduced its payment to Cash-west on account of the forgiving of Blendingwell\u2019s indebtedness to Wingate, the matter of the amount of that reduction should have been presented to the jury for determination. Blendingwell contends that the ABC Royalty claim should have been submitted to the jury or decided in Blending-well\u2019s favor as a matter of law; and it contends that the sheet music claim should have been submitted to the jury. We have considered all of appellants\u2019 arguments in support of these contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A_J\">A. <em>The ABC Settlement Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The parties agree that Croce was to receive % of the amounts received by Cash-west from ABC as royalties under the ABC Agreements. Croce claimed that as a result of the settlement among ABC, Cash-west, Blendingwell, and Wingate, ABC reduced the amount of its royalty payments to Cashwest by $326,000, the amount of Blendingwell\u2019s forgiven indebtedness to Wingate, and that Croce was therefore entitled to % of $326,000. Cashwest, on the other hand, pointed out that (a) the audits revealed that ABC was indebted to Blend-ingwell in the amount of $223,000, (b) there was no dispute that Blendingwell had already paid Croce royalties on this $223,000, and (c) this debt of ABC was also forgiven in the settlement. Accordingly, Cashwest argued that Croce was entitled to at most % of $103,000 (the difference between the two sums forgiven), or $57,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Croce\u2019s claim was submitted to the jury in the form of the following special interrogatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">Did ABC reduce its royalty payments to Cashwest as a consequence of the settlement of the Blendingwell claim against ABC?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">(Interrogatory No. 3.) The jury responded \u201cyes.\u201d' There was, however, no follow-up interrogatory asking the jury to determine the amount by which ABC had reduced its royalty payments, as the parties had not, prior to the submission of the case to the jury, requested such an interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">Following the jury\u2019s special verdict, Cashwest requested that a new question as to the amount of the ABC reduction be put to the jury. Croce\u2019s counsel initially did not object but thereafter agreed with the court\u2019s view that a finding of a reduction in the whole amount of $326,000 was implicit in the jury\u2019s answer to Interrogatory No. 3. After further colloquy and reflection, the court decided not to ask the jury another interrogatory as to the amount of the reduction and instead elected to determine that issue itself. The court\u2019s finding was that ABC had reduced its royalty payments by $326,000. Cashwest does not contend on appeal that this finding was \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), but urges only that we reverse the judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ground that the court was required to submit the matter to the jury. We see no error in the court\u2019s actions. Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a); <em>Cote v. Estate of Butler, </em>518 F.2d 157, 160 (2d Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Rule 49(a) provides that the court may require the jury to return a special verdict in the form of answers to written interrogatories and provides that the court shall give the jury such instruction as is necessary to enable it to answer the interrogatories. The rule states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfK\">[i]f in so doing the court omits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives his right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury retires he demands its submission to the jury. As to an issue omitted without such demand the court may make a finding____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Since Cashwest acknowledges that the jury \u201cwas not asked to decide\u201d the amount of the reduction (Appellants\u2019 brief on appeal at 35), and since the record is clear that Cashwest made no objection to the omission of such a question until after the jury had retired, and indeed had returned its verdict, the right to challenge that omission was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The authorities relied on by Cashwest for the proposition that no waiver occurred are inapposite, as all of them involved either the failure of the trial judge to remedy a flaw called to his attention before the jury retired, <em>see, e.g., Huddleston v. Herman &amp; MacLean, </em>640 F.2d 534, 550 (5th Cir.1981), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>459 U.S. 375, 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 L.Ed.2d 548 (1983), or the failure of the jury to answer one or more of the questions actually put to it, <em>see, e.g., Franki Foundation Co. v. Alger-Rau &amp; Associates Inc., </em>513 F.2d 581 (3d Cir.1975). We are aware of no case reversing a decision by the trial judge not to put a postverdict question to the jury where none had been timely requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Nor are we persuaded to reach a different result merely because Croce\u2019s attorney initially did not object to giving the jury a new postverdict question. Since no timely request or objection had been made by Cashwest, the matter of whether to submit a postverdict interrogatory was wholly within the discretion of the trial judge. Rule 49(a) expressly allows the trial judge to make findings as to omitted issues, and we see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision here to make such a finding rather than to submit a new question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">B. <em>The ABC Royalty Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">In support of its contention that the court improperly dismissed its counterclaim and directed a verdict against it on the ABC Royalty claim, Blendingwell points out that the Songwriting Agreement required it to pay Croce \u201c50% of the net sums actually received by the COMPANY <em>[i.e., </em>Blendingwell] from mechanical ... licenses,\u201d (Songwriting Agreement U 3.E.), and it contends that since it physically received from ABC only 75% of the gross amount payable by ABC, it was required to pay Croce only 37\u00a52% of that gross amount, <em>i.e., </em>one half of ABC\u2019s cash payments to it. Blendingwell argues principally that (1) the term \u201cnet sums actually received\u201d is so clear that the court should have directed a verdict in its favor instead of against it, (2) as the term was unambiguous the court should not have considered extrinsic evidence in order to interpret the term, and (3) if the term was not sufficiently clear and unambiguous to warrant judgment as a matter of law for Blendingwell or to warrant the exclusion of extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent, the matter should have been submitted to the jury for determination. We find no merit in any of Blending-well\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">The court ruled that the term \u201cnet sums actually received by Blending-well\u201d must be construed to include also sums that Blendingwell constructively received. Implicit in this ruling was the view that the contract term was not unambiguously limited to amounts \u201cphysically received,\u201d or received in cash. We see no error in that view. No publisher wishes to pay royalties on items it sells but for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>it is unable to collect payment. The phrase \u201csums actually received\u201d thus could easily have been intended to mean \u201csums realized,\u201d thereby relieving the publisher of any obligation to pay royalties on amounts that were owing but uncollected. Since a seller need not physically receive a cash payment in order to collect compensation for items sold, the court was justified in concluding that the phrase \u201cnet sums actually received\u201d was not clearly limited, as Blendingwell contended, to sums physically received or received in cash. Accordingly, the court was entitled to admit extrinsic evidence in order to fathom the intentions of the parties in using that term. <em>See, e.g., 67 Wall Street Co. v. Franklin National Bank, </em>37 N.Y.2d 245, 248-49, 371 N.Y.S.2d 915, 918, 333 N.E.2d 184, 186 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The evidence relied on by the trial court in concluding that the parties intended the term \u201cactually received\u201d to mean \u201crealized\u201d and to include sums constructively received was overwhelming. First, there was the parties\u2019 practical construction of that term. From 1972 until 1980, Blending-well paid Croce 50% of the total amounts owing to it by ABC \u2014 both of the sums received from ABC in cash and of the sums constructively received through ABC\u2019s payments to Wingate on its behalf. It was not until well after this lawsuit was under way that Blendingwell decided to advance the interpretation that it was to pay Croce only 50% of the 75% paid to it by ABC in cash, and no part of the amounts ABC paid to Wingate to satisfy Blendingwell\u2019s debt. Given this prior practice and the substantial sum involved \u2014 $334,000\u2014it is the parties\u2019 practical construction of the contract prior to the commencement of the litigation that is compelling. <em>See, e.g., Old Colony Trust Co. v. Omaha, </em>230 U.S. 100, 118, 33 S.Ct. 967, 972, 57 L.Ed. 1410 (1913) (\u201cGenerally speaking, the practical interpretation of a contract by the parties to it for any considerable period of time before it comes to be the subject of controversy is deemed of great, if not controlling, influence.\u201d); <em>William C. Atwater &amp; Co. v. Panama Rail Road Co., </em>255 N.Y. 496, 501, 175 N.E. 189, 191 (1931) (\u201cThe courts in determining the obligations of a contract should, when possible, apply the same measure as the parties have applied in performing their obligations.\u201d); <em>Woolsey v. Funke, </em>121 N.Y. 87, 92, 24 N.E. 191, 192 (1890) (\u201c \u2018There is no surer way to find out what parties meant than to see what they have done____ Parties in such cases often claim more, but rarely less than they are entitled to.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Insurance Co. v.. Dutcher, </em>95 U.S. 269, 273, 24 L.Ed. 410 (1877)).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Further, there was clear and unequivocal evidence that Blendingwell\u2019s actions from 1972 to 1980 in paying Croce 50% of the net sums realized did not result from bookkeeping errors but reflected Blendingwell\u2019s conscious contemporaneous interpretation of its contractual obligation to Croce. In 1975, a tape-recorded conference was held among, <em>inter alios, </em>Ingrid Croce and Blendingwell\u2019s president Kurnit, in which Kurnit told Ingrid Croce that Blendingwell had given up one-half of its own share of the royalties and had not asked Croce to share the burden by accepting merely a 50-50 division with Blendingwell on the remaining 75%:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">[Kurnit]: I can tell you that the majority of the monies earned under the existing contracts I believe have gone to in artist royalties is Jim Croce. The royalties \u2014 %th of the royalty coming from ABC was Jim\u2019s share and [Cashwest\u2019s predecessor] received a smaller share than Jim received. That was some<em>thing </em>\u2014 we <em>also gave up half of our publishing in order to make the deal. Blendingwell Music has operated on 50% of the publishing income.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">[Croce]: \u2014 With ABC?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2z\">[Kurnit]: \u2014 Yeah, in order to make the deal and in <em>order </em>\u2014 we <em>made that sacrifice. We never turned around to Jimmy </em>and could have at that point of time and could have at that point of time [sfc] cause we \u2014 everybody desperately needed a deal and there were you know. <em>We had two alternatives. Turning around to Jimmy and saying Jim we\u2019ve had to sacrifice half of our share let\u2019s consider that the SA of everything that re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>mained </em>% <em>the publishers and the full writers as being one pot and go 50/50 on that. We didn\u2019t do that </em>\u2014 we just don\u2019t do that. <em>We made the sacrifice </em>in order to have the result and in order to what had \u2014 what was really right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"apz-dedup-0\">(Plaintiff's Exhibit 78A at 32-33; emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">It is noteworthy that the nature of Blendingwell\u2019s undertaking to Wingate has uniformly been described by Blendingwell as its assignment to Wingate of one-half of Blendingwell\u2019s own share of the royalties. Thus, the ABC Agreements themselves stated that Blendingwell would pay Win-gate 50% of Blendingwell\u2019s Croce receipts calculated after deduction for royalties owing to Croce <em>(see </em>note 1 <em>supra)', </em>and, as revealed in the 1975 taped conversation, Kurnit told Ingrid Croce, \u201cwe also gave up <em>half of our </em>publishing\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 78A at 32; emphasis added). Even appellants\u2019 brief on appeal states that \u201cBlend-ingwell assigned to [Wingate] <em>50% of Blendingwell\u2019s share </em>____\u201d (Appellants\u2019 brief on appeal at 7; emphasis added.) Blendingwell has not pointed to a shred of support, either in the trial record or in any papers supporting its motion to vacate the directed verdict, for the proposition that Blendingwell had given Wingate instead on <em>e-quarter </em>of its own share plus one-quarter of <em>Croce\u2019s.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Blend-ingwell\u2019s argument that the ABC agreements could have been structured so as to make its payments to Wingate expenses to be deducted before Croce\u2019s share of the net was computed. Blendingwell\u2019s argument proves too much, both factually and doctrinally. In fact the ABC Agreements were not so structured. The Participation Agreement expressly, defined Blending-well\u2019s \u201cNet Income,\u201d of which Blending-well was to pay Wingate half, as an amount remaining after Croce\u2019s royalties were deducted. Plainly, if Croce\u2019s royalties were to be deducted first, in order to compute Blendingwell\u2019s obligation, Croce's share was not to be computed after a deduction for Blendingwell\u2019s obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Nor do we view Blendingwell\u2019s present construction of its agreement to pay half of its share of royalties to Wingate as significantly different in effect from the construction unsuccessfully advanced with respect to a similar provision by the publisher in <em>Nolan v. Sam Fox Publishing Co., </em>499 F.2d 1394 (2d Cir.1974), <em>aff\u2019g </em>300 F.Supp. 1311 (S.D.N.Y.1969). In <em>Nolan, </em>the publisher (\u201cFox\u201d) had agreed to pay Nolan Vs \u201cof all royalties received by the \u2018Publisher\u2019 \u201d for Nolan\u2019s song \u201cTumbling Tumbleweeds.\u201d The publisher assigned its interests in the song to Williamson Music, Inc. (\u201cWilliamson\u201d), in return for Williamson\u2019s agreement to pay the publisher royalties in amounts varying between one-half and two-thirds of Williamson\u2019s gross receipts. 300 F.Supp. at 1314. Nolan sought an accounting of sums received by both the publisher and Williamson, and his claim was upheld in the district court and on appeal. We noted that \u201cunder the interpretation of the contract suggested by Fox, the continual dilution of earnings payable to Nolan could be achieved through successive assignments,\u201d 499 F.2d at 1399, and we considered it unlikely that the parties had intended to make the composer vulnerable to such a dilution. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, under Blendingwell\u2019s interpretation of the Songwriting Agreement, Blendingwell could have instructed ABC to pay part of the gross royalties to any of Blendingwell\u2019s creditors, or indeed to any other payee selected by Blendingwell, and claimed to owe Croce only 50% of the sums sent by ABC to Blendingwell in cash. We do not believe such an intention could rationally be imputed to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">The procedural principles governing the court\u2019s treatment of these issues are not in substantial dispute. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>court may direct a verdict, and we may uphold a directed verdict, only if \u201cthe evidence is such that, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable men could have reached.\u201d <em>Simblest v. Maynard, </em>427 F.2d 1, 4 (2d Cir.1970); <em>see Konik v. Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital Medical Center, </em>738 F.2d 1007 at 1013 (2d Cir.1984); <em>cf. Blum v. Fresh Grown Preserve Corp., </em>292 N.Y. 241, 246, 54 N.E.2d 809, 811 (1944) (evidence is insufficient to withstand a directed verdict \u201cwhere no reasonable man could accept it and base an inference upon it\u201d); <em>D\u2019Angelo, Forrest &amp; Co. v. Franklin United Life Insurance Co., </em>65 A.D.2d 766, 767, 409 N.Y.S.2d 784, 785 (2d Dep\u2019t 1978) (directed verdict improper where, \u201c[t]aking all the evidence presented as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom, it cannot be said that no rational process existed by which the jury could have found for the\u201d nonmoving party). Application of this principle to an issue of contract construction means that if the evidence so clearly establishes what interpretation should be given to the contract that reasonable minds could not conclude that it could be interpreted in any other way, a directed verdict on the issue is proper. <em>See W.S. Hayes, Inc. v. Public Service Mutual Insurance Co., </em>12 A.D.2d 989, 990, 212 N.Y.S.2d 89, 90 (1961) (\u201cThe question of what meaning should be given to the words of a contract is ordinarily a question of fact but \u2018if the evidence is so clear that no reasonable man would determine the issue before the court in any way but one, the court will itself determine the issue.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 3 A. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 554, at 222 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We conclude that the directed verdict in favor of Croce on the ABC Royalty claim and the dismissal of Blendingwell\u2019s counterclaim for the alleged overpayments were proper. In light of the language and consistent characterization by Blendingwell of its agreement with Wingate, the evidence of the parties\u2019 actual practice in performing the Songwriting Agreement, and the evidence of Blendingwell\u2019s president\u2019s recorded statement, no rational juror could have concluded that the parties intended that Blendingwell be obligated to pay Croce only 37V2% of the royalties realized by Blendingwell from the mechanical license to ABC.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">C. <em>The Sheet Music Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">These procedural principles also govern Blendingwell\u2019s defense to Croce\u2019s sheet music claim. Paragraph 3.A. of the Songwriting Agreement provided that Croce was to be paid three cents per copy of sheet music \u201csold by the COMPANY.\u201d Paragraph 3.G. provided that as to sums received from any sources or rights \u201cnot specifically provided for herein,\u201d Croce was to receive 50%. The court ruled that the catchall provision. controlled the royalties owed to Croce on sheet music sold by Robbins because it was incontrovertible that the Songwriting Agreement defined \u201cCOMPANY\u201d as Blendingwell, that Blendingwell did not sell the sheet music for which it withheld royalties, and that there was no other provision specifically governing payment to Croce for sheet music sold by a person other than Blendingwell. The court thus directed a verdict in favor of Croce for $70,992, the amount withheld by Blending-well as the difference between three cents per copy and the 50% royalties actually paid prior to 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Blendingwell attacks this ruling on the grounds that (1) when a contract\u2019s specific provision conflicts with a more general provision, the specific is to control; (2) the custom in the industry was to pay songwriters three cents per copy of sheet music; and (3) the court\u2019s narrow interpretation of \u201cCOMPANY\u201d in connection with paragraph 3.A. was inconsistent with its interpretation of \u201cCOMPANY\u201d in paragraph 3.E. in connection with the ABC Royalty claim. We see no merit in any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">First, we find no factual predicate for application of the principle that where a specific contract provision conflicts with a more general provision, the specific provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>sion controls. There is no conflict between the provision for a three-cent royalty for a product sold by Blendingwell and the provision for a different royalty for a product sold by a person other than Blendingwell. Since there is no inconsistency, Blend-ingwell\u2019s maxim does not come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Second, evidence of industry practice may not be used to vary the terms of a contract that clearly sets forth the rights and obligations of the parties. <em>In re Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>299 N.Y. 177, 184-85, 86 N.E.2d 162, 166 (1949); <em>CableWiedemer, Inc. v. Friederich &amp; Sons Co., </em>71 Misc.2d 443, 445, 336 N.Y.S.2d 139, 141 (Monroe County Ct.1972). Here, the Songwriting Agreement plainly stated in paragraph 3. A. that sheet music sales by Blendingwell were to result in a three-cent royalty and in paragraph 3.G. that sums received from other sources not specifically provided for in the contract were to result in a 50% royalty. The industry custom as described to us by Blendingwell would have been used not to illuminate an unclear term but instead to modify the provision of paragraph 3.A. to have it read, in effect, \u201csheet music sales by Blendingwell or any other person who is its licensee.\u201d This is not a permissible use of industry custom evidence. Further, we do not see that the evidence of industry custom supported even that reinterpretation. The expert on whose testimony Blendingwell relies testified that when an agreement contained a provision for royalties on sheet music sold by the publishing company, the industry practice was to include a provision that sheet music sold by persons other than the company would result in a royalty of 50%.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Finally, there is no merit in Blending-well\u2019s contention that the trial court interpreted \u201cCOMPANY\u201d for purposes of the sheet music claim inconsistently with its interpretation of that term for the purposes of the ABC Royalty claim. The term \u201cCOMPANY\u201d was not at issue in connection with the ABC Royalty claim. What was at issue was whether actual receipt by Blendingwell meant merely physical possession by Blendingwell or instead meant realization by Blendingwell. The conclusion that a company has constructively received income it has directed its debtor to pay to its creditor does not mean that the court considered either the company and its debtor or the company and its creditor to be one in the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">At trial there was no dispute that the sheet music in question was sold by Robbins, an independent music publisher, and not by Blendingwell. Further, the court\u2019s view as to the clear meaning of the contract terms governing royalties for sheet music sold by Robbins is confirmed by the .fact that for the better part of a decade Blendingwell actually paid Croce a royalty of 50% of the net sums it received from Robbins. We conclude that the trial court did not err in directing a verdict for Croce on the sheet music claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\">. The pertinent provision of the assignment agreement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">5. Company <em>[i.e., </em>Blendingwell] shall pay to [Wingate] fifty (50%) percent of the Net Income actually received and derived by Company from [Croce] Composition[s].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEP\">(Participation Agreement dated April 25, 1972, between Blendingwell and Wingate.) \"Net Income\u201d was defined as \u201cthe gross receipts derived by Company from the Composition[s], less ... [Royalties and other sums which shall be paid by Company to the Composer pursuant to the provisions of the songwriters\u2019 contracts between Company and the Composer,\u201d and less certain expenses. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\">. After a bench trial on other issues, the court dismissed most of Croce\u2019s claims for breach of fiduciary duty. Although Croce filed a notice of cross-appeal from that ruling, the notice was withdrawn and those claims are not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">. Although Cashwest states that the tape and transcript of this conversation were introduced in connection with a different issue, we find no indication in the record that their offer or receipt in evidence was in any way limited. The evidence was thus available for consideration on any issue to which it was relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
