In April 1983 the Committee sued the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, the Administrator for the Federal Highway Administration and its Region 5 Administrator, the Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, and the Village of Grafton. The complaint' alleged that the defendants violated federal law and that therefore the proposed construction of the Falls Road Bridge and traffic corridor in Grafton, Wisconsin, should be enjoined until compliance with the applicable federal law. The Committee asserted that the defendants violated the Federal Parklands statute (23 U.S.C. \u00a7 138 and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(f)) by not filing a Federal Parklands statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Committee also claims that defendants violated the National Environmental Protection Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)) by failing to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed project. Next the Committee asserts that defendants violated the Federal-Aid Highways Act (23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 <em>et seq.) </em>and the regulations promulgated thereunder by failing to consider all available alternatives as well as the impacts of the project. Finally, the complaint alleges that defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>violated the hearing requirements of the Federal-Aid Highways Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-5\">After a five-day trial Judge Warren refused to enjoin the project and dismissed the complaint. His 51-page opinion (Plaintiffs A-App. 1 through 51) now appears in 581 F.Supp. 678 (E.D.Wis.1984) and correctly disposes of the Committee\u2019s contentions. We agree that there was no violation of the three statutes for the reasons given in Judge Warren\u2019s opinion, which we adopt as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-6\">The district court\u2019s March 14, 1984, order dismissing the complaint is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1540-21\">. A Federal Parklands Statement, sometimes known as a \"section 4(f)\" statement, is the equivalent of the findings that are required by the Federal Parklands statute.
