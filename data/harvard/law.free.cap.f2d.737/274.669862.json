(\u201cGusam\u201d) appeals from an order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York, Boris Radoyevich, <em>Bankruptcy Judge, </em>filed August 12, 1983, converting, <em>sua sponte, </em>Gusam\u2019s Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding to a Chapter 7 liquidation case under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-151326 (\u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d or \u201cCode\u201d). On August 30, 1983, Judge Radoyevich issued a Memorandum Decision, reported at 32 B.R. 832 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1983), \u201cin an effort to provide the appellate court with a more complete record of this Court\u2019s decisional basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 833. On appeal, Gusam contends that the bankruptcy court lacked power to convert Gusam\u2019s Chapter 11 petition to a Chapter 7 case pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b) absent a request by a party in interest. We agree with Gusam and, consequently, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">We state the facts succintly for purposes of this decision. Gusam filed its Chapter 11 petition on August 17, 1982. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(a), Judge Radoyevich appointed a creditor\u2019s committee on August 25, 1982. On February 1, 1983, upon application by Gusam, the bankruptcy court issued an order authorizing Gusam to retain \u201cSpecial Counsel for the limited purpose of representing the Debtor-in-Possession with respect to the sale of its assets.\u201d After holding a hearing, Judge Radoyevich issued an order, filed April 25, 1983, approving the sale of Gusam\u2019s business to Leechir Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cLeechir\u201d), for the amount of $275,000. To provide Leechir sufficient time to obtain a liquor license, the order directed the parties to hold the closing on the sale \u201cwithin thirty (30) days of [Leechir] receiving final approval from the State Liquor Authority.\u201d Shortly after approving Gusam\u2019s sale and without request by any of Gusam\u2019s creditors,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Radoyevich issued another order, filed May 3, 1983, directing Gusam to show cause why the court should not dismiss its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Chapter 11 petition or convert it to a Chapter 7 proceeding due to Gusam\u2019s failure \u201cto act pursuant to its duty under Section 1107(a) and Section 1106(a)(5)\u201d of the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy judge adjourned the hearing on the order to show cause on several pccasions, largely at Gus-am\u2019s request, to give Leechir additional time to obtain a liquor license. Leechir finally acquired the license in early July and the closing was held on July 18. Gus-am asserts that as of that date it began working with its attorneys to develop a liquidating plan which it intended to submit to its creditors and to the court. As of August 11, 1983 (the final return date for the order to show cause), however, Gusam had not submitted such a plan. At the August 11th hearing, Gusam\u2019s attorney requested a further ten-day adjournment, asserting that at that time Gusam would be ready to file the plan with the court. The bankruptcy judge denied the request and, in a decision from the bench, <em>sua sponte </em>ordered the conversion of Gusam\u2019s petition and appointed Jules V. Speciner as trustee to administer the estate. The bankruptcy judge explained his <em>sua sponte </em>exercise of power in a subsequent Memorandum Decision dated August 30,1983. <em>In Re Gusam, </em>32 B.R. 832 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1983). The parties agreed, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b), <em>see John T. Mather Memorial Hospital, Inc. v. Pearl, </em>723 F.2d 193, 194 n. I (2d Cir.1983), to submit Gusam\u2019s appeal directly to this court. Upon review, we hold that the bankruptcy judge was without power to convert <em>sua sponte </em>the proceeding from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 pursuant to section 1112(b), because conversion under that provision can take place only \u201con request \u00f3f a party in interest.\u201d II U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b) (1982). Since no such request was made herein, we reverse and remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Gusam contends that section 1112(b) confers power upon the bankruptcy court to convert a Chapter 11 case to a Chapter 7 case only \u201con request of a party in interest.\u201d Since \u201cno party in interest\u201d requested the bankruptcy court to convert, argues Gusam, the court herein was without power to do so <em>sua sponte. See Warner v. Universal Guardian Corp., </em>30 B.R. 528, 529 (Bankr. 9th Cir.1983); <em>In re Larmar Estates, Inc., </em>6 B.R. 933, 934-35 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1980); <em>Zip Print, Inc. v. Keller, </em>4 B.R. 676, 677 &amp; n. 1 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1980); 5 Collier on Bankruptcy K 1112.01, at 1112-3, -4 (15th ed. 1983). We agree with Gus-am that a plain reading of section 1112(b) suggests that a court can convert a case only upon request by a party in interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, unless the legislative history contradicts the clear language of the statute, we must agree with Gusam that the bankruptcy court herein was without power to convert the proceedings <em>sua sponte. See United States v. Holroyd, </em>732 F.2d 1122, 1125 (2d Cir.1984) (\u201cOur analysis is constrained by a fundamental rule of statutory construction: when the express language of a statute is clear, a court will not adopt a different construction absent clear legislative history contradicting the plain meaning of the words.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Our own review of the legislative history indicates that the congressional intent is not contradicted, and indeed, is served by a plain reading of the statute. It is clear that a principal aim of the drafters of the new Code was to permit bankruptcy judges to concentrate on their judicial functions by relieving them of previously existing administrative burdens. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No.. 595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 89-90, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5963, 6050-51 (recounting various administrative duties of bankruptcy judges under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the previous act, which \u201cfunctions and duties ... constitute no part of [their] judicial responsibilities, and divert [them] from the important judicial and legal work that must be done in bankruptcy cases\u201d). With this concern in mind, the House version of section 1112(b) provided that the court could dismiss Chapter 11 cases or convert them to Chapter 7 \u201con request of a party in interest.\u201d H.R. 8200, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977). In contrast, the Senate version of the provision expressly conferred power upon the bankruptcy court to dismiss or convert Chapter 11 cases \u201con its own motion.\u201d S. 2266, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977). Eventually, Congress adopted the House version of section 1112(b), deleting the Senate\u2019s reference to the court\u2019s power to act \u201con its own motion\u201d and, instead, providing that the bankruptcy court could convert or dismiss \u201con request of a party in interest.\u201d <em>See </em>5 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1112.01, at 1112-4 (15th ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Our interpretation of the legislative intent is reinforced by the statements of Congressman Edwards and Senator DeConcini, the sponsors of the Code, made in reference to section 102, which sets forth the Code\u2019s rules of construction. The sponsors stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">[T]he phrase \u201con request of a party in interest\u201d or a similar phrase, is used in connection with an action that the court may take in various sections of the Code. <em>The phrase is intended to restrict the court from acting sua sponte. </em>Rules of bankruptcy procedure or court decisions will determine who is a party in interest for the particular purposes of the provision in question, but <em>the court will not be permitted to act on its own.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">124 Cong.Rec. 32,393 (1978) (statement of Congressman Edwards) (emphasis added); 124 Cong.Rec. 33,993 (1978) (statement of Senator DeConcini) (emphasis added). The above-quoted language makes clear that the very purpose of inserting the phrase \u201con request of a party in interest\u201d in the final version of section 1112(b) was to keep the court from acting <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">In short, the legislative intent \u2014 as evinced by the drafters\u2019 concern with excessive judicial entanglement in administrative matters, the eventual selection of the House version over the Senate version of section 1112(b), and the sponsors\u2019 statements as to the purpose and meaning of the phrase \u201con request of a party in interest\u201d \u2014 is not contradicted, and indeed, is furthered by permitting the bankruptcy court to act under section 1112(b) only upon request by a party in interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Finally, because we conclude that the bankruptcy court was without power to convert <em>sua sponte </em>a Chapter 11 proceeding to a Chapter 7 case pursuant to section 1112(b), we need not address Gusam\u2019s further contention that under the facts of this case there was no cause for conversion and, therefore, that the bankruptcy judge abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the order of the bankruptcy court and we remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-15\">.
