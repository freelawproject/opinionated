The Secretary contends that the election was influenced by the failure of some of the subordinate lodges of the Union to comply with a requirement that notice of delegate elections be mailed to each member not less than 15 days prior to the election. The action was dismissed following trial. The court, Thomas M. Reavley, <em>Circuit </em>Judge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that the protesting union member had failed to exhaust available union remedies prior to filing a complaint with the Secretary, as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(a)(1) (1982). Since we hold that the union member\u2019s protest letter adequately exhausted his internal union remedies, we reverse and remand for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The Union is a three-tiered labor organization consisting of more than 1,000 subordinate or local lodges under the jurisdiction of approximately 40 System Federations, which in turn are affiliated with the Grand Lodge. The Missouri Pacific System Federation Joint Protective Board (Federation) is one of these intermediate System Federations. It has jurisdiction over 56 local lodges. The Federation mailed a convention call, dated January 28, 1980, to its subordinate lodges, notifying them that the Federation convention would be held in Wichita, Kansas, on July 28, 1980 to elect Federation officers and to conduct other business. Each local lodge was entitled to send one convention delegate, provided that no delegate could represent more than 300 members. The election of convention delegates was to be in accordance with the Constitution and Bylaws of the Grand Lodge. Article XX, Section 10, provides, in part, that all members of the local lodges who are in good standing must be given at least 15 days advance notice of the date, time and place at which nominations for convention delegate will be made, as well as the date, time and place at which the delegate elections will be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">The convention was held as scheduled. L.W. Borden challenged the incumbent, T.G. Hawkes, Jr., for the position of General Chairman. Borden lost by a narrow margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the convention, he raised a point of order on the ground that some of the subordinate lodges had not complied with the notice of delegate election requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">A month after the convention, Borden decided to protest the election. He initially contacted the Department of Labor by a letter dated September 10, 1980. He was told that he must exhaust his internal union remedies prior to filing a complaint with the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">On September 16, 1980, Borden wrote a letter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to Olee Berge, President of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Grand Lodge. In this letter he complained about several aspects of the election, including the allegation that members were \u201cnot given the opportunity to attend meetings or take part in the election of a delegate.\u201d Berge responded with a letter dated September 22, 1980,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which stated among other things that, unless and until Borden furnished him with \u201cevidence of a probative nature showing that there is a basis for your accusations, your request for an investigation is declined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Borden interpreted this response as a denial of his request. He filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor dated October 2, 1980. His complaint consisted of a letter stating that proof of the allegations was in the possession of the Grand Lodge and asking the Secretary to investigate. He enclosed a copy of his letter to Berge and the latter\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The Secretary investigated and found merit to the protest that some members were not given the opportunity to attend meetings or to take part in the election of a delegate because they had not been properly notified. After receiving the Department of Labor\u2019s Summary of Violations letter, the Union also conducted an investigation. It found that in some cases proper notice had not been given, but concluded that this failure did not affect the outcome of the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The Secretary commenced this action in the district court on January 5, 1981 seeking to have the July 28, .1980 election declared void and to have an immediate new election, under the supervision of the Department of Labor, for 7 of the 9 offices of the Federation Board. The complaint alleged certain violations of the LMRDA. It alleged that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(e) had been violated in that 8 of the 56 subordinate lodges had -not given the 15-day notice of delegate election required by that section of the statute, and that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(d) had been violated in that one of the lodges was represented by a delegate who had not been elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">After a bench trial on February 11, 1983, the court filed a concise, straightforward decision on March 17, 1983. The court dismissed the action on the basis of a finding that the protesting union, member had failed to exhaust union remedies available to him as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(a)(1). The court held that \u201cBorden was required to make known his objection with such specific basis as was known to him\u201d, and that he had failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The sole question presented on this appeal is whether Borden adequately exhausted his union remedies before filing a complaint with the Department of Labor. Section 402(a) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(a)(1), requires that a member of a labor organization \u201cexhaust [] the remedies available under the constitution and bylaws of such organization and of any parent body\u201d prior to filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging election violations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The justification for this requirement is \u201cto postpone governmental intervention until the union is afforded the opportunity to redress the violation.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Local 153, supra </em>note 2, 389 U.S. at 472. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>1959 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2318, 2323.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Hodgson v. Local Union 6799, United Steelworkers (Local 6799), </em>403 U.S. 333 (1971), held that \u201cwhen a union member is aware of the facts supporting an alleged election violation, the member must, in some discernible fashion, indicate to his union his dissatisfaction with those facts if he is to meet the exhaustion requirement\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 341. The Union interprets this to mean that all information bearing on the alleged violation which is at the disposal of the union member must be specifically divulged in his initial protest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In <em>Local 6799, </em>the union member\u2019s internal protest dealt with several matters, including the use of union facilities to prepare campaign materials for the incumbent president. An objection concerning a meeting-attendance requirement imposed as a condition of candidacy for union office \u2014 a claim wholly unrelated to those presented in the union protest \u2014 was raised for the first time in the union member\u2019s complaint filed with the Secretary of Labor. The facts of the instant case are significantly different. Here, Borden presented all of his claims to Berge in his letter of September 16, 1980. The union does not contend that Borden is now alleging any new grounds for relief, only that his protest was insufficiently specific in detailing the alleged violations. Thus <em>Local 6799 </em>is distinguishable on this ground. The sentence in the opinion requiring the union member to present <em>facts </em>must be read in light of the holding that \u201ccourts should impose a heavy burden on the union to show that it could not in any way <em>discern that a member was complaining of the violation in question.\u201d </em>403 U.S. at 341 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">Subsequent cases have interpreted <em>Local 6799 </em>as requiring only that the union be able to discern that the member was complaining of the violation ultimately litigated. <em>See, e.g., Donovan v. Local Union No. 120, Laborers\u2019 International Union, </em>683 F.2d 1095 (7th Cir.1982) (union protest concerning application of a rule exhausted later challenge by the Secretary to the validity of the rule); <em>Hodgson v. District 6, United Mine Workers, </em>474 F.2d 940, 946 (6th Cir.1973) (\u201cthe fact that Howard\u2019s protests can be read fairly as attacking the validity of the rule in question, is sufficient to meet the exhaustion requirement\u201d); <em>Hodgson v. Local 1299, United Steelworkers, </em>453 F.2d 565 (6th Cir.1971) (test is whether union had fair notice that members were complaining about the validity of the meeting-attendance rule when protest challenged the application of the rule); <em>Ba-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>lanoff v. Donovan, </em>569 F.Supp. 966 (N.D. Ill.1983) (attack which focused on particular issues of a newspaper did not provide the union with \u201cfair notice\u201d that member also was dissatisfied with his own lack of coverage in subsequent issues of the paper). We are aware of no case where, even though the nature of the alleged violation was known to the union, nevertheless the union member\u2019s complaint was dismissed because the specific instances constituting the violation were not included in the internal protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Applying this analysis to the instant case, we conclude that Borden\u2019s letter, although broad and lacking specific information, nevertheless satisfied the requirement of \u00a7 482(a)(1). The letter specifically stated that \u201cseveral lodges were not properly represented\u201d and that \u201c[s]ome of the lodges have been stacked with members and not given the opportunity to attend meetings or take part in the election of a delegate.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He indicated his \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d with these facts regarding election defects, and offered to provide more information if called upon to do so by Berge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Local 6799, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged the likelihood of broad and imprecise language in internal union protests. 403 U.S. at 340. And the Court previously had pointed out that Congress did not intend to restrict the availability of relief according to the \u201cartfulness of a layman\u2019s complaint which often must be based on incomplete information.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Local Union No. 125, Laborers\u2019 International Union, </em>389 U.S. 477, 482 (1968). Any ambiguities must be liberally construed in favor of the complaining member.. <em>Donovan v. Local 126, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>728 F.2d 610 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Hodgson v. District 6, United Mine Workers, supra, </em>474 F.2d at 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Unions are expected to \u201cprovide responsible and responsive procedures for investigating and redressing members\u2019 election grievances.\u201d <em>Wirtz v. Local Union No. 125, supra, </em>389 U.S. at 484. The Union in the instant case had no established grievance procedure for election protests at the time Borden wrote Berge. In this context, the tone of Berge\u2019s letter to Borden strikes us as irresponsible and unresponsive. Instead of merely requesting additional information, the letter stated that <em>\u201cunless and until </em>you furnish this office with <em>evidence of a probative nature </em>showing that there is a basis for your accusations, <em>your request for an investigation is declined\u201d </em>(emphasis added). This understandably gave Borden the impression that his request has been denied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the very least, it makes clear that the burden of substantiation was being placed on Borden, and that the Union would take no further action unless Borden produced \u201cevidence of a probative nature\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">There is no statutory requirement that complaining union members must present evidence. <em>See Hodgson v. Local 734, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>336 F.Supp. 1243, 1253 (N.D.Ill.1972); <em>Wirtz v. American Guild of Variety Artists, </em>267 F.Supp. 527, 533 (S.D.N.Y.1967); <em>Wirtz v. Local Union 169, International Hod Carriers, </em>246 F.Supp. 741, 751-52 (D.Nev.1965). We are not aware of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>provision in the Union\u2019s constitution or bylaws which imposes any such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">There is a \u201cstrong affirmative duty placed upon the union to ascertain the scope of the member\u2019s protest.\u201d <em>Hodgson v. Local 734, supra, </em>336 F.Supp. at 1253. We hold that, where the substance of a violation is presented to a union and the member offers to provide more information if called upon to do so, the union is not privileged to decline to investigate unless the member offers probative evidence and thereafter to argue that it was not given an opportunity to correct the problem before the Secretary\u2019s intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse and remand for further proceedings according to law, with costs to appellant in this Court. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">. Of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">. The terms of the officers elected at the challenged election expire in July 1984. Delegate elections for the July 1984 convention already have taken place. Nevertheless, this action is not moot. In <em>Wirtz v. Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 463, 473-74 (1968), the Supreme Court held that, when the Secretary proves a violation that may have affected the outcome of a challenged election of union officers, the fact that the union already has conducted another unsupervised election does not deprive the Secretary of his right to a court order declaring the. challenged election void and directing that a new election be conducted under his supervision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-15\">. Borden\u2019s letter to Berge was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-16\">\"Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-17\">On July 28, 1980, the Missouri Pacific System Federation held their quadrennial convention.

The Union argues that this complaint is entitled to less attention because it follows a more lengthy attack on the advantages given the incumbent General Chairman. We reject this argument as wholly without merit. Unless distorted by being excerpted out of context, the location of a particular claim within a protest letter is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. There is disagreement between the parties concerning Borden\u2019s knowledge of particular facts at the time he wrote the letter to Berge. The district court found that he raised a point of order at the convention on the ground that some of the subordinate lodges had not complied with the notice of delegate election requirement; so he apparently had knowledge of defects in notice which were not specifically mentioned in his letter of protest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\">. Berge testified at trial that he expected Borden to respond to his letter. Such an expectation may very well have been unreasonable, in view of the negative tone of Berge\u2019s response to Borden\u2019s protest. Exhaustion is to be objectively determined. <em>Hodgson v.
