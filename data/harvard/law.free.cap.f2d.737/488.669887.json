BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b553-26\">On March 30,1980, Ramona Zamora-Garcia was found to be a deportable alien who had entered the United States without valid entry documents in 1973. She filed for a Suspension of Deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254 on that same date. On April 6, 1982, the Immigration Judge (ILJ) denied her request, she appealed this decision, and her appeal was dismissed-by order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) on May 18, 1983. The Board\u2019s dismissal was originally before us on appeal for a determination of whether the Board abused its discretion in failing to find that deportation would cause appellant \u201cextreme hardship\u201d sufficient to invoke the relief provided by \u00a7 1254. We have reconsidered our original unpublished opinion in light of the Board\u2019s petition for rehearing, and find the issues worthy of further consideration as well as publication. The petition for rehearing is therefore GRANTED, and we substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the following published opinion in lieu thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Ramona Zamora-Garcia is a 32 year old unmarried native citizen of Mexico. She came to the United States in 1969, when she was 17 or 18 years old, and since then has lived with and been employed by Ms. Marilyn Chrisman. Ramona is the Chris-mans\u2019 housekeeper, and has cared for the two Chrisman children since they were very small. Ms. Chrisman testified in Ramona\u2019s behalf in 1982 at the suspension hearing, and stated that the Chrismans consider Ramona \u201ca member of our family.\u201d Ramona has lived with the Chrismans continuously since 1969, with the exception of a three week visit to her family in Mexico in 1973. Although she receives a two week vacation each year and has saved $4500, Ramona has chosen not to return to Mexico for her vacations because she no longer feels welcome in her father\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The relative to whom Ramona feels closest is her sister, Elia Zamora, who also came to the United States in 1969 and was initially found to be deportable along with Ramona. Elia, however, was granted a Suspension of Deportation because she had married a lawful permanent resident. Besides her father, who has remarried, Ramona\u2019s relatives in Mexico include three married sisters and brothers and one unmarried brother. Ramona stated that if she returned to Mexico, she could not live with her father because he lives in her stepmother\u2019s house and the two women are estranged. This is why she has not returned to Mexico for a visit in more than ten years. She further stated that her sisters and brothers now have lives of their own, and she could not live with them either.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">To be considered for a Suspension of Deportation, the respondent has a duty to prove three things \u2014 first, that she has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years; second, that she has been a person of good moral character during that time; and third, that deportation would cause her extreme hardship. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. There is no dispute that Ramona meets the first two criteria. However, the Board affirmed the IU\u2019s finding that she had failed to meet her burden of demonstrating extreme hardship. She therefore was not considered for a Suspension of Deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">We recognize from the outset that the \u201cdecision whether to suspend the deportation of an alien who satisfies the three statutory requirements is discretionary, and is subject only to a most restricted judicial review.\u201d <em>Ramos v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>695 F.2d 181, 184-85 (5th Cir.1983). The first two requirements, continuous residency for at least seven years and good moral character, are findings of fact which are to be determined from the evidence \u201con the record as a whole.\u201d Thus, as to the first two requirements, we decline to rule upon decisions by the Board or ILJ that are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4). As to the requirement of extreme hardship, however, we have held that under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981), that factor is to be reviewed under the more limited \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. <em>Ramos, supra, </em>695 F.2d at 185. We recognized in <em>Ramos </em>that the Act specifically grants the Attorney General the authority to determine the existence of extreme hardship, and that the provision may be quite narrowly construed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Although we held in <em>Ramos </em>that there was little opportunity for \u201csubstantive\u201d judicial review of adverse determinations of extreme hardship, we may review these determinations \u201cprocedurally\u201d to ensure that the complaining alien has received full and fair consideration of all circumstances that give rise to his or her claims. <em>Id. </em>at 186. Under such circumstances, Courts of Appeal have remanded to the Board for reconsideration in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the relevant factors it may have failed to consider. <em>See, e.g., Prapavat v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>638 F.2d 87 (9th Cir.1981), <em>aff'd, on rehearing, </em>662 F.2d 561, 562 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Santana-Figueroa v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>644 F.2d 1354, 1356-57 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>Ravancho v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>658 F.2d 169, 174-76 (3d Cir.1981); <em>Antoine-Dorcelli v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>703 F.2d 19, 21 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We held in <em>Ramos </em>that for the Attorney General properly to fulfill his discretionary obligation, he or his delegates must <em>actually consider </em>\u201cthe facts and circumstances respecting each petitioner\u2019s claim of extreme hardship.\u201d <em>Ramos, supra, </em>695 F.2d at 188, <em>citing Santana-Figueroa, supra, </em>644 F.2d at 1356. We require that the Board \u201cmeaningfully address ... each of the alien\u2019s assertions of hardship that are based on evidence,\u201d giving reasons for denying relief that reflect full consideration of the evidence. <em>Ramos </em>at 188. In reviewing Board decisions on hardship, we base our decision on the Board\u2019s articulation of its reasons for denying relief rather than our own assumptions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\n<em>Extreme Hardship: Relevant Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">It is well established that the adverse economic impact of deportation alone is insufficient to justify a finding of extreme hardship. In this case the IU found, and the Board affirmed, that the \u201cmost that can be said of respondent\u2019s case is that deportation to Mexico would result in economic hardship because employment opportunities in that country are not equal to ours.\u201d The IU found that Ramona\u2019s case was \u201cnot unlike\u201d <em>Pelaez v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>513 F.2d 303 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 892, 96 S.Ct. 190, 46 L.Ed.2d 124 (1975), where we affirmed the Board\u2019s finding of no extreme hardship in the petitioner\u2019s claims. In <em>Pe-laez, </em>the alien based her claim of hardship on the difficulty in obtaining employment and the lower standard of living in her native country, coupled with the impossibility of obtaining a return visa and the inability to continue to contribute to the support of her family. <em>Id. </em>at 305, n. 1. In <em>Pelaez, </em>we pointed out but did not specifically address the petitioner\u2019s claim that deportation would disrupt \u201cthe way of life to which she had become accustomed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304. We therefore cannot determine in this situation that the IU\u2019s citation to <em>Pelaez </em>amounted to adequate consideration of Ramona\u2019s non-economic claims of extreme hardship. We find instead that this case presented several factors not present in <em>Pelaez </em>that were relevant to Ramona\u2019s claims of hardship, yet were not considered in the proceedings below in accordance with the standards we have set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">First, both petitioner and her friend and employer, Ms. Chrisman, testified that Ramona is considered a member of the Chris-man family. She has \u201creared\u201d the Chris-man children for 14 years now, and she participates in family activities. Ms. Chris-man was concerned by the fact that Ramona did not wish to return to Mexico for her vacations and took it upon herself to speak to Ramona\u2019s father about the problem, which has never been resolved. When Ramona became involved in some minor trouble with the police,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Chrismans were fully supportive of her and now vouch for her complete honesty and high moral character.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">The estrangement from her natural family, coupled with the development of close ties with her \u201cAmerican\u201d family calls into question the IU\u2019s finding that Ramona has no \u201cclose family ties in this country.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are in accord with the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Circuit in finding that it \u201cis unrealistic as well as unjust to adopt such a rigid view of the family unit\u201d as to find that only blood relations may constitute \u201cfamily.\u201d <em>Antoine-Dorcelli v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>703 F.2d 19, 21 (1st Cir. 1983). In <em>Antoine-Dorcelli, </em>the Government sought deportation of a 49 year old native Haitian woman who had been in Puerto Rico since 1970. Prior to her arrival in Puerto Rico, she had lived and worked in Haiti for about 20 years as a servant to the mother of the woman with whom she came to stay in Puerto Rico, Mrs. Craig. Antoine-Dorcelli, like Ramona, had developed a particular attachment to Mrs. Craig\u2019s children and indeed had arrived in Puerto Rico in 1970, a year later than Ramona arrived in Texas. The First Circuit reversed and remanded the Board\u2019s denial of Suspension of Deportation, finding that the Board had improperly failed to consider the hardship to the petitioner arising from her separation from the Craigs.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Antoine-Dorcelli, like Ramona, had living family members in her native country. The Government attempts to distinguish the case by emphasizing that Antoine-Dor-celli had had \u201clittle or no contact\u201d with her family in Haiti since she was a small child, whereas Ramona left Mexico as a young teenager and has since maintained some contact with her family. The Government further stresses the fact that Ramona is paid a salary and receives a vacation, while Antoine-Dorcelli\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d were provided for by the Craigs as they arose. We do not find Ramona\u2019s status as an employee dis-positive \u2014 indeed, the <em>Antoine-Dorcelli </em>Court pointed out Antoine-Dorcelli\u2019s non-employee status solely for the purpose of illustrating that she would suffer <em>economic </em>hardship if deported in addition to the emotional trauma of separating from the Craigs. Similarly, we find that despite Ramona's infrequent contact with her family in Mexico, her situation is not so vastly different from Antoine-Dorcelli\u2019s that we can say the Board\u2019s failure to consider the emotional hardship posed by separation from the Chrisman family was proper. We add that it appears from the facts of <em>Antoine-Dorcelli </em>that the Haitian woman did not leave her country until she was roughly 36 years of age, whereas Ramona left at age 17 or 18, during the more critical years of young adulthood.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">The <em>Antoine-Dorcelli </em>Court also pointed out that if there had been evidence that Antoine-Dorcelli\u2019s relationship with the Craig children \u201c \u2018closely resembled that of parent to child,\u2019 \u201d then \u201cconsideration of the harm suffered by [the Craig] children as a result of petitioner\u2019s deportation might also have been merited.\u201d <em>Antoine-Dorcel-li, supra, </em>703 F.2d at 22 &amp; n. 3, <em>citing Tovar v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>612 F.2d 794, 797 (3d Cir.1980). We originally directed the Board to consider the harm to the Chrisman children, who have been raised by Ramona, rather than merely concluding in its written opinion that \u201c[n]o consideration\u201d could be given to this factor \u201csince ... [the Chrismans and Ramona] do not have the familial relationship set forth\u201d in the statute. In so doing, we relied on the <em>Antoine-Dorcelli </em>Court\u2019s supposition as well as on <em>Tovar, </em>the Third Circuit Case upon which the First Circuit relied. In light of a Supreme Court decision unavailable during our initial deliberations, we have concluded that that reliance may have been incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\"><em>Tovar </em>extended the statutory language of \u00a7 1254 to include hardship not only to the deportee\u2019s \u201cspouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States\u201d but also to the deportee\u2019s grandchild. The <em>To-var </em>Court held that the proper focus was whether the deportee\u2019s relationship to her grandchild \u201cso closely resembled that of parent to child\u201d that the hardship to the grandchild from the grandmother\u2019s deportation should be considered. <em>Tovar, supra, </em>612 F.2d at 794. <em>Tovar </em>relied for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>proposition upon <em>Vergel v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>536 F.2d 755, 757 (8th Cir.1976). In <em>Vergel, </em>the Court determined that deportation would cause severe hardship not only to the Filipino deportee, but also to an invalid child she had nursed almost since birth. <em>Id. </em>Although the Court could not grant the relief sought,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the basis of this hardship it stayed issuance of its mandate to allow the petitioner time to apply for a discretionary stay on humanitarian grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 757-58. In <em>Vergel, </em>like the case before us, the child and her parents were lawful residents of the United States unrelated to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In its petition for rehearing, the INS argues that in <em>Contreras-Buenfil v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>712 F.2d 401 (9th Cir.1983), the Ninth Circuit questioned the continuing precedential value of <em>Tovar </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service v. Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981). In <em>Jong Ha Wang, </em>the Court held that a Court of Appeals may not substitute its determination of \u201cextreme hardship\u201d for that of the Board. <em>Id. </em>450 U.S. at 145, 101 S.Ct. at 1027. As we pointed out earlier, however, <em>Jong Ha Wang </em>does not preclude procedural review of Board decisions to ensure fair consideration of all factors giving rise to the alien\u2019s claim of hardship. <em>See </em>discussion of <em>Ramos, supra, </em>695 F.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Thus, although we may find an abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s utter failure or refusal to consider relevant hardship factors, we recognize that we lack the authority to determine the weight, if any, to be afforded each factor. Similarly, we may not assess the credibility of the witnesses or evidence that purport to prove the existence of each factor. We do not think that our review, so limited, constitutes a substitution of our view for that of the Board in a manner forbidden by <em>Jong Ha Wang. </em>We are thus unpersuaded by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Contreras-Buenfil.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">However, that is not the only argument set out in the petition for rehearing. The INS also argues that our direction that the hardship to the Chrisman children be considered impermissibly expands the language of \u00a7 1254(a)(1) beyond its terms. We concede that the plain language of the statute provides only for consideration of extreme hardship \u201cto the alien or to his spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residency.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1). On rehearing, we think our earlier liberal interpretation of the statute, then in accord with <em>Antoine-Dorcelli, Tovar, </em>and the spirit of <em>Vergel, </em>is precluded by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service v. Phinpathya, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 584, 78 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">In reviewing the \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d requirement of \u00a7 1254(a)(1), the Supreme Court declined to apply any interpretation other than the \u201cplain meaning\u201d approach to the 32 year old statute. \u2014 U.S. at-, 104 S.Ct. at 590, 78 L.Ed.2d at 410. The Court relied upon the legislative history of the 1952 amendments, pointing out that Congress had deliberately \u201cmade the criteria for suspension of deportation more stringent both to restrict the opportunity for discretionary action\u201d and to keep out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>S.Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, 25 (1952).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u201caliens [who] are deliberately flaunting our immigration laws by ... gaining admission into the United States illegally ... with the intention of establishing themselves in a situation in which they may subsequently have access to some administrative remedy to adjust their status to that of permanent residents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-19\"><em>Phinpathya, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 104 S.Ct. at 590, 78 L.Ed.2d at 409-410, <em>citing</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Although the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling only specifically has an impact upon the \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d requirement, we \u2014 without so deciding \u2014 have doubts that the Court would approach the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d requirement any differently. We therefore recognize \u2014 although perhaps reluctantly \u2014 that the Board need not consider the hardship to the Chrisman children posed by the possibility of Ramona\u2019s deportation. We emphasize, however, that we do require consideration of the hardship to Ramona posed by the possibility of separation from, the Chris-mans.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In its reconsideration on remand the Board should also take into account the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Santana-Figueroa v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>644 F.2d 1354 (9th Cir.1981), where the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded because the Board had \u201cdisregarded the possibility that extreme hardship would result from the combined effect of depriving the petitioner of his livelihood and uprooting him from a community to which he had belonged and contributed for more than a decade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357. The petitioner in that case was a 70 year old unskilled maintenance man who had lived and worked in the United States for 14 years, supporting himself and his family who lived in Mexico without public assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 1355. Due to his advanced age, the economic situation confronting him was possibly more severe than Ramona\u2019s, but the noneconomic factors justifying remand were substantially <em>less </em>severe. The <em>Santana-Figueroa </em>Court held that the Board should have considered the hardship resulting from the petitioner\u2019s separation from his church, friends, and American society in general. <em>Id. </em>at 1357. Ramona, on the other hand, would leave behind the family with whom she has lived for nearly half her entire life (indeed, <em>all </em>her adult life), the children she has raised, and the blood relative to whom she feels closest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>In addition, we find that all the other non-economic factors that persuaded the <em>Santana-Figueroa </em>Court to remand \u2014 length of time in the United States, adaptation to American way of life, attachment to American friends and community, and contribution to American society \u2014 are present here and should have been considered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In conclusion, we reiterate that it is not our purpose here to hold that the presence of these noneconomic factors requires the Board to reverse its decision. We reverse and remand for the sole purpose of directing the Board to consider and then make appropriate findings on these factors along with the economic factors previously before it consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">. Ramona and her sister Elia were arrested for shoplifting in a supermarket on April 18, 1980. Ramona had taken items worth less than $5.00, and the charges were dismissed after she participated in Project Detour, a rehabilitation program for first-time offenders. This incident was considered by the ILJ, who found it no bar to a finding of good moral character.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-13\">. We recognize, as should the Board, the nature of the hardship posed by the separation of family members. In <em>Mejia-Carrillo v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, 656 F.2d </em>520, 521-22 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Cir. 1981), the Ninth Circuit held that the \"most important single factor [in determining extreme hardship] may be the separation of the alien from family living in the United States____sepa-ration from family alone may establish extreme hardship.\u201d <em>Id. See also Bastida v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>609 F.2d 101, 104-05 (3d Cir.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">. The <em>Vergel </em>Court concluded that it had no jurisdiction to review the original deportation order because a timely appeal was lacking, and could find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion to reopen because the petitioner could not meet the statutory seven years\u2019 residency requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 757.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\">. The relevant portions of the Act have not changed significantly since 1962, when the words \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\" were changed to merely \"extreme hardship.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">We recognize, as did the Eighth Circuit in <em>Rios-Pineda v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>720 F.2d 529, 530-31 (8th Cir.1983) that recent legislative action\" may render this case \"moot\u201d due to the extended period of time Ramona has been within U.S. borders. On June 20, 1984, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1510, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1983, which had twice previously passed the Senate as S. 529. A \"legalization\u201d provision, one of the more hotly contested portions of the new law, would grant amnesty, from deportation- to many long term resident, yet \"illegal\" immigrants presently within our borders. <em>See </em>129 Cong.Rec. S6905-S6987 (daily ed. May 18, 1983) (consideration and passage of S. 529, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983)); 130 Cong.Rec. H6149-H6150 (daily ed. June 20, 1984) (passage of H.R. 1510, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The bill, however, is not yet law, having gone from the House floor to a conference committee for negotiation of possible revisions. We, like the Eighth Circuit, therefore \"have no choice but to decide this case based on an immigration policy embodied in laws passed in substance over two decades ago.\u201d <em>Rios-Pineda, supra, </em>720 F.2d at 531. Nonetheless, we find no disagreement with the closing words of the Eighth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">We do not question the Board\u2019s sincerity in attempting to implement the immigration policy which languishes in our federal statutes. We do require that [the present] policy be followed to the letter and in a spirit of total fairness to those persons who may be permanently exiled from our shores as a result of its implementation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 534.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b558-14\">.

We point out that the Board, while recognizing that Ramona's sister Elia may now remain in the United States, failed to consider this separation as a factor in determining extreme hardship to Ramona. Elia is the relative to whom Ramona feels closest. While the other members of the immediate family live in Mexico, Elia has been in the United States since 1969, when she and Ramona arrived together. Under <em>Antoine-Dorcelli </em>and <em>Santana-Figueroa, </em>this factor warranted a more \"fact sensitive inquiry.\u201d <em>Antoine-Dorcelli, supra, </em>703 F.2d at 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b559-16\">. We also point out that our own opinion in <em>Vargas-Gonzales v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>647 F.2d 457 (5th Cir.1981), indicates that noneconomic factors play a strong part in extreme hardship determinations. There, we remanded to the Board for reconsideration of whether the 7 year \"continuous physical presence\u201d requirement had been met. Although the Board had not previously reached the issue of extreme hardship because it held that the continuous presence requirement had not been satisfied, we observed that the petitioner had been a \"resident, householder and steadily employed resident of the United States since 1967, a family man of good moral character ... whose deportation will cause hardship to his family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459. We found that \"the record reflected] nothing to question the uncontrovert-ed showing\u201d that the petitioner himself, who had \"a wife and home in El Paso,\" and had been \"continuously employed by the same employer since 1969,\u201d had \u201cfully satisfied the ... hardship eligibility requirements for suspension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
