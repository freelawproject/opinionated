The Union distributed handbills asking Smith\u2019s customers not to patronize Smith\u2019s markets because Smith\u2019s had failed to ensure that the new market would be built by union labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">This court has jurisdiction of this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (1982). We conclude that the issuance of the injunction violated the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">The district' court held that the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not prevent the court from issuing injunctive relief because the controversy between Smith\u2019s and the Union did not grow out of a \u201clabor dispute\u201d as defined by section 13(c) of that Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court found there was no labor dispute in this case because the Union is not attempting to organize or to negotiate for Smith\u2019s employees and because Smith\u2019s and Desert Valley Electric are in \u201cno wise substantially aligned ... in any economic way or ... in any other way.\u201d On appeal, the determination of whether such a \u201clabor dispute\u201d exists in the present case \u201cis a question of law which the court must answer from the whole record.\u201d <em>Hasbrouck v. Sheet Metal Workers Local 232, </em>586 F.2d 691, 694 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">The Union is engaged in a dispute with the subcontractor, Desert Valley Electric, over that subcontractor\u2019s refusal to employ union labor. This controversy\u2014 whether the subcontractor will remain a non-union employer \u2014 is plainly one which concerns \u201cthe association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c). As such, it is a \u201clabor dispute\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuar-dia Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The Union\u2019s handbilling of Smith\u2019s customers is expressly intended to influence the outcome of the Union\u2019s labor dispute with Desert Valley Electric.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such \u201cpressure tactically, directed toward a neutral employer in a labor dispute not his own,\u201d is, of course, the \u201ccentral aspect\u201d of the classic secondary boycott. <em>National Woodwork Manufacturer\u2019s Association v. NLRB, </em>386 U.S. 612, 623, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 1257, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967). There is no question that under the Norris-LaGuardia Act a secondary boycott can be found to involve or grow out of a labor dispute. <em>Id.; United States v. Hutcheson, </em>312 U.S. 219, 231, 61 S.Ct. 463, 465, 85 L.Ed. 788 (1941); <em>California Association of Employers v. Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, </em>178 F.2d 175, 179 (9th Cir.1949). The Supreme Court has noted that in the NorrisLaGuardia Act, \u201cCongress abolished, for purposes of labor immunity, the distinction between primary activity between the \u2018immediate disputants\u2019 and secondary activity in which the employer disputants and the members of the union do not stand \u2018in the proximate relation of employer and employee ____\u2019\u201d <em>National Woodwork Manufacturers Association v. NLRB, </em>386 U.S. at 623, 87 S.Ct. at 1257 (citation omitted). There is also no doubt that \u201c[s]ale by a merchant of non-union commodities is ... a traditional source of labor disputes within the scope of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\u201d <em>Bakery Sales Drivers Local Union No. 33 v. Wagshal, </em>333 U.S. 437, 444, 68 S.Ct. 630, 633, 92 L.Ed. 792 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">The Union here is acting against a secondary employer, Smith\u2019s, in an effort to promote the interest of the members of the Union in a contest with a primary employer, Desert Valley Electric, over terms and conditions of employment. Accordingly we hold that this secondary boycott grows out of or involves a labor dispute and that the preliminary injunction was therefore issued in violation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">We reject Smith\u2019s argument that the dispute between the Union and Smith\u2019s remains outside the scope of the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act because of the supposedly tenuous nature of the relationship between Smith\u2019s, as lessee of a market, and Desert Valley Electric, as subcontractor. Citing secondary boycott decisions of other circuits, Smith\u2019s contends that federal courts will not find that a secondary boycott has grown out of a labor dispute unless the primary employer and the secondary employer are in fact economically aligned in some substantial manner. <em>See, e.g., Ashley, Drew &amp; Northern Ry. v. United Transportation Union, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>625 F.2d 1357 (8th Cir.1980); <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., </em>362 F.2d 649 (5th Cir.), <em>aff'd by an equally divided Court, </em>385 U.S. 20, 87 S.Ct. 226, 17 L.Ed.2d 20 (1966). Because the premise of this rule is that \u201cthe scope of Norris-LaGuardia\u2019s protection is determined by the union\u2019s self interest,\u201d <em>Ashley, Drew &amp; Northern Railway v. United Transportation Union, </em>625 F.2d at 1365 n. 10, a case is considered to involve or grow out of a labor dispute \u201conly when the offending activity is furthering the union\u2019s economic interest in a labor dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1363. Under the \u201ceconomic self-interest test\u201d of the Fifth and Eighth Circuits, a union engaging in a secondary boycott is furthering its economic self-interest only if the secondary employer is \u201csubstantially aligned\u201d with the primary employer. <em>Id. </em>at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">When applying the \u201ceconomic self-interest\u201d test, courts assess for themselves the degree of \u201calignment\u201d between employers. The \u201csubstantial alignment\u201d inquiry, in fact, requires that the court decide whether the union\u2019s secondary target <em>actually </em>possessed sufficient economic power over the primary employer to affect the outcome of the underlying labor dispute. The Union\u2019s belief in the efficiency of a secondary boycott is irrelevant to this inquiry. Thus, the Fifth Circuit found that the operator of a railroad terminal picketed by a union engaged in a labor dispute with a railroad could not obtain injunctive relief because the railroad received services from the terminal that <em>\u2018\u2018in fact </em>constitute^] an integral part of [the struck railroad\u2019s] day-to-day operations.\u201d <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., </em>362 F.2d at 651 (emphasis in original). On the other hand, in <em>Ashley, Drew &amp; Northern Railway v. United Transportation Union, </em>the Eighth Circuit found that an injunction could issue against the union because the union failed to present evidence showing that the target of the secondary picketing, Ashley, Drew &amp; Northern Railway, the operator of a rail yard, had any substantial connection with the primary employer, Rock Island Railroad. 625 F.2d at 1364-65. In fact, courts have found \u201csubstantial alignment\u201d between employers only when the secondary employer provides the primary employer with essential services or facilities, participates in a joint strike insurance plan, or has some other \u201csignificant commonality of interest\u201d with the primary employer. <em>Id. </em>at 1363-65 (citing cases). <em>See, e.g., Amalgamated Association of Street Employers v. Dixie Motor Coach Corp., </em>170 F.2d 902 (8th Cir.1948). Smith\u2019s urges that under this \u201ceconomic self-interest\u201d test, no labor dispute exists in this case, because \u201c[i]t is difficult to emphasize too much the absolute absence of <em>any </em>relationship between Smithes and Desert Valley Electric.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Mindful that \u201cthe term \u2018labor dispute\u2019 must not be narrowly construed,\u201d <em>Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, Inc. v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, </em>457 U.S. 702, 712, 102 S.Ct. 2673, 2681, 73 L.Ed.2d 327 (1982), we reject the \u201ceconomic self-interest test\u201d applied by the Fifth and Eighth Circuits and urged upon us by Smith\u2019s. We decline to adopt a rule which would exclude a secondary boycott from the anti-injunction provisions of the NorrisLaGuardia Act simply because the union is unable to establish that the secondary employer is in fact \u201csubstantially aligned\u201d with the primary employer. Such a rule puts the courts in the untenable position of second-guessing a union as to the effectiveness of a particular boycott in achieving a union\u2019s goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">In those cases where the Supreme Court has held that a controversy between a labor organization and an employer did not involve or grow out of a \u201clabor dispute,\u201d it has determined that the controversy was not in fact a dispute affecting the employer-employee relationship, but rather was a dispute upon which the employer-employee relationship had no bearing at all. The Supreme Court has not narrowed the definition of the term \u201clabor dispute,\u201d nor has the court made that definition turn on detailed judicial fact-finding relating to the economic effectiveness of a particular boycott. Rather, the Court has simply made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>.clear that \u201cthe protections of ... [the Norris-LaGuardia] Act do not extend to labor organizations when they cease to act as labor groups or when they enter into illegal combinations with non-labor groups in restraint of trade.\u201d <em>Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, Inc. v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, </em>457 U.S. at 714, 102 S.Ct. at 2682 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In <em>Columbia River Packers Association, Inc. v. Hinton, </em>315 U.S. 143, 62 S.Ct. 520, 86 L.Ed. 750 (1942), for example, where the union acted as agent for its members in negotiating contracts for those members\u2019 sales of fish to canners and processors, the Court held that there was no \u201clabor dispute\u201d involved because the controversy was actually \u201ca dispute among businessmen over the terms of a contract for the sale of fish, not a controversy over \u201cterms or conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415; <em>see also American Federation of Musicians v. Carroll, </em>391 U.S. 99, 88 S.Ct. 1562, 20 L.Ed.2d 460 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Thus, the Supreme Court has not fashioned a narrowing \u201csubstantial alignment/economic self-interest\u201d test reserved exclusively for resolving the special problem of whether a secondary boycott involves or grows out of a \u201clabor dispute.\u201d Smith\u2019s relies on <em>Bakery Sales Drivers Local Union No. 33 v. Wagshal, </em>333 U.S. 437, 68 S.Ct. 630, 92 L.Ed. 792 (1948), to support its argument that because of the supposed lack of economic alignment between Smith\u2019s and Desert Valley Electric, the controversy between Smith\u2019s and the Union does not involve or grow out of a labor dispute. Smith\u2019s reliance on <em>Wagshal </em>is misplaced. As the Supreme Court has recently noted, the Court held in <em>Wagshal </em>\u201conly that a controversy between two businessmen over the delivery times or methods of payment does not become a labor dispute merely because a union representative, with or without his employer\u2019s consent, sought to obtain payment pursuant to a particular method.\u201d <em>Jacksonville Bulk Terminals v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, </em>457 U.S. at 713-14 n. 13, 102 S.Ct. at 2681 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Here, there can be no question that the underlying controversy between the Union and Desert Valley Electric is a labor dispute. Nor can it be doubted that the Union\u2019s handbilling of Smith\u2019s customers is designed to influence the outcome of that labor dispute. Our inquiry need go no further. We hold that this case grows out of a \u201clabor dispute\u201d within the meaning of section 13(c) of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c). The district court therefore had no jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">The preliminary injunction is VACATED and this case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">. Pointing to the various state tort claims included in the complaint, Smith\u2019s argues that the Norris-LaGuardia Act is not applicable when a federal court bases equitable relief on state law claims over which the court has pendent jurisdiction. In this case, however, the district court relied upon section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187, as the source of its authority to issue the preliminary injunction. No mention is made of Smith\u2019s state law claims in the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\">.
