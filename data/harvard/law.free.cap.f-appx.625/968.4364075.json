McCavey, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint filed against nine defendants involved in varying degrees with his state divorce action, asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Georgia state law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>On appeal, McCavey argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and abused its discretion in not'allowing him to file his amended complaint prior to doing so. However, after reviewing the record on appeal and the parties\u2019 arguments, we find that McCavey;s action was properly dismissed. As'the district court concluded, \u201c42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 is not an appropriate device for obtaining collateral review of state court judgments, as [McCavey] seeks to do here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">McCavey also argues that the district court\u2019s grant of appellee Gold\u2019s motion for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 sanctions was inappropriate. Because the district court\u2019s order granting Gold\u2019s sanctions motion was not final, we do not have jurisdiction to consider it, and we dismiss McCavey\u2019s appeal of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Additionally, appellee Gold filed a motion in this court for just damages and double costs under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, but we find that McCa-vey\u2019s pro se appeal is not so frivolous and devoid of merit as to warrant sanctions. Accordingly, we deny Gold\u2019s request for Rule 38 sanctions. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">We review dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Parise v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1463, 1465 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThe burden for establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction rests with the party bringing the claim.\u201d <em>Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd. v. APJ Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">The district court dismissed McCavey\u2019s action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on its application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides that \u201cfederal district courts generally lack jurisdiction to review a final state court decision.\u201d' <em>See Doe v. Florida Bar, </em>630 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2011); <em>see also Lance v. Dennis, </em>546 U.S. 459, 463, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 1201, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2006) (per curiam) (noting that, under the doctrine, \u201clower federal 'courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-c\u00f3urt judgments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">The doctrine precludes jurisdiction in \u201c \u2018cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries .caused by state-court judgm\u00e9nts rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alvarez v. Att\u2019y Gen. of Fla., </em>679 F.3d 1257, 1262 (11th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22,161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005)). .It applies when issues presented to the district court. are \u201cinextricably intertwined with the state court judgment so that (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>the success of the federal claim would effectively nullify the state court judgment, or that (2) the federal claim would succeed only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">As an initial matter, the district court did not dismiss McCavey\u2019s complaint without allowing him to amend it, as it reviewed the amended complaint and dismissed it for the same reasons as the first complaint. Next, the district court did not err in dismissing McCavey\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in light of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, because McCavey was a state court loser and his complaint was inextricably intertwined with the state decision in his divorce proceeding. <em>See id. </em>The state court proceedings had ended: McCavey filed the present complaint almost two years after the state court issued its judgment in his divorce action. <em>See Nicholson v. Shafe, 558 </em>F.3d 1266, 1275 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[I]f a lower state court issues a judgment and the losing party allows the time for appeal to expire, then the state proceedings have ended.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). And McCavey is, in effect, seeking \u201creview and rejection of the' state court judgment.\u201d <em>See Alvarez, </em>679 F.3d at 1263. By arguing that the \u2019 defendants in this action, who were involved or allegedly involved in th\u00e9 divorce decision, acted improperly in relation to that decision, McCavey was a \u201cstate court loser\u201d seeking redress for injuries incurred during and as a result of the divorce judgment. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">McCavey\u2019s civil rights and state claims were inextricably intertwined with the state divorce decision, because \u201cthe federal claim would succeed only to the extent that the \u2022 state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1262 (internal quotation marks omitted). We agree with the distinct court\u2019s characterization of McCavey\u2019s contention: that, in essence, the state divorce judgment was improperly rendered. While he did not expressly or directly attack the- divorce judgment, his claims for damages against the Appellees are based on their actions in relation to his divorce proceeding. -McCavey would only be entitled to damages from the alleged wrongs tq the, extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues presented in the divorce case. <em>See id. </em>And McCavey\u2019s amended complaint did not cure this deficiency. The few added allegations did not prevent the application of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because these allegations wer\u00e9 also based on the Appellees\u2019 actions during his state court -divorce proceeding and, .therefore, were inextricably intertwined as discussed previously. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">furthermore, McCavey\u2019s argument that he could not have reasonably raised his issues in state court proceedings fails. <em>See Wood v. Orange Cnty., </em>715 F.2d 1543, 1546-47 (11th Cir.1983) (noting that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine only precludes federal court review of federal claims that the plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity to raise in an earlier state proceeding). As shown by his filing of objections during his divorce action, he could have reasonably raised issues concerning the actions of certain Appellees.during the course of that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">He'could also have raised issues concerning-the state court\u2019s alleged biases on appeal, rather than determining that such an appeal would be \u201cfutile.\u201d Although his allegations did not involve issues relating to the-divorce judgment (such as amount of alimony and custody), they did relate to the structure and nattxre of the divorce proceedings, which are relevant to raise during the trial and on-appeal. <em>See Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1261 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cIf [the appellant] believed the state court\u2019s result was based on a legal error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>the proper response was the same one open to all litigants who are .unhappy with the judgment of a trial court: direct appeal. We are not a clearinghouse for ... overstock arguments; if he did not offer them to the state courts \u2014 or if the state courts did.not buy them \u2014 he cannot unload them by attempting to sell them to us.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Next, we conclude that we do not \u25a0have jurisdiction over the appeal of the district court\u2019s order granting appellee Gold\u2019s motion for sanctions pursuant-to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. We have an obligation to review sua sponte whether we have jurisdiction at any point in: the appellate process. <em>Reaves v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>717 F.3d 8.86, 905 (11th Cir.2013). We only have jurisdiction over appeals from \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of the district courts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. .A sanction order that awards attorney\u2019s fees but does not determine the amount of those fees is not final. <em>Santini v. Cleveland Clinic Fla., </em>232 F.3d 823, 825; n. 1 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">The district court\u2019s order granting Gold\u2019s motion for Rule 11 sanctions did not include \u25a0 the amount of attorney\u2019s Tees. McCavey filed his notice of appeal before the district court entered its order setting the amount of those, fees. Therefore,,* the sanction order was not final as of the date McCavey filed his notice of appeal. While the district court did issue a final order and judgment concerning sanctions, McCa-vey did not appeal it, nor did he attempt to amend his, notice of appeal. Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction over McCavey\u2019s appeal of the order granting Rule 11 sanctions, and we dismiss his appeal as to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">After McCavey and,Gold submitted them initial briefs on appeal, Gold filed a motion for just damages and double costs under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38. Gold asserts that this appeal is frivolous and that McCavey knew the appeal'was frivolous after sanctions wer\u00e9 imposed against him by the district court under Rule 11. However, McCavey\u2019s issue on\u2019 appeal \u2014 a challenge to the district court\u2019s application of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>\u2014 is not sufficiently frivolous to impose sanctions on a pro se litigant. <em>See Woods v. I.R.S., </em>3 F.3d 403, 404 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (noting our reluctance to impose sanctions against a pro se litigant even in a clearly frivolous appeal). Even though McCavey may not have strong arguments, his arguments are not as patently frivolous in the face of established law and \u201cutterly devoid of merit\u201d as in the cases in which this court has sanctioned pro se parties. <em>Cf. Bonfiglio v. Nugent, </em>986, F.2d 1391, 1393-94 (11th Cir.1993); <em>Stoecklin v. C.I.R., </em>865 F.2d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir.1989). Furthermore, McCavey has not advanced any arguments on appeal that we have repeatedly held to be frivolous and worthy of-sanctions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Morse, </em>532 F.3d 1130, 1132-83 (11th Cir.2008) (per. curiam). Accordingly, Gold\u2019s motion for just damages and- double costs pursuant to Rule 38 is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of McCavey\u2019s suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We dismiss McCavey\u2019s appeal with regard to the district court\u2019s order granting sanctions, and we deny Gold\u2019s motion for sanctions.-</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART, MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-13\">.
