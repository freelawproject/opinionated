Far-id argues that- material- disputes of fact exist about whether she was denied promotions, mispaid, required to complete extra duties, and blamed for wrongdoing because she is white and Egyptian; whether she was disciplined because of her disability; and whether she was retaliated against for filing a charge of discrimination] We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a summary judgment and view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1263 (11th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">We review claims of discrimination and retaliation based on circumstantial evidence using the burden-shifting framework established by' the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1264. Under that framework, an employee must establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation, which creates a rebuttable presumption -that the employer has acted unlawfully. <em>Id. </em>The employer can rebut the presumption , by proffering a legitimate reason for its conduct. <em>Id. </em>If the employer provides a legitimate reason, the employee must prove that the reason is a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">The district court did not err when ' it entered' summary judgment against Farid\u2019s complaint of discrimination based on her race and national origin. Farid failed to establish a prima facie case that she was denied promotions because of her ethnicity. <em>See id. </em>As the. district court stated, Farid did not identify what \u201cposition\u201d she sought, whether she was qualified for the position, whether she was similarly situated to \u201cthe person who ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tained the position,\u201d or what \u201cdifference obtaining the position ... would have made .to [her] in pay or other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d With respect to Farid\u2019s claim about pay errors, she failed to establish that the legitimate reasons the Postmaster proffered for the miscalculations were pretextual. <em>See Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2007). Undisputed eviden.ce established that \u201c[e]rrors in pay processing for rural carriers associates like\u201d Farid were attributable to the varied methods used to record \u201cwork in different offices and ... [for] different routes\u201d; Farid was overpaid once and the agency made an \u201cadjustment\u201d to remedy the error; and the Service compensated Farid for underpayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Farid also failed to establish a prima facie case of a hostile work environment. <em>See McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1378 (11th Cir.2008). Farid was required for .one week to examine postal vehicles, was erroneously blamed for injuring herself, and received warning letters twice for obstructing her coworkers\u2019 parking spaces, but those \u201csporadic and isolated\u201d incidents did not affect Farid\u2019s position with the Postal Service. <em>See id. </em>at 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The district court also did not err when it entered summary judgment against Farid\u2019s complaint of discrimination based on a disability. Farid failed to establish that she had an impairment that constituted a disability when-the Postmaster asked her to resume her full time duties as a mail carrier in January 2010. <em>See Cash v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir.2000). Farid submitted a doctor\u2019s report that -restricted her from \u201cdriving with [a] headache\u201d and carrying heavy items, but Farid offered-no evidence that the restrictions \u201csubstantially limit[ed] one or more of [her] major life activities.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(1)(A); <em>see also </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(j)(l). And, even if we were to assume that Farid was disabled, she could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination because the Postmaster fully accommodated her requests for different work assignments. <em>See Sutton v. Lader, </em>185 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.1999). When Farid opposed resuming full time duties, the Postmaster offered her a position to deliver mail \u201cas needed [within her] limitations\u201d without having to \u201clift[ ] more than 10 pounds\u201d or \u201cdriv[e} with a reported headache.\u201d At Farid\u2019s request, the Postmaster further modified her position to relieve her of \u201cdelivery duties;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The district court also did not err by entering summary judgment against Farid\u2019s complaint of retaliation. Farid failed to establish a prima facie case because she presented no evidence of a materially adverse employment action that was causally connected to a protected activity. <em>See Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, </em>996 F.2d 1155, 1163 (11th Cir.1993). Farid\u2019s\u2019allegations about being underpaid and mistreated by her supervisors between 2005 and 2009 were not retaliatory because they predated the filing of her charge of discrimination in April 2010. Although Farid was required to examine vehicles for one week, was blamed errantly for injuring herself, and received warnings for blocking parking spots, those actions were not materially .adverse because they did not \u201caffect the terms and conditions of [Farid\u2019s] employment.\u201d <em>See Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 64, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2412-13, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). Farid also alleged that she was instructed not to touch the telephone or to perform clerical duties in retaliation for her charge of discrimination, but the Postmaster presented undisputed evidence that limited-duty employees like Farid were prohibited from performing clerical duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>because of a dispute with the postal workers\u2019 union.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of the Postmaster.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
