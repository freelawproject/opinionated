Bozorgmehr Pouyeh, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals, the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his fourth amended complaint. Pouyeh filed suit after he applied for and did not receive a position in the residency program of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) School of Ophthalmology. His fourth amended complaint alleged that he was denied a resident position because he was an Iranian citizen, and that the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama System, the Board\u2019s members, UAB, and various UAB employees had violated his federal statutory and constitutional rights. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, doing so with prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We review that dismissal <em>de novo. Edwards v. Prime, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir.2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Count One asserts that the Board is liable under Title VII because it \u201chas ex-r eluded systematically Iranian doctors from [residency] position[s]\u201d by requiring them to have graduated .from a medical school accredited by either the American Medical Association (AMA) or the Canadian Medical Association (CMA). Construed liberally, Count One asserts three claims for relief: (1) a disparate-treatment claim, (2) a disparate-impact claim, and (3) a pattern- or-practice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">To make out a disparate-treatment claim, 'Pouyeh\u2019s complaint must contain factual allegations demonstrating, either directly or circumstantially, that the Board\u2019s actions were based on his national origin. <em>See Raj v. La. State Univ., </em>714 F.3d 322, 331 (5th Cir.2013); <em>cf. EEOG v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that, at summary judgment, a disparate \u2014 treatment claim must be supported by direct or circumstantial evidence of discrimination). Here, the complaint does not \u201ccontain sufficient factual matter\u201d to plausibly suggest that the Board intentionally excluded Pouyeh and other applicants based on their national origin. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The most plausible explanation \u2014 indeed, the one provided in the complaint itself \u2014 is that Pouyeh was disqualified from consideration because he did not graduate from an AMA- or CMA-accredited medical school.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rejecting applicants based on whether the medical schools they attended were accredited by the AMA or the CMA-is not discrimination based on national origin. <em>See Maceluch v. Wysong, </em>680 F.2d 1062, 1065 (5th Cir.1982) (explaining that a policy \u201cbased upon the locality of the education received\u201d does not discriminate based on alienage because \u201c[substantial. numbers of Americans attend medical schools abroad,, just as some foreigners attend medical schools in the United States\u201d). Pouyeh\u2019s complaint therefore has not alleged facts that establish a plausible Title VII disparate-treatment claim. <em>See Iqbal </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129. S.Ct. at 1949 (\u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). '</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">To make out a disparate-impact claim, Pouyeh must allege facts establishing that the Board\u2019s admission policy has a \u201csignificant adverse effect[]\u201d on a protected group. <em>Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., </em>594 F.3d 798, 807-08 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). That requires factual allegations \u2014 usually a statistical disparity \u2014 demonstrating a disparity in treatment between groups so significant that it supports an inference that discrimination is the cause. <em>See id.; Armstrong v. Flowers Hosp., Inc., </em>33 F.3d 1308, 1314-15 (11th Cir.1994). Pouyeh\u2019s complaint contains no such factual allegations, only the-bare assertidn that the Board has \u201cexcluded systematically Iranian doctors\u201d and that one of Pouyeh\u2019s friends from Iran was also denied a residency position at UAB\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>School of Ophthalmology. That is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">And as for the pattern-or-practice claim, such claims may be brought under Title VII by the government or by a class of private plaintiffs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). <em>Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol, </em>516 F.3d 955, 964-65 (11th Cir.2008); <em>E.E.O.C. v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, Inc., </em>220 F.3d 1263, 1286 (11th Cir.2000). Pouyeh is not the government, and he has not brought a class- action under Rule 23(b)(2). He has therefore failed to state a claim for relief under a pattern-or-practice theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Count Two asserts that the Board is liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 for discrimination against Pouyeh based on \u201chis alienage/National Origin.\u201d This claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment, which prevents federal courts from hearing a \u00a7 1981 claim \u201cin which the state or one or more of its agencies is ... the defendant,\u201d <em>Brown v. E. Cent. Health Dist., </em>752 F.2d 615, 617 (11th Cir.1985). The Board is a state agency.' <em>See Harden v. Adams, </em>760 F.2d 1158, 1163-64 (11th Cir.1985) (holding that Alabama\u2019s state university boards are state agencies for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment). So Pouyeh has not stated \u00e1 claim for relief under \u00a7 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Count Three alleges that UAB and the Board violated Title VI because they \u201cexcluded systematically Iranian doctors from ophthalmology.residency and internship positions.\u201d Title VI provides that: \u201cNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of ... national origin, be excluded from participatioh in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. A defendant is not liable under Title VI unless the defendant\u2019s actions constitute \u00e1 violation of the Fourteenth\" Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. <em>See </em>I.L. <em>v. Alabama, </em>739 F.3d 1273, 1288 n. 10 (11th Cir.2014). As we have already explained, rejecting an applicant based on whether his medical school Was accredited by the AMA or the CMA is not discrimination based on the applicant\u2019s national origin. <em>See Maceluch, </em>680 F.2d at 1065-67. UAB\u2019s.,requirement that applicants attend an AMA- or CMA-certified medical school is therefore subject only to rational basis review, and it satisfies the rational-basis test. <em>Cf. id. </em>(holding that a State\u2019s refusal to -grant \u201cthe \u2018M.D.\u2019 designation\u201d to individuals with a \u201cDoctor of Osteopathy\u201d degree is subject to, and satisfies, the rational-basis test). Pouyeh has failed to state a claim for relief under Title VI. -</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The remaining four counts of Pouyeh\u2019s complaint assert the same two theories of liability against the individual members of the Board and three UAB employees. Those counts allege that the individual defendants: (1) deprived Pouyeh \u201cof equal benefit of laws\u201d under Title VI and Title VII; and (2) violated his \u201cconstitutionally substantive due process right to employment, education, obtaining license to continue his profession in the United States, appropriate socioeconomic status, property) and marriage.\u201d Pouyeh has failed to state a claim based on the first theory because there is no individual liability under Title VI or Title VII. <em>Shotz v. City of Plantation, </em>344 F.3d 1161, 1171 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>2003) (\u201cIt is beyond question ... that individuals are not liable under Title VI.\u201d); <em>Busby v. City of Orlando, </em>931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cThe relief granted under Title VII is against the <em>employer, </em>not individual employees whose actions would constitute a violation of the Act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Pouyeh has failed to state a claim against the individual defendants under his second theory because he has not identified a constitutional right that was actually violated. Except for marriage, there is no substantive due process right to any of the items that Pouyeh claims as constitutional rights. <em>See Pollard v. Cockrell, </em>578 F.2d 1002, 1011 (5th Cir.1978)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (rejecting the notion that there is a substantive due process \u201cright to engage in a lawful business, trade, or profession\u201d); <em>Mahavongsanan v. Hall, </em>529 F.2d 448, 450 (5th Cir.1976) (rejecting a substantive due process right to higher' education). And the complaint does not provide any explanation for how denying Pouyeh a residency position infringed on his constitutionally protected right to marry. <em>Cf. Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 386, 98 S.Ct. 673, 681, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978) (rejecting the notion \u201cthat every state regulation which relates in any way to the incidents of or prerequisites for marriage must be subjected to rigorous scrutiny\u201d and declaring that \u201creasonable regulations that do not significantly interfere with decisions to enter into the marital relationship may legitimately be imposed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\">. In, his. brief to this Court, Pouyeh raises several issues that were not presented to the district court in this case, but were, raised in a separate discrimination suit that Pouyeh filed against the University of Miami for denying him admission to its ophthalmology residency program. <em>See Pouyeh v. Bascom Palmer Eye Inst., </em>613 Fed.Appx. 802, 805-06 (11th Cir.2015) (unpublished), (addressing- Pouyeh\u2019s claim that the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, established by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal </em>and <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>is unconstitutional). We will not address those issues because they were not presented to the district court in this case. <em>See Harris Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Iranian Radio &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Television, </em>691 F.2d 1344, 1353 (11th Cir.1982) (\"Generally, an appellate court will not consider issues not raised in the district court.\"); <em>see also Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts, B.V. </em>v. <em>Consorcio Barr S.A., </em>377 F.3d 1164, 1167 (11th Cir.2004) (rejecting the practice of incorporating by reference the arguments that a party made in a brief that it filed outside of the appeal before the court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">. Because the fourth amended complaint asserts, that this is the policy governing admission to UAB\u2019s School of Ophthalmology, we must assume that it is. <em>See Corsello v. Lineare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1012 (11th Cir.2005) (\"On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, we accept as, true the facts as alleged in the complaint.\u201d). .. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\">. In his brief to this Court, Pouyeh also asserts that he has a\u2019 claim' to relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-3. He did not raise this theory of liability in the district court; so we' will not consider it here. <em>Fils v. City of Aventura, </em>647 F.3d 1272, 1284 (11th Cir.2011) (\"To prevail on a particular theory of liability, a party must present that argument to the district court.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661.
