We granted Mr. Mostow-icz a certificate of appealability on a single issue: Whether trial counsel rendered-ineffective assistance by advising him to reject the government\u2019s conditional plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Upon review of the record and the briefs, we conclude that Mr. Mostowicz failed to allege or explain how -or why his lawyer\u2019s advice was constitutionally deficient. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s d\u00e9nial of Mr.-Mostowicz\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. '</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">I<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3W\">In 2010, a federal grand jury indicted Mr. Mostowicz for possession of cocaine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), and alprazolam (xanax) with intent to distribute, in violation -'of 21'-U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(2), and possession of a-firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, in violation\u2019 of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). After Mr. Mostowicz filed a motion to suppress, the Assistant' U.S. Attorney in charge of the case sent Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s lawyer ah e-mail regarding a potential plea offer. The e-mail states that the government would not enter into <em>a </em>plea agreement with Mr. Mostowicz if he pursued the motion to suppress. <em>See </em>D.E. 38, tab 11 at pg. 40.The e-mail further states in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-18\">If. your client wants to enter into a plea, agreement with .the government, I would be willing to seek authorization from my supervisors to allow him to plead guilty to the gun charge in exchange for the government\u2019s willingness \u25a0 to dismiss .the drug charge. In that event, your client\u2019s guideline range would be 78 to 84 months, with a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months. -As a condition of our plea agreement, I \u25a0would agree to recommend a sentence of 60 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-19\">Pleas\u00e9 be advised' that I will hot seek authorization from my supervisors to enter into a plea agreement until your client indicates that he is willing to accept the terms outlines [sic] above. Furthermore, please be advised that my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>supervisors may not grant me such authority. Nothing in this letter is intended to convey an official plea offer, unless and until' I receive authorization from my supervisors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>Id. </em>An agreement regarding the potential plea offer was not reached. Mr. Mostow-icz pursued his motion to suppress, which was ultimately denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Mr. Mostowiez eventually pled guilty to the drug and gun charges under a different written plea agreement. During the plea colloquy, Mr. Mostowiez indicated that he understood the potential sentence and that he was satisfied with trial counsel\u2019s representation. <em>See id. </em>at tab 61. At sentencing, Mr. Mostowiez again indicated that he was satisfied with trial counsel. <em>See id. </em>at tab 62. The district court sentenced Mr. Mostowiez to 90 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Mr. Mostowiez then filed a motion to vacate under \u00a7 2255, alleging, among other things, ineffective assistance of counsel. Relevant to this appeal, he argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for recommending that he move forward with the suppression hearing and reject the government\u2019s conditional plea offer. Mr. Mos-towicz\u2019s allegations as to his ineffectiveness claim are worth quoting in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">The plea-offer called for the voluntary dismissal of Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence. Counsel advised Mr. Mostowiez that rejecting the plea offer and proceeding with the Suppression Hearing would likely result in the same five year offer, since the Motion to Suppress would \u2018shake things up[.]\u2019 Counsel further advised he would recommend that Mr. Mostowiez not accept the plea offer and proceed with the Suppression Hearing, since the five year term of imprisonment was still attainable. Had Counsel rendered effective legal advice during the \u2018Plea-bargaining\u2019 phase, then Mr. Mostowiez would have effectively accepted the plea offer and b\u00e9en sentenced to a t\u00e9rm of imprisonment of five years instead of seven and a half years. The Court would have likely accepted the plea, since the proceedings would have been expedited and the judicial economy would have been satisfied. It was-only-due to Counsel\u2019s advice that Mr; Mostowiez did not accept the plea-offer - provided by the Government. Therefore, the proper remedy would be resentencing. Mr. Mostowiez was not properly advised in regard to whether or not he should have accepted the \u2018plea-offer\u2019 offered by [the government].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-11\"><em>See id, </em>at tab CVDE 1, pg. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">The'magistrate judge recommending denying the \u00a7\u2022 2255 motion, <em>see id. </em>at tab 21, concluding that Mr. Mostowiez had failed to demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, because he presented \u201cno evidence, other than self-severing, uncorroborated statements, that his attorney recommended that he reject the government\u2019s conditional plea offer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at pg. 16. The magistrate judge further concluded that Mr. Mostowiez failed to demonstrate prejudice because (1) he offered no evidence that trial counsel recommended accepting the government\u2019s conditional offer; and (2) even if he could prove that trial counsel made such a recommendation, he could not prove that the government would have ultimately agreed to the offer, as it was contingent upon a supervisor\u2019s approval, <em>Id. </em>The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, over Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s objections, and denied his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at tab 23. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Mr. Mostowicz moved for reconsideration, reasserting his ineffective-assistance claim regarding the conditional plea offer. The district court summarily denied the motion,, and subsequently denied Mr. Mos-towiez\u2019s motion for a certificate .of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d), ruling that. Mr. Mostowicz had \u201cfailed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d D.E. 11. '</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">On February 27, 2014,- Mr. Mostowicz applied for a COA in this Court. .On July 7, 2014 \u2014 before we ruled on his motion for COA \u2014 Mr. Mostowicz filed another motion, asking this Court to remand the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. <em>See </em>D.E..17. On December 2, 2014 \u2014 before issuing an order on Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s motion to remand \u2014 we granted a COA on a single issue: \u201cWhether [Mr.] Mostowicz\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by., advising him to reject a government plea offer?\u201d D.E. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Approximately one month later, Mr. Mostowicz filed his initial brief. <em>See </em>D.E. 23. He did not argue that the district court erred by failing to hold an evidentia-ry hearing. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The following month, a three-judge panel of this Court issued an order on Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s motion for remand, which was construed as a motion for summary\u2019 reversal. The panel \u2019denied Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s request, but permitted him to argue, in his merit briefs,1 \u201cthat the district court erred in denying, without an evidentiary hearing, his claim that his counsel was ineffective for advising him to reject [the]\u2019 government's] plea offer.\u201d The panel explained that such an argument was within the scope of the COA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The government\u2019s brief makes' no mention of the lack of an evidentiary hearing. This is not surprising, for Mr. Mostowicz did- not raise the issue in his initial brief, and neither the magistrate judge nor the district court ever addressed the issue. In his reply brief, however, Mr. Mostowicz argues that an evidentiary hearing is required because he.-alleged facts .that, if taken as true, entitle him to relief.-</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">\u201cWhether counsel, rendered ineffective assistance is a mixed question of law and fact- that this Court reviews <em>de novo,\u201d Hagins v. United States, </em>267 F.3d 1202, 1204 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cIn a ... \u00a7- 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286,1287 (11th Cir.2008). A. defendant\u2019s .Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel extends to the, plea-bargaining process. <em>See Lafler v. Cooper, </em>\u2014 U.S. - \u2014 , 132 S.Ct. 1376, 1384, 182 L.Ed.2d 398 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">The \u201cbenchmark\u201d for judging a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel -is whether counsel\u2019s performance- \u201cso undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the [proceedings] cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the' petitioner must demonstrate that his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient'and that he was prejudiced by the deficiency. <em>See id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We are not required to consider the defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ciency and prejudice prongs in any particular order. <em>See id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (explaining that \u201ca court need not' determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies\u201d). And we \u201cneed not address the [prejudice] prong if the defendant cannot meet the [performance] prong, ... or vice versa.\u201d <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Strickland).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In judging whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the proper measure is reasonableness under prevailing professional norms. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To be constitutionally deficient, counsel\u2019s performance must fall \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness[.]\u201d <em>Atkins v. Attorney Gen. of State of Ala., </em>932 F.2d 1430, 1432 (11th Cir.1991). We must take care to \u201celiminate the distorting effects of hindsight\u201d when evaluating an attorney\u2019s performance, \u201cand [we] evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cBecause of the difficulties inherent in making th[is] evaluation, [there is] a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct f[ell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound ... strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See also Kimmel-man v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986) (\u201cCounsel\u2019s competence ... is presumed, and the defendant must rebut this presumption by <em>proving </em>that his attorney\u2019s representation was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms and that the challenged action was not sound strategy.\u201d) (emphasis added and internal citation.omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ABB\">Indeed, \u201c[J]udicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance [is] highly deferential.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We have explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APt\">[t]he test has nothing to do with what the best lawyers would have done. Nor is the test even what most good lawyers would have done. We, ask only whether some reasonable lawyer at the trial could have acted, in\u2019 the circumstances, as defense counsel acted at trial.... We are not interested in grading lawyers\u2019 performances____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\"><em>White v. Singletary, </em>972 F.2d 1218, 1220-21 (11th Cir.1992) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The burden, therefore, was on Mr. Mostowicz .to \u201cestablish!] deficient performance by showing that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Kimbrough v. Sec\u2019y, DOC, </em>565 F.3d 796, 804 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cIt should go without saying, that the absence of evidence cannot overcome the \u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burt v. Titlow, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 10, 17, 187 L.Ed.2d 348 (2013) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052) (alteration original).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Mr. Mostowicz admits that his lawyer advised him of the details of the government\u2019s conditional plea offer. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2 (\u201cMovant was advised by counsel that there was a plea offer of [60] months imprisonment in exchange for willingness to withdraw the motion to suppress[.]\u201d). He claims that \u201c[c]ounsel advised that a[60] month sentence ... was still likely\u201d even if he went forward with the motion to suppress, because the suppression hearing would \u201cshake things up.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>Id. </em>He argues that he would have accepted the government\u2019s conditional offer Had' he known that there was no chance of obtaining a 60-month sentence if he litigated the motion to suppress. \u25a0 <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">On this record, the district court correctly rejected Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s ineffectiveness claim. Mr. Mostowicz did not explain how or why his lawyer\u2019s advice was constitutionally deficient. Indeed, he failed to make any showing to rebut the presumption that his counsel\u2019s advice \u2014 to proceed with the suppression hearing because the 60-month sentence would still be attainable \u2014 was reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Kimmelman, </em>477 U.S. at 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574. Although Mr. Mos-towicz takes issue with the ultimate outcome of his case, this is not <em>proof </em>of deficiency under <em>Strickland. See Titlow, </em>134 S.Ct. at 17 (\u201c[Wjithout evidence that [counsel] gave incorrect advice or evidence that he failed to give material advice, [a defendant] cannot establish that his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d) (internal- quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>Cf. Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1327 (11th Cir.2000) (rejecting ineffective assistance of counsel claim because \u201c[p]eti-tioner\u2019s evidence was insufficient\u2019 to prove that his trial -counsel\u2019s acts , were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Mr. Mostowicz did not allege (much less show), that the motion to'-suppress was doomed to fail. Although the motion was ultimately denied, it may have been reasonable for trial counsel, under the circumstances at the time, to conclude that there was a good chance the motion was going to succeed, and that, as a result, some or all of\u2019 the charges against Mr. Mostowicz would have been dismissed. Nor did Mr. Mostowicz allege (or show) that his counsel\u2019s advice \u2014 that a 60-month sentence would still be possible even if he moved forward with the motion to suppress \u2014 was incorrect at the time, much less ineffective under <em>Strickland. </em>In fact, because the district court could have sentenced Mr. Mostowicz to 60 months through a variance, it appears that counsel\u2019s advice was not legally incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Simply put, advice, although incorrect in retrospect, does not necessarily rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Premo v. Moore, </em>562 U.S. 115, 132, 131 S.Ct. 733, 745, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011) (explaining that \u201chindsight cannot suffice for relief when counsel\u2019s choices were reasonable and legitimate based on predictions of how the trial would proceed\u201d). We conclude that the district court correctly denied Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the performance prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">In his reply brief, Mr. Mostowicz argues that an evidentiary hearing whs required because he alleged facts that, if taken as true, entitle him to relief. Generally, we do not address issues raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1183 (11th Cir.2003). We recognize, however, that a panel of this Court issued an order allowing Mr. Mos-towicz to argue the lack of an evidentiary hearing his merit briefs. <em>See </em>D.E. 29. That order was issued after Mr. Mostowicz filed his initial brief, so the first opportuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ty he had to present an argument on the subject was in his reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Nevertheless, we reject Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s argument on the merits. Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s allegations concerning his counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance were, as we have explained, conclusory. And eoncluso-ry'allegations do not entitle a \u00a7 2255 mov-ant to an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Winthrop-Redin v. United States, </em>767 F.3d 1210, 1216 (11th Cir.2014) (explaining that \u201ca district court need not hold a hearing if the allegations [in a \u00a7 2255 motion] are ... based upon unsupported generalizations\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\">. The documents relevant to Mr. Mostowicz\u2019s criminal case are recorded on the criminal docket, and the documents'\" relevant to his \u00a7 2255 motion are recorded on the civil docket. For clarity, we cite to the Appendix for the United States filed with this Court (D.E. 38, tab \u2014), unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">. We affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress on direct appeal. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Mostowicz, </em>471 Fed.Appx. 887 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">. Mr. Mostowicz does not refer to or challenge the order denying his motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we do not address the issue. <em>See Timson v.

Even if Mr, Mostowicz had shown that- his lawyer made a tactical mistake by advising him to move forward with the suppression hearing and reject the government\u2019s conditional plea offer \u2014 and we do not hold that he has \u2014 errors in judgment and tactical miscalculations by a lawyer do not <em>necessarily </em>constitute a denial of effective assistance of counsel. <em>See Odom v. United States, </em>377 F.2d 853, 858 (5th Cir.1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
