The IJ and the BIA denied Marcelus\u2019s applications based on a finding that he was not credible. After review, we deny Marce-lus\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">On appeal, Marcelus contends that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing, with specific and credible evidence, either' past persecution or a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). While an applicant\u2019s\u201d credible testimony may be suf\u00f1ci\u00e9nt t\u00f3 sustain his burden of proof, even without corroborating evidence, Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(ii),. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii), the weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, the gre\u00e1ter the need for corroboration. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Conversely, where the applicant relies solely on his testimony, an adverse-credibility determination may support denying his application. <em>Lyashchynska v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>676 F.3d 962, 967 (11th Cir.2012). However, if the applicant produces evidence other than his testimony, the IJ and the BIA must consider this evidence as well. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In making an adverse credibility finding, the IJ must be explicit and offer \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for the finding. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), as amended by the REAL ID Act, the IJ, in evaluating credibility must consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d including (1) the applicant\u2019s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness; (2) the inherent- plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account; (3) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written and' oral statements; (4) the internal consistency of each statement; (5) the consistency of the statements with other reeord evidence; and (6) any other relevant factor. INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(iii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility determination is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not -supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">During his hearing, Marcelus testified that in 2005, while working as a bus driver in Saint-Marc, a group of men boarded his bus with a small boy that they appeared to have kidnapped. The kidnappers held a gun to Marcelus\u2019s head and ordered him to drive the bus away. When' Marcelus was unable to start the bus, the kidnappers beat him up and used tear gas on him. During the attack, Marcelus\u2019s sister, who was also on the bus, was shot and killed by the kidnappers. The police intervened, and Marcelus was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for 33 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">After being released from the hospital, Marcelus gave a statement before a judge, which resulted in a police investigation that identified three of the kidnappers. Police arrested the three men, but they were immediately released. Afterward, the kidnappers began knocking on Marce-lus\u2019s door and asking for him because they wanted to kill him. Marcelus and his family fled Saint-Marc, with Marcelus going to Port-de-Paix and Port-au-Prince and his .wife and children going to Latiti, on the outskirts of Saint-Marc. The kidnappers continued to look for Marcelus and told his neighbors they needed to kill Marcelus because he had identified them. The kidnappers said that if they could not find Marcelus, they would take his children. Marcelus lived in hiding for six or seven years, before leaving Haiti entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The IJ and the BIA gaye specific, cogent reasons for-discrediting Marcelus\u2019s testimony, and those reasons are supported by substantial evidence. In particular, the IJ and the BIA noted that: (1) Marcelus\u2019s asylum application stated that he had lived at the same address in Saint-Marc from 1993 to 2011, but Marcelus testified that he lived in hiding in Port-auPrince and Port-de-Paix from 2005 to 2011; (2) although Marcelus claimed he was in hiding from 2005 until 2011, his application stated that he continued to work in Saint-Marc as a bus driver during that period; (3) the court clerk\u2019s report that Marcelus submitted to corroborate his account did not mention his sister\u2019s murder, an omission Marcelus could not explain; and (4) while Marcelus\u2019s application emphasized his membership in an- antiLavalas -political group, he never mentioned the political group during his testimony, and the court clerk\u2019s, report indicated Marcelus was merely a victim of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>crime and did not suggest any other reason for the attack. All of these reasons find support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Moreover, the record does not compel a finding that Marcelus is credible.. Marcelus argues that he offered an explanation for one of the identified inconsistencies (about his residences between 2005 and 2011). A tenable explanation, however, does not compel us to overturn the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Lyashchynska, </em>676 F.3d at 967 (\u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The reasons for discrediting Marcelus are supported- by substantial evidence, and Marcelus does not contend that the other evidence\u2019 in the record, absent his discredited testimony, compels a conclusion that he was, or likely will be, persecuted in Haiti.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">. Marcelus\u2019s petition for review challenges only the denial of his asylum claim, makes only a few passjng references to his claim for withholding of removal, and does not mention at all his request for relief under the United \u2022 Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Accordingly, Marcelus has abandoned his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief, and we do not address them. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1352 (11th Cir.2009) (deeming abandoned a CAT claim to which the petitioner\u2019s brief made only passing reference).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-17\">. Because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. Mohammed v. <em>U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>547 F,3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.2008). The IJ\u2019s credibility finding is a factual finding that we review for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Under the substantial evidence test, we will reverse an IJ\u2019s credibility finding only if the record compels it. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\">. We, like the BIA before us, note that even if Marcelus\u2019s testimony had been credited, it would not have shown statutory eligibility for asylum. Marcelus's testimony showed only that he was a victim of criminal activity and feared\" the perpetrators would retaliate against him because he had reported the crime to authorities, which is insufficient to demonstrate either past or future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See, e.g., Cendejas Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1302, 1310 (11th Cir.2013); <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1198 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
