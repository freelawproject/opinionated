(LWW), and Swiftsure Group, LLC (Swiftsure). Appellants argue the district court erred in granting summary judgment as to their counts based on (1) violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c) and 1964, as well as Florida\u2019s Civil Remedies for Criminal Practices Act (the Florida RICO Act), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 772.103(3)-(4); (2) fraud; (3) civil conspiracy; (4) breach of fiduciary duty; and (5) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons below, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Vinecombe created LTC in 1994. LTC originally performed two services: (1) selling and developing asset tracking software and (2) providing asset tracking services, such as physical inventory services. In' 2003, Vinecombe created LWW. Vine-combe\u2019s intention in creating LWW was to give the business to his sons Adam, Eric, and Craig.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His plan was for LWW to take over the physical inventory services, while LTC would continue developing and selling asset tracking software. LTC and LWW shared office space and often worked together on projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">On May 8,2009, Vinecombe entered into a stock purchase agreement with Daedalus. Under the stock purchase agreement, Vinecombe sold 100% of LTC\u2019s preferred stock, convertible into a 70% ownership interest in LTC, to Daedalus for a purchase price of $1,250,000. Of the purchase price, $250,000 was paid to Vinecombe and the remaining $1,000,000 was invested in LTC. After the transaction, Vinecombe retained a 30% ownership interest in LTC and remained President and CEO of the company. In conjunction with the stock purchase agreement, Vinecombe and Riegl also entered into two-year employment agreements with LTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">On May 29, 2009, Vinecombe, as President of LTC, and his son Adam, as president of LWW, executed \u2022 a Teaming Agreement. By its terms, the Teaming Agreement was an \u201cindependent contractor teaming agreement.\u201d The agreement provided: \u201cThe rights, responsibilities and obligations of the parties shall be deemed to be independent contractors; one party cannot bind the other, and the employees of one party shall not be deemed to be employees of another party.\u201d The Teaming Agreement allowed one party to resell the services of the other party under their own individual contracts, or- for the parties to jointly bid on project proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">In 2009, 2010, and 2011, LTC contracted with the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (ConnSCU). LTC also Contracted with a company called EMC in 2008 and 2010. LWW performed physical inventory work on these projects under the LTC contracts. EMC and ConnSCU sent checks to LTC for payment. The checks were made payable to LTC. Each check was endorsed \u201cLockwood\u201d and deposited directly into LWW\u2019s bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">Near the end of 2010, LTC began running low on funds. Ken Baritz (Baritz), a managing member of Daedalus, and Vine-combe discussed several options for the company. These options included (i) immediately shutting down LTC, (ii) terminating a software engineer, or (iii) having Daedalus invest more money in LTC to give the company a chance to get by while Baritz searched for another investor. Bar-itz agreed Daedalus would invest another $100,000 in LTC if Vinecombe and Riegle would agree to defer half of their salaries during that time period, to which they agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">, In early 2011, an inquiry was received from Qatar, University (QU) regarding LTC\u2019s asset tracking software. This agreement culminated in a three-phase asset management project that included use and integration of LTC\u2019s asset tracking software. LWW paid LTC $100,000 for the use of LTC\u2019s asset tracking software on December 30, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">Riegl resigned from LTC on April 30, 2011. Around that time, Riegl and Vine-combe traveled to Qatar to begin the QU <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>Project and were paid for their work by LWW.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">In April 2011, Daedalus entered into a stock purchase agreement with Infrax Systems (Infrax). Under this agreement, Daedalus received $1,650,000 worth . of stock in Infrax and warrants to buy 660,-000 additional shares of Infrax stock. In exchange, Infrax took control of LTC. Vi-necombe resigned as president of LTC op June 3, 2011, but agreed to continue helping LTC as an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">On March 1, 2013, Appellants Daedalus and LTC sued Appellees Vineeombe, Riegl, Adam, Eric, LWW, and Swiftsure alleging, in short, they were unlawfully targeted and defrauded of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW*</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Leigh v. Warner Bros., </em>212 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate only when there are no genuine issues of material fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ao2\">\n<em>1.' Federal arid State RICO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 federal and state RICO counts. To prove a RICO violation under both federal and Florida law, a plaintiff must establish, among other things, \u201ccontinuity.\u201d <em>See Jackson v. Bell-South Telecomm., </em>372 F.3d 1250, 1264 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that, in addition to showing two or more related predicate acts, federal RICO plaintiffs must show \u201cthe predicate acts demonstrate[ ] criminal conduct of a <em>continuing </em>nature\u201d); <em>Lugo v. State, </em>845. So.2d 74, 99 (Fla.2003) (explaining Florida RICO plaintiffs must establish \u201cthat a continuity of particular criminal activity exists\u201d). There are two types of continuity that may establish a RICO claim: closed-ended continuity and open-ended continuity. <em>H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106, L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). Closed-ended continuity refers to \u201ca closed period of repeated conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Open-ended continuity refers to \u201cpast conduct that by its-nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">Appellants cannot establish either form of continuity. They cannot show closed-ended continuity because there is only one victim, LTC, and \u201conly a single scheme with a discrete goal\u201d connecting the predicate <em>acts </em>\u2014 i.e., Appellees\u2019 alleged scheme to divert business proceeds from LTC to LWW and themselves. <em>See Jackson, </em>372 F.3d at 1267 (\u201c[Wjhere the RICO allegations concern only a single scheme with a discrete goal, the courts have refused to find a closed-ended pattern of racketeering even when the scheme took place over longer periods of time.\u201d); <em>Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., </em>917 F.2d 1507, 1516 (10th Cir.1990) (affirming dismissal of RICO claim when a \u201cclosed-ended series of predicate acts ... constituted a single scheme to accomplish one discrete goal, directed at one individual with no potential to extend to other persons or entities\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">Nor can they show open-ended continuity because there is no threat of continuing criminal activity. <em>See Jackson, </em>372 F.3d-at 1265 (\u201cIn \u2018open-ended\u2019\u2022 cases that rely on alleging the <em>threat </em>of continuity, plaintiffs can meet their burden by establishing \u2022 either that .the racketeering acts themselves include a specific Threat of.repetition -extending indefinitely into the future, or that the predicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity\u2019s regular way of doing business.\u201d (quotations omitted)). We agree with the district court \u201c[tjhere is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>no threat that [Appellees\u2019] alleged pattern of racketeering activity will continue into the future because their goal has been realized in the acquiring of the QU Project, ' and there is no longer a working relationship between the two companies giving rise to the opportunity for Defendants\u2019 pattern of predicate acts to persist into the future.\u201d <em>See. also Vicom, Inc. v. Harbridge Merck. Servs., Inc., </em>20. F.3d 771, 782 (7th Cir.1994), (\u201cIn assessing whether a threat of continued racketeering activity exists, we have made clear that schemes which have a clear and terminable goal have a natural ending point. Such schemes therefore cannot support a finding of any specific threat of continuity that would constitute open-ended continuity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Ap-pellees on the federal and Florida RIQO counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">\n<em>2. Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Appellees on Appellants\u2019 two fraud-based counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">\n<em>a. Fraud in the Inducement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Appellants assert the evidence in this case supports \u00e1 claim of fraud in the inducement. As the district court found, however, Appellants failed to argue a claim for fraud in the inducement in responding to Appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion, instead arguing the elements of a conspirar cy to defraud. Because Appellants failed to carry their burden, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on their claim of fraud in the inducement. <em>A &amp; M Stores, Inc. v. Hiram Walker, Inc., </em>427 F.2d 167, 168 (5th Cir.1970)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (affirming summary judgment because \u201cplaintiff failed to meet its burden of responding to defendants\u2019 motions \u25a0\u25a0 for summary judgment by setting forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-14\">\n<em>b. Common Law Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">With regard to Appellants\u2019 claim for common law fraud, we agree with the district court that \u201c[Appellants] advance no specific facts ... that would establish a claim of common law fraud.\u201d Appellants\u2019 broad assertion that \u201c[t]he record in this case details the criminal or fraudulent acts committed by each of the Defendants\u201d is insufficient 'to create a genuine issue of fqet. <em>See Martin v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>935 F.2d 235, 238 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cThe party opposing the motion [for summary judgment] must. present specific facts in support of its position and cannot rest upon allegations or denials in the pleadings.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did. not err in granting summary judgment on the common law fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-16\">\n<em>3.- Civil Conspiracy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b995-17\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Appellees on the civil conspiracy claim. Appellants\u2019 brief broadly asserts Appellees agreed to divert LTC\u2019s business opportunities to LWW arid to have LTC\u2019s incoming revenue from the QU contracts deposited into LWWs f\u00edn\u00e1\u00f1cial account. However, as with the claim for common law fraud, Appellants have not identified specific facts or evidence substantiating their allegations. Furthermore, Appellants have not explained how this conduct, even if true and supported by evidence, satisfies the elements of a civil conspiracy. In particular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>Appellants have not explained how LWW\u2019s cashing of checks constituted an independent wrong or tort. <em>See Blatt v. Green, Rose, Kahn &amp; Piotrkowski, </em>456 So.2d 949, 951 (Fla. 3d DCA 1984). (\u201c[A] cause of action for civil conspiracy exists ... only if the basis for the conspiracy is an .independent wrong or tort which would constitute a cause of action if the wrong were done by one person.\u201d (quotations omitted)). Accordingly, the district- court did not err in granting summary judgment on the civil conspiracy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\">A <em>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"APo\">The district court did not err in granting partial summary judgment to Appellees on the breach of fiduciary duty cl\u00e1im. Specifically, the district court did not err in concluding \u201c[Appellees] are entitled to summary judgment to\" the limited extent that they did not owe any fiduciary' duties to LTC beyond their respective dates of resignation from the company.\u201d <em>See Gregg v. U.S. Indus., Inc., </em>715 F.2d 1522, 1541 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201c[0]nce Gregg was removed as president and chief operating officer of his former companies and made only a consultant he no longer had fiduciary duties.... \u201d); <em>Renpak, Inc. v. Oppenheimer, </em>104 So.2d 642, 644 (Fla. 2d DCA 1958) (\u201cAfter there has been a severance of official relationship, either .because of resignation or removal, generally a director or officer occupies no relation to the corporation of trust or confidence and deals with it thereafter like any other stranger; and he is not precluded from engaging in a competing business.\u201d). Additionally, the district court' did not err in concluding Riegle was entitled to partial summary judgment \u201cto the limited extent that any breach of fiduciary duty is asserted against him in relation to the ConnSCU contracts and checks.\u201d As the district court explained, there is no evidence Riegle was involved in those transactions. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting partial summaiy judgment to Appellees on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">\n<em>5. Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Finally, the district court did not err in granting partial summary judgment to Appellees to the limited extent summary judgment was granted to Appellees on the claim of fiduciary 'duty discussed above. <em>See Wiand v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>938 F.Supp.2d 1238, 1244 (M.D.Fla.2013) (\u201cA cause' of action for aiding: and abetting requires [among other things] ah underlying violation\u2018on the part of the primary wrongdoer____\u201d (quotations omitted)). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">IV. CONCLUSION \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment on the federal claims and dismissing the remaining state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-7\">. More specifically, the district court granted \u25a0 partial summary judgment against Appellants on their claims of (1) federal RICO, (2) federal RICO conspiracy, (3) Florida RICO, (4) Florida RICO conspiracy, (5) fraud in the inducement, (6) common law fraud, (7) civil conspiracy, (8) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and (9) breach of fiduciary duty. The analysis is the same with respect to each of the four RICO-based claims and with respect to both fraud-based .claims. For clarity purposes, we discuss the four RICO-based claims collectively, as well as the two fraud-based claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-15\">. After the district court granted partial summary judgment against all of Appellants\u2019 federal claims, all that remained were some state law claims. On November 14, 2014, the district court entered a final order dismissing the remaining state law claims without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and closing the case. Appellants timely appealed both orders. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting partial summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>ment, we also affirm its order dismissing the remaining state law claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b993-15\">.
