On appeal, Bostic argues his sentence \u2014 120 months, 74 months above the Guidelines range maximum \u2014 was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. In particular, he argues that the district court gave improper weight to testimony regarding a pending state criminal charge and created a sentencing disparity with similarly situated defendants.' After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence must be both proeedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2010). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing it is unreasonable im light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 750 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Bostic\u2019s s\u00e9nt\u00e9nce was not procedurally unreasonable. A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court erred in calculating the Guidelines range; treated the Guidelines as mandatory; failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts; or failed to adequately explain the sentence, including any deviation from the Guidelines range. <em>Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d at 1264. Bostic argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing to explicitly address potential sentencing disparities between Bostic and similarly situated defendants. However, \u201cthe district court do\u00e9s not need to discuss or state each factor explicitly.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Beyond that, in <em>Gall, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">avoidance of unwarranted disparities was clearly considered by the Sentencing Commission when setting the Guidelines ranges. Since the District Judge correctly calculated and carefully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>reviewed the Guidelines range, he necessarily gave significant weight and consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted disparities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">552 U.S. at 54, 128 S.Ct. at 599. Likewise here, because the district court correctly calculated and considered the Guidelines range, it necessarily considered the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. There was no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Neither was Bostic\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable. The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is determined in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We will not vacate a sentence as substantively unreasonable unless we are left with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court clearly erred in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and issued a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d at 1264-65 (quotation omitted). The district court is required to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. In imposing a particular sentence, the district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Where, as here, the district court imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines range, it must explain why the variance is appropriate; The \u201cjustification for the variance must be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted). A major deviation from the Guidelines should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor deviation. <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Here, the district court sentenced Bostic to the' statutory maximum \u2014 120 months in prison \u2014 despite a Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months, and the government\u2019s recommendation of a'within-Guidelines sentence. However, at' sentencing, the court heard substantial testimony about Bostic\u2019s involvement in a violent crime that had been committed within 24 hours of his arrest on the felon-in-possession charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court then discussed at length why a 120-month sentence was appropriate under the circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">This court does not believe that a Guideline sentence is appropriate in this particular instance. Specifically, the court finds that the defendant\u2019s conduct, particularly with regard to his use of the firearm and maybe even the firearm that he was caught with in this case but certainly a firearm in beating, pistol whipping one of the victims in the home in Northport within 24 hours of the occasion when his firearm was taken from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>him,, at the motel- and then he ran from the police \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">I order you ... to be imprisoned for 120 months, which is my understanding [of] the maximum sentence that I can give on this particular charge. I believe that is appropriate when I consider the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense and promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for the offense as well as the nature and circumstances and history and characteristics of this defendant, particularly the characteristic of his violent propensity and. nature in his committing- a violent offense with a firearm within 24 hours ... of this particular offense. And also there is a need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The district court, did not abuse its. discretion when it sentenced the defendant above the Guidelines range based op its assessment of the need to protect the public, deter criminal conduct, and promote respect for the law. .</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">. Although Bostic had not been convicted of that crime at the time of his sentencing \u2014 the charges were only pending \u2014 the district court could still consider evidence of it. In fact, courts can even consider \u201crelevant acquitted conduct,\u201d proved by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing, so long as the sentence does not exceed what is authorized by the jury verdict. <em>United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1348 (11th Cir.2006). Beyond that, Bostic argues that the court incorrectly referred to his crime as a \"robbery,\" not a \"burglary.\u201d But since the court made its determination based on the facts of the crime, not its legal classification, this argument does nof affect the outcome.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
