Fields raises nine issues on appeal, which we address in turn. As the parties are familiar with the facts of this c^se, we will not recount them in detail. We . include only those facts necessary to the discussion of each issue. Upon review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">\n<em>A. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The district court did not err in denying Fields\u2019s Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal on the \u00a7 1591 charges because a reasonable jury could have found he recruited the victims to engage in commercial sex acts by. means of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. Based :on the victims\u2019 testimony, Fields recruited and enticed women to engage in prostitution by (1) proposing to advertise their prostitution services online, (2) driving them to their prostitution locations, and (3) offering them drugs, money, and a place to live if they prostituted for him. After recruiting them to engage in commercial sex acts, Fields substantially increased their drug addictions. Fields then coerced the victims to engage in 'commercial sex acts by withholding pills from them and thereby causing them to experience withdrawal sickness if they did not engage in prostitution. The withdrawal sickness was so severe that it caused the victims to want to die. Fields isolated the victims to preclude them from obtaining \u25a0 drugs \u25a0 elsewhere and to render them dependent on him and subservient to his demands.'</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">\n<em>B. Motion for Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Fields\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on a witness\u2019s testimony regarding Fields\u2019s' prior jail time. The witness\u2019s comment about Fields\u2019s prior imprisonment was brief and unelicited, and added nothing t\u00f3 the Government\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d 1324, 1334 (11th Cir.2009) (holding \u201cwhere the comment is brief, unelicited, and unresponsive, adding nothing to the government\u2019s case, the denial of a.mistrial is proper\u201d). The witness made only a passing reference to Fields\u2019s prior jail time, and the district court gave a curative instruction to the jury. <em>See United States v. Beasley, </em>2 F.3d 1551, 1559 (11th Cir.1993) (holding witness mentioning prison did not constitute reversible error because comments were \u201cmade in passing\u201d and \u201cfollowed quickly by the district court\u2019s curative instruction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">\n<em>C.Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Adx\">The district court did not err in denying Fields\u2019s request for the \u00a7 1591 pattern jury instruction and instead adding: (1) that the jury may consider the victims\u2019 potential special vulnerabilities, (2) a definition of force, and (3) a definition of fraud. The district court did not misstate the law or mislead the jury to Fields\u2019s prejudice. <em>See United States v. House, </em>684 F.3d 1173, 1196 (11th Cir.2012) (reviewing jury instructions to determine \u201cwhether the instructions misstated the law or misled the jury\u201d (quotation omitted)). The district court\u2019s definitions of \u201ccoercion\u201d and'\u201cserious harm\u201d were direct quotations from the relevant statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(e)(2), (4). The district court\u2019s explanation regarding victims with special vulnerabilities was a direct application of the statutory definition of \u201cserious harm\u201d to the facts of this case. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1591(e)(4). Additionally, the district court\u2019s definitions of \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cfraud\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>followed logically from the plain language of the statute. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1591(a); <em>United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2009) (stating courts interpret \u201ca statute in a manner consistent with the plain language of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">\n<em>D. Motion for Substitution of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Field\u2019s motion for substitution of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although an, indigent criminal defendant has a right to be represented by counsel, he does not have a right to be represented by. a particular lawyer, or to demand a different appointed lawyer except for good cause. <em>Thomas v. Wainwright, </em>767 F.2d 738, 742 (11th Cir.1985). \u201cGood cause in this context means a fundamental problem, such as a conflict of interest, a complete breakdown in communication or an irreconcilable conflict which leads to an apparently unjust verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Garey, </em>540 F.3d 1253, 1263 (11th Cir.2008) (en banc) (quotation omitted). Fields did not show there was a fundamental problem that warranted replacement of counsel. <em>See id. </em>The only problems Fields identified. at trial were general assertions about his counsel\u2019s unwillingness to ask certain questions of witnesses and his counsel\u2019s attitude towards him. These do not rise to the level of \u201ca conflict of interest, a complete breakdown in communication or an irreconcilable conflict which leads to an apparently unjust verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">\n<em>E. Base Offense Level</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">The district court did not err in setting Fields\u2019s base offense level for his sex trafficking convictions at 34 based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7. 2Gl.l(a) because it was not clearly erroneous . to conclude Fields was convicted under., 18 .U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(b)(1). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2G1.1(a) (providing for a base offense level of 34. if the offense of conviction is \u00a7 1591(b)(1)). Fields\u2019s base offense level was 34 because, as discussed above, the trial evidence showed he violated \u00a7 1591(a) by means of coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">\n<em>F.' Vulnerable Victim Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">The district court did, not err in applying a vulnerable victim enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(14)(B). The victims\u2019 drug addictions rendered them particularly \u25a0susceptible to Field\u2019s selling and dispensing of controlled, substances. As such, the district court did not clearly err in finding they were vulnerable victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">\n<em>G. Rol\u00e9 Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">The district court .did not clearly err in finding the Government presented sufficient reliable evidence to support a role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c) for Fields\u2019s, drug offenses. Paul Fry testified that Fields, paid for Fry\u2019s prescriptions, took him to doctors to obtain the prescriptions, and took for himself a substantial portion of the prescribed pills,- When Fry could not find a pharmacy that had the prescribed medications, Fry would leave the prescriptions at Fields\u2019s hous\u00e9 as a form1 of'collateral until Fields'would drive him to a pharmacy to fill them. It was not clearly erroneous to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>conclude Fields had sufficient authority and control to qualify for the aggravated role enhancement. <em>See United States v. Suarez, </em>313 F.3d 1287, 1294 (11th Cir.2002) (applying role enhancement where defendant \u201chad decision-making-authority and exercised control\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">\n<em>H. Dangerous Weapon Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The district court did not clearly err in applying a dangerous weapon enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). It was not clearly erroneous to conclude that the gun discovered in Fields\u2019s bedroom was a dangerous weapon. The gun was a six-shot revolver made by Colt, and was next to bags of lead projectiles and percussion caps. Even assuming the gun was not capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury, the district court did not clearly err in concluding the gun resembled an instrument with such capability. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(D)(i)(ii)) (2013) (including, as a dangerous weapon, \u201can object that is not an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury but [ ] closely resembles such an instrument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Fields concedes the weapon was discovered in his bedroom, where he stored many of the drugs for which he was convicted. The burden thus shifted- to Fields to show that a connection between the weapon and the offense was clearly improbable. <em>See United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2006). Fields failed to demonstrate a connection was clearly improbable, especially in light of the fact that the gun was discovered in his bedroom next to bags of lead projectiles and percussion caps, and a victim had previously broken into his-bedroom to obtain pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">\n<em>I. Reasonableness of Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by allegedly failing to consider ah the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court expressly stated it considered: (1) the evidence in the case; (2) everything said at the sentencing hearing; (3) the \u00a7 3553 factors; (4) the advisory \u25a0guidelines; (5) what sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary; (6) what sentence was necessary to provide proper punishment; and (7) what sentence was necessary to protect the public. In focusing on the nature and circumstances of the offense, the district court noted that Fields preyed on the victims\u2019 vulnerabilities and committed an outrageous crime. The district court also noted Fields\u2019s lack of remorse. This was procedurally sufficient. <em>See United States v. Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d 1353, 1359 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1186, 191 L.Ed.2d 142 (2015) (\u201cNothing requires the district court to discuss each of the \u00a7 -3553(a) factors, and an acknowledgment that it has considered each will suffice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 405-month sentence of imprisonment. Fields\u2019s sentence was within the advisory guideline range, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Fields\u2019s sentence does not represent a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010), in light of Fields\u2019s multiple'and repeated exploitations of the victims\u2019 vulnerabilities in furthering his prostitution business. We accordingly affirm Fields\u2019s 405-month sentence as procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AF1\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AWK\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b971-10\">. In his initial brief, without citation to legal authority or evidence in the record, Fields passingly suggests the district court denied his right to effective assistance of counsel. Fields has abandoned this argument because \"a party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate.\u201d <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003). Even had Fields not abandoned this issue, the record is not sufficiently developed for us to review whether Fields\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
