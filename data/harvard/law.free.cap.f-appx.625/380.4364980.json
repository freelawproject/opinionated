In support of his petition, Lawal argues that the BIA erred in applying its decision in <em>Matter of Rivas, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 130 (BIA 2013), which was decided after Lawal\u2019s case had already commenced. As Lawal acknowledges, our prior panel precedent in <em>Rivas v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>765 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2014), forecloses his argument that <em>Matter of Rivas </em>was wrongly decided. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 34 n. 12. And if <em>Matter of Rivas </em>does in fact apply, Lawal does not contest that his petition must be denied. The only question Lawal asks us to address, then, is whether the BIA erred in applying <em>Matter of Rivas </em>retroactively. <em>See id. </em>at 22-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">We review legal conclusions <em>de novo. Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th Cir.2009). We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopted the opinion of the IJ. <em>Indrawati v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>779 F.3d 1284, 1297 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">The governm\u00e9nt draws our attention to <em>Yu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), as supporting the BIA\u2019s retroactive application of <em>Matter 'of Rivas. </em>Yu had applied for automatic ref\u00fagee status pursuant to INA \u00a7 101(a)(42), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), during removal proceedings that began in October 2003, claiming that the Chinese government would persecute him by forcing his wife to undergo sterilization, abortion, or invasive insertion \u00f3f a contraceptive device. <em>Yu, </em>568 F.3d at 1329. The IJ found that Yu' was not credible and denied his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. <em>Id. </em>The BIA dismissed Yu\u2019s appeal, reasoning that, regardless of the credibility finding, the case was governed by the intervening precedential decision of <em>Matter of J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520 (A.G.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"A8a\">In <em>Matter of J-S-, </em>the Attorney General directed the BIA \u201cto refer to him,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(h)(1)(i),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the BIA\u2019s decision in a case concerning whether INA \u00a7 101(a)(42), enacted in 1996, conferred automatic refugee status on the spouses of persons who had been subjected to forced abortion or sterilization pursuant to a foreign government\u2019s population control.' 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 521. In 1997 and 2006, the BIA had held that \u00a7 101(a)(42) conferred such status on a spouse, but the Attorney General had not yet addressed those decisions in an opinion. <em>Id. </em>Based on the text, structure, history, and purpose of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ute, the Attorney General overruled these prior cases to the extent they held that spouses were entitled to automatic refugee status under \u00a7 101(a)(42). <em>Id. </em>at 523-36; <em>id. </em>at 537 (\u201c[F]rom now on, the Board and Immigration Judges shall cease to apply the per se rule of spousal eligibility....\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Yu argued that the.BIA\u2019s retroactive application of <em>.Matter of J-S- </em>violated -his due-process rights and that previous BIA decisions entitled him to automatic refugee status. <em>Yu, </em>568 F.3d at 1330. We noted that the BIA had previously interpreted \u00a7 101(a)(42) as applying to legally married spouses. <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31. Applying <em>Chevron </em>analysis, we held that the language of the. statute clearly and unambiguously supported the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation, and that even if the meaning of the statute was somehow ambiguous, the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation was reasonable and therefore entitled to deference. <em>Id. </em>at 1331-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In so doing, we specifically rejected Yu\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s decision involved an improper retroactive application of <em>Matter of J-S-. Id. </em>at 1333. We stated that \u201c[t]he BIA did not retroactively apply a new law but instead applied the Attorney General\u2019s determination of what the law. had <em>always </em>meant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The Attorney General\u2019s ruling in <em>Matter of J-S- </em>did not change/ the law, and the fact that the BIA had previously construed the statute differently did not prevent the Attorney General from determining otherwise. The BIA properly ap-' plied <em>Matter of J-S- </em>to Yu\u2019s case because, once the decision was issued, it \u201cbecame the controlling .interpretation -of the law and was entitled to full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review, regardless of whether the events predated the Attorney General\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1334, Although the decision may have prevented Yu from succeeding in his application, it did not impair any vested right, but merely upset his expectations based on prior law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">We conclude that the BIA did not retroactively apply a new rule of law to Lawal\u2019s case. The BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Rivas </em>was based on amendments to INA \u00a7 212(h) that took effect in the 1990s, <em>see Matter of Rivas, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 131, before Lawal was convicted of the relevant crimes, left and returned to the United States, or filed his application for waiver of grounds of admissibility. The BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Rivas </em>did not change the law; rather, it clarified what the law under \u00a7. 212(h) had been during the entire time-frame relevant to Lawal\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 134-35. Once the BIA issued <em>Matter of Rivas, </em>that interpretation became the controlling interpretation of the law and was entitled to full effect in all cases still open on direct review, such as Lawal\u2019s. <em>See Yu, </em>568 F.3d at 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Lawal suggests that when we found that the language of the statute in <em>Yu </em>was unambiguous, this finding rendered all subsequent discussion dicta because automatic refugee status was unavailable even without <em>Matter of J-S-\u2019s </em>retroactive application. But we alternatively held that <em>Matter of J-S- </em>was a reasonable interpretation of the statute even if it was ambiguous and that its retroactive application did not violate due process. <em>See id. </em>at 1333\u2014 34, An alternative holding is binding precedent. <em>See Hitchcock v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of </em>Corr., 745 F.3d 476, 484 n. 3 (11th Cir.2014) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-11\">. \u201c[T]he Attorney General retains the authority to review final decisions of the BIA, either upon the Attorney General's initiative or by request.\" <em>Farquharson v.
