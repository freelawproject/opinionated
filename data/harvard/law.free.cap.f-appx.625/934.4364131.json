Howard argues the .district court erred By denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal for two reasons. First, Howard contends there was; insufficient, evidence to show he intended to induce the 14-year-old minor into sexual activity because, according to Howard, the minor had already assented to sexual activity. by reaching out to him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2022 Second, Howard argues the Government failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>prove he was predisposed to commit the charged offense, and thus his entrapment defense should have prevailed. We reject both arguments and affirm,</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">\n<em>1. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AZ5\">The district court did not err in denying Howard\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal based on sufficiency of the evidence because sufficient evidence demonstrated Howard attempted to induce or elicit a minor\u2019s assent to engage in sexual activity.' Howard argues that \u201cAshley,\u201d the minor female online persona adopted by law enforcement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> assented to sex merely by responding to his Craigslist advertisement. Thus, he asserts their com versations were discussions only of. where and how to. have sex, not whether they should in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The evidence, viewed in a light favorable to the Government, does not support Howard\u2019s theory. <em>See United States v. Gamo-ry, </em>635 F.3d 480, 497 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining, ,inr evaluating sufficiency, \u201c[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, making all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the government\u2019s favor, and then determine whether a reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (citation and quotation omitted)). While it is true Howard\u2019s Craigslist advertisement solicited oral sex in the title, the text of the advertisement sought information regarding a potential respondent\u2019s age and where she lived! From this, a reasonable juror could find responding to the advertisement alone was not sufficient to assent to\u2018srixual contact but would simply initiate a conversation about whether Howard arid the respondent would both agree to engage in sexual activity after they shared more information with each other. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Furthermore, \u201cAshley\u201d did not come right out and state she agreed to the solicitation. Rather, she initiated \"communication with Howard by telling him that she was young and wanted to say \u201chi\u201d after seeing the ad. Then, upon learning she was 14, Howard-engaged \u201cAshley\u201d in sexually explicit conversation, asked her if she wanted to meet (proposing both oral and vaginal sex), and attempted to assuage her doubts by trilling her he did' not want to hurt her. Howard also stated, during his post-arrest interview, that he planned to try and talk \u201cAshley\u201d into going to a mall dressing room to have sex with him, further indicating that, in Howard\u2019s mind, \u201cAshley\u201d had not yet assented to engage in sexual contact with him and that the chats from the previous several days were intended to persuade \u201cAshley\u201d to agree to engage in sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">In short, the district court did not err by denying Howard\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal because ample evidence supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that Howard intended to persuade or induce a minor to engage in sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">&amp;\u25a0 <em>Entrapment Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">The district corirt also did not err in deriying Howard\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal based on his entrapment defense. Howard asserts he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the evidence showed he was not predisposed to enticing a minor into engaging in sexual activity. We disagree and conclude the evidence was sufficirint for a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>juror to find Howard was predisposed to commit the charged crime. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>43 F.3d 618, 622 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201cWhen an entrapment defense is rejected by the jury, our review is limited to deciding whether the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that the defendant was predisposed to take part in the illicit transaction\u201d). Although a Government agent provided an opportunity for Howard to commit a crime, Howard readily took advantage of that opportunity. <em>See Jacobson v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 540, 550, 112 S.Ct. 1535, 118 L.Ed.2d 174 (1992) (\u201c[Wjhere the defendant is simply provided with the opportunity to commit a crime, the entrapment defense is of little use because the ready commission of the criminal act amply demonstrates the defendant\u2019s predisposition.\u201d). \u2019 The agent, as \u201cAshley,\u201d stated early on in the exchanges with Howard that she was only 14 years old, asking him a number of times if that was a problem. Despite these opportunities to back away, Howard proceeded to engage her in sexually explicit conversation and attempted to persuade her to assent to engage in sexual activity. A reasonable juror could find Howard\u2019s ready commission.of the offense and his failure to take advantage of repe\u00e1ted opportunities to back away from the criminal conduct established his predisposition. <em>See id.; United States v. Ventura, </em>936 F.2d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cEvidence that a defendant was afforded an opportunity to back out of a transaction and did not avail himself of that opportunity also constitutes evidence of predisposition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not err in denying Howard\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">AFFIRMED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-12\">. Howard also contends the jury confused the charged offense \u2014 attempted enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity \u2014 with the separate offense of attempting to have sex with a minor. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>603 F.3d 904, 914 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining the . \"intent\u201d requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) is \"inten[t] to cause assent on the part of the minor,\u201d not \"intent to engage in.sexual activity\u201d (quotation mark omitted)). There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>evidence the jury was confused. The jury was instructed properly on the elements 'Of \"18 U.S.C..\u00a7 2422(b), and we presume jurors follow the instructions given to them.' <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>9 F.3d 934, 938 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b954-12\">. To be sure, \u2018\u2018section 2422(b) does not require an actual minor victim.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>603 F.3d 904, 913 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
