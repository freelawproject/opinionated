Flint was discharged from prison in January 2013, and placed on supervised release. In October 2013, Flint was arrested in Palm- Beach County, Florida, charged with \u25a0 sexual battery, and detained. On November 3, 2014, he pled guilty to that charge and received one year\u2019s imprisonment. Shortly thereafter, a warrant for his arrest issued for violating the conditions of supervised release. On February 17, 2015, following a revocation hearing, the District Court revoked Flint\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>nine months\u2019 imprisonment, to-be followed by 48 months\u2019 supervised release. To meet the conditions of his supervised release, Flint had to comply with the requirements of-the Sexual Offender Registration and Notification Act (\u201cSORNA\u201d) and participate in a sex-offender program. Flint appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment, arguing that the court abused its discretion in imposing those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We review the decision to revoke supervised release, for abuse of discretion. <em>United </em>States, <em>v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2014). We review any sentence imposed after a revocation of supervised release for reasonableness, <em>id., </em>and the imposition of '\u00e1 special condition for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dodge, </em>597 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Upon finding that the defendant violated a condition of his supervised release,1 a district court may revoke that supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The court may also \u201cmodify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(2). In determining an appropriate sentence upon revocation of supervised release, the court must consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 3553(a), including the nature and characteristics of the offense and the defendant, the need to deter future criminal acts, the need to protect the public, :the need to provide the defendant with medical care or other correctional treatment,- the applicable Guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to - avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide, restitution to victims. . <em>Id. </em>.\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7), and 3583(e)(3). The court has- broad discretion to determine the weight due any particular sentencing factor. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). A district court can abuse its discretion, however, if it \u201c(1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the'proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1174 (11th Cir.2006) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In July 2006, Congress enacted SORNA \u201c \u2018to protect the public from sex offenders and offenders against children\u2019 by establishing \u2018a comprehensive national system for the registration of those offenders.\u2019\u201d <em>See-. United States, v. Ambert, </em>561 F.3d 1202, 1205 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901), . Given the seriousness of the problem it was designed to address, SORNA extends to \u201call sex offenders\u201d and applies retroactively to qualifying offenses committed before 2006. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R, \u00a7 72.3 (\u201cThe requirements of SORNA apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of [SORNA].\u201d). For purposes of SORNA, .a \u201csex offender\u201d is defined as an \u201cindividual who was convicted of a sex offense.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16911(1). A \u201csex offense\u201d includes any criminal offense\u2014 defined as a state, local, \u25a0 tribal, foreign, or military offense \u2014 that has an element involving a sexual act or sexual contact with another. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16911(5)(A)(i), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">When tailoring sentences, district courts are required to \u201corder,, as an explicit condition of supervised release for a person required to register under [SORNA], that the person comply with the -requirements of that Act.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). \u2022 A court may also impose additional conditions so long as those conditions are reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>related to the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is necessary, and are consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the S\u00e9\u00f1tencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3583(d)(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We find no abuse of discretion here. Flint\u2019s compliance with SORNA as a condition of supervised release was statutorily mandated because of a prior rape conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16911(5)(A)(i), (6); <em>see also </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 72.3. That conviction combined with the recent sexual-battery charges against Flint supported the court\u2019s determination that he should participate in a sex-offender program. Moreover, the conditions imposed by the court were not unreasonable, as the court complied with statutory requirements, considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and articulated its reasons for the imposing the conditions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">AFFIRMED..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
