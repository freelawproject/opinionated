In his complaint, Harvey alleged that Daniels wrongfully arrested him for assaulting someone with a knife, and that the illegality of his arrest,and other evidence invalidated his conviction. He had already completed serving his prison sentence before filing his complaint. The district court dismissed the complaint without providing Harvey an opportunity to amend it. :</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Qn appeal, Harvey does not expressly challenge any of the bases for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his' complaint, but, instead, disputes the factual basis for the arrest at the heart of his \u25a0 \u00a7 1983 complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">A district court must'screen a complaint in a civil action in which'an indigent1 plaintiff seeks redress from a governmental entity, officer, or employee, and the court must dismiss the complaint if it, is frivolous, malicious, or -fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (e)(2)(B). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(e)(2), <em>Leal v. Georgia. Dept. of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). A claim is frivolous only if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact,\u201d <em>and.pro se </em>pleadings must be liberally construed. <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotations omitted), We may affirm on any basis supported by the record, regardless of whether the district court decided the case on that basis. <em>Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">State prisoners must use habeas corpus, not \u00a7 1983, When seeking, whether directly or indirectly,- to invalidate their convictions: <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 1245-48, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). A prisoner indirectly challenges his confinement by requesting monetary damages for claims that would require a judicial determination about the invalidity of his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 80-82, 125 S.Ct. at 1247-48. This bar to challenges under \u00a7 1983 to the fact or duration of confinement-was articulated by <em>Heck v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), which held that a \u00a7 1983 action will not lie where \u201cestablishing the basis for the damages claim necessarily demonstrates the invalidity of the conviction.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 481-82, 114 S.Ct. at 2369-70. It is unclear, however, whether <em>Heck </em>bars \u00a7 1983 claims once, as in the instant case, a state prisoner is no longer in custody and cannot pursue habeas relief. <em>See Morrow v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>610 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c[W]e do not understand <em>Heck\u2019s </em>rule to extend to a case ... where Plaintiff is not in custody and where Plaintiff\u2019s action ... in no way implies the invalidity of his conviction or of the sentence imposed by his conviction\u201d) (citing <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 17, 118 S.Ct. 978, 988, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">A claimant is entitled to relief under \u00a7 1983 if he can prove that a person acting under color of state law deprived him of a federal right. <em>Almand v. DeKalb Cnty., Ga., </em>103 F.3d 1510, 1513 (11th Cir.1997). We have identified malicious prosecution as a violation of the Fourth Amendment and a viable constitutional tort under \u00a7 1983. <em>Wood v. Kesler, </em>323 F.3d 872, 881 (11th Cir.2003). The common law elements of malicious prosecution include: \u201c(1) prosecution for a criminal offense; (2) instigated without probable cause; (3) .with malice; (4) under a valid warrant, accusation or summons; (5) which has terminated favorably to the plaintiff; and (6) has caused damage to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Barnette v. Coastal Hematology &amp; Oncology, P.C., </em>294 Ga.App. 733, 735, 670 S.E.2d 217, 220 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">We have also identified false arrest and false imprisonment as violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth' Amendment, respectively, and viable claims under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Ortega v. Christian, </em>85 F.3d 1521, 1525-26 (11th Cir.1996). The common law elements of false arrest include: (1) an arrest under the process of law; (2) without probable cause; and (3) which is made maliciously. <em>Mohamud v. Wachovia Corp., </em>260 Ga.App. 612, 612, 580 S.E.2d 259, 259 (2003). The common law elements of false imprisonment include: (1) the unlawful arrest, confinement, or detention of another, and (2) which is in violation of the individual\u2019s personal liberty. <em>Garcia v. State, </em>240 Ga.App. 53, 54, 527 S.E.2d 877, 878 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">To avoid dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege facts showing he was deprived of a constitutional right by a person acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; <em>Holmes v. Crosby, </em>418 F.3d 1256, 1258 (11th Cir.2005). All constitutional claims brought under \u00a7 1983 are subject to the statute of limitations governing personal-injury actions'in the state where the \u00a7 1983 action Was brought. <em>McNair v. Allen, </em>515 F.3d 1168, 1173 (11th Cir.2008). We independently review the district court\u2019s ruling concerning the applicable statute of limitations. <em>Uboh v. Reno, </em>141 F.3d 1000,1002 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cFederal courts apply their-forum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions to actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Federal law determines when the statute of limitations begins to run. <em>Rozar v. Mullis, </em>85 F.3d 556, 561 (11th Cir.1996). Generally, \u201cthe statute of limitations does- not begin to run until the facts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561-62 (internal marks omitted). Georgia\u2019s statute of limitations is two years. <em>Thigpen v. Bibb County, Ga., Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>223 F.3d 1231, 1243 (11th Cir.2000), Under Georgia law, an action may be filed after the running of the statute of limitations period under certain circumstances provided for in the state\u2019s renewal statute, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>When any-case-has been commenced in either state or federal court within the applicable statute of limitations and the plaintiff discontinues or dismisses the same, it may be recommenced in a court of this state' or in a federal court within the original applicable period of limitations <em>or </em>within six months after the discontinuance ' or dismissal, whichever is later ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-2-61. It is appropriate for a district court to dismiss a complaint as time-barred where the prisoner fails to identify why. the statute of limitations might be tolled in his Case. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1163 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo&gt; </em>that Harvey adequately preserved a challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and that <em>Heck </em>does not apply, we still affirm, Harvey filed his complaint in federal, court more than two years- after his arrest, past the applicable statute of limitations. ; <em>Thig-pen, </em>223 F.3d at 1243.. The limitations period was. not tolled by Harvey\u2019s earlier, state court litigation, because he did not discontinue or dismiss the suit but, instead, judgment was entered against him, and it thereby does not satisfy the renewal statute. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-2-61. Accordingly^ because the claims in Harvey\u2019s \u00a7 1983 brief were time-barred, amending the complaint would have been futile, and the district court was not required to provide Harvey with an opportunity to amend his complaint. <em>Sibley, </em>437 F,3d at 1074. As such, we affirm the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of Harvey\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\">. 'Harvey does not raise any issues regarding the district court\u2019s failure to afford him an opportunity to amend his complaint prior to dismissing it. Accordingly, he has abandoned any such issue. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (Although we construe <em>pro se </em>briefs liberally, \u201cissues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned,\u201d). In any event, amendment would have been futile for reasons set forth <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">. Harvey\u2019s motions for review of state court litigation and for default or declaratory judgment are DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
