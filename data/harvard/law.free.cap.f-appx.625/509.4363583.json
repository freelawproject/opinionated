PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b527-24\">We review the procedural history in detail because , this is not \u25a0 the first time Hutchins has filed a Rule 60(b) motion as to the final judgment in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-25\">A. 1996 Conviction and First \u00a7 2255 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b527-26\">In 1996, Hutchins was convicted of conspiring to possess cocaine and cocain\u00e9 base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>and '846, and sentenced to life imprisonment. In-1999, Hutchins\u2019s conviction and life sentence were affirmed on direct\u2019 appeal. <em>United States v. Hutchins, </em>181 F.3d 107 (11th Cir.1999) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In 2000, Hutchins filed his original \u00a7 2255 motion, raising, <em>inter alia, </em>a claim under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Specifically, Hutchins claimed that the government failed to turn over certain FBI-302 reports of cooperating witnesses\u2019 preliminary statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In 2001, the district court denied Hutch-ins\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, concluding, in part, that his <em>Brady </em>claim (1) was procedurally barred because he did not raise it on direct appeal, and (2) was \u201cinsufficient to warrant relief\u2019 because Hutchins relied only on his good faith belief and did not proffer any evidence showing that the FBI-302 reports were exculpatory or that the government suppressed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">As to the merits'ruling, the district court also noted that the government had \u201cresponded that it submitted questionable FBI [reports] to the court, and requested a determination as to whether the information was <em>Brady </em>information and whether the [cooperating 'witnesses\u2019] interviews should be admitted as evidence or not disclosed\u201d and that Hutchins appeared to be challenging the district court\u2019s earlier in camera inspection of the questionable FBI reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Both the district court and this Court denied Hutchins\u2019s request for a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">B. 2002 Rule 60(b) Motion to Reopen \u00a7 2255 Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">In 2002, Hutchins filed a motion to reopen the \u00a7 2255 proceedings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2) and (3). Hutchins\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion contended that newly discovered evidence\u2014 FBI-302 reports produced in 2001 in response to a Freedom of Information Act request \u2014 showed the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cwas obtained by fraud upon the court by Government Counsel.\u201d Hutchins pointed to the government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 2255 motion claiming that it \u201cprovided all discoverable material before and during trial proceedings,\u201d and submitted all questionable FBI reports to the trial court for in camera review. Hutchins maintained that the FBI-302 reports, newly produced in 2001, showed that \u201cGovernment Counsel in responding to petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition, misled the Court concerning ... whether or not the government disclosed, at trial, all discoverable FBI documents to the defense or to the trial court for an in camera inspection.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also contended that (1) these FBI-302 reports showed that the government had not in fact complied with <em>Brady </em>during his criminal trial, and (2) his Rule 60(b) motion asserting fraud should not be treated as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">On October 4, 2002, the district court denied Hutchins\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. The district court stated that (1) Hutchins\u2019s \u201cclaim of prosecutorial misconduct\u201d was procedurally barred because it was not raised on direct appeal, and (2) his \u201callegation is insufficient to warrant relief be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>cause Mr. Hutchins has not demonstrated that the FBI reports contained exculpatory information, or that the government suppressed the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">C. 2004 Appeal Ruling on 2002 Rule 60(b) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Hutchins appealed the Rule 60(b) ruling without first obtaining a COA. This Court ordered a limited remand so the district court could make a COA determination. <em>See Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Com., </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1263 (11th Cir.2004) (en bane) (concluding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2)\u2019s COA requirement applies to Rule 60(b) motions). On remand, the district court denied Hutchins\u2019s motion for a COA on December 14, 2004, and this Court did as well on November 9,2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">D. 2014 Rule 60(b) Motion to Reopen Initial \u00a7 2255 Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Almost ten years later, Hutchins filed his instant (and second) Rule 60(b)(3) motion in 2014.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Rule 60(b)(3) motion sought relief from \u201cthe district court\u2019s [2001] judgment denying his initial 28 USC section 2255 petition\u201d and also from the district court\u2019s 2004 denial of a COA on remand from this Court as to his earlier Rule 60(b) in his \u00a7 2255 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Hutchins\u2019s Rule 60(b)(3) motion again asserted that the government\u2019s counsel perpetrated a fraud on the \u00a7 2255 court by making an \u201cuntrue statement\u201d that the government had disclosed all the FBI-302 reports to either Hutchins or the trial court. Relying on \u201cintervening\u201d Supreme Court precedent, Hutchins also argued that his earlier Rule 60(b)(2) and (3) motion should not have been construed by this Court back in 2004 as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion that - must comply with the COA requirements. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">On November 15,2014, the district court construed Hutchins\u2019s second Rule 60(b) motion filed in 2\u00d314 as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. On December 5, 2014, the district court also dismissed for lack of jurisdiction Hutchins\u2019s subsequent Rule 59(e) motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">On appeal, Hutchins argues that the district court erred by construing his 2014 Rule 60(b)(3) and 59(e) motions as successive \u00a7 2255 motions and dismissing them for lack of-jurisdiction. Hutchins argues the district court erred in construing his Rule 60(b)(3) and Rule 59(e) motions as successive \u00a7 2255 motions because his claims do not attack the district court\u2019s resolution of the merits of his <em>Brady </em>claim, but rather raise \u201csome defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.\u201d <em>See Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S, at 532 &amp; nn. 4, 5, 125 S.Ct. at 2648 &amp; nn. 4, 5. Hutchins also claims that he should not have been required to obtain a COA in'2004 to appeal his 2002 Rule 60(b) motion because that motion was also a Rule 60(b)(3) motion alleging fraud upon the district court in his initial \u00a7 2255 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">Here, we need not decide whether the district court properly construed Hutch-ins\u2019s 2014 Rule 60(b)(3) and 59(e) motions as successive \u00a7 B255 motions because, in any event, Hutchins\u2019s 2014 Rule 60(b)(3) motion was barred by the one-year statute of limitation in Rule 60(c)(1). <em>See </em>Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1) (stating that a motion under Rule 60(b)(1), (2), or (3) must be made \u201cno more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding\u201d). In addition, the law of the case doctrine bars tlie issues about the COA raised in Hutchins\u2019s motions, regardless of their timeliness. <em>See Mega Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Pieniozek, </em>585 F.3d 1399, 1405 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. Hutchins apparently received at least some of the FBI reports on January 14, 2000, before he filed his original \u00a7 2255. However, Hutchins alleges that the reports were redacted, and it was not until September 29, 2001, after the district'court denied his \u00a7-2255 motion, that he received either additional or un-redacted reports. He also alleges that the reports showed that (1) cooperating witnesses gave prior inconsistent statements, some of which were exculpatory, and (2) the government\u2019s counsel lied to the \u00a7 2255 court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\">. Although Hutchins's 2014 Rule 60(b) motion did not identify a particular subsection of Rule 60(b), it referred to an \u201cextrinsic misrepresentation\u201d that was \"perpetrated on the federal court,\u201d language tracking Rule 60(b)(3). On appeal, Hutchins clarifies that his 2014 Rule 60(b) motion was brought pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
