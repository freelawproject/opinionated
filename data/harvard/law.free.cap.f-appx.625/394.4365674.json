(\u201cAero-tek\u201d) brings this action against two former employees and their new employer, Crawford Thomas, LLC (\u201cC-T\u201d). At issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the appeal is a claim against C-T for tor-tious interference. Aerotek alleges that C-T\u2019s employment relationship with Kevin Zahn and Jason Jimenez (\u201cEmployees\u201d)\u2014 both bound by restrictive covenant \u2014 intentionally and unjustifiably interferes with Aerotek\u2019s contractual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">On motion to dismiss, the district court framed the issue as \u201cwhether a new employer has a duty to terminate employees when it learns they are subject to non-complete agreements with a former employer.\u201d The district court dismissed the tortious interference claim against C-T by assuming that C-T only came to know of the Employees\u2019 obligation- to Aerotek after their hiring, and holding that such delayed knowledge is insufficient to support the claim under Florida law. On appeal, Aero-tek argues that continuing interference with restrictive covenants is actionable, and that the district court improperly assumed that C-T came to know of the Employees\u2019 obligation to Aerotek only after their hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Mills v. Foremost Ins. Co., </em>511 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[W]hen ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.\u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In Florida, the elements of tortious interference are \u201c(1) the existence of a business relationship that affords the plaintiff existing or prospective legal rights; (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the business relationship; (3) the defendant\u2019s intentional and unjustified interference with the relationship; and (4) damage to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Int'l Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. Austral Insulated Prods., Inc., </em>262 F.3d 1152, 1154 (11th Cir.2001). The district court reasoned that the alleged breach of contract \u2014 C-T hiring the Employees \u2014 is not the- sort of wrong that can continue to occur; although the harm, may continue to accrue to Aerotek, this harm all occurred as'the result of a single breach. If C-T had no knowledge of the contract at the time of the Employees\u2019 breach, then C-T could have no'liability. The district court\u2019s dismissal was improper for multiple reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">First, .the. district court\u2019s determination that O-T only came to know of the Employees\u2019 obligation, to Aerotek after -their hiring is erroneous given the requirement to accept as true all factual allegations contained in the- complaint. Although Aer-otek noted that it had provided notice to C-T through a cease-and-desist letter, that statement in Aerotek\u2019s. memorandum in opposition to dismissal is not at all inconsistent with knowledge of the covenants by C-T prior to receipt of the letter. Taking all reasonable inferences from the. complaint in favor of Aerotek, we believe there is a reasonable inference that C-T had knowledge at the time of .the-hires,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">Second, the restrictive covenants here prevented the Employees both from employment with .Aerotek\u2019s competitor<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and communication with any 'of Aerotek\u2019s customers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aerotek alleged that Zahn communicated .with at least one Aerotek client in violation of the Non-Solicitation covenant. As noted above, the district court framed the issue as \u201cwhether a new employer has \u00e1 duty to terminate employees when it learns they are subject to non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>complete agreements.with a former employer/\u2019 In framing.the issue and proceeding with its analysis, the district court did not consider whether breach of the Non-Solicitation covenant could have .occurred with C-T\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\">. Third, in <em>Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. v. Dolgencorp, LLC, </em>746 F.3d 1008, 1043 (11th Cir.2014), this Court concluded \u201cthat Florida law recognizes a continuing violation principle when restrictive covenants are violated by ongoing, separate acts.\u201d We upheld.the district court\u2019s reasoning that each day that the defendant operated a grocery store in'violation' of the restrictive covenant constituted another breach. <em>Id. </em>That is, not only did- opening the grocery store violate the restrictive covenant, but ongoing operation violated as well. <em>Id. </em>at 1043-44. Extending this reasoning to the matter at hand, there are reasonable inferences that each day that the Employees worked in violation of the covenants constituted a separate breach, and that each day that C-T employed Employees knowing that they were acting in violation of the Non-Compet\u00e9 covenant and/or the Non-Solicitation covenant' constituted a separate breach. Thus, it was not only the <em>hiring </em>of the Employees that breached the covenants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Taking the reasonable inferences in favor of Aerotek, we believe there are allegations that C-T had knowledge of sueh breaches following receipt of the cease-and-desist letter, and therefore, Aerotek pled a plausible prima facie case of tortious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">We reverse the dismissal of the claim against C-T and remand for additional proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\">.Knowledge can be pled generally. Fed. R.Civ.P. 9. Aerotek is entitled to discovery to ascertain the precise timing of C-T\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-14\">. Non-Compete Covenant</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-15\">. Non-Solicitaition Covenant</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b414-20\">. It is worth noting that <em>Winn-Dixie </em>addressed covenants running with the land and breach of those covenants; the case did not involve a claim for tortious interference. 746 F.3d at 1043. - Yet this distinguishing factor actually favors Aerotek, because that defendant's best argument'in <em>Winn-Dixie </em>had nothing to do with knowledge, but rather was that the continuing tort doctrine should not apply because the case sounded in contract. <em>Id. </em>at 1042. Here, we have a tort case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
