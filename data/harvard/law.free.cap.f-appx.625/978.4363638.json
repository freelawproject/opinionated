Ferrer, Kathleen Mary Salyer, James Alan Wein-kle, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b997-15\">Timothy Cone, Christine Carr O\u2019Connor, Michael Caruso, Federal Public Defender, Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, Fort Pierce, FL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b997-17\">Before TJOFLAT, MARTIN and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b997-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b997-19\">A jury convicted Edwidge Darbouze of all five counts of a superseding indictment: attempting<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to receive child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252(a)(2) and (b)(1) (Counts 1 and 2); possession of a Compaq desktop computer containing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2) (Count 3); possession of a Polaroid Micro SD Card 32GB containing child pornography, including a visual depiction of a minor under 12, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2) (Count 4); and possession of a Samsung Galaxy cellular telephone containing child pornography, including visual depiction of a minor under 12, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2) (Count 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-20\">After the District Court sentenced Dar-bouze to concurrent prison terms of 135 months and supervised release- terms of 120 months, he lodged this appeal. He challeng\u00e9s his convictions on two -grounds. First,- he contends that the District Court abused its discretion under Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>of Evidence 403 when it allowed the Government to introduce into evidence eight screen shots and one video of child pornography. Second, he asserts that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting Homeland Security Special Agent Deborah Trajkovic\u2019s testimony that Evans Darbouze told her that he did not know how to use peer-to-peer file sharing. We find no abuse of discretion in either instance and accordingly affirm Darbouze\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\"> Federal Rule of Evidence 403, Excluding Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, Waste of Time, or Other Reasons, states: \u201cThe court may exclude relevant evidence if its. probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\u201d Darbouze argues' that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the eight screen shots and one video of child pornography because he had previously stipulated that these items contained images of prepubescent minors. Moreover, he argues, their prejudicial value was- substantial because images of minors engaged in sexually explicit activity would normally cause a juror to find guilt in order to hold someone accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for' a clear abuse' of discretion, only reversing if the \u201cresulting error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1119 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cRule 403 is an extraordinary remedy which the district court should invoke sparingly, and the balance should be struck in favor of admissibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1120 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). In short, we-consider the evidence in a light most favorable to admission, \u201cmaximizing its probative value and minimizing its undue prejudicial impact.\u201d <em>United States v. Dodds, </em>347 F.3d 893, 897 (11th Cir.2003). Photographs of child pornography may be probative to show: 1) the images are child pornography, 2) the defendant knew they'were child pornography, 3) the defendant intended to collect child pornography, or 4) that the pornography crossed state lines. <em>Id. </em>\u2022 at 899. ' Absent a stipulation that the defendant knew he was in possession of child pornography, a district court does not abuse its discretion when it finds that the risk of injecting emotions into the decision-making process does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the images. <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 734 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">We find no abuse here. Darbouze did not stipulate that he knew the images Were child pornography. Furthermore, the District Court took pains to limit the prejudicial effect by limiting the number of images shown, and striking from the venire for cause those jurors who said they could not b\u00e9 fair and impartial after viewing the images.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">The pornographic evidence the Government introduced at Darbouze\u2019s trial came from a search of the two-bedroom apartment where he was living with his parents and his brother, Evans. His parents' slept in one bedroom and he slept in the other. Evans slept on a mattress, in the living room. Among other things, the se\u00e1rch disclosed a Compaq desktop \u2022 computer in the living room with approximately fourteen videos of child pornography, and a cellphone. charging on the floor beside Darbouze\u2019s bed containing a micro SD card with approximately fifteen videos of child pornography on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Agent Trajkovic interviewed Darbouze<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Evans after she and ten other agents finished searching the apartment. At trial, on the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination, she recounted what took place during the search and the subsequent interviews. On cross-examination, defense counsel turned to Agent Trajkovic\u2019s interaction with Evans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-5\">Q. And before you interviewed Ed-widge Junior, you interviewed Evans Darbouze, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-7\">Q. So I want to talk to you about some of the things he told you that you didn\u2019t necessarily follow up on or investigate, okay? Evans Darbouze told you he had never seen child pornography in his life, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection, hearsay. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It\u2019s not for the truth. \u25a0 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-9\">THE COURT: The objection is overruled. I\u2019ll allow it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">The cross-examination then continued, during which the Agent Trajkovic said that Evans denied watching child pornography. After defense counsel asked her if she had considered whether Evans was the one to download child pornography, Agent Traj-kovic responded, \u201cwe basically had ruled out Evans Darbouze because when he was asked about his use of the computer and his knowledge about P2P network and P2P software \u2014 .\u201d At that point, defense counsel interjected, \u201cI\u2019m not asking you about that, Special Agent Trajkovic, and I\u2019m going to stop 'you because there\u2019s certain rules. What I\u2019m asking is, you took him at his word when he told you that statement.\u201d She then responded, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">On redirect examination, when the prosecutor asked the agent if Evans \u201c[w]as asked whether he had ever downloaded child pornography,\u201d defense counsel said: \u2018Your Honor, as long as this isn\u2019t being introduced for- the truth.\u201d The court stated, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s \u2014 and the prosecutor clarified, \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d But after the prosecutor asked, \u201cdid he say whether he had ever used peer-to-peer file sharing,\u201d defense counsel objected, \u201chearsay, Sixth Amendment, and beyond the scope.\u201d The court overruled <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the objection, and the agent stated: \u201che said that he didn\u2019t know how to use peer-to-peer. He didn\u2019t know what file sharing was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">Darbouze contends that Evans\u2019s statement -to Agent Trajkovic that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to use peer-to-peer file sharing\u201d constituted, rank hearsay and, moreover, was \u201ctestimonial\u201d and thus inadmissible Under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation \u25a0 Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree. First, defense counsel opened the door by intimating that the government\u2019s investigation was unreasonably narrow for not focusing on Evans. The prosecution was entitled to rehabilitate the witness by eliciting the reasoning behind her investigative decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">Second, it is clear from the context that neither side sought to use Evans\u2019 statements for their -truth. When the prosecutor objected on hearsay grounds to defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the agent as to what Evans had told her, defense counsel was quick to say that she was not introducing Evans\u2019s statements \u201cfor the truth.\u201d The court agreed and therefore overruled the prbsecutor\u2019s objection. The court made the same ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>when the prosecutor engaged hr similar questioning on redirect examination, and this ruling was proper for the same reasons. In both cases, Evans\u2019 statements did not come in for the truth, but to \u201c\u201cexplain why Agent Trajkovie focused the investigation- as she did. Defense counsel had opened the door on cross-examination and effectively invited the prosecutor to ask the question at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">In sum, because the challenged answer was not introduced for the truth of its contents, Darbouze\u2019s hearsay and Confrontation Clause challenges fail. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 801(c); <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1369 n. 9, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (\u201cThe Clause ... does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted:\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-11\">.
