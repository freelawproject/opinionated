Variste contends (1) the district court abused its discretion by admitting IRS agent Karyn Calabrese\u2019s testimony about indicators of fraud on Variste\u2019s tax returns as lay opinion testimony and'(2)'the district court clearly erred by concluding'Var-iste\u2019s offense involved more than fifty victims. \"As the parties \u00e1re familiar with the facts, we'weave them into the discussion only as necessary. Upon review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">\n<em>1. Calabrese\u2019s testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">Calabrese, a special agent with the IRS\u2019s Criminal Investigations unit, participated ip the IRS\u2019s investigation of Variste and reviewed the tax returns filed under Variste\u2019s electronic filer identification number (EFIN).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Calabrese prepared a summary of some of the information from the returns and testified about several indicators of fraud she noticed when reviewing them. The district court allowed Calabrese\u2019s testimony about these fraud indicators as lay opinion testimony under Federal Rule, .of Evidence 701. On appeal, Variste argues the district court erred in allowing Calabrese\u2019s testimony as lay opinion testimony. Variste contends Calabrese\u2019s testimony was expert testimony and, as such, the district court should have evaluated its admissibility, under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and the factors, set forth in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Calabrese\u2019s testimony about indicators of fraud on Variste\u2019s tax'returns as lay opinion testimony under Rule 701. <em>See United States v. </em>Jayyousi, 657 F.3d 1085, 1102 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s ruling regarding the . admissibility of the agent\u2019s lay testimony under Rule 701 for a clear abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>discretion\u201d). Rule. 701 allows a lay witness to offer opinion testimony if it is \u201c(a) rationally based on the witness\u2019s perception; (b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness\u2019s testimony or to determining a fact .in issue; and (c) not based on scien7 tifie, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Calabrese\u2019s testimony satisfied Rule 7Ql\u2019s requirements for lay opinion testimony. First, her testimony was based on her personal review of the tax returns filed under Variste\u2019s EFIN. Second, her testimony about the fraud indicators helped the jury better understand the significance of the commonalities in the tax returns. Third, Calabrese\u2019s testimony was not the type of specialized testimony that needed to be admitted under Rule 702 because it was based on a summary of documents related to the case, the jury could have reviewed the documents itself and noticed the commonalities among the returns filed under Variste\u2019s EFIN, and the opinions given by Calabres\u00e9 related to the summary that she prepared. <em>See United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1331-32 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding a financial analyst from the Federal Bureau of Investigation gave lay testimony when he summarized thousands ' of financial documents, compared time sheets to payroll entries, and testified a fraud victim was billed for work that was performed for someone else, because \u201cwhile [the agent\u2019s] expertise and the use of computer software may have made him more efficient at reviewing [the company\u2019s] records, his review itself was within the capacity of any reasonable lay person\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 841 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cRule 701 does not prohibit lay witnesses from testifying based on particularized knowledge gained from their own personal experiences.\u201d). Therefore, the .district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Calabrese\u2019s testimony as lay opinion testimony under Rule 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">. <em>Number of Victims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Next, Variste contends the district court erred itt applying a four-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) ' \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B) because it found the offense involved more than 50 victims. According to Variste, the actual number of victims was 44 because his family members and friends who did not suffer losses and who voluntarily provided th\u00e9ir information to him do not qualify as victims within the meaning of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The district court did not err, much less ' clearly err, in concluding Variste\u2019s offense involved more than 50 victims. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>732 F.3d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.2013) (reviewing the district court\u2019s calculation of the number of victims for clear error). When calculating the number of victims for fraud offenses involving the unlawful use of others\u2019 means of identification, a victim is either a person who suffered an actual loss from the offense or a person \u201cwhose means of identification was used unlawfully or -without authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>774 F.3d 711, 735 (11th Cir.2014) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 4(E))). \u201cThe district court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, evidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the PSI, or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d. 1270, 1300 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Substantial evidence supported the district court\u2019s'conclusion that Variste us\u00e9d means of identification from mote than 50 victims without their authority. At sentencing, Variste conceded that at least 43 of the 52 tax returns filed under his EFIN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>were unauthorized returns. Additionally, Variste did not object to paragraph 13 of the PSI, which stated Variste filed at least 17 other fraudulent tax returns under an unindicted co-conspirators EFIN. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (unobjected-to-facts in PSI are deemed admitted). Furthermore, Variste did not object to Exhibit 30C, which contained e-mails from his phone confirming that returns were sent under the co-conspirators EFIN. Given the totality of the record, the district court did not error, clearly or otherwise, in concluding there were more than 50 victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Variste\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-12\">.
