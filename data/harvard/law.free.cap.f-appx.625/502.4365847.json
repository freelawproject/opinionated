It also contends that Lantana failed to present clear ,and convincing evidence of fraud or of fraud that actually hindered Lantana. from thoroughly investigating and appraising Suite 225\u2019s .insurance claim. Alternatively, Suite 225 contends that it is entitled to an evi-dentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Suite 225 began operating a restaurant in Lake Worth, Florida in 2008. Douglas Peters was the sole owner, and his self-described approach to running the restaurant was \u201chands-off.\u201d On December 10, 2009, Peters sent an email to his landlord, Love Realty. The email states that \u201c[t]ime is of the essence.\u201d It refers to an earlier conversation that Peters had with the Love Realty\u2019s CEO, Burt Handelsman, and asks for a rent reduction: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">I fan the scenarios by [Handlesman], We will either stay and re-negotiate to redo the restaurant and concept after a 3 month closing-and renovation with a new hands on partner or we can auction off the contents and negotiate a GOOD GUY EXIT. I have made a yeomen effort which has included going into my pocket for the last 2 years to the tune of $186,000 plus. As I explained to [Han- \" dlesman] there is nobody who will survive at this location with the triple net fees ... that are in place today\u2014 I am asking for an \u00e1nswer \u2014 I can\u2019t even make it through season with the concept I have now and 1 am going to lose my proposed partner investor who is willing to pay for all the renovations into the inside and out of the location if I don\u2019t get an answer from [Handlesman], I ... would appreciate it happening asap, prior to next months rent being due.... [T]his is very stressful to myself which is affecting my whole family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Doc. 43-9 at 2. Two weeks later, Handels-man sent Peters a letter on Love Realty letterhead stating that the financial terms of the lease would be modified. Handels-man\u2019s letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">We agree that you may deduct from each bill, which will be sent to you, as if the original Lease were in full force and effect without this modification, the sum of $2,500 each month from the payment required for rent ... for the duration of your Lease. Said reduced sum will be accepted as full payment thereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">It is my understanding that you will be modifying the restaurant for a new concept for which this concession has been granted____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">Doc. 43-9 at 3. The letter was signed \u201cAgreed and Consented to\u201d by Peters with a handwritten date of \u201c12-23-09\u201d next to his signature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">On January 8, 2010, Peters sent an email to Love Realty about suspending garbage service during Suite 225\u2019s upcoming closure for renovation. That email stated: \u201c[P]lease update me on our garbage discussion. I am planning to shut down in less than 10 days. [T]his whole week we did less than 2,000 in business!\u201d Three days later, on Monday, January 11, 2010,. the restaurant was closed for the day. When restaurant employees arrived to open it the next day; they discovered that a pipe had burst in one of the bathrooms, and the restaurant was flooded. The damage was extensive,-and the restaurant could not operate until repairs were made and equipment was replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Peters filed an insurance claim with Lantana, submitting a proof of loss on March .16, 2010. During .the claims process, Lantana investigated and determined that the damage and related business interruption were covered by the policy. Lantana offered to settle, but Peters thought that the amount offered was inadequate and called for an appraisal by an independent umpire according to the terms of the policy. In connection with the insurance claim, Peters had three examinations under oath, and those occurred on May 24, 2010, June 23, 2010, and December 5, 2012. In the first examination he testified that the rent for the restaurant had not been abated and that he had never planned to change the business model or \u201ctheme\u201d of the restaurant. He did not mention his December 2009 and January 2010 emails to Love Realty or Love Realty\u2019s December 2009 letter agreeing to reduce amount of monthly rent. Nowhere in his 2010 testimony did Peters acknowledge the planned renovation to \u201credo the restaurant and concept\u201d or the landlord\u2019s agreement to reduc\u00e9 the monthly rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Lantana would not agree to an independent appraisal, and in July 2010 Peters filed in state court a petition to compel appraisal. Lantana removed the case to federal district court, and the court later granted Peters\u2019 petition; After that, an appraisal panel determined that Suite 225\u2019s damages totaled $543,927, which included a business interruption loss of $289,888.45. On November 15, 2011, the district court affirmed the appraisal award and entered judgment for the total amount in favor of Peters. \u2022 '</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">About three weeks later, the parties filed a joint motion to modify the judgment or in the alternative for relief from the judgment. The motion sought to reduc\u00e9 the total amount awarded from $543,927.09 to $217,416.34 to account for the amount Lantana had already paid Suite 225 under the appraisal award. The motion also asked for the prejudgment interest to run from 30 days after the date of the appraisal award in accordance with Florida law and the terms of the policy. The court granted the motion and entered an Amended Final Judgment on December 12, 2011. Based on the judgment in its favor,. Suite; 225 filed- a separate -action against Lantana alleging bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">On December 7, 2012, just short of a year after the aniended final judgment was entered on the appraisal award, Lantana filed a Rule 60(b)(3) motion for relief from judgment. It contended that during the bad faith action, documents produced by third parties during discovery revealed that Peters had made material representations and omissions that amounted to fraud and that foreclosed any coverage under the policy. Among other things, Lantana specifically pointed to the communications between Peters and his landlord addressing the financial troubles of the restaurant, the plan to close it for renovation in order to change its \u201cconcept,\u201d and the agreement for a reduction in the amount of monthly rent. Lantana argued as a result of Peters\u2019 material misrepresentations the policy was void by its express terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Suite 225 opposed the motion, and the district court held a hearing. After the hearing, the court issued hn order finding that Lantana\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion had been filed within a year of the court\u2019s December 12, 2011 judgment, which was the fihal judgment, and that the motion was filed within a reasonable time. The court referred the matter to a magistrate judge to issue a report and recommendation on the issue of whether the appraisal award was procured by a materially fraudulent insurance claim by.Suite 225. The court left it to the magistrate judge\u2019s discretion wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>er to hold another hearing and to receive additional evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The magistrate judge issued a report finding that Lantana had \u201cestablished by clear and convincing evidence that Douglas Peters, on [Suite 225\u2019s] behalf, systematically engaged in a pattern of making material misrepresentations to prevent [Lantana] from learning Peters\u2019 plan to renovate the restaurant which may have exposed a possible motive and resulted in further investigation into the cause of the flood.\u201d The report also found that Peters had \u201csought to prevent [Lantana] from establishing that' the covered amount of Business ' Interruption loss was actually less than [Suite 225] claimed.\u201d It concluded that \u201c[b]ased on this fraud, [Suite 225] is not entitled to coverage, and the policy should be deemed void.\u201d The report emphasized that Peters had made \u201cthe consistent and repetitive decision ... to hide the rent reduction from his insurer, a variety of public and independent appraisers, and this Court.\u201d \"</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The report rejected as not credible Peters\u2019 testimony iri December 2012 that failing to reveal the rent reduction during the claims process was \u201can oversight,\u201d explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">Peters\u2019 contention that the rent 'reduction somehow slipped his mind during the claims process, only weeks after receiving it, is belied by his [December 2009] email to Love Realty, wherein he (1) admitted to spending nearly $200,000.00 of his own money to keep the restaurant afloat, (2) frantically insisted upon a rent reduction (under threat of executing a \u201cgood guy exit\u201d), and (3) made an emotional plea to alleviate the stress on his family. Clearly, this rent reduction was extremely important to Peters and given the fact that all of these events, including the preparation of the Sworn Proof of Loss, occurred in such- quick succession, the Court finds that the omission was knowing and'intentional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Doc. <em>81 </em>at 10. The recommendation was to grant Lantana\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. The district court accepted that recommendation, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, vacated its earlier judgment against Lantana, declared the policy void due to material misrepresentation, and entered a new judgment in favor of Lantana. This is Suite 225\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">\u201cWe review the grant of relief under Rule 60(b) for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>AIG Baker Sterling Heights, LLC v. American Multi-Cinema, Inc., </em>579 F.3d 1268, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). Under that standard, \u201cwe affirm unless we determine that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard, failed to follow proper procedures in making the relevant determination, or made findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Lugo v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>750 F.3d 1198, 1207 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">\u201cRule 60(b) is the procedural means by which a party may seek relief from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Doe v. Drummond Co., </em>782 F.3d 576, 612 (11th Cir.2015) (quotation marks omitted). A Rule 60(b) motion for relief from a judgment based on \u201cfraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3), must be \u201cmade within a reasonable time\u201d and at the latest \u201cno more than a year after the entry of the judgment,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). Suite 225 first contends that Lantana\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion-is untimely because, although it was filed within a year of the December 12, 2011 amended final judgment, it was not filed within a year of the November 15, 2011 \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d The November 15 judgment is the one that the parties jointly asked the court to alter or amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Rule 60(b) is a vehicle for relief from a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). When the relief is sought based on an opposing party\u2019s fraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct, the Rule 60 one7year clock starts running based on \u201centry of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). A judgment is \u201cany order from which an appeal lies.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In the present case, an appeal from the court\u2019s November 15 order could have been filed, but after the parties timely filed their motion to alter or amend that judgment, the November 15 order was no longer immediately appealable. <em>See Green v. Drug Enforcement </em>Admin.; 606 F.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cA timely filed Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment (among other motions) tolls the time limit in which to appeal.\u201d). If Lantana had filed a. notice of appeal after the district court entered its November 15 order, that notice would have merely served as a placeholder until the parties\u2019 motion to alter or amend was resolved. <em>See, e.g., Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1524 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201c[A]n otherwise timely notice of appeal filed before the disposition of a Rule 59 motion is not voided but instead merely lies dormant while the motion is pending, and the notice of appeal becomes effective as of the date of the order disposing of the Rule 59 motion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Because the court granted the parties\u2019 motion to alter or amend and entered an amended judgment on- December 12, its new judgment in effect vacated the November 15 judgment. <em>Cf. Empl\u2019rs Ins. of Wausanu v. Titan Int'l Inc,, </em>400 F.3d 486, 489 (7th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201cwhen a motion to amend a judgment is granted, the result is an amended judgment\u201d and holding that the time to appeal ran from the date that the amended judgment was entered on the docket). Lantana\u2019s Rule 60(b)(3) motion was timely filed within a year of the December 11 final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Suite 225 next contends that even if the Rule 60(b)(3) motion was filed within a year of the final judgment, it was not filed within -a \u201creasonable time,\u201d as the rule requires. The district court found that until November 30, 2012, discovery in the parties\u2019 separate bad faith action was ongoing. Third party discovery in that case produced the documents that revealed the plan to shut down the restaurant for renovations in .order to create a new \u201cconcept,\u201d and it. revealed evidence of an agreement for a rent reduction. Peters\u2019 deposition in the bad faith lawsuit was on December 5, 2012. In that deposition he testified that the agreement to reduce the rent was not revealed earlier because of an \u201coversight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Two days after- Peters gave that testimony, Lantana filed its Rule 60(b)(3) motion. The magistrate judge\u2019s report, which the district -court adopted,. found, that it was \u201cevident that Peters\u2019 misrepresentations to [Lantana], the appraisal panel and [the] Court were not merely an \u2018oversight,\u2019 but an intentional deception.\u201d The record supports that finding. The ..district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that after Lantana discovered the evidence of those omissions and misrepresentations, it filed a Rule 60(h)(3) motion within a reasonable time'.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\"> Suite 225 also contends that, even if Lantana\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was timely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the district court abused its discretion by finding that Lantana had presented clear and convincing evidence of fraud and that Lantana had shown it was prevented from fully litigating its case- in the appraisal proceedings. Parties seeking relief from a judgment under Rule 60(b)(3) \u201cmust prove by clear and convincing evidence that the adverse party obtained the verdict through fraud, misrepresentations, or other misconduct,\u201d and that as a result they were prevented from fully presenting their case. <em>Waddell v. Hendry County Sheriffs Office, </em>329 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Suite 225 does not dispute that Peters made omissions and misrepresentations because it cannot dispute that. It cannot dispute that Peters did not disclose that he planned to shut down the restaurant for renovations just-before the flood occurred. It cannot dispute that Peters intended to change the restaurant \u201cconcept\u201d during renovations to try to improve business. It cannot dispute that Peters did not disclose the agreement with the landlord to lower the rent. '</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Instead of taking issue with the indisputable evidence, Suite 225 essentially argues that those omissions did not matter. It argues that even thbugh the planned renovations were not disclosed, Peters did testify during the appraisal process that business at the- restaurant had not been good for the past couple of years. It argues that Lantana could have investigated the restaurant\u2019s finances- more thoroughly. It argues that even if there was a plan to change the restaurant \u201cconcept,\u201d there was n\u00e9ver \u2018 a plan to change its \u201ctheme,\u201d which is what Peters was asked about during his 2010 examination under oath. It argues that even though the rent reduction agreement was not disclosed,, it did not matter because, as it turned out, the rent was never actually reduced.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which the district court adopted, observed that -\u201c[e]ven .putting aside the uncanny coincidence of the pipe burst occurring the first time the restaurant had been closed in weeks, and within days of when Peters was planning to shutter the restaurant for a complete renovation,\u201d the evidence showed that Peters intentionally deceived Lantana, the appraisal panel, and the court. That evidence was weighed. Credibility determinations were made. Those findings were not in Peters\u2019 favor, and they were not clearly erroneous. The report also found \u201cabsurd\u201d Suite 225\u2019s argument that Lantana should have conducted a more thorough investigation and noted that \u201cthe insurer is entitled, to rely on the representations of an insured, without checking all its files to determine if the insured is committing a fraud.\u201d <em>Schrader v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>280 F.2d 355, 362 (5th Cir.1960), We agree. -</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by granting Lantana\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-12\">. Lantana Insurance Ltd. is now known as Stonington Insurance Co.', but for the sake of \u2022 simplicity, this opinion will refer'to the company as Lantana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">.

Suite 225 also contends that the magistrate judge should have conducted an evidentiary hearing. The district court held a hearing on the Rule 60(b) motion. In referring the matter to the magistrate judge for a report a\u00f1d \u2022 recommendation, the court\u2019s order stated that another hearing could be held to receive addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tional evidence \u201cas necessary.\u201d In light of the clear and convincing evidence in the record, it was not an abuse of discretion to determine that another hearing was unnecessary. <em>See Lugo, </em>750 F,3d at 1207 (\u201cA district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an evidentia-ry hearing in a Rule 60(b) proceeding is .., reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
