On appeal, Cameron argues that the district court \u00e9rred when it failed to inform him prior to his guilty pleas that he might be sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful consideration of the record and the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>: When a defendant objects for the first time on appeal to deficiencies in his plea colloquy, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>751 F.3d 1244, 1251-52 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 310, 190 L.Ed.2d 225 (2014). To establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that the error prejudiced his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn the Rule 11 context, a defendant who seeks to establish plain error must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, [the defendant] would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252 (quotation omitted). Finally, we exercise our discretion under the plain error standard only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Because a defendant waives a number of constitutional rights by entering a guilty plea, due process requires the he make the plea \u201cknowingly and voluntarily.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005). In accepting a defendant\u2019s\" guilty plea, a court \u201cmust comply with Rule 11 and specifically address three \u2018core principles,\u2019 ensuring that a defendant (1) enters his guilty plea free from coercion, (2) understands the nature of the charges, and (3) understands the consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00dander Rule 11, the district court must \u201cinform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands ... the nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading ...\u201d and \u201cany maximum possible penalty\u201d or \u201cmandatory minimum penalty.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(G), (H), (I). The Rule also requires that the defendant be made aware\u2019 of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines calculation process. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(l)(M).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We have held that \u201cthere is no one mechanical way or precise juncture to which a district judge must conform in advising a defendant of the charges to which he is pleading guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>173 F.3d 1318, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1999) (quotations omitted). Instead, we review the record as a whole to see if the core principles of Rule 11 are satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 1323. Each plea colloquy is assessed individually based on various factors including \u201cthe simplicity or complexity of the charges and the defendant\u2019s sophistication and intelligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322-23. Finally, it is not plain error when a court fails to advise a defendant of the existence of a particular Guidelines provision that may enhance the sentence. <em>See United States v. Bozza, </em>132 F.3d 659, 661-62 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cBozza\u2019s contention that his purported lack of notice of the possible enhancement violated Rule 11 is without merit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) advisory committee notes (1989) (\u2018Since it will be impracticable, if not impossible, to know which guidelines will be relevant pri- or to the formulation of a presentence report and resolution of disputed facts, [Rule 11(c)(1)] does not require the court to specify which guidelines will be important or which grounds for departure might prove to'be significant.\u2019 \u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">During the, plea colloquy, the court .also informed Cameron .that he might be sentenced anywhere .between the statutory minimum and , maximum, and that any guideline range estimated by his counsel was not necessarily going to be accurate. Cameron acknowledged this and proceeded with his plea. He cannot now claim that the \u25a0 court erred by not informing him of the possibility he may receive a higher sentence as a career offender when he was informed of the possibility he might receive any sentence within the statutory range. Moreover, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>court asked Cameron if he had discussed with his attorney the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and how they might apply to his case. Cameron replied that he had. The district court did not plainly err because such a conversation with his attorney would have informed Cameron of the potential incarceration consequences of his pleas. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court committed any error, Cameron has failed to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that he would not have entered the guilty pleas, as his argument to that effect is simply a conelusory statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\">. Cameron also argues that he is entitled to have his guilty pleas vacated because, at his plea colloquy, the district court failed to determine whether he understood and agreed to the quantity of drugs attributed to his conduct. This argument is frivolous because the plea colloquy repeatedly discussed the drug quantity and the record is clear that Cameron understood both the amount of cocaine and cocaine base to which he was pleading guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
