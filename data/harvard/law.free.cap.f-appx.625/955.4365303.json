He argues the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress and his request for a hearing pursuant to <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress under a mixed standard, reviewing the'district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its application of the law to those facts de novo. <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cFurther, when considering. a ruling on a motion to suppress, all facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review de novo whether a search warrant affidavit established probable cause, and \u201cwe give due weight to inferences drawn from the facts by resident, judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>767 F.3d 1264, 1274-75 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1448, 191 L.Ed.2d 403 (2015). We generally review a district court\u2019s denial of a <em>Franks </em>hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2014), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1883, 191 L.Ed.2d 753 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-20\">\u201cTo obtain a warrant, police must establish probable cause to conclude that there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence, of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>.United States v. Gib</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number><em>son, </em>708 F.3d 1256, 1278 (11th Cir.) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 342, 187 L.Ed.2d 238 (2013). An affidavit in support of a warrant \u201cshould establish a connection between the defendant and the property to be searched and a link between the property and any criminal activity.\u201d <em>Mathis, </em>767 F.3d at 1276 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Affidavits submitted in support of search warrants are presumptively' valid. <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. at 2684. A search warrant may be voided and the fruits of the search excluded if the search warrant affidavit contained a false statement made knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth. <em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. at 2676. Nevertheless, even intentionally false or recklessly misleading omissions in the affidavit \u201cwill invalidate a warrant only if inclusion of the omitted facts would have prevented a finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Mathis, </em>767 F.3d at 1275 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">\u201cA <em>Franks, </em>hearing is warranted where a defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that an affiant made intentionally false or recklessly misleading statements (or omissions), and those statements are necessary to the finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d at 1328 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen assessing whether the alleged false statements and omissions were material, the trial court is to disregard those portions of the affidavit which the defendant has shown are arguably false and misleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of showing that, absent, those misrepresentations or omissions, probable cause would have been lacking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover,, we have held that when a \u201cmagistrate judge undertook the evaluation prescribed by <em>Franks </em>and considered the affidavit with the omissions and additions proposed by [the defendant,\u201d the trial court did not err in declining to hold a <em>Franks </em>hearing. <em>See United States v. Kapordelis,. </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1309-1310 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Murray\u2019s motion to suppress and did not abus\u00e9 its discretion in denying a <em>Franks </em>hearing. Even if the factual omissions in the affidavits supporting Murray\u2019s search and arrest warrants were knowing and intentional or in reckless disregard of the truth, their inclusion would not have prevented a finding of probable cause. <em>See Mathis, </em>767 F.3d at 1275; <em>Barsoum, </em>763 F.3d at 1328. Murray does not deny that the victim identified his shooter as \u201cJay,\u201d which was a nickname of Murray, and id\u00e9ntified Murray from a photographic lineup. Murray does not deny that the offic\u00e9r heard that Murray was located at the apartment to be searched. These conceded facts established a fair probability that evidence would be found at the apartment, <em>see Gibson, </em>708 F.3d at 1278, and that Murray was connected to the apartment, <em>see Mathis, </em>767 F.3d at 1276. Moreover, the district court considered the omitted facts at the hearing on Murray\u2019s motion to suppress, and found that there was still probable cause. <em>See Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d at 1309-1310. Finally, Murray does not deny that there was another active warrant for his arrest in connection with the December shooting authorizing officers to arrest him. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Murray\u2019s motion to suppress and of a <em>Franks </em>\u25a0 hearing despite the factual omissions contained in the affidavits supporting Murray\u2019s arrest and search warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">Second, Murray argues that his post-arrest statements should be sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>pressed as involuntary because medical attention was withheld from him. By knowingly and voluntarily 'entering a guilty plea, a defendant waives the right to appeal nonjurisdictional challenges that he did not explicitly preserve. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998). Because Murray pled guilty to possessing firearms and ammunition as a convicted felon, and he did not preserve the involuntariness argument, he has waived the right to raise this argument on appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\"> Third, Murray argues that the district court abused, its discretion by imposing a minimum 15-year imprisonment term pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because the characterizations of Murray\u2019s prior offenses as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and as \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d were not charged by the grand jury in its indictment, found by .a jury at trial, or admitted in his plea. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">We review constitutional challenges to a sentence de novo. <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). A defendant who enters a plea of guilty waives all {nonjurisdictional challenges to the constitutionality of the conviction. <em>Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d at 1344,.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and its corresponding sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, provide that anyone convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) who has three previous convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Generally, any fact that increases either the statutory maximum or statutory minimum sentence is an element of the crime that must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2163-64, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). However, the fact of a prior conviction is not an element of the crime and does not need to be alleged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 243-44, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1231, 1233, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1250 (11th Cir.2014). Furthermore, district courts may make findings regarding the violent nature of a prior conviction for ACCA purposes. <em>United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262, 1264-65 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Having pled guilty to the underlying charge without expressly reserving the right to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge on appeal, Murray has waived this challenge.\u2019 <em>See Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d at 1344; <em>United States v. Ford, </em>270 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). Even if Murray did not waive his right to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge on appeal, it fails. The district court was allowed to determine whether Murray\u2019s prior convictions qualified as ACCA predicates, as they were not elements of the offenses. <em>See Day, </em>465 F.3d at 1264-65. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s enhanced sentence based on its characterization of Murray\u2019s prior offenses as a violent felony and serious drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">Fourth, Murray argues that his conviction in Florida state court, where he received a withhold of adjudication and a sentence of 120 days jail for possession of cocaine with intent to sell or deliver, was illegal under Florida law such that it cannot be used as a predicate conviction for the ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>We review de novo whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA. <em>United, States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Under the ACCA, \u201ca person who violates [\u00a7 ] 922(g) and has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another,\u201d shall be imprisoned not less than 15 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). For the purposes of \u00a7 924(e), a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d includes \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ..., for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Under Florida law, possession of cocaine with intent to sell is a second degree felony punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(d), 893.03(2)(a), 893.13(l)(a). A conviction under \u00a7 893.13(1), which includes possession with intent to sell cocaine, qualifies as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2827, 192 L.Ed.2d 864 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">A defendants guilty plea in \u25a0 Florida state court, even where adjudication has been withheld, is a conviction for the purpose of enhancing a sentence under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Santiago, </em>601 F.3d 1241, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">Under Florida law, a judge may, where allowed by law, withhold an adjudication of guilt if the judge places the defendant on probation. Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.670. One intermediate Florida court has held that, under Florida law, adjudication cannot be withheld if a jail term is imposed. <em>State v. Seward, </em>543 So.2d 398, 399 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">With the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel, a defendant has no right to challenge the validity of previous state convictions in his federal sentencing proceeding when such convictions are used to enhance his sentence under the ACCA. <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 487, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 1734, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">Here, the district court did not err in using Murray\u2019s prior conviction under Florida law for possession of -cocaine with intent to sell or deliver as a predicate ACCA conviction. Murray\u2019s prior conviction qualified as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA. <em>See Smith, </em>775 F;3d at 1268. Murray pled guilty and his adjudication was withheld; therefore, the conviction qualifies as a conviction for purposes of enhancing Murray\u2019s sentence under the ACCA even if adjudication was withheld. <em>See Santiago, </em>601 F.3d at 1247. Although Murray\u2019s prison sentence, if accompanied by a withhold of adjudication, may have been illegal, <em>see </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.670, that would only affect his sentence, not his conviction. Whether a prior conviction counts as an ACCA predicate depends on the punishment prescribed by law, not the punishment actually administered. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A). - Furthermore, Murray has no right to challenge-the validity of his previous state convictions used to enhance his sentence under the ACCA. <em>See Custis, </em>511 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 1732. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s enhancement based on Murray\u2019s prior convictions for \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d, under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">Murray finally argues that his prior Florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer does not qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. Murray also argues that' the ACCA\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutional<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>ly vague because it does not give persons of ordinary intelligence fair notice of its reach, and should therefore not be consulted for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">We review de novo whether a particular conviction is a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Kirk, </em>767 F.3d 1136, 1138 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014-, 135 S.Ct. 2941, 192 L.Ed.2d 962 (2015) (mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The ACCA defines a violent felony as any crime punishabl\u00e9 by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that: \u201c(i) has as an\" element -the use, attempted use, or threatened. use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson,, or extortion, involves use of explosives, <em>or otherwise involves conduct that presents\u25a0 a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court recently struck down the italicized clause, known as the residual clause, in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>as a violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee. of due process. <em>See </em>576 U.S.-,-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2557, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s categorization- of the battery on a law enforcement officer offense- as a violent felony was constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">However, we will not reverse a conviction where the error below was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. </em>Paz, 405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The error here was harmless even without the battery on a law enforcement officer offense counting against Murray because he qualified for ACCA enhancement based on his three serious drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
