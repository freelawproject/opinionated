J.</author>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">On August 19, 2012, Christopher Patterson snatched a gold chain from around the neck of 71-year-old Guadalupe Ramos.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the process, he either knocked or threw her to the pavement of a grocery store parking lot. Patterson fled on foot; Maxamillion Lee McDonald (defendant), the driver of a car parked several spaces away from the Ramos vehicle, pulled out of the lot and picked Patterson up a block or two away. With defendant in the car was Lawrence Slaughter. The trio\u2014all members of the East Side Crips criminal street gang\u2014then drove to a business that purchased gold. Meanwhile, Guadalupe developed an irregular heartbeat. She was pronounced dead about an hour after the robbery. The day before, defendant, accompanied by Slaughter, had grabbed a gold chain from the neck of a woman in a different store\u2019s parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Defendant now stands convicted, following a jury trial, of first degree murder during the commission of a robbery (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189, 190.2, subd. (a)(17); count 1), robbery (\u00a7 212.5, subd. (c); counts 2 &amp; 4), and active participation in a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a); count 3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to counts 1 and 2, the jury further found defendant committed the offense for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).) Following a bifurcated court trial, defendant was found to have been previously convicted of a serious or violent felony (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (c)-(j), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(e)) and to have served two prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied, and, the People not having sought the death penalty, defendant was sentenced to an unstayed term of life in prison without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>possibility of parole plus 12 years. He was ordered to pay restitution and various fees, fines, and assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">In the published portion of this opinion, we hold there was prejudicial instructional error concerning the requirement that defendant must have aided and abetted the robbery at or before the time of the act causing death. We also hold the jury was correctly instructed on the specific intent required by section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In the unpublished portion, we conclude (1) there was insufficient evidence to support the special circumstance finding; (2) there was sufficient evidence to support the gang enhancements; (3) the error in giving CALCRIM No. 361 was harmless; and (4) the jury was adequately instructed concerning the elements of section 186.22, subdivision (a). We vacate the special circumstance finding and reverse the conviction and enhancement on count 1, affirm the conviction and enhancement on count 2, affirm the convictions on counts 3 and 4, affirm the prior strike and prison term enhancements, and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">FACTS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">Defendant raises a number of claims of purported instructional error.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">A. <em>First Degree Felony Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct, as to first degree felony murder, that the jury had to find he aided and abetted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>robbery before or at the time of the act(s) causing death.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Under the instructions given, he says, the jury could have believed defendant was guilty of aiding and abetting a robbery in progress by acting as a getaway driver before Patterson had reached a place of temporary safety, and, hence, was automatically guilty of felony murder even though the acts that caused Guadalupe\u2019s death had already been committed before he aided and abetted. We agree with defendant that his murder conviction must be reversed.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The prosecution presented evidence from which the jury reasonably could have determined defendant was a coplanner of the robbery and participated in casing the Foods Co for a victim, then acted as the getaway driver for the actual robber\u2014in other words, that he aided and abetted the robbery from the outset. If jurors believed defendant\u2019s testimony, however, he had no idea ahead of time that Patterson was going to commit any kind of crime at the Foods Co, and only went to Patterson\u2019s aid (although suspecting Patterson had committed some kind of crime) after he saw Patterson running away from the store.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Without objection or modification, the trial court gave CALCRIM No. 1603 in conjunction with instructions on robbery, as charged in counts 2 and 4, to wit: \u201cTo be guilty of robbery as an aider and abettor, the defendant must have formed the intent to aid and abet the commission of the robbery before or while a perpetrator carried away the property to a place of temporary safety. A perpetrator has reached a place of temporary safety with the property if he or she has successfully escaped from the scene, is no longer being pursued, and has unchallenged possession of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>During the jury instruction conference, the parties agreed the only applicable theory of first degree murder was felony murder. The People requested that CALCRIM No. 540B be given; defense counsel had no objection. Pursuant to that instruction, the trial court told the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u201cThe defendant is charged in Count 1 with murder under a theory of felony murder. The defendant may be guilty of murder under a theory of felony murder, even if another person did the act that resulted in the death. I will call the other person the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u201cTo prove that the defendant is guilty of first-degree murder under this theory, the People must prove that: One, the defendant aided and abetted or was a member of a conspiracy to commit robbery; two, the defendant intended to aid and abet the perpetrator in committing or intended that one or more members of the conspiracy commit robbery; three, if the defendant did not personally commit robbery, then a perpetrator, whom the defendant was aiding and abetting or with whom the defendant conspired, personally committed robbery; four, while committing robbery, the perpetrator caused the death of another person; and five, there was a logical connection between the cause of death and the robbery. The connection between the cause of death and the robbery must involve more than just their occurrence at the same time and place.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u201cA person may be guilty of felony murder even if the killing was unintentional, accidental or negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u201cTo decide whether the perpetrator committed robbery, please refer to the separate instructions that I will give you on that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u201cTo decide whether the defendant aided and abetted a crime, please refer to the separate instructions that I have given you on aiding and abetting. You must apply those instructions when you decide whether the People have proved first-degree murder under a theory of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u201cIt is not required that the person die immediately, as long as the cause of death and the felony are part of one continuous transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u201cIt is not required that the defendant be present when the death occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">For reasons not apparent from the jury instruction conference, the trial court omitted a bracketed paragraph from the instruction that would have told jurors: \u201c[The defendant must have (intended to commit[,]/ [or] aid and abet[,]/ [or] been a member of a conspiracy to commit) the (felony/felonies) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>of_&lt;insert felony or felonies from Pen. Code, \u00a7 189&gt; </em>before or at the time that (he/she) caused the death.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">With respect to the robbery-murder special circumstance, and without objection, the trial court gave CALCRIM No. 703, which told the jury, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u201cIf you decide that the defendant is guilty of first-degree murder but was not the actual killer, then when you consider the special circumstance of whether the murder was committed by the defendant while engaged in the commission of or acting as an accomplice to the crime of robbery, you must also decide whether the defendant acted either with intent to kill or with reckless indifference to human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u201cIn order to prove this special circumstance for a defendant who is not the actual killer but who is guilty of first-degree murder as an aider and abettor, the People must prove either that the defendant intended to kill or the People must prove all of the following: One, the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime began before or during the killing; two, the defendant was a major participant in the crime; and three, when the defendant participated in the crime, he acted with reckless indifference to human life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Finally, with the agreement of both parties, the trial court modified CALCRIM No. 730 to delete language referring to conspiracy. It then instructed the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u201cThe defendant is charged with the special circumstance of murder committed while engaged in the commission of robbery. To prove that this special circumstance is true, the People must prove that: One, the defendant aided and abetted a robbery; two, the defendant intended to aid and abet the perpetrator in committing a robbery; three, if the defendant did not personally commit the robbery, then a perpetrator whom the defendant was aiding and abetting before or during the killing personally committed a robbery; four, the perpetrator did an act that caused the death of another person; five, the act causing the death and the robbery were part of one continuous transaction; and six, there was a logical connection between the act causing the death and the robbery. The connection between the fatal act and the robbery must involve more than just their occurrence at the same time and place.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\u201cTo decide whether the perpetrator committed robbery, please refer to the separate instructions that I will give you on that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">\u201cTo decide whether the defendant aided and abetted a crime, please refer to the separate instructions that I have given you on aiding and abetting. You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>must apply those instructions when you decide whether the People have proved first-degree murder under a theory of felony murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The final sentence quoted above was contained in both the court\u2019s oral and written instructions, a copy of which was given to the jury. The sentence should have read: \u201cYou must apply those instructions when you decide whether the People have proved <em>this special </em>circumstance.\u201d (Italics added.) Again, the trial court omitted the portion of the instruction that would have told jurors: \u201c[The defendant must have (intended to commit[,]/ [or] aided and abetted/ [or] been a member of a conspiracy to commit) the (felony/felonies) <em>of_&lt;insert felony or felonies from Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2(a)(17)&gt; </em>before or at the time of the act causing the death.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he crime of robbery is not confined to the act of taking property from victims. The nature of the crime is such that a robber\u2019s escape with his loot is just as important to the execution of the crime as obtaining possession of the loot in the first place.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] As a result, the commission of a robbery is ongoing \u2018 \u201cuntil the robber has won his way to a place of temporary safety.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] A robber has not reached a place of temporary safety while an immediate and active pursuit to recover the property is in progress. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Debose </em>(2014) 59 Cal.4th <em>111, </em>205 [172 Cal.Rptr.3d 606, 326 P.3d 213].) Because of this, for aider and abettor liability where <em>robbery </em>is concerned, \u201ca getaway driver must form the intent to facilitate or encourage commission of the robbery prior to or during the carrying away of the loot to a place of temporary safety.\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1158, 1165 [282 Cal.Rptr. 450, 811 P.2d 742], fn. &amp; italics omitted; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1169-1170.) As given here, CALCRIM No. 1603 correctly conveyed these legal principles with respect to the robbery charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Where the complicity of an aider and abettor in <em>felony murder </em>is concerned, however, different legal principles apply. In <em>People v. Pulido </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 713 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 625, 936 P.2d 1235] <em>(Pulido), </em>the California Supreme Court \u201caddress[ed] a question regarding the scope of complicity in robbery murder. If one person, acting alone, kills in the perpetration of a robbery, and another person <em>thereafter </em>aids and abets the robber in the asportation and securing of the property taken, is the second person guilty of first degree murder under section 189? [The court] conclude[d] the answer is no. Although the second person is an accomplice to robbery [citation], such participation in the robbery does not subject the accomplice to murder liability under section 189, because the killer and accomplice were not \u2018jointly engaged at the time of such killing\u2019 in a robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>[citation]; the killer, in other words, was not acting, at the time of the killing, in furtherance of a \u2018common\u2019 design to rob [citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 716.)<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In <em>Pulido, </em>the victim was shot in the head and died within seconds. <em>(Pulido, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 717.) The court thus had no occasion to clarify the law with respect to the situation present here, in which the act or acts causing death are separated by a significant period of time from the death itself.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Other opinions make it clear, however, that what matters for purposes of felony-murder liability has always been the time of commission of the acts that resulted in the victim\u2019s death, even if death did not immediately result. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Cavitt </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 187, 196 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 281, 91 P.3d 222]; <em>People v. Lewis </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 647 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 22 P.3d 392]; <em>People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 222 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365]; <em>People v. Ainsworth </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 984, 1016 [248 Cal.Rptr. 568, 755 P.2d 1017]; <em>People v. Celis </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 466, 473 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 139]; <em>People v. Esquivel </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1386, 1396 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 324].)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In the present case, if the prosecution\u2019s version of events was accepted, defendant was guilty of robbery and first degree felony murder. If the defense\u2019s version was accepted, however, at most defendant was guilty of robbery. In light of the foregoing, the omitted paragraph of CALCRIM No. 540B, quoted <em>ante, </em>was a correct statement of the law and was factually applicable to the present case. Although the record does not show defendant objected to its omission, we believe the trial court should have included it on its own motion, with a slight modification so that the final clause referred to the time the perpetrator (rather than the defendant) caused death.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u201cA trial court has a sua sponte duty to instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Marks </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1335, 1345 [248 Cal.Rptr. 874, 756 P.2d 260].) One of the Bench Notes following CALCRIM No. 540B advises that if there is evidence the defendant did not form the intent to commit the felony, or did not aid and abet the felony, until after the homicide, he or she is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>entitled <em>on request </em>to an instruction pinpointing the issue, and in such instances, the bracketed paragraph quoted <em>ante </em>should be given.  Such notes do not have the force of law, however. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fiore </em>(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1362, 1381 [174 Cal.Rptr.3d 806].) Moreover, in each of the cases cited as authority <em>(People v. Silva </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 345, 371 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 21 P.3d 769]; <em>People v. Hudson </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 121, 124-127 [287 P.2d 497]; see <em>People v. Turner </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 668, 691 [268 Cal.Rptr. 706, 789 P.2d 887]), the defendant was the actual killer. Even if it did not inspire confidence, defendant\u2019s testimony constitutes substantial evidence in support of a finding of robbery but not felony murder. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 713, 746 [244 Cal.Rptr. 867, 750 P.2d 741]; <em>People v. Mejia-Lenares </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1446 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 404].) Because the general instructions given by the court did not inform the jury that defendant had to have aided and abetted the robbery before the acts that resulted in Guadalupe\u2019s death in order to be found guilty of felony murder, the court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on the timing of defendant\u2019s intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Esquivel, </em>supra, 28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1399; see <em>People v. Riccardi </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 758, 837-838 [144 Cal.Rptr.3d 84, 281 P.3d 1]; <em>People v. D\u2019Arcy </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 257, 296-297 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 459, 226 P.3d 949]; <em>People v. Marks, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1345; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 430, 446-447 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Jurors were directed to consider the instructions together. As jurors are presumed to follow the instructions given by the court <em>(People v. Murtishaw </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1001, 1044 [258 Cal.Rptr. 821, 773 P.2d 172]), we presume they did so. Accordingly, we must assess the effect of the giving of CALCRIM No. 1603, which described the timing of an aider and abettor\u2019s formation of intent vis-a-vis robbery, with the truncated version of CALCRIM No. 540B, which omitted a description of the timing of an aider and abettor\u2019s formation of intent vis-a-vis felony murder. \u201cIn assessing a claim of instructional error or ambiguity, we consider the instructions as a whole to determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood the jury was misled. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tate </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 635, 696 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 156, 234 P.3d 428]; see <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire </em>(1991) 502 U.S. 62, 72-73 &amp; fn. 4 [116 L.Ed.2d 385, 112 S.Ct. 475]; <em>Boyde </em>v. <em>California </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 370, 380 [108 L.Ed.2d 316, 110 S.Ct. 1190].) We also consider the arguments of counsel in assessing the probable impact of the instruction or instructions on the jury. <em>(People v. Young </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1202 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 112, 105 P.3d 487]; see <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Angelone </em>(2000) 528 U.S. 225, 236 [145 L.Ed.2d <em>121, </em>120 S.Ct. 727].) We independently determine whether instructions correctly state the law. <em>(People v. Posey </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 193, 218 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 551, 82 P.3d 755].)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Taken together, CALCRIM Nos. 540B and 1603, as given in this case, permitted defendant to be found guilty of felony murder even if he did not aid and abet the robbery until after commission of the act that caused Guadalupe\u2019s death. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Instructional error affecting an element of the charged offense warrants reversal unless it is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1171; see <em>People v. Wilkins </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 333, 348-350 [153 Cal.Rptr.3d 519, 295 P.3d 903].) Likewise, when the jury is given the option of relying on two theories of guilt, one of which is legally correct but the other of which is legally incorrect, reversal is required unless the record demonstrates, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the verdict was actually based on a valid ground. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chun </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172, 1203 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 106, 203 P.3d 425]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiton </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116, 1129 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 847 P.2d 45]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 69 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 239 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512] &amp; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826, 834, fn. 3 [226 Cal.Rptr. 112, 718 P.2d 99]; see <em>Hedgpeth v. Pulido </em>(2008) 555 U.S. 57, 58 [172 L.Ed.2d 388, 129 S.Ct. 530]; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824].)<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In making this determination, we must consider what effect the error had upon the guilty verdict <em>in this case, </em>and so we must look \u201cto the basis on which \u2018the jury <em>actually rested </em>its verdict.\u2019 [Citation.] The inquiry, in other words, is not whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered, but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in <em>this </em>trial was surely unattributable to the error.\u201d <em>(Sullivan v. Louisiana </em>(1993) 508 U.S. 275, 279 [124 L.Ed.2d 182, 113 S.Ct. 2078]; see <em>People v. Esquivel, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1399-1400.) As the California Supreme Court has explained, <em>\u201cNeder </em>[v. <em>United States </em>(1999) 527 U.S. 1, 19 [144 L.Ed.2d 35, 119 S.Ct. 1827]] instructs us to \u2018conduct a thorough examination of the record. If, at the end of that examination, the court cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error ... it should not find the error harmless.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Mil </em>(2012) 53 Cal.4th 400, 417 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 339, 266 P.3d 1030].)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Error of the type present here may be found harmless where the jury resolved the issue against the defendant in another context, pursuant to other, properly given instructions. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Sakarias </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 596, 625 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 17, 995 P.2d 152]; <em>People v. Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, 628 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376]; <em>People v. Sanders </em>(1990) 51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Cal.3d 471, 509-510 [273 Cal.Rptr. 537, 797 P.2d 561].) The Attorney General urges us to use this means to find the error harmless in the present case. She says that taken together, the instructions on aiding and abetting, felony murder, and the special circumstance, and the jury\u2019s special circumstance finding, show the jury necessarily found defendant \u201chad pre-force joinder\u201d; hence, \u201c \u2018[t]he factual question posed by [giving the unmodified form of CALCRIM No. 1603 and deleting the bracketed language from CALCRIM No. 540B] was necessarily resolved adversely to defendant under other, properly given instructions.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pulido, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 726.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Pursuant to CALCRIM No. 401, jurors were instructed that \u201c[t]o prove that the defendant is guilty of a crime based on aiding and abetting that crime, the People must prove that: One, the perpetrator committed the crime; two, the defendant knew that the perpetrator intended to commit the crime; three, <em>before or during the commission of the crime, the defendant intended to aid and abet the perpetrator in committing the crime-, </em>and four, the defendant\u2019s words or conduct did, in fact, aid and abet the perpetrator\u2019s commission of the crime.\u201d (Italics added.) Since there was no evidence anyone intended to commit the crime of murder, the crime referred to in the instruction can only be robbery. Yet CALCRIM No. 1603 permitted jurors to find defendant aided and abetted robbery even if he did not form the intent to aid and abet until the asportation phase of the crime. CALCRIM No. 540B, the instruction on first degree felony murder, merely required that defendant have aided and abetted robbery, and that \u201cwhile committing robbery, the perpetrator caused the death of another person.\u201d Although the instruction went on to state, \u201cIt is not required that the person die immediately, as long as the cause of death and the felony are part of one continuous transaction,\u201d nothing in its language\u2014 particularly when considered with CALCRIM Nos. 401 and 1603\u2014required jurors to find defendant was aiding and abetting at the time of the. act causing death.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The special circumstance instructions similarly do not allow us to say the jury necessarily resolved the issue adversely to defendant.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> CALCRIM No. 703 required the People to prove, inter alia, that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s participation in the crime began before or during <em>the killing </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) CALCRIM No. 730 required the People to prove, inter alia, that \u201cif the defendant did not personally commit the robbery, then a perpetrator whom the defendant was aiding and abetting before or during <em>the killing </em>personally committed a robbery; ... the perpetrator did an act that caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>death of another person; [and] the act causing the death and the robbery were part of one continuous transaction . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Jurors were told that words and phrases not specifically defined in the instructions were to be applied \u201cusing their ordinary, everyday meanings.\u201d The ordinary definition of \u201ckill\u201d is \u201cto deprive of life : put to death : cause the death of.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Diet. (1986) p. 1242.) The common definition of \u201ckilling\u201d includes \u201cthe act of one that kills; <em>esp </em>: MURDER, HOMICIDE\u201d and \u201chaving the effect of killing : as . . . producing death.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In light of the variance among the everyday meanings of \u201ckilling,\u201d it is reasonably likely one or more jurors interpreted the instructions as requiring that defendant\u2019s participation/aiding and abetting precede <em>Guadalupe\u2019s death itself, </em>and not the act that caused her death.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Inclusion of the bracketed portion of CALCRIM No. 730 that informed jurors defendant must have aided and abetted before or at the time of the <em>act causing death </em>would have cured the problem (as would inclusion of that bracketed portion of CALCRIM No. 540B), because it would have clarified that the critical moment for felony-murder complicity was commission of the act causing death, and not death itself. Without that clarification, however, it cannot be determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the giving of CALCRIM No. 1603 in its unmodified form, together with omission of the bracketed language from CALCRIM No. 540B, did not contribute to defendant\u2019s conviction of first degree murder. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Swain </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 593, 607 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 909 P.2d 994].) Nor can we \u201cbe certain beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found defendant guilty of [first degree] murder had it been properly instructed.\u201d <em>(People v. Banks </em>(2014) 59 Cal.4th 1113, 1153 [176 Cal.Rptr.3d 185, 331 P.3d 1206], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 363, 391, fn. 3 [188 Cal.Rptr.3d 328, 349 P.3d 1028].) While there would have been sufficient evidence to support a finding defendant aided and abetted before or during commission of the act causing death, jurors could have believed defendant\u2019s claim he only realized Patterson might have committed a crime, and decided to help Patterson, during the asportation phase of the robbery. (See <em>People v. Haley </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 283, 310 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 877, 96 P.3d 170].) Stated another way, \u201cthe evidence and the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence ... do not prove [defendant aided and abetted before or during the act that caused death] so overwhelmingly that the jury could not have had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>reasonable doubt on the matter. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 44 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262]; see <em>People v. Riccardi, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at p. 839.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The arguments of counsel did nothing to lessen the prejudicial impact of the instructions. For instance, the prosecutor told the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u201cIn regards to Mr. McDonald, he is not alleged to be the actual perpetrator or the person who pulled the chain that [Guadalupe] was wearing that day. He is alleged to be what is called an aider and abettor. The difference is that he didn\u2019t pull the chain. As you see at the bottom [of the prosecutor\u2019s visual aid] they are both equally guilty. That is the only difference. He did not physically take that chain . . . but, because he was there to help, he was there to facilitate, he was there to encourage his gang buddy, he is equally guilty of robbery. <em>He\u2019s equally guilty of murder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u201cLet\u2019s start with the different types of criminal liability that can lead you to being guilty of murder. You are the killer. You directly commit. You shoot somebody. You stab somebody. You pull the chain on an old lady and she falls to the ground and dies 45 minutes later. You directly committed that murder. You are guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u201cIn this case that\u2019s Mr. Patterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u201cYou can also be guilty of murder based on aiding and abetting, what I just spoke about. You aided and abetted a robbery. Robbery is a violent primp. You knew about the intention. You either actually committed the robbery or you knew someone was going to commit a robbery and, <em>during the course of that robbery, </em>you helped them. <em>You are guilty of </em>murder.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The prosecutor also stated, with respect to the murder charge: \u201cYou\u2019re going to see aiding and abetting. . . . You have to have knowledge of the intent of the perpetrator to commit the crime before or during the commission of the crime. The defendant has to intend to aid or/and abet. That has to be the intent of Mr. McDonald in this case, <em>before or during the commission of that robbery </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) In addition, the prosecutor told jurors:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u201cOnce you have started to act or move towards a robbery, if death results, it\u2019s first-degree murder. The killer, again, is responsible for the killing. A co-felon, a co-participant, somebody aiding and abetting is also equally liable if they embarked on that robbery with that person. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">\u201cAgain, <em>robbery is a continuing crime. It is not over until you reach a place of safety, </em>as alleged in Count 2 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cAs to first-degree murder, Mr. McDonald is alleged to be an aider and abettor to the intended crime that he had knowledge of the intent of Mr. Patterson, that he had knowledge of the intent of Mr. Slaughter and, before or during <em>the commission of the crime, </em>he intended to aid and abet the perpetrator, again, Mr. Patterson. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u201cAgain, this jury instruction was read to you. You will have it in the back. I just put the pertinent portions down.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201cThe defendant either committed or aided and abetted a robbery. That\u2019s the first decision you have to make. If he committed or he aided and abetted the robbery, you move on from there. He intended to aid and abet the robbery, and <em>if, during the course of that robbery, before or during, somebody dies, he\u2019s guilty of murder under first-degree felony murder. </em>Those are the steps you take.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u201cYou decide first about robbery, you decide about his intention as to that robbery, <em>and then if [Guadalupe] died during the course of that robbery, Mr. McDonald is guilty of murder.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Defense counsel argued defendant was at most an accessory after the fact. She told the jurors:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u201cWhat\u2019s an aider and abettor? Well, let me give you three examples so that it hits home .... If Mr. McDonald and Mr. Patterson at the Haley apartments said to each other, \u2018Hey, you know what, why don\u2019t we walk across the street, look for some old women. Why don\u2019t you go ahead and, you know, scope out the store. I\u2019ll sit in the car and, when I see you run, I\u2019ll go ahead and, you know, meet you on Height and Gurley.\u2019 Okay. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s what Mr. Patterson does. [Guadalupe], we know, died. You better believe Mr. McDonald would be an aider and abettor, okay? And he would be guilty of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">\u201cNow let me give you a second scenario. Mr. McDonald is sitting in his car. He turns around and he sees Mr. Patterson pull the chain off [Guadalupe], and he had no idea . . . that Mr. Patterson was going to do that. He sees Mr. Patterson pull the chain, sees Mr. Patterson being chased right there, and says, oh, oh, I got to go help my gang buddy. Pulls back the car in the parking lot, says to Mr. Patterson, \u2018Hey, get in the car, okay? We\u2019re in this together. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019 Mr. McDonald would be an aider and abettor, <em>and you better believe he\u2019d be guilty of felony murder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">\u201cLet\u2019s take a third scenario. Mr. McDonald is sitting in his car. He has no idea what Mr. Patterson is about to do. Mr. Patterson gets out, commits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>robbery, starts to run through the parking lot. Mr. McDonald looks back and says, okay, something has happened, I don\u2019t know what. Is he mouthing off? Has he hit something? Has he stolen something? I have no idea. Pulls the car out; goes to Height and Gurley; is able to see where Mr. Patterson is; picks him up, okay? And at the moment Mr. Patterson gets in the car, doesn\u2019t know what has happened, drives on the horseshoe[-shaped portion of the street], and Mr. Patterson says, either on that street or the next street, . . . T pulled a chain from an old wom[a]n.\u2019 Is he an aider and abettor, Mr. McDonald? The answer to that is absolutely not. He is not an aider and abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u201cIs he guilty of something? You better believe that. What\u2019s he guilty of? He is guilty of being an accessory after the fact.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The instructions, taken as a whole, did not correctly state the law with respect to first degree felony-murder complicity of an aider and abettor. Neither attorney clarified the matter. The conviction on count 1 must be reversed, although it is supported by substantial evidence and so can be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In light of the fact we are reversing the murder conviction, we need not address defendant\u2019s further claim the trial court erred by failing to instruct on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense to felony murder.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> For guidance of the court and parties upon retrial, however, we observe that if the trial court again finds sufficient evidence to warrant the giving of instructions on grand theft as a lesser included offense of robbery, and on the natural and probable consequence theory of second degree murder with an underlying offense of robbery or grand theft, it should also instruct on involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> As defendant asserts, if the jury were to find defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>lacked the knowledge and intent necessary to convict him of aiding and abetting a robbery, but that he aided and abetted grand theft, it would follow that the jury could find second degree murder (based on the risk the victim of grand theft might die of a heart attack) was too remote to be considered a natural and probable consequence, but find involuntary manslaughter based on the fact the victim was killed in the commission of a felony that was not inherently dangerous.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">B. <em>CALCRIM No. 361</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">C. <em>Intent Required for Gang Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Pursuant to CALCRIM No. 1401, the trial court instructed the jury, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u201cIf you find the defendant guilty of the crimes charged in Counts 1, 2 and/or 4, you must then decide whether for each crime the People have proved the additional allegation that the defendant committed that crime for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang.. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u201cTo prove this allegation, the People must prove that: One, the defendant committed the crime for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang; and two, the defendant intended to assist, further or promote <em>criminal conduct by gang members.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Defendant now contends the instruction was erroneous because it failed to require a specific intent to benefit, further, or promote \u201c <em>\u2018the </em>gang.\u2019 \u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>misstatement of the intent element was prejudicial, he claims, because it allowed the jury to find the gang enhancement based on a specific intent to assist criminal conduct of certain gang members (specifically, Patterson and Slaughter) rather than the gang itself, and the prosecutor expressly urged the jury to construe the instruction in that manner.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We conclude the instruction correctly stated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">As previously stated, subdivision (b)(1) of section 186.22 prescribes imposition of enhanced punishment for \u201cany person who is convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, <em>with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> As given in defendant\u2019s case, CALCRIM No. 1401 essentially tracked the statutory language. The California Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he language of a statute defining a crime or defense is generally an appropriate and desirable basis for an instruction, and is ordinarily sufficient when the defendant fails to request amplification. If the jury would have no difficulty in understanding the statute without guidance, the court need do no more than instruct in statutory language.\u2019 [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u201cThe rule to be applied in determining whether the meaning of a statute is adequately conveyed by its express terms is well established. When a word or phrase \u2018 \u201cis commonly understood by those familiar with the English language and is not used in a technical sense peculiar to the law, the court is not required to give an instruction as to its meaning in the absence of a request.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] A word or phrase having a technical, legal meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>requiring clarification by the court is one that has a definition that <em>differs </em>from its nonlegal meaning. [Citation.] Thus, . . . terms are held to require clarification by the trial court when their statutory definition differs from the meaning that might be ascribed to the same terms in common parlance. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Estrada </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 568, 574-575 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 586, 904 P.2d 1197], citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u201cMember\u201d and \u201cmembership\u201d have been held to be terms of ordinary meaning that require no further definition. <em>(People v. Green </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 692, 699 [278 Cal.Rptr. 140], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castenada </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 743, 747-748, 752 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 906, 3 P.3d 278].) Defendant says, however, that where, as here, both the gang offense and the gang enhancement are at issue, so that the jury is instructed in the language of both CALCRIM Nos. 1400 (as to the substantive offense) and 1401 (as to the enhancement), a problem arises because the term \u201cgang members\u201d means one thing in CALCRIM No. 1400 and something else in CALCRIM No. 1401.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Defendant contends: \u201cIn CALCRIM No. 1400, the term \u2018members\u2019 refers to the individual gang members who act in concert with the defendant in the commission of a felony. In CALCRIM No. 1401, the term \u2018members\u2019 refers to the gang membership as a whole\u2014the entire gang\u2014rather than individual gang members.\u201d This being the case, his argument runs, the trial court had a sua sponte duty to define the term as used in CALCRIM No. 1401, and its failure to perform this duty resulted in the jury being misinstructed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In <em>Albillar, </em>the court, in an opinion written by Justice Baxter, addressed a case in which the defendants were convicted of forcible sex offenses while acting in concert, and active participation in a criminal street gang. The jury found true the gang enhancement allegation as to the sex offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Albillar </em>(2010) 51 Cal.4th 47, 50 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 415, 244 P.3d 1062] <em>(Albillar).) </em>With respect to the gang offense, the high court considered-\u2014and rejected\u2014\u201cthe argument that the phrase \u2018any felonious criminal conduct\u2019 in section 186.22[, subdivision ](a) refers only to gang-related felonious criminal conduct . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">With respect to the gang enhancement, one or more defendants contended (1) there was no evidence the sex offenses were committed for the benefit of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>at the direction of, or in association with their gang; (2) there was no evidence the sex offenses were committed with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist <em>other </em>criminal conduct by gang members; and (3) there was no evidence the sex offenses were committed with the specific intent to facilitate criminal conduct by <em>the gang. </em>The court determined none of the contentions had merit. <em>(Albillar, supra, </em>51 Cal.4th at p. 59.) With respect to the defendants\u2019 third claim\u2014the one that concerns us in the present case\u2014the high court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u201c[An analysis similar to that by which the court rejected the defendants\u2019 second claim] disposes of the related argument. . ., that section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l) requires the specific intent to promote, further, or assist a <em>gang-related, </em>crime. The enhancement already requires proof that the defendant commit a gang-related crime in the first prong\u2014i.e., that the defendant be convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang. [Citation.] There is no further requirement that the defendant act with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist a <em>gang', </em>the statute requires only the specific intent to promote, further, or assist criminal conduct by <em>gang members. </em>[Citations.] [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u201cWe also reject the argument . . . , that the constitutional requirement of personal guilt would compel the inclusion in the enhancement of a specific intent to aid the <em>gang. </em>The claim is specious. The enhancement set forth in section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l) does not pose a risk of conviction for mere nominal or passive involvement with a gang. Indeed, it does not depend on membership in a gang at all. Rather, it applies when a defendant has personally committed a gang-related felony with the specific intent to aid members of that gang. Defendants cite no authority to suggest that this would run afoul of <em>Scales v. United States </em>[(1961)] 367 U.S. 203 [6 L.Ed.2d 782, 81 S.Ct. 1469], which upheld a statute criminalizing active membership in an organization that advocates the overthrow of the federal government by force or violence even in the <em>absence </em>of a specific act of criminality. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u201cIn sum, <em>if substantial evidence establishes that the defendant intended to and did commit the charged felony with known members of a gang, the jury may fairly infer that the defendant had the specific intent to promote, further, or assist criminal conduct by those gang members. </em>Here, there was ample evidence that defendants intended to attack [the victim], that they assisted each other in raping her, and that they were each members of the criminal street gang. Accordingly, there was substantial evidence that defendants acted with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist gang members in that criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(Albillar, supra, </em>51 Cal.4th at pp. 67-68, last italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The <em>Albillar </em>opinion was unanimous with respect to its discussion of section 186.22, subdivision (a) and the second prong (specific intent) of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1).<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We do not believe the foregoing italicized language could be clearer. Nevertheless, defendant takes the view that the California Supreme Court\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 1125 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 533, 290 P.3d 1143] <em>(Rodriguez) </em>altered its pronouncement in <em>Albillar. </em>Defendant reads too much into <em>Rodriguez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th 1125, the issue was whether <em>the substantive gang offense </em>could be violated by a gang member acting alone to commit a felony. A majority of the court held it could not. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1128 (lead opn. of Corrigan, J.); see <em>id. </em>at p. 1139 (cone. opn. of Baxter, J.).) In so ruling, the lead opinion found it \u201csignificant that the offense requires a defendant to promote, further, or assist <em>members </em>of the gang.\u201d <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>at p. 1131 (lead opn. of Corrigan, J.).) Justice Corrigan explained: \u201cSection 186.22[, subdivision ](a) speaks of \u2018criminal conduct by <em>members </em>of that gang.\u2019 (Italics added.) \u2018[Members\u2019 is a plural noun. The words \u2018promotes, furthers, or assists\u2019 are the verbs describing the defendant\u2019s acts, which must be performed willfully. The phrase \u2018any felonious criminal conduct\u2019 is the direct object of these verbs. The prepositional phrase \u2018by members of that gang\u2019 indicates who performs the felonious criminal conduct. Therefore, to satisfy the third element, a defendant must willfully advance, encourage, contribute to, or help <em>members </em>of his gang commit felonious criminal conduct. The plain meaning of section 186.22[, subdivision ](a) requires that felonious criminal conduct be committed by at least two gang members, one of whom can include the defendant if he is a gang member. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1132 (lead opn. of Corrigan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Defendant points to the fact that at times, the lead opinion in <em>Rodriguez </em>speaks, with reference to the gang enhancement, in terms of specific intent to promote, etc., <em>the gang. </em>For instance, during a discussion of the constitutional concerns raised by <em>Scales </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>367 U.S. 203, <em>Rodriguez </em>states: \u201cIt is established, then, that one need not have the specific intent to promote, further, or benefit <em>the gang </em>to violate section 186.22[, subdivision ](a), nor must one commit a gang-related felony.\u201d <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 1135 (lead opn. of Corrigan, J.), italics added.) The opinion also states: \u201cSection 186.22[, subdivision ](a) and section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l) strike at different things. The enhancement under section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l) punishes gang-related conduct, i.e., felonies committed with the specific intent to benefit, further, or promote <em>the gang. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1138 (lead opn. of Corrigan, J.), italics added.) And: \u201c[0]ur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>conclusion does not lead to absurd results. A lone gang member who commits a felony will not go unpunished; he or she will be convicted of the underlying felony. Further, such a gang member would not be protected from having that felony enhanced by section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l) .... Because the gang, enhancement under section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l) requires both that the felony be gang related and that the defendant act with a specific intent to promote, further, or assist <em>the gang, </em>these requirements provide a nexus to gang activity sufficient to alleviate due process concerns. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1138-1139 (lead opn. of Corrigan, J.), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Defendant also points to Justice Baxter\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Rodriguez. </em>Basing his conclusion \u201csolely on the plain meaning of the express statutory language\u201d and finding \u201cno need to consider the constitutional implications of a contrary construction,\u201d Justice Baxter determined that \u201cthe gang offense requires felonious criminal conduct committed by at least two \u2018[gang] members,\u2019 including any defendant who is a member of \u2018that gang.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Rod<em>riguez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 1140 (cone. opn. of Baxter, J.).) Justice Baxter further wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u201cI recognize, of course, that a seemingly similar reference to gang \u2018members\u2019 appears in both section 186.22[, subdivision ](a) and section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l). However, small but significant differences in grammar and context make clear that the enhancement provision lacks the same multiple-actor condition as the gang offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u201cFirst, section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l), unlike section 186.22[, subdivision ](a), applies where the defendant, even if acting alone, \u2018specifically] inten[ds]\u2019 by his felonious action to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members. Section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l)\u2019s reference to promoting, furthering, or assisting gang members thus merely describes a culpable mental state. By contrast, the gravamen of section 186.22[, subdivision ](a) is that the defendant\u2019s own criminal conduct must itself directly promote, further, or assist felonious criminal conduct by members of the gang. Thus, section 186.22[, subdivision ](a) implies joint criminal action with other gang members\u2014an implication that does not necessarily arise in section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l). <em>This difference suggests we need not construe gang \u2018members\u2019 in each provision the same way.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u201cThe relevant two subdivisions also treat criminal conduct by gang \u2018members\u2019 differently. As noted, section 186.22[, subdivision ](a) plainly requires felonious criminal conduct committed in tandem by at least two gang members, one of whom may be the defendant. In contrast, nothing in section 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l) states or implies that the criminal conduct by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>gang members which the defendant intends to promote, further, or assist is the same criminal conduct underlying the felony conviction subject to enhancement. For this reason too, the direct and specific link between criminal conduct committed by the defendant and that committed by other gang members set forth in the gang offense [citation] is not present in the gang enhancement [citation].</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u201cAccordingly, I agree with Justice Corrigan that the gang offense . . . , unlike the gang enhancement. . . , does not extend to defendants who commit the requisite criminal conduct on their own.\u201d <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at pp. 1140-1141 (cone. opn. of Baxter, J.), italics added &amp; omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u201cThe discussion in an appellate decision is directed to the issue presented.\u201d <em>(People v. Colantuono </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 206, 221, fn. 13 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 908, 865 P.2d 704].) The issue presented in <em>Rodriguez </em>was whether a gang member acting alone could violate subdivision (a) of section 186.22. The italicized portions of the lead and concurring opinions must be read in light of that issue. We will not conclude an opinion addressing an issue specifically and solely related to section 186.22, subdivision (a) sub silentio overruled or significantly altered by an opinion directly addressing and explaining different language contained solely in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1), particularly when, as in <em>Rodriguez, </em>the opinion mentions the language of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) only in context of its discussion of section 186.22, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Defendant points to <em>People v. Rios </em>(2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 542 [165 Cal.Rptr.3d 687] <em>(Rios), </em>in which the Court of Appeal concluded \u201cthat the holding in Rodriguez\u2014that a lone actor cannot violate section 186.22, subdivision (a)\u2014does not apply to the separate enhancement set forth in section 186.22, subdivision (b), which enhances punishment when a defendant is found, among other things, to have acted with the specific intent to further, promote or assist in criminal conduct by gang members.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 546.) Defendant says a holding under subdivision (b) of section 186.22 \u201c[can] apply to a lone actor . . . means that the specific intent element cannot refer to the intent to assist a gang-member accomplice (because a lone actor has no accomplice). Instead, the defendant must have the specific intent to promote, further, or assist criminal conduct by \u2018gang members\u2019 [as] a whole, or in other words, must have the specific intent to promote, further, or assist \u2018the gang.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">We do not believe <em>Rios </em>assists defendant. Subdivision (b)(1) of section 186.22 requires a specific intent \u201cto promote, further, or assist <em>in any criminal conduct by gang members.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) As Justice Baxter noted in his concurring opinion in <em>Rodriguez, </em>\u201cnothing in [that subdivision] states or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>implies that the criminal conduct by gang members which the defendant intends to promote, further, or assist <em>is the same criminal conduct </em>underlying the felony conviction subject to enhancement.\u201d <em>(Rodriguez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 1141 (cone. opn. of Baxter, J.).) But as Justice Baxter observed in his majority opinion in <em>Albillar, </em>\u201csection 186.22[, subdivision ](b)(l) encompasses the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in <em>any </em>criminal conduct by gang members\u2014including the current offenses . . . .\u201d <em>(Albillar, supra, </em>51 Cal.4th at p. 65.) He also wrote about the gang enhancement; \u201cThere is no further requirement that the defendant act with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist a <em>gang-, </em>the statute requires only the specific intent to promote, further, or assist criminal conduct by <em>gang members. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 67.) As we previously pointed out, under <em>Albillar, </em>\u201cif substantial evidence establishes that the defendant <em>intended to </em>and did commit the charged felony <em>with known members of a gang, </em>the jury may fairly infer that the defendant had the specific intent to promote, further, or assist criminal conduct <em>by those gang members, \u201d </em>as required for the gang enhancement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 68, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Although <em>Albillar </em>concerned the sufficiency of evidence to uphold a gang enhancement finding, CALCRIM No. 1401, as given in the present case, correctly stated the applicable law set out in that case, as did the prosecutor\u2019s related argument to the jury. Nothing in <em>Rodriguez </em>suggests any change in <em>Albillar\u2019s </em>interpretation of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendant\u2019s jury was not misinstructed on the gang enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">D. <em>CALCRIM No. 1400</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The convictions on counts 2, 3, and 4; the Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (b) enhancement on count 2; and the prior strike and prison term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>enhancements are affirmed.
