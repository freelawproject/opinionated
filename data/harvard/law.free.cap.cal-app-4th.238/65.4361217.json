Costco withheld federal and state payroll taxes from the award. Cifuentes claimed the judgment was not satisfied, citing the decision in <em>Lisec v. United Airlines, Inc. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1507 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 689] <em>(Lisec), </em>that an employer is not required to withhold payroll taxes from an award of lost wages to a former employee. Believing it was bound by <em>Lisec, </em>the trial court ruled the withholding was improper and denied Costco\u2019s motion for acknowledgment of satisfaction of the judgment. We conclude this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">In the 23 years since <em>Lisec, </em>the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the vast majority of federal appellate courts have broadly interpreted the applicable Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions as requiring an employer to withhold payroll taxes for all \u201cwages\u201d arising from the employer-employee relationship, even after that relationship has terminated. Persuaded by these authorities, we adopt this prevailing view and conclude Costco properly withheld the payroll taxes. The judgment having been satisfied, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">While employed by Costco, Cifuentes observed a front-end manager hugging a female employee outside the store. He reported the incident to a supervisor. Six months later, the front-end manager reported seeing Cifuentes surreptitiously sip three ounces of a beverage sold by Costco. Costco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>terminated Cifuentes\u2019s employment for violating its policy against \u201cgrazing,\u201d i.e., consuming food merchandise without payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Cifuentes filed a wrongful termination complaint alleging contract claims against Costco and tort claims against Costco and three of its managers. The trial court summarily adjudicated the tort claims in the defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Cifuentes prevailed at trial on his breach of contract claim. The jury awarded him $28,125 in \u201cpast wage loss\u201d and $273,253 in \u201cfuture wage loss.\u201d With costs and interest, the judgment totaled $325,692.07. Cifuentes appealed the portion of the judgment summarily adjudicating the tort claims in favor of Costco and its managers. We affirmed. <em>(Cifuentes v. Costco Wholesale Corp. </em>(My 10, 2012, B231684) [nonpub. opn.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">When Costco paid the judgment, it withheld $116,150.84 in payroll taxes from the $301,378 attributed to lost wages. The taxes included Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 et seq.) contributions, federal and state income taxes and state disability insurance. Maintaining it was required by law to withhold the taxes, Costco informed Cifuentes it had fully satisfied the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Initially, Cifuentes claimed that postjudgment interest of $274.53 was still owed. Costco disputed this, but paid the $274.53 and demanded that Cifuentes acknowledge full satisfaction of the judgment. Cifuentes again declined, pointing to the Sixth Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>Lisec, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at page 1507, that an award of lost wages to a former employee is not subject to withholding. He asserted Costco should have paid him the full judgment amount, issued a 1099 tax form for the lost wages and allowed him to pay any taxes due directly to the taxing authorities. Cifuentes filed an acknowledgment of partial satisfaction in the amount of $209,898.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">In a series of letters, the parties disputed whether <em>Lisec </em>was controlling. Costco cited a number of contrary IRS and federal case authorities and highlighted the admonishment in a respected California practice guide that \u201c[ejmployers should not rely on <em>Lisec, </em>supra. The opinion does not cite or mention contrary federal cases on what is basically an issue of federal tax law.\u201d (Chin et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Employment Litigation (The Rutter Group 2014) \u00b6 17:897, p. 17-169 (Cal. Rutter Employment Guide); accord, Rosen et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Federal Employment Litigation (The Rutter Group 2015) \u00b6 11:897, p. 11-110 (Fed. Rutter Employment Guide).) Costco further noted that Cifuentes\u2019s own financial expert, Pamela Allman, testified that any compensation for \u201clost past or future wages\u201d would be \u201csubject to payroll taxes,\u201d including \u201cSocial Security, Medicare, [and s]tate disability insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The impasse remained until Cifuentes received $69,078 in tax refunds from the IRS and California\u2019s Franchise Tax Board. Costco again demanded he acknowledge satisfaction of the judgment. Cifuentes refused, claiming he was still owed $23,764.95 plus interest. Costco moved for an acknowledgement of satisfaction of judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 724.050<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and requested $20,060 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Citing a number of federal appellate decisions, IRS authorities and treatises, Costco argued <em>Lisec </em>was wrongly decided and that prevailing law supported the withholding. The trial court acknowledged that \u201c[mjuch of what Costco argues is compelling,\u201d and stated that \u201c[i]f the court were to rule on this issue in the first instance, it might be inclined to rule in Costco\u2019s favor.\u201d Suggesting \u201cthe issue may need to be decided by a higher court,\u201d the court determined it had no choice but to follow <em>Lisec </em>as the only California appellate decision on point and consequently denied the motion. It found Costco still owes Cifuentes the $9,975.37 withheld for FICA and state disability insurance, plus interest on that sum and \u201cpossibly\u201d on the income tax withholdings that eventually were refunded. The court questioned whether interest is due on the amounts withheld for income taxes actually owed, but concluded \u201c[i]n any event, the judgment has not been fully satisfied.\u201d It denied Cifuentes\u2019s request for $2,880 in attorney fees based on his failure to submit a declaration providing evidence of those fees. Costco appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The principal issue on appeal is whether an employer is required to withhold payroll taxes when paying a judgment to a former employee for \u201clost past wages\u201d (backpay) and \u201clost future wages\u201d (front pay). Backpay is the amount of wages the employee would have earned from the date of termination up to the time of the court award or settlement but for the employer\u2019s misconduct. <em>(Noel v. New York State Office of Mental Health Central New York Psychiatric Center </em>(2d Cir. 2012) 697 F.3d 209, 213 <em>(Noel).) </em>Front pay is \u201cmoney awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement.\u201d <em>(Pollard v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>(2001) 532 U.S. 843, 846 [150 L.Ed.2d 62, 121 S.Ct. 1946].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Costco contends the award of backpay and front pay to Cifuentes constituted \u201cwages\u201d under the applicable federal and state tax laws and, as such, was subject to mandatory withholding. It claims that if it had paid the judgment without deducting the taxes, it could have been held personally liable for them. Cifuentes responds that under <em>Lisec, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>1507, the judgment must be satisfied in the amount as written. He concedes the award was taxable to him as income, but maintains the withholding was unlawful because the award was not remuneration for services performed by him on Costco\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The trial court determined it was bound by <em>Lisec </em>under principles of stare decisis. <em>(See Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) Although we review the decision of a sister court with respect, if we disagree with its conclusion, we are not so bound. <em>(Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. County of Santa Clara </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 480, 485 [231 Cal.Rptr. 702]; see <em>In re Jaime P. </em>(2006) 40 Cal.4th 128, 133 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 430, 146 P.3d 965] [\u201c[R]eexamination of precedent may become necessary when subsequent developments indicate an earlier decision was unsound, or has become ripe for reconsideration.\u201d].) Our review of current IRS and federal decisional authorities persuades us that an employer who fails to withhold payroll taxes from an award of back or front pay to a former employee exposes itself to penalties and personal liability for those taxes. We therefore decline to follow <em>Lisec </em>and adopt instead the prevailing federal view.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">We review de novo the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the meaning and scope of federal statutory law. <em>(Kanter v. Warner-Lambert Co. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 780, 789 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 72].) If the United States Supreme Court has not provided guidance on an issue of federal law and there is a division of opinion or conflict among the federal courts, state courts may make an independent determination of federal law. <em>(Alicia T. v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 869, 879 [271 Cal.Rptr. 513].) The decisions of the federal appellate and district courts are accorded great weight, though they are not binding. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\n<em>Pre-1993 Interpretation of Applicable Tax Laws</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The IRC requires employers to collect income and FICA taxes by withholding them from wages paid to employees. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3102(a), 3402(a)(1); <em>Maxfield v. United States Postal Service </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 752 F.2d 433, 434.) California law similarly requires employers to withhold state income and disability insurance taxes. (Unemp. Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13020, subd. (a)(1), 986.) An employer who fails to withhold such taxes may be held liable for those taxes plus penalties and interest. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3102(b), 3403, 6651; Unemp. Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 987, 1112, 1113, 1127, 13070.) The failure to withhold taxes also is punishable as a crime. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7202 [felony]; Unemp. Ins. Code, \u00a7 2118 [misdemeanor].) In addition, even if the tax is later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>paid, an employer who fails to withhold is subject to liability for penalties and other statutory additions. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402(d); see <em>Cheetham v. CSX Transportation </em>(M.D.Fla., Feb. 13, 2012, No. 3:06-cv-704-PAM-TEM) 2012 WL 1424168, p. *8 <em>(Cheetham).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The IRC and the Unemployment Insurance Code define \u201cwages\u201d for income tax withholding purposes as \u201call remuneration ... for services performed by an employee for his [or her] employer.\u201d (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(a); Unemp. Ins. Code, \u00a7 13009.) The IRC describes \u201cwages\u201d for FICA (Social Security and Medicare) withholding as \u201call remuneration for employment,\u201d and defines \u201cemployment\u201d as \u201cany service, of whatever nature, performed . . . by an employee for the person employing him.\u201d (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(a), (b).) Given the similarity in the statutory definitions of \u201cwages,\u201d they are interpreted in the same manner. <em>(Rowan Cos. v. United States </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 247, 257 [68 L.Ed.2d 814, 101 S.Ct. 2288] [tax statutes favor consistent definition of wages for both FICA and income tax withholding purposes]; see <em>J. H. McKnight Ranch, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 978, 984, fn. 1 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 339].) When federal and state tax statutes are identical, as they are here, federal decisions are particularly compelling in interpreting state tax law. <em>(Estate of Darby </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 96, 100 [208 P.2d 689]; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1942) 48 Cal.App.2d 835, 838 [120 P.2d 927].)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>Social Security Board v. Nierotko </em>(1946) 327 U.S. 358 [90 L.Ed. 718, 66 S.Ct. 637] <em>(Nierotko) </em>considered whether an award of backpay to a wrongfully terminated employee constitutes wages for Social Security purposes. The employee was reinstated and awarded pay for the period he was not employed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 359-360.) The United States Supreme Court held the award constituted \u201cwages under the Social Security Act definitions which define wages as \u2018remuneration for employment\u2019 and employment as \u2018any service . . . performed ... by an employee for his employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 364; see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(a), (b).) The court rejected the argument the award did not qualify as wages because no services had been performed. It explained that \u201cwages\u201d and \u201cemployment\u201d should be interpreted broadly: \u201cThe very words \u2018any service . . . performed ... for his employer,\u2019 with the purpose of the Social Security Act in mind, <em>import breadth of coverage. </em>They admonish us against holding that \u2018service\u2019 can be only productive activity. We think that \u2018service\u2019 as used by Congress in this definitive phrase means not only work actually done but the entire employer-employee relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the employer.\u201d <em>(Nierotko, </em>at pp. 365-366, italics added, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Emphasizing <em>Nierotko\u2019&amp; </em>broad construction of \u201cwages,\u201d the federal court of claims similarly approved the deduction of FICA taxes from an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>backpay to an employee who was wrongfully terminated and then reinstated to his position. <em>(Ainsworth v. U.S. </em>(Ct.Cl. 1968) 399 F.2d 176, 185-186 [185 Ct.Cl. 110], superseded by statute on other grounds in <em>Markey v. U.S. </em>(Fed.Cl. 1993) 27 Fed.Cl. 615, 627.) Because the employee had been reinstated, the court found it unnecessary to address the \u201cproblems which may arise if an employee is not reinstated at any time.\u201d <em>(Ainsworth, </em>at p. 183.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In 1972, the IRS ruled that a payment of three weeks\u2019 pay to a discharged employee in settlement of a discrimination claim constituted wages for purposes of FICA and income tax withholding. (Rev. Rul. 72-572, 1972-2 C.B. 535.) It noted that under the applicable employment tax regulations, remuneration for employment constitutes wages even though the individual is no longer an employee at the time paid, and \u201cfor purposes of income tax withholding, that all payments made by an employee on account of dismissal, that is, involuntary separation from the service of the employer, constitute \u2018wages\u2019 regardless of whether the employer is legally bound by contract, statute, or otherwise to make the payments.\u201d (Ibid., citing 26 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 31.3121(a)-l(b), (i), 31.3306(b)-l(i), 31.3401(a)-l(a)(5) (1972).)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">When <em>Lisec </em>came before the court in 1992, there was little additional decisional guidance on the scope of \u201cwages\u201d as defined in the tax statutes. The plaintiffs, who had prevailed on their wrongful termination claim, obtained an award of contract damages that included backpay and front pay. <em>(Lisec, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1501-1502, 1504.) Their former employer withheld payroll taxes, claiming the award constituted wages under federal and state law. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1501-1502.) When the plaintiffs maintained the judgment was not satisfied, the employer moved for an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment, as permitted by section 724.050.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion, finding the employer lacked statutory authority to unilaterally reduce the judgment by withholding taxes. <em>(Lisec, </em>at pp. 1503, 1507-1508.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In affirming the decision, the Court of Appeal distinguished <em>Nierotko </em>and <em>Ainsworth </em>on the basis that the employees in those cases were reinstated. <em>(Lisec, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 1507.) It observed the damages awarded to the plaintiffs did not redress deprivation of compensation earned or due for services already performed within the context of an ongoing employment relationship. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the absence of such a relationship, the court held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>award did not constitute remuneration for services performed, and thus was not wages for purposes of withholding. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\n<em>Post-bisec Interpretation of Applicable Tax Laws</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In the years since <em>Lisec, </em>numerous federal courts have considered whether an award of backpay or front pay to a non-reinstated employee is subject to income/FICA taxation and withholding. With the exception of the Fifth Circuit (see <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(5th Cir. 1996) 87 F.3d 682, 690), federal appellate courts have adopted <em>Nierotko\u2019s </em>broad interpretation of \u201cwages\u201d for taxation and withholding purposes. In <em>Gerbec v. U.S. </em>(6th Cir. 1999) 164 F.3d 1015, 1026 <em>(Gerbec), </em>the Sixth Circuit concluded that a portion of a settlement award of back and front pay in a class action brought by former employees of Continental Can Company (Continental) was subject to both income and FICA taxes. It explained: \u201cThe phrase \u2018remuneration for employment\u2019 as it appears in [IRC] \u00a7 3121 should be interpreted broadly. [Citations.] We hold that the phrase \u2018remuneration for employment\u2019 includes certain compensation in the employer-employee relationship for which no actual services were performed. . . . The holding in <em>Nierotko </em>clearly supports the conclusion that awards representing a loss in wages, both back wages and future wages, that otherwise would have been paid, reflect compensation paid to the employee because of the employer-employee relationship, regardless of whether the employee actually worked during the time period in question.\u201d <em>(Gerbec, </em>at p. 1026, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The Fourth and Eighth Circuits reached the same conclusion in two other Continental settlement cases. <em>(Mayberry v. U.S. </em>(8th Cir. 1998) 151 F.3d 855, 860 <em>(Mayberry); Hemelt v. U.S. </em>(4th Cir. 1997) 122 F.3d 204, 209 <em>(Hemelt).) </em>They, along with <em>Gerbec, </em>rejected <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>U.S., supra, </em>87 F.3d at page 690, an earlier Continental settlement case which held that front pay was not subject to wage taxation because it was not for \u201c \u2018services already performed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gerbec, supra, </em>164 F.3d at p. 1026, fn. 15; see <em>Mayberry, </em>at p. 858; <em>Hemelt, </em>at pp. 207, 210; see also <em>Noel, supra, </em>697 F.3d at p. 213, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In <em>Rivera v. Baker West, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 430 F.3d 1253, 1259 <em>(Rivera), </em>the Ninth Circuit concluded that payroll taxes had to be withheld from an award of lost wages arising from settlement of a wrongful termination claim. Citing <em>Gerbec, Hemelt </em>and <em>Mayberry, </em>the court determined that even though the plaintiff was no longer employed, his claim arose from the employer-employee relationship, and that it would be improper to exempt him from tax withholding merely because the payment was not in return for actual services performed. <em>(Rivera, </em>at pp. 1259-1260; see <em>Gerbec, supra, </em>164 F.3d at p. 1026; 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3121(a)-l(i) (2015).) It emphasized that the employer could have been held liable to the taxing authorities for failing to withhold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the requisite taxes and that the plaintiff could seek a refund for any excess withholding. <em>(Rivera, </em>at pp. 1259-1260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Cifuentes contends these cases are distinguishable because they involved a settlement of claims, rather than an adjudicated award of lost wages. It is well established, however, that \u201cwhether a claim is resolved through litigation or settlement, the nature of the underlying action determines the tax consequences of the resolution of the claim.\u201d <em>(Tribune Pub. Co. v. U.S. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 836 F.2d 1176, 1177; see <em>Sager Glove Corp. v. Commissioner </em>(1961) 36 T.C. 1173, 1180 [\u201cThe taxability of the proceeds of a lawsuit, or of a sum received in settlement thereof, depends upon the nature of the claim and the actual basis of recovery.\u201d], affd. (7th Cir. 1962) 311 F.2d 210.) Cifuentes cites no case law suggesting an award of back or front pay for breach of an employment contract should be treated differently for tax purposes because it arose from a judgment rather than a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Noel </em>illustrates this point. A jury awarded the plaintiff backpay and front pay as damages for wrongful termination. <em>(Noel, supra, </em>697 F.3d at pp. 211-212.) The former employer withheld federal and state payroll taxes on both sums. As in this case, the trial court determined the judgment was not satisfied. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 212.) The IRS maintained in amicus curiae briefing that the decision unfairly \u201c \u2018penalize[d] the [employer] for fulfilling its legal duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Second Circuit agreed, having \u201clittle difficulty in concluding that both back pay and front pay are \u2018wages\u2019 as defined by the [IRC].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 213, fn. omitted.) Noting that both are \u201cremuneration paid to an employee to compensate for what he would have earned had he not been the victim of [his employer\u2019s unlawful conduct],\u201d the court joined the First, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits in concluding \u201cthat awards of back and front pay constitute \u2018wages\u2019 subject to statutory withholding.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 214 &amp; fn. 4; see <em>Gerstenbluth v. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC </em>(2d Cir. 2013) 728 F.3d 139, 144, 147 [reiterating <em>Noel\u2019s </em>holding that front and backpay awards are wages subject to FICA taxes]; see also <em>Ramos v.

Although the 2012 version did cite <em>Lisec </em>for the proposition that an employer may not withhold sums for income and FICA taxes from backpay awarded as part of a judgment, the treatise 'subsequently was revised to clarify that \u201cemployers may be required to withhold and report the taxable amount . . . .\u201d (Fed. Rutter Employment Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 11:200, p. 11-26, citation omitted.) Paragraph 11:898 now states that \u201c[a]ny part of a settlement or judgment that is considered compensation for lost income (i.e., backpay, severance, front pay, unpaid overtime compensation) constitutes \u2018wages\u2019 and is subject to tax withholding.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 11:898, p. 11\u2014111, citing <em>Gerbec, supra, </em>164 F.3d at p. 1026.) The treatise further warns employers not to rely on <em>Lisec </em>because it \u201cdoes not cite or mention contrary federal cases on what is basically an issue of federal tax law.\u201d (Fed. Rutter Employment Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 11:897, p. 11-110; accord, Cal. Rutter Employment Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 17:897, p. 17169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Nor are we persuaded by <em>Newhouse </em>v. <em>McCormick &amp; Co. </em>(8th Cir. 1998) 157 F.3d 582, in which the defendant declined to employ the plaintiff after discriminating against him during the hiring process. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 583-584.) The court held the jury\u2019s award of damages was not subject to withholding because no \u201ccurrent or previous employer-employee relationship existed between [the parties] that would justify [the defendant] in withholding payroll taxes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 585.) Here, the parties\u2019 previous employer-employee relationship is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">We recognize that at least one federal district court and two state courts have relied on <em>Lisec </em>to hold that awards of lost wages to former employees are not subject to withholding. (See <em>Churchill v. Star Enterprises </em>(E.D.Pa. 1998) 3 F.Supp.2d 622, 624-625; <em>Arkansas Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services </em>v. <em>Storey </em>(2007) 372 Ark. 23, 31 [269 S.W.3d 803, 808]; <em>Sang-Hoon Kim </em>v. <em>Monmouth College </em>(1998) 320 N.J. Super.Ct. Law Div. 157, 161-162 [726 A.2d 1017, 1019].) But these cases represent a dwindling minority view. As with <em>Lisec, </em>courts have called <em>Churchill </em>and <em>Kim </em>into doubt based on their restrictive interpretation of <em>Nierotko. </em>(E.g., <em>Cheetham, supra, </em>2012 WL 1424168 at p. <em>*6 [.Nierotko </em>\u201chas expressly rejected the idea that the determination of whether taxes must be withheld from a damages award depends upon whether services were actually performed by the employee\u201d]; <em>Amalgamated Transit Union Local 880 v. NJ Transit Bus Operations, Inc. </em>(2006) 385 N.J. Super.Ct.App.Div. 298 [897 A.2d 357, 361] [\u201c \u2018To the extent that <em>Kim, </em>in <em>dicta, </em>suggests that back pay covering a period when the employee performs no actual services is not considered wages and is thus not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>subject to employment taxes, <em>Kim </em>conflicts with . . . <em>Nierotko . </em>. . and is contrary to every Circuit that has considered the issue . . . .\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Josifovich </em>v. <em>Secure Computing Corp. </em>(D.N.J., July 31, 2009, No. 07-5469 (FLW)) 2009 WL 2390611, p. *4 [same].) Likewise, <em>Storey </em>has been criticized for \u201cconflicting] with an abundance of federal case law\u201d and for leaving employers \u201cto wonder when exactly it is appropriate to withhold taxes from an award of back pay or settlement of an employment-related claim.\u201d (Dobson &amp; Loftis, <em>Not All Back Pay is Created Equal: The Arkansas Supreme Court Holds Employers Cannot Withhold Taxes on Back Pay Awards </em>(Fall 2010) 45 Ark. Lawyer 16, 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\n<em>Costco\u2019s Withholding of Payroll Taxes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">When Costco paid the judgment, it had two alternatives. It could follow <em>Lisec </em>and risk liability to the IRS and other taxing authorities for the amount of tax it failed to withhold plus penalties. Or it could follow the prevailing federal view and risk a judicial declaration that the judgment is not satisfied. We conclude it chose correctly. Costco\u2019s potential exposure for failing to withhold the payroll taxes outweighed the inconvenience to Cifuentes of seeking a refund for the excess withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Under prevailing federal decisional law, an award of back or front pay arises from the employer-employee relationship, and therefore qualifies as wages, even though the plaintiff is no longer employed and the award is not for actual services performed. (E.g., <em>Gerbec, supra, </em>164 F.3d at p. 1026; <em>Rivera, supra, </em>430 F.3d at p. 1260; <em>Noel, supra, </em>697 F.3d at pp. 213-214.) Consistent with this view, the IRS\u2019s position is that judgment and settlement payments for backpay and front pay (other than lost wages on account of personal injury or sickness) are subject to income and FICA tax withholding and are reportable as wages on a form W-2, rather than as non-wage income on a form 1099-MISC. (Office of Chief Counsel IRS mem., UILC: 61.00-00, 3101.00-00, 3111.00-00, 3402.00-00, Income and Employment Tax Consequences and Proper Reporting of Employment-Related Judgments and Settlements, Oct. 22, 2008; see 26 C.F.R., \u00a7\u00a7 31.3121(a)-l(b), (i), 31.3306(b)-l(i), 31.3401 (a)-1 (a)(5) (2015).)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">In <em>Cheetham, </em>the defendant employer asserted that if it was required to pay an award of lost wages without withholding taxes, it could be held liable for those taxes and potentially have to pay the same amount twice\u2014once to the plaintiff and once to the IRS. <em>(Cheetham, supra, </em>2012 WL 1424168 at p. *7.) The IRS agreed with the defendant, explaining in amicus curiae briefing that an employer \u201cwill not be relieved of liability for withholding taxes unless it can show that the taxes have been paid [by the plaintiff], and even then it will still be liable for applicable penalties and other statutory additions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. *8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Cifuentes has not cited any authority suggesting that <em>Lisec </em>would have insulated Costco from liability to the taxing authorities had it failed to withhold income and FICA taxes. To the contrary, the California and Federal Rutter Employment Guides advise employers not to follow <em>Lisec </em>because it is inconsistent with federal law. (Fed. Rutter Employment Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 11:897, p. 11-110; Cal. Rutter Employment Guide, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 17:897, p. 17-169.) Moreover, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Rivera\u2014the controlling federal appellate authority in California\u2014contravenes <em>Lisec, </em>further underscoring the risk to California employers of failing to withhold taxes from lost wages. (See <em>Rivera, supra, </em>430 F.3d at p. 1259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Costco contends that if the courts do not consistently apply the definition of wages for taxation and withholding purposes, employers and employees will have a difficult time understanding when payroll taxes must be withheld from judgments and settlements. We agree. The IRS does not base its enforcement scheme on state court decisions. Consistent rulings among the state and federal courts will allow the parties in employment litigation to accurately discern whether a payment, in the form of either a settlement or judgment, constitutes wages from which withholdings must be taken or income from which withholdings are not necessary. Employers who face penalties for making the wrong decision should not have to guess as to whether withholding is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The IRC requires that taxes be withheld from wages because it is the most reliable means of assuring that they are paid. (See <em>Baral v. United States </em>(2000) 528 U.S. 431, 436-437 [145 L.Ed.2d 949, 120 S.Ct. 1006].) By adopting the prevailing federal view, we ensure that California employers who withhold taxes from awards of lost wages are not penalized \u201c \u2018for fulfilling [their] legal duty.\u2019 \u201d (Noel, <em>supra, </em>697 F.3d at p. 212.) Moreover, our decision does not leave plaintiff employees without an adequate remedy. They may seek a refund from the taxing authorities for any amounts withheld in excess of their tax obligation. <em>(Rivera, supra, </em>430 F.3d at p. 1260.) As observed in <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>County of Fairfax </em>(E.D.Va. 1991) 758 F.Supp. 353, 367, footnote 26, \u201c[c]ourts do not disagree . . . that tax authorities must receive their due, and that neither plaintiffs nor defendants should receive windfalls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Cifuentes received almost $70,000 in income tax refunds. He does not claim he is entitled to an additional refund. The trial court determined he may be owed $9,975.37, most of which is for FICA tax withholding. Beginning with <em>Nierotko, </em>federal courts have taken a consistently broad view of \u201cwages\u201d and \u201cemployment\u201d for FICA taxation purposes. <em>(Nierotko, supra, </em>327 U.S. at pp. 365-366; <em>Gerbec, supra, </em>164 F.3d at p. 1026; <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>151 F.3d at p. 860; <em>Hemelt, supra, </em>122 F.3d at pp. 209-210.) This is because Congress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>by enacting the FICA tax provisions, \u201cintended to impose FICA taxes on a \u00abbroad range of employer-furnished remuneration in order to accomplish the remedial purpose of the Social Security Act.\u201d <em>(Associated Elec. Coop., Inc. </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(Fed.Cir. 2000) 226 F.3d 1322, 1326; see <em>Nierotko, </em>at p. 364.) Cifuentes has not demonstrated that the award of lost wages was exempt from FICA taxation or that he is entitled to reimbursement of those taxes. Indeed, his own financial expert testified his award would be subject to FICA tax and state disability insurance withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Additionally, we reject Cifuentes\u2019s assertion the withholding was improper because it did not take into account his obligation to pay his attorney a contingency-based fee. As Costco points out, the entire award of lost wages was taxable as income regardless of whether a portion was used to pay contingent attorney fees. <em>(Commissioner v. Banks </em>(2005) 543 U.S. 426, 430 [160 L.Ed.2d 859, 125 S.Ct. 826] [\u201c[T]he litigant\u2019s income includes the portion of the recovery paid to the attorney as a contingent fee.\u201d].) Nor are we convinced by Cifuentes\u2019s reference to the section of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Pub.L. No. 108-357 (Oct. 22, 2004) 118 Stat. 1418) authorizing an \u201cabove-the-line\u201d deduction of attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with a claim of discrimination or retaliation. (See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 62(a)(20), (21).) The award in this case was for breach of contract, not unlawful discrimination or retaliation. (See <em>Banks, </em>at p. 439.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The trial court found Costco\u2019s position \u201ccompelling\u201d and implied that, but for <em>Lisec, </em>it would have ruled in Costco\u2019s favor. We so rule. The law, as it has developed since <em>Lisec, </em>required Costco to withhold payroll taxes from the award of lost wages. Costco complied with this requirement and satisfied the judgment by paying Cifuentes the remaining balance due. His remedy was to seek refunds for any excess withholding, not further damages from Costco. (See <em>Rivera, supra, </em>430 F.3d at p. 1260.) Accordingly, we reverse the order denying Costco\u2019s motion for acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment and remand with instructions to grant the requested relief. (See \u00a7 724.050, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\"><em>Attorney </em>Fees<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The order denying Costco\u2019s motion for acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>instructions to enter a new order granting relief under section 724.050.
