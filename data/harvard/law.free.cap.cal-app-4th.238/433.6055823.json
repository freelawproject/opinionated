Appellants Kay Eckler and Steve Engel filed separate actions against respondent Neutrogena Corporation alleging that its sunscreen products were misleadingly labeled and marketed in violation of California consumer protection statutes. Appellants alleged that Neutrogena misleadingly labeled its products with the descriptions \u201csunblock,\u201d \u201cwaterproof,\u201d and \u201csweatproof\u201d (Labeling Terms), terms that the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited in a regulation published on June 17, 2011, with a compliance date of December 17, 2012. Engel contends that Neutrogena is liable for marketing products that bore the Labeling Terms before the December 17, 2012 compliance date. The Eckler matter raises an additional product labeling issue with respect to sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) value greater than 50 (SPF 50+). Although Eckler does not contend that the SPF values on Neutrogena\u2019s products were inaccurate, she believes that consumers will be misled about their benefits and seeks an order that Neutrogena modify its labels and alter its advertising. The superior court sustained Neutrogena\u2019s demurrer to Eckler\u2019s complaint without leave to amend, and granted its motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Engel\u2019s complaint. The court concluded that their claims were preempted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 379r) and implementing FDA regulations. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Appellant Engel filed suit against Johnson &amp; Johnson and Neutrogena in December 2003, and an amended complaint in June 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although those pleadings focused on purported misrepresentations concerning the ability of sunscreen products to protect users from longer wavelength ultraviolet rays, the amended complaint did allege that Neutrogena\u2019s product was not truly water or sweat \u201cproof,\u201d or a true \u201csunblock.\u201d Engel\u2019s action was eventually added to a coordination proceeding involving other parties raising claims against sunscreen manufacturers. A corrected amended master complaint dated April 2006 is the operative pleading. In that complaint Engel alleged that he purchased Neutrogena Oil Free Healthy Defense Sunblock lotion \u201cand was damaged thereby.\u201d The suit alleged that respondents used the Labeling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Terms on its packaging and marketing, which were deceptive advertising and unlawful business practices under California\u2019s unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200), false advertising law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17500), and Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.). According to Erigel, the gravamen of his allegations is that Neutrogena\u2019s products were falsely labeled \u201cby claiming that they: (1) were a \u2018sunblock\u2019 when in fact they did not block all of the sun\u2019s harmful rays and did not in fact block, but rather absorbed, the sun\u2019s rays; (2) provided \u2018waterproof\u2019 protection, which has been defined by the FDA to mean \u2018impenetrable to or unaffected by water\u2019 and \u2018completely resistant to water regardless of time of immersion\u2019 when the products were not impenetrable to, or unaffected by, or resisted over time to water; and (3) provided \u2018sweatproof\u2019 protection, which implies that they were impenetrable to or unaffected by sweat and completely resistant to sweat regardless of time of immersion or exposure, when they were not impenetrable to, unaffected by, or resistant over time to sweat.\u201d He sought injunctive, restitutionary, and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In June 2011 the FDA issued a final rule that among other things, prohibited sunscreen product labels from stating that they were \u201csunblock,\u201d \u201csweatproof,\u201d and \u201cwaterproof.\u201d (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.327(g) (2015); 76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35661 (June 17, 2011) (Final Rule).) Ultimately the compliance date for the regulation was set for 18 months later, on December 17, 2012. Engel contends that this regulation codified a previous alleged ban on these descriptions; Neutrogena contends that it represented the first time the agency prohibited the Labeling Terms. Neutrogena moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing, among other things, that Engel\u2019s claims were preempted by federal law. The superior court concluded that Engel\u2019s claims were entirely preempted, and that the 18 months between publication of the Final Rule and its effective date represented a \u201csafe harbor\u201d reflecting the FDA\u2019s cost-benefit analysis: a delay fashioned to \u201cminimize transactions costs based on a global analysis of social welfare. That\u2019s what a cost-benefit analysis is.\u201d Engel\u2019s appeal challenges the trial court\u2019s dismissal of claims arising from purchase of products bearing the Labeling Terms with respect to three time periods: (1) before June 17, 2011, when the Final Rule was published, (2) after the Final Rule\u2019s publication but before the compliance date, and (3) after the December 17, 2012 compliance date.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Appellant Eckler also filed suit against Neutrogena under California\u2019s unfair competition law and Consumers Legal Remedies Act alleging that its sunscreen product labels were misleading. Eckler complained of the same Labeling Terms as Engel did; she also contended that the package labeling on SPF 50+ products was false and misleading. Eckler did not allege that the SPF values on Neutrogena\u2019s labels were inaccurate. Rather, she asserted that labels for SPF 50+ products omitted what she claims is a material fact, that they provide no added clinical benefit compared to products rated at SPF 50. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Eckler did not claim that Neutrogena affirmatively represented that SPF 50+ products conferred enhanced clinical benefits, but she avers that consumers would naturally believe so, and thus Neutrogena misled consumers by charging more for such products and not disclaiming any benefits. Eckler alleged that she purchased two of Neutrogena\u2019s sunscreen products in May 2012 after reading the labels. Her complaint further asserted that consumers read the labels before deciding to purchase the products and are deceived by Neutrogena\u2019s allegedly false representations and failures to disclose material facts on the labels and packaging of its products. Eckler \u201cseeks an. order requiring Neutrogena to disclose on its Product labels and associated advertising that the higher SPF values in the SPF 55-100+ collection do not provide proportionately greater, or any added clinical sun protection benefit.\u201d She also requested class-wide restitution and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Neutrogena demurred to Eckler\u2019s complaint on several grounds, including express and implied preemption. The court concluded that Eckler\u2019s action was preempted by federal law, sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action. Eckler and Engel filed timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review for Demurrer and Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">We apply a de novo standard of review to a trial court\u2019s order of dismissal following an order sustaining a demurrer. <em>(Los Altos El Granada Investors </em>v. <em>City of Capitola </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 629, 650 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 434].)

The FDCA was amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (Pub.L. No. 105-115 (Nov. 21, 1997) 111 Stat. 2296) (Modernization Act), which included a provision expressly preempting state law requirements regarding nonprescription drugs, including sunscreen products. Section 751 of the FDCA, codified at 21 United States Code section 379r(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specifically prohibits state requirements that are <em>not identical </em>with federal requirements: \u201cno State . . . may establish or continue in effect any requirement\u2014[\u00b6] (1) that relates to the regulation of a drug . . . and [\u00b6] (2) that is different from or in addition to, or that is otherwise not identical with, a requirement under this chapter. . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Such state \u201crequirements]\u201d include those concerning \u201cpublic information\u201d or \u201cpublic communication relating to a warning.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">A savings clause excepts from preemption product liability suits (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 379r(e).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, the statute permits state enforcement of \u201ca requirement that is identical to a requirement of this chapter.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Title 21 United States Code section 379r reflects Congress\u2019s express intention generally to preempt state requirements on the labeling of nonprescription drugs such as the sunscreen products at issue. This intent is amply supported by the legislative history of the Modernization Act. The language in section 379r was added by amendment in the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. (Sen.Rep. No. 105-43, 1st Sess., p. 13 (1997).) The Senate Report on the Modernization Act stated that \u201c[a]n essential element of a nationwide marketplace is a national uniform system of regulation. It is intended that the FDA provide national leadership in assuring the safety, effectiveness, and proper labeling and packaging for nonprescription drugs and cosmetics marketed throughout the country . . . .\u201d (Sen.Rep. No. 105-43, at pp. 63-64.) The report also emphasized that states may not impose different or additional requirements relating to labeling and advertising: \u201cNo State or local government is permitted to impose different or additional requirements that relate to the subject matter covered by the three Federal laws as they apply to nonprescription drugs and cosmetics. These include requirements imposed on product manufacture or composition, labeling, advertising, or any other form of public notification or communication.\u201d <em>(Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>at p. 64.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Conference Committee on the Senate bill adopted the preemption language added by the Senate. (H.R.Rep. No. 105-399, 1st. Sess., pp. 81-83 (1997) (Conference Report).) The Conference Report reiterated that the \u201cscope of national uniformity\u201d applied to \u201cstate requirements that relate to labeling and packaging or, if they go beyond labeling and packaging, to requirements relating to warnings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The 1997 legislation, as part of a major reform of all food, drug and cosmetic regulation, also singled out sunscreen products for future FDA regulatory action. Section 129 of the Modernization Act provided: \u201cNot later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue regulations for over-the-counter sunscreen products for the prevention or treatment of sunburn.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 393 note; 111 Stat. 2331.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">B. <em>FDA regulations concerning sunscreen products</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Sunscreen products have been the subject of exhaustive federal regulatory action for many years. The FDA\u2019s regulations cover, among other topics, permissible active ingredients, highly technical standards for the testing and measurement of sun protection, and required and prohibited statements on product packaging. During over three decades of proposed mies, comments, new data, and reconsiderations, the agency\u2019s view has evolved with medical and chemical advances, and in response to the data and comments it has received in the rulemaking process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">For example, in 1978 the FDA issued a proposed mle based on a panel recommendation concerning sunscreen products. (43 Fed.Reg. 38206 (Aug. 25, 1978).) Among other things, the proposal stated that sunscreen products that satisfy testing procedures may be labeled \u201cwaterproof,\u201d and those that satisfy sweat resistance testing procedures may be labeled \u201csweat resistant.\u201d (43 Fed.Reg. 38206, 38215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>In 1993, in another notice of proposed rulemaking, the agency issued a \u201cTentative Final Monograph\u201d based on its consideration of comments to the 1978 proposed rule. (58 Fed.Reg. 28194 (May 12, 1993).) The FDA stated that it was concerned that \u201cthe term \u2018waterproof,\u2019 as used in the Panel\u2019s recommended monograph, may be confusing or misleading to consumers . . . .\u201d (58 Fed.Reg. 28194, 28228.) The FDA continued: \u201cTherefore, the agency is not proposing the labeling claim \u2018waterproof,\u2019 but is proposing instead the term \u2018very water resistant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The proposed rule also provisionally authorized use of the term \u201csunblock.\u201d \u201cThe agency agrees with the comment that the descriptive term \u2018sunblock\u2019 would be informative to users of OTC sunscreen drug products. The agency believes that the term \u2018sunblock\u2019 may be used as an additional statement of product performance on sunscreen drug products that contain the ingredient titanium dioxide and provide an SPF of 12 or higher.\u201d (58 Fed.Reg. 28194, 28240.) No changes in the Code of Federal Regulations concerning the Labeling Terms were made in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In 1999 the FDA published as a final rule a final monograph regarding sunscreen products. (64 Fed.Reg. 27666 (May 21, 1999).) This monograph provided that sunscreens with SPF values over 30 be labeled no higher than 30+. (64 Fed.Reg. 27666, 27675.) The agency found that data was lacking to \u201csupport or dismiss limiting the maximum SPF value in this final rule.\u201d (64 Fed.Reg. 27666, 27674.) Based upon the comments it received, the agency concluded that \u201cOTC sunscreen products with SPF values above 30 should be available for those sun-sensitive consumers who require such products . . . .\u201d (64 Fed.Reg. 27666, 27675.) The 1999 final rule, however, was stayed and never went into effect. (See 69 Fed.Reg. 53801 (Sept. 3, 2004).)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In 2007, the FDA issued another proposed rule, described as a proposed amendment to the final monograph. (72 Fed.Reg. 49070 (Aug. 27, 2007).) That document proposed a new labeling system, as well as adding combinations of ingredients, and proposing new testing procedures. The FDA stated it \u201cplans to grant an extended compliance period when this proposed rule is finalized\u201d because \u201csome manufacturers may not have sufficient time to incorporate labeling changes without disrupting their production schedules.\u201d (72 Fed.Reg. 49070, 49109.) In the 2007 publication, the FDA did not propose a prohibition on the Labeling Terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The 2007 proposed rule also explained its preemptive effect, both express and implied. The FDA explained that a final rule would preclude state requirements on labeling of sunscreen products that were not identical to it: \u201cThis proposed rule, if finalized as proposed, would amend the labeling and include new UVA testing for OTC sunscreen drug products. Any final rule would have a preemptive effect in that it would preclude States from issuing requirements related to the labeling and testing of OTC sunscreen drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>products that are different from or in addition to, or not otherwise identical with a requirement in the final rule. This preemptive effect is consistent with what congress set forth in section 751 of the act [(21 U.S.C. \u00a7 379r)]. Section 751(a) of the act displaces both State legislative requirements and State common law duties. We also note that even where the express preemption provision in section 751(a) of the act is not applicable, implied preemption may arise (see <em>Geier </em>v. <em>American Honda Co., </em>529 U.S. 861 [146 L.Ed.2d 914, 120 S.Ct. 1913] (2000)).\u201d (72 Fed.Reg. 49070, 49109 (Aug. 27, 2007).) Four years later, the FDA issued its Final Rule on sunscreen labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">(i) <em>FDA 2011 Final Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Simultaneously in 2011, the FDA issued a Final Rule on labeling and effectiveness testing for sunscreen products, and a proposed rule that invited comments concerning limiting the labeling of sunscreen products to SPF 50. The Final Rule addressed the labeling and effectiveness testing issues raised by nearly 2,900 submissions received in response to the August 27, 2007 proposed rule. It promulgated two new federal regulations: 21 Code of Federal Regulations parts 201.327 and 310.545 (2015), which set labeling requirements, specified effectiveness testing, and identified false and misleading claims that render a product misbranded. (76 Fed.Reg. 35620 (June 17, 2011) (Labeling and Effectiveness Testing; Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> FDA described this regulation as \u201ca labeling rule, and not a monograph.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35622.) Thus, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>prescribed labeling requirements that reflected the FDA\u2019s \u201ccurrent determination on appropriate regulation on these aspects of sunscreens.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35621.) The Final Rule mandated that sunscreen labels state the SPF value resulting from the detailed testing procedure described in the regulation. (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.327(a)(1) &amp; (I) (2015) [specifying testing procedure to arrive at appropriate SPF values and providing labels \u201cshall\u201d state the SPF value].) The FDA codified in 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 201 (2015) certain requirements for OTC sunscreen products, including \u201cspecific claims that render a covered product misbranded or are not allowed on any OTC sunscreen drug product marketed in the United States without an approved application.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35621.) Accordingly, sunscreen products cannot include on labels the descriptions \u201c[s]unblock,\u201d \u201csweatproof,\u201d and \u201cwaterproof.\u201d (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.327(g) (2015).) The regulation promulgated by the Final Rule expressly provides that the numerical SPF value resulting from the FDA-mandated SPF testing procedure must be placed on a sunscreen product\u2019s principal display panel (see 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.327(a)(i)(A), (ii) (2015)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The labeling requirements in the Final Rule are detailed. Products that pass the broad spectrum test of 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 201.327(j) (2015) must state \u201cBroad Spectrum SPF\u201d with the numerical SPF value appearing as \u201ccontinuous text with no intervening text or graphic\u201d all in the \u201csame font style, size, and color with the same background color.\u201d (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.327(a)(1)(B) (2015).) The rule specifies warnings about keeping the product out of the eyes, and not using it on damaged or broken skin. (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.327(d) (2015).) The rule also prohibits certain statements, such as any implication that use, alone, reduces the risk of skin cancer or early skin aging, and use of the terms \u201csweatproof,\u201d \u201cwaterproof,\u201d and \u201c[s]unblock.\u201d (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.327(c)(3), (g) (2015).) The Final Rule does not include as being a false or misleading claim accurately labeling a product with an SPF value above 50. (See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.327(c)(3), (g) (2015).)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Noting that often additional product label information can cause more confusion than clarity, the Final Rule repeatedly reflected a balancing of concerns. For instance, the Final Rule eliminated a statement proposed in 2007 that \u201c \u2018higher SPF products give more sun protection, but are not intended to extend the time spent in the sun.\u2019 \u201d (72 Fed.Reg. 49070, 49075 (Aug. 27, 2007).) The FDA \u201cconcluded that [this] statement, although truthful, is not necessary.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35642 (June 17, 2011).) (See 76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35626 (June 17, 2011) [\u201c. . . UVA star rating would likely be confusing in conjunction with the numerical SPF rating.\u201d]; 76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35627 [\u201cthe \u2018No UVA Protection\u2019 statement is not necessary and could be misleading\u201d]; 76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35628 [proposed label <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>requirement explaining two types of ultraviolet rays was \u201cpotentially confusing\u201d].) The FDA cited 82 studies and reports on dermatology, photochemistry, and other fields in support of its technical judgments. (76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35658-35660.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In discussions pertinent to this appeal, the FDA Final Rule confirmed its expressly preemptive impact except as to claims based on state product liability law. The FDA noted that it addressed the preemption issue in its 2007 proposed rule. That rule noted that 21 United States Code section 379r \u201cis an express preemption provision.\u201d (72 Fed.Reg. 49070, 49109 (Aug. 27, 2007).) While clarifying that by its terms the Modernization Act did not preempt product liability claims, whether based on statutes or common law, the FDA emphasized: \u201cHowever, it is important to note that [section 379r] exempts only those common law claims that are based on State product liability law.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35624 (June 17, 2011).) The agency also noted that \u201calthough implied preemption may arise, such scenarios are necessarily case-specific.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, in the Final Rule the FDA made clear that section 379r requires preemption of suits based on state law (other than product liability actions) that would seek to impose any labeling or advertising requirements not identical to those contained in the Final Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Final Rule was initially to have a compliance date (for products with annual sales of $25,000 or more) of June 18, 2012. This date was extended to December 17, 2012. Engel contends that during the 18-month period from publication of the Final Rule on June 17, 2011, to the compliance date of December 17, 2012, Neutrogena should face liability for non-compliant products. In extending the compliance date, the FDA stated that \u201cgranting manufacturers additional time to complete testing and relabeling is in the public interest.\u201d (77 Fed.Reg. 27591, 27592 (May 11, 2012).) This was consistent with what the FDA had announced four years earlier. \u201cFDA plans to grant an extended compliance period when this proposed rule is finalized.\u201d (72 Fed.Reg. 49070, 49109 (Aug. 27, 2007).) Moreover, it had always been the FDA\u2019s intention that products already on the market remain and not be recalled. Recognizing that non-compliant products were in the stream of commerce, the FDA reiterated that those products could remain on the market: \u201cIn the 2007 proposed rule, we indicated that sunscreen products which are already distributed by the effective date of the final rule would not be expected to be relabeled or retested in conformity with the final rule conditions unless these products were subsequently relabeled or repackaged after the effective date (72 FR 49070 at 49109). Consistent with this statement, we do not expect non-compliant products introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce prior to the compliance dates specified for this final rule to be removed from the market.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35624 (June 17, 2011).)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(ii) <em>FDA 2011 Proposed Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">On the same day it published the Final Rule, the FDA published a proposed rule titled Revised Effectiveness Determination; Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use. (76 Fed.Reg. 35672 (June 17, 2011), boldface omitted (Proposed Rule).) The Proposed Rule would further modify 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 201.327 (2015) to limit the maximum labeled SPF value for OTC sunscreen drug products to \u201c50+.\u201d The agency stated that \u201cthis proposal is part of FDA\u2019s ongoing review of these products to ensure their safety and effectiveness.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35672 (June 17, 2011).) In its discussion of the Proposed Rule, the FDA noted that in 1999 it had proposed a maximum SPF of 30+, and in 2007 proposed a maximum of 50+, in part because of a concern that \u201cproducts with SPF test values above 50 could not be tested with acceptable accuracy and reproducibility . . . .\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35672.) The Proposed Rule noted that submissions in response to the 2007 proposal demonstrated the accuracy and reproducibility of test values as high as SPF 80. The FDA stated that \u201cbecause the record continues to lack data demonstrating that sunscreen products with SPF values above 50 provide additional clinical benefit compared to SPF 50 products,\u201d it was again proposing \u201ca maximum labeled SPF value of \u201850+.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Proposed Rule noted that \u201c[c]onsumers have learned to associate higher SPF values with greater sun protection. Consumers would likely assume that a product with an SPF value higher than 50 provides greater protection than a product with an SPF value of 50 <em>(e.g., </em>assume that an SPF 80 sunscreen provides greater protection than an SPF 50 sunscreen). However, we lack evidence that a product with an SPF value higher than 50 provides additional clinical benefit compared to a product with an SPF value of 50. In the absence of data demonstrating additional clinical benefit, we are concerned that labeling a product with a specific SPF value higher than 50 would be misleading to the consumer.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35672, 35674 (June 17, 2011).) In the Proposed Rule, the agency stated that it needed further data and invited comments. \u201c[W]e are requiring data sufficient to support a general conclusion that sunscreen products with specific SPF values above 50 provide additional protection over SPF 50 sunscreen products. If we receive such data, and sufficient accompanying data regarding accuracy and reproducibility of testing, we may be able to allow those specific SPF values to be included in labeling.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35672, 35675.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The Proposed Rule acknowledged the potential value of sunscreen products with SPF values over 50: \u201cWe recognize that sunscreen products with SPF values above 50 could have utility for consumers in certain settings, such as skiing at high altitudes, or with certain conditions that predispose them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>developing skin cancer. If such products are needed in unique situations but not in typical situations of sunscreen use <em>(e.g., </em>beach or gardening), it is possible that different labeling may be necessary for these unique situations. . . . Additional data would enable us to identify the appropriate target population ... for sunscreen products with SPF values above 50.\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35672, 35675 (June 17, 2011).)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In summary, the Proposed Rule declared no final FDA position on the safety and effectiveness of products with SPF values over 50. While the agency expressed concerns about the efficacy of such products, it lacked scientific evidence to issue a rule. Accordingly, the Proposed Rule invited relevant data.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the publication of the 2011 Proposed Rule, the FDA has issued no Final Rule limiting the maximum SPF that can appear on sunscreen labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">3. <em>Principles of Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, \u201c[w]hen a state statute, administrative rule, or common-law cause of action conflicts with a federal statute, it is axiomatic that the state law is without effect. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., supra, </em>529 U.S. at p. 894 <em>(Geier).) </em>\u201cIn determining whether federal law preempts state law, a court\u2019s task is to discern congressional intent. [Citation.] Congress\u2019s express intent in this regard will be found when Congress explicitly states that it is preempting state authority. [Citation.] Congress\u2019s implied intent to preempt is found (i) when it is clear that Congress intended, by comprehensive legislation, to occupy the entire field of regulation, leaving no room for the states to supplement federal law [citation]; (ii) when compliance with both federal and state regulations is an impossibility [citation]; or (iii) when state law \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bronco Wine Co. v. Jolly (2004) 33 </em>Cal.4th 943, 955 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 180, 95 P.3d 422]; see <em>Dowhal v. SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 910, 923 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 88 P.3d 1] <em>(Dowhal). </em>In addition, federal agency regulation with the force of law can preempt conflicting state requirements. <em>(Wyeth v. Levine </em>(2009) 555 U.S. 555, 576 [173 L.Ed.2d 51, 129 S.Ct. 1187]; <em>Geier, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>529 U.S. at pp. 874-884.) A state \u201crequirement\u201d may include state suits based on common law or statutory provisions. <em>(Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504, 521-522 [120 L.Ed.2d 407, 112 S.Ct. 2608]; <em>Kanter, supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 792.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The party who asserts that state law is preempted bears the burden of so demonstrating. <em>(Viva! Internal. Voice for Animals </em>v. <em>Adidas Promotional Retail Operations, Inc. </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 929, 936 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 50, 162 P.3d 569].) Moreover, consideration of issues under the supremacy clause starts with the presumption that state laws are not to be preempted by a federal statute unless it is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress to do so. <em>(Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 516 (June 17, 2011).)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">By its terms, 21 United States Code section 379r expressly preempts state requirements not identical with the federal requirements. The FDA maintains that pursuant to section 379r, its sunscreen labeling regulations preempt state law requirements not identical to the Final Rule. (76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35624 (June 17, 2011).)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">A. <em>California cases interpreting 21 United States Code section 379r</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Two published California appellate cases have considered the preemptive effect of 21 United States Code section 379r on lawsuits aimed at enforcing state statutory requirements. Both found that the suits were preempted, although under different theories. In <em>Dowhal, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 910, our Supreme Court held that a suit to require a Proposition 65 warning on nicotine replacement therapy products was preempted despite a savings clause in section 379r that exempted Proposition 65. The court found that section 379r did not expressly preempt the claim that the state law warning was required because of the savings clause. However, because the state and federal requirements directly conflicted, the Proposition 65 requirement was impliedly preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Proposition 65, enacted through ballot initiative in 1986, prohibits businesses from knowingly exposing anyone to a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity without a warning. Regulations to implement the initiative required that products containing nicotine warn users that it contained a chemical known to the state \u201cto cause reproductive harm.\u201d In contrast to this state requirement, the FDA label for nicotine replacement therapy products warned a pregnant or breast-feeding mother that smoking can seriously harm her child, and urged cessation of smoking without using nicotine replacement medicine, but also stated that \u201cthe risks to your child from this medicine are not fully known.\u201d <em>(Dowhal, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 918-919.) Plaintiff Dowhal, acting on behalf of the public, sued to bar sale of defendant\u2019s nicotine replacement products without the Proposition 65 warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>In considering whether the state warning requirement was preempted by federal law, the Supreme Court explained that express preemption, and implied preemption based on pervasive federal regulation that occupies the field, did not apply. \u201cThe savings clause in the Modernization Act demonstrates both that Congress did not expressly preempt California law, and that it did not occupy the field of labeling of over-the-counter drugs. Thus the issue here concerns the third form of preemption, referred to as \u2018conflict preemption.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dowhal, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 924.) The Supreme Court reasoned that there was a direct conflict between the required Proposition 65 warning and the FDA\u2019s mandates because it was impossible for the manufacturer to comply with both requirements. Relying on the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Geier </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., supra, </em>529 U.S. 861, our Supreme Court concluded in <em>Dowhal </em>that the savings clause \u201cdoes not entirely exclude conflict preemption\u201d <em>(Dowhal, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 926), and accordingly, the FDA\u2019s directive could invalidate a Proposition 65 label \u201con a basis relevant to consumer health,\u201d although not to pursue a policy of \u201cnational uniform labeling.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>The Supreme Court deferred to the FDA\u2019s balancing of competing risks, observing that this was \u201can unusual case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 934.) While in most cases the FDA and Proposition 65 warnings would both inform the consumer of the risks involved in using a product, in this instance, the \u201cFDA\u2019s objection to labels warning that nicotine \u2018can\u2019 harm the baby is not that they are false, but that consumers may give too much weight to the warnings and decide to continue smoking instead of using [the product] to stop smoking.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 931.) Thus, the suit to require the Proposition 65 warning was preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Dowhal </em>is our Supreme Court\u2019s only interpretation of the statute at issue here, but it is significant because it concluded that the doctrine of implied preemption foreclosed enforcement of a state ballot initiative even when the federal statute contained a savings clause crafted specifically to exempt that initiative. (See <em>Dowhal, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 926, fn. 6.) And, relevant to this case concerning sunscreen rules, <em>Dowhal </em>indicates that without the unique savings clause in that case, that is, with the express preemption provisions of 21 United States Code section 379r in force, the federal statute preempts state requirements that depart from \u201cnational uniform labeling.\u201d (32 Cal.4th at p. 926.) Finally the <em>Dowhal </em>decision reflects a cautious deference to the policy tradeoffs considered by the federal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In the second California decision on the preemptive effect of 21 United States Code section 379r, the First District Court of Appeal affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendant manufacturers of OTC drugs for the treatment of head lice. <em>(Kanter, supra, </em>99 Cal.App.4th 780.) Plaintiffs alleged that the products were falsely labeled. The trial court found that the claims were preempted by section 379r, and the Court of Appeal agreed. (99 Cal.App.4th at pp. 795-797.) The FDA had approved labeling for the product, but plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>alleged that the labels were inaccurate, and accordingly, defendants breached warranties, and were guilty of fraud and false advertising. Plaintiffs sought relief under, among other statutes, Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500, and the Consumers Legal Remedies Act. The <em>Kanter </em>court noted that the underlying legal theories were based on the assertion that the FDA-approved label was inadequate and should be changed. The court concluded that \u201cwhen a state law claim, however couched, would effectively require a manufacturer to include additional or different information on a federally approved label, it is preempted.\u201d (99 Cal.App.4th at p. 795.) The court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims were expressly preempted by section 379r because \u201c[e]ach cause of action would result in the establishment of a state requirement regarding labeling that would be \u2018different from\u2019 and \u2018otherwise not identical with\u2019 the federally required label . . . .\u201d (99 Cal.App.4th at pp. 796-797.) Because the court concluded that section 379r expressly preempted the suit, it declined to reach the issue of implied conflict preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><em>Dowhal </em>and <em>Kanter </em>indicate that under 21 United States Code section 379r: (1) the FDA may require uniform labeling of products; (2) ordinarily, suits that seek alternatives to the FDA\u2019s uniform labels are expressly preempted; and (3) even without express preemption, when state litigation poses an obstacle to the objectives of the federal agency, the suit may be foreclosed by implied preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">B. <em>Federal cases interpreting 21 United States Code section 379r</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Most of the cases on preemption under the FDCA have arisen in federal court. Two recent district court decisions in California considered the issue raised by Eckler, that the California consumer protection statutes were violated by the merchandising of sunscreen products with SPF values over 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In <em>Corra </em>v. <em>Energizer Holdings, Inc. </em>(E.D. Cal. 2013) 962 F.Supp.2d 1207 <em>(Corra), </em>a consumer sued a sunscreen distributor alleging violations of Business and Professions Code section 17200, Civil Code section 1750, and breach of express warranty. The plaintiff alleged that defendant distributed sunscreen products which had SPF values over 85, but that, while defendant charged a premium for them, such products do not provide superior protection compared to lower SPF products. The district court denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on preemption.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court did not examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>language of 21 United States Code section 379r, but considered the FDA\u2019s Final Rule regarding sunscreen products. (76 Fed.Reg. 35620 et seq. (June 17, 2011).) The court concluded that the preemption doctrine did not foreclose the suit, noting that plaintiffs did not seek to prohibit use of SPF ratings over 50 or change the product label: \u201cRather, Plaintiff alleges the way Defendants marketed their sunscreen products <em>beyond </em>simply providing an SPF rating\u2014-in effect, combining the use of SPF ratings with price differentials and claims of proportionally greater protection\u2014misled consumers into purchasing more expensive, higher SPF-rated products . . . .\u201d (962 F.Supp.2d at p. 1214.) The court believed that if the plaintiff were to prevail under the state consumer protection statutes, \u201cDefendant\u2019s SPF labeling duties would remain unchanged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1215.) The court also rejected defendant\u2019s argument that 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 201.327 (2015) was a further reason to find preemptive intent. That part, listing the types of representations that were forbidden, was prefaced with the phrase \u201c[t]hese claims include but are not limited to.\u201d (21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.327(g) (2015).) This non-exclusive list, reasoned the court, \u201cclearly evince[d] no intent to preempt state consumer fraud claims.\u201d (962 F.Supp.2d at p. 1215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">A contrary result was reached by a different federal district court in <em>Gisvold v. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(S.D.Cal. 2014) 62 F.Supp.3d 1198 <em>(Gisvold). </em>As in <em>Corra, </em>the plaintiff in <em>Gisvold </em>alleged that sunscreen products with an SPF over 50 do not provide any increase in clinical benefit over SPF 50 products, and thus contended that labels stating SPF values over 50 are false and misleading under Business and Professions Code section 17200, Civil Code section 1750, and express warranty. Gisvold sought an order that defendants charge the same price for the SPF 50+ products as SPF 50 products \u201cand/or that they include \u2018a disclaimer on the label or packaging that a SPF value above 50 does not provide proportional clinical benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gisvold, </em>at p. 1201.) Just as Eckler requests here, Gisvold sought an order that the company \u201cengage in a corrective advertising campaign.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In <em>Gisvold, </em>the district court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were preempted. In contrast to the <em>Corra </em>decision, the <em>Gisvold </em>court reviewed the express preemption language in the federal statute: \u201cThe FDCA, which includes an express pre-emption statute, is unambiguous and broad in scope . . .\u201d and quoted 21 United States Code section 379r. <em>(Gisvold, supra, </em>62 F.Supp.3d at p. 1202.) The court also reviewed the FDA\u2019s final rule regarding labeling and effectiveness of sunscreen products, noting that they mandate the SPF value. The court found that the plaintiff\u2019s argument was broader than her pleading: \u201c[t]he essence of Plaintiff\u2019s claim is that \u2018Merck\u2019s SPF 55, 70+, 80 or 100+ representations <em>... on its Coppertone SPF 55-100+ collection </em>are false, misleading, and reasonably likely to deceive the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>court concluded that \u201cin seeking to provide greater consumer protections, Plaintiff targets Merck\u2019s sunscreen label (which complies with current FDA regulations), and proposes a disclaimer regarding the level of sunscreen effectiveness beyond SPF 50. Because the proposed disclaimer plainly adds to and is not identical with the FDA\u2019s requirements, Plaintiff\u2019s action is expressly pre-empted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 379r.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1202-1203, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The <em>Gisvold </em>court was unpersuaded by the <em>Corra </em>decision, pointing out that <em>Corra </em>did not consider whether a disclaimer regarding clinical benefits would \u201cadd to or be identical with FDA\u2019s labeling requirements.\u201d <em>(Gisvold, supra, </em>62 F.Supp.3d at p. 1203.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It also interpreted more narrowly than the <em>Corra </em>court the FDA\u2019s regulation on false or misleading claims at 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 201.327(g). That regulation prohibits use on product labels or other advertising the terms \u201csweatproof,\u201d \u201cwaterproof,\u201d and \u201csunblock,\u201d or \u201csimilar claims.\u201d The district court in <em>Gisvold </em>reasoned: \u201cAlthough the regulation does not purport to provide an exclusive list of false and/or misleading claims, its scope is limited to claims <em>similar </em>to those listed. Plaintiff does not argue, nor could she, that premium pricing or the lack of a disclaimer regarding proportional clinical benefits of SPF 50+ products are similar to the claims precluded by the regulation.\u201d <em>(Gisvold, </em>at p. 1203, original italics.) Accordingly, the court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on grounds of express preemption.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The timing of compliance with the 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 201.327(g) prohibition was not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Neither federal decision is binding on us, but <em>Gisvold </em>is the more persuasive because that case, like this one, involved a plaintiff seeking a change in product labeling and advertising. In <em>Corra </em>the court assumed that a change in labeling was not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Other federal cases have considered the preemptive effect of 21 United States Code section 379r with respect to different nonprescription drug products. OTC cold medications were the target in <em>Carter v. Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2008) 582 F.Supp.2d 1271 <em>(Carter). </em>In that case the plaintiffs claimed that the medications were unsafe and ineffective for children under age six, although they alleged no injury from use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>medications and sought recovery only for the money they paid for them. Their actions were brought under New Jersey consumer fraud statutes and common law claims for false and misleading advertising, deceptive business practices and breach of warranty. The complaint requested an injunction preventing defendants from falsely advertising and marketing the cold medicine as safe and effective for children under the age of six. The court observed that these medications are governed by FDA regulations, which, after a lengthy evaluation process, were issued on a range of subjects, including permissible active ingredients, dosages and mandatory labeling. The FDA determined that the medications should bear a warning that they not be administered to children under the age of two. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The court in <em>Carter </em>found that the claims were expressly preempted under 21 United States Code section 379r and dismissed them. The court found that the relief sought by suits under state law constitute \u201crequirements\u201d that may be subject to preemption, citing Supreme Court cases that gave an \u201cexpansive reading\u201d to that term. <em>(Carter, supra, </em>582 F.Supp.2d at p. 1281.) And, turning to section 379r itself, the district court reasoned that subdivision (c)(2) \u201cexpands the universe of potentially preempted state law claims to include that those require additional warnings in the advertising for nonprescription drugs, and not only on the labeling.\u201d (582 F.Supp.2d at p. 1282.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiffs in <em>Carter </em>\u201cdo not allege that Defendants fail to comply with FDA regulations as they currently exist, so none of their claims are parallel enforcement claims.\u201d (582 F.Supp.2d at p. 1282.) (See \u00a7 379r(f) [no prohibition on state enforcement of a requirement identical to a requirement under the FDCA].) The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the relief they sought fell outside of federal requirements based on a purported general duty on defendant\u2019s part \u201cnot to deceive.\u201d (582 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1282-1283.) It found that plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of authority was mistaken, and failed to acknowledge the breadth of preemption embodied in section 379r: \u201cThe touchstone of preemption under \u00a7 379r is the <em>effect </em>that a finding of liability on a particular claim would have on the Defendants, and not the particular common law or state law theory upon which that claim was brought. As long as that claim imposes a \u2018requirement\u2019 that is at variance with FDA regulations, it is preempted.\u201d (582 F.Supp.2d at p. 1283, original italics.) Thus, a suit to add to product labels or alter \u201cpublic information\u201d or \u201cpublic communication\u201d from that required by the federal agency is foreclosed under section 379r.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The <em>Carter </em>decision is pertinent to the appeals considered here for another reason. Engel claims, based on comments in proposed regulations, that the FDA \u201cbanned\u201d the use of the Labeling Terms long before it actually issued a regulation doing so. Eckler claims as a fact the lack of clinical benefit of SPF 50+ products, although the agency expressed merely a lack of sufficient evidence one way or the other on that issue. Both arguments are based on distortions of agency comments. In <em>Carter, </em>the plaintiff similarly sought to stretch the meaning of a proposal published in the Federal Register, a non-final recommendation that the agency did not adopt. <em>(Carter, supra, </em>582 F.Supp.2d at p. 1276.) <em>Carter </em>recognizes that courts should avoid engaging in their own rulemaking when the agency\u2019s work is in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Other federal cases applying 21 United States Code section 379r follow <em>Carter. </em>In <em>Crozier v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Companies, Inc. </em>(D.N.J. 2012) 901 F.Supp.2d 494, the plaintiffs sued under New Jersey consumer statutes claiming that a first aid antiseptic spray, which accurately identified on its label the antiseptic ingredients, did not contain antibiotics. The plaintiffs contended that the defendant\u2019s manner of marketing and advertising the product confused and misled consumers to assume that an antibiotic was an ingredient. The district court held that claims pertaining to the product\u2019s label were expressly preempted under section 379r, although it declined to do so with respect to marketing claims. (901 F.Supp.2d at pp. 503-505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In <em>Bowling </em>v. <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson </em>(S.D.N.Y. 2014) 65 F.Supp.3d 371 <em>(Bowling), </em>the plaintiffs filed suit under state and federal consumer and warranty statutes claiming that the defendant\u2019s mouthwash bore a label falsely representing that it \u201crestored enamel.\u201d The court held that these claims were preempted by 21 United Stated Code section 379r: \u201cthe FDA has issued a monograph directly on point but declined ... to indicate . . . that \u2018Restores Enamel\u2019 is misleading. If successful, this litigation would do exactly what Congress, in passing section 379r of the FDCA, sought to forbid: using state law causes of action to bootstrap labeling requirements that are \u2018not identical with\u2019 federal regulation.\u201d (65 F.Supp.3d at p. 376.) The district court explained that \u201cthe whole point of section 379r is that it is not up to private litigants\u2014or judges\u2014to decide what is \u2018false or misleading.\u2019 It is up to the FDA.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 377.) Concluding that the suit sought to \u201csupercede the FDA\u2019s regulatory authority,\u201d the court held that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was foreclosed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Cases that have declined to find preemption have done so under statutory exceptions, or because label uniformity was not at issue. For example, the district court found no preemption in <em>Delarosa v. Boiron, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2011) 818 F.Supp.2d 1177. In that case the plaintiffs used the defendant\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201chomeopathic\u201d cold medicine but stayed sick. Unlike non-homeopathic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>OTC drugs, however, homeopathic OTC drugs are not evaluated by the FDA at all. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1182.) The court concluded that the homeopathic medicine was excepted from preemption under 21 United States Code section 379r(d). (818 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1186-1187.) Alternatively, the court found that for this product, there were no federal requirements that could be added to or departed from. Thus, the homeopathic cold remedy differed from the products in <em>Kanter </em>and <em>Carter </em>which\u2014like the sunscreen products at issue here\u2014were drugs subject to FDA\u2019s comprehensive efficacy and labeling regulations. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1189.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The intent of Congress expressed in the Modernization Act, both the history and terms of the FDA\u2019s regulations, and California and federal decisions establish a clear standard: State suits seeking to require product labels inconsistent with the federal objective of national labeling uniformity, and not congruent with the FDA\u2019s balanced effort to achieve such uniformity, are preempted. The question is whether under this standard appellants\u2019 suits are foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Appellants\u2019 claims are preempted</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">With respect to Engel\u2019s action, the question is whether Neutrogena is liable for marketing products bearing the Labeling Terms before the FDA required it to stop doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Placing into commerce a package of sunscreen bearing the terms \u201cwaterproof,\u201d \u201csweatproof,\u201d and \u201csunblock\u201d became non-compliant with a federal regulation for the first time on December 17, 2012. Engel, however, insists that the FDA \u201cbanned\u201d these Labeling Terms 18 year before the Final Rule. He is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Contrary to Engel\u2019s contention, the FDA did not ban the Labeling Terms in 1993, 18 years before the Final Rule. As recounted above, for a time the FDA proposed permitting the terms \u201cwaterproof\u2019 and \u201csunblock,\u201d provided certain ingredient or testing conditions were met. In the August 27, 2007 Proposed Rule that preceded the Final Rule, the FDA did not propose that the Labeling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Terms be prohibited. (See 72 Fed.Reg. 49070, 49113-49114 (Aug. 27, 2007).) What Engel refers to as a ban by the FDA in 1993 was a proposed rule issuing a tentative final monograph to which further comments were invited. (58 Fed.Reg. 28194 (May 12, 1993).) The tentative final monograph was not an \u201corder,\u201d as Engel argues, nor was it in any sense final. This proposed rule did not \u201cban\u201d any of the Labeling Terms. The agency did express concern that \u201cwaterproof\u2019 could be confusing or misleading and proposed using the term \u201cvery water resistant\u201d instead. (58 Fed.Reg. 28194, 28228 (May 12, 1993).) But the FDA did not propose that \u201cwaterproof\u2019 be prohibited on sunscreen labels. The term \u201csweatproof\u2019 was not addressed at all, although the agency proposed the use of the term \u201c \u2018sweat resistant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>And, contrary to appellants\u2019 contention, the FDA agreed that the \u201cdescriptive term \u2018sunblock\u2019 would be informative to users of OTC sunscreen drug products,\u201d and proposed how the term could be used in certain circumstances. (58 Fed.Reg. 28194, 28240 (May 12, 1993).) To be sure, in the Final Rule, the FDA states that the Labeling Terms \u201care false or misleading, as we have stated in previous sunscreen rulemakings (58 FR 28194 at 28228; 64 FR 27666 at 276766 through 27680).\u201d (76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35643 (June 17, 2011).) But a review of those previous comments, issued in conjunction with proposed rules and a monograph that never became effective, do not support that broad characterization. In any case, no prohibition of the Labeling Terms ever appeared as part of the Code of Federal Regulations until the publication of the Final Rule on June 17, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Engel seeks to declare that product descriptions on sunscreen labels that were, until the FDA\u2019s Final Rule, in compliance with federal law, nevertheless violated California law. He therefore seeks enforcement of a state requirement \u201cthat is different from or in addition to, or that is otherwise not identical with\u201d a requirement under the FDCA, and thus, his suit is subject to 21 United States Code section 379r\u2019s express preemption provision. (See <em>Kanter, supra, </em>99 Cal.App.4th at p. 796 [assertion that approved label is inadequate and should be changed results in \u201cestablishment of a state requirement regarding labeling that would be \u2018different from\u2019 and \u2018otherwise not identical with\u2019 the federally required label ... is therefore preempted\u201d (citation omitted)]; <em>Bowling, supra, </em>65 F.Supp.3d at p. 377 [\u201cthe whole point of section 379r is that it is not up to private litigants\u2014or judges\u2014to decide what is \u2018false or misleading.\u2019 It is up to the FDA.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Engel argues, however, that Neutrogena should be liable for non-compliant Neutrogena products marketed during the 18-month period after publication of the Final Rule to the December 17, 2012 compliance date. This was the period that the superior court concluded was a safe harbor reflecting a utilitarian cost-benefit analysis. As discussed above, the FDA assured manufacturers that they would have time to comply with the new testing and labeling regime and that non-compliant products could remain on the market. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>(76 Fed.Reg. 35620, 35624 (June 17, 2011).) Engel, in other words, urges that states may compel compliance with a federal requirement before the federal agency requires. This conflict is what Congress meant to avoid. The superior court was correct in concluding that the FDA intended to permit a reasonable time to achieve compliance and that the preemption doctrine nullifies a suit seeking to impose a requirement inconsistent with the agency\u2019s regulations. (See <em>Carter, supra, </em>582 F.Supp.2d at p. 1283 [\u201ctouchstone of preemption under \u00a7 379r is the <em>effect </em>that a finding of liability on a particular claim would have on the Defendants .... As long as that claim imposes a \u2018requirement\u2019 that is at variance with FDA regulations, it is preempted.\u201d (original italics)]; <em>Lombardo v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Cos. Inc. </em>(S.D.Fla., Dec. 19, 2013, No. 13-60536-Civ-SCOLA) 2013 U.S.Dist. Lexis 189043 [finding express preemption regarding sunscreen products sold after date Final Rule enacted and labeled before Dec. 17, 2012 compliance date].)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Engel\u2019s claims are also impliedly preempted because they pose an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress and its delegated agency. (See <em>Dowhal, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 923.) Engel seeks imposition of a labeling regime before the agency required manufacturers like Neutrogena to comply with it. This is contrary to Congress\u2019s intention of enacting uniform national labeling for nonprescription drugs, which the FDA is charged with implementing. As the recitation above of the history of the FDA\u2019s regulatory process demonstrates, before it issued the Final Rule, the agency sifted through thousands of comments, reviewed scientific studies, changed its position on the very terms in question\u2014 \u201cwaterproof\u2019 and \u201csunblock\u201d\u2014and determined what label information was necessary, truthful but unnecessary, and misleading. Appellant seeks to disrupt the careful weighing of conflicting considerations that Congress entrusted the agency to undertake. As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Dowhal, </em>enforcement of the Proposition 65 notice requirements\u2014even with an express savings clause\u2014were impliedly preempted by federal disclosure rules that reflected a nuanced balance of the need to provide accurate product information while not discouraging use of a product that could help pregnant women stop smoking. The state-required warning label in that case\u2014even though truthful\u2014could be prohibited because it conflicted with the federal purpose. <em>(Dowhal, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 928-931.) In this case, Engel seeks to usurp the federal agency\u2019s careful consideration of appropriate label requirements and restrictions, and its determination of the most reasonable phase-in of labeling requirements.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> His suit conflicts with federal law by posing an obstacle to Congress\u2019s objective of national labeling uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Eckler\u2019s claim about the Labeling Terms falls with Engel\u2019s. Eckler\u2019s second labeling claim is that while Neutrogena accurately states the SPF value on its products, she maintains that consumers are likely to be misled about the efficacy of SPF 50+ products. Eckler requests that labels and advertising correct the allegedly misleading omission. Does Eckler\u2019s state lawsuit seek requirements in addition to or not identical to federal law? The answer is yes, and thus her suit is also expressly preempted. (See <em>Kanter, supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 795 [\u201cwhen a state law claim . . . would effectively require a manufacturer to include additional or different information on a federally approved label, it is preempted\u201d].) Eckler\u2019s SPF 50+ claim is based on a distorted reading of FDA regulations and on speculation about what consumers believe. Further, in contrast to the claim arising from the Labeling Terms, her allegations about the efficacy of SPF 50+ products have never been endorsed by the FDA. It is true that in 1999, in a monograph that never took effect, the FDA proposed capping the SPF value at 30. The 2011 Proposed Rule considerably raises that limit. (76 Fed.Reg. 35672 (June 17, 2011).) In any case, the Proposed Rule is simply that: it offers a proposal, but asserts no final conclusions; it requests data. Eckler\u2019s suit would involve the state court in precisely the type of scientific inquiry and policy balancing that is within the expert agency\u2019s proper purview.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Eckler seeks disclosure language added to Neutrogena\u2019s product label and a corrective advertising campaign. Such an order is expressly preempted by 21 United States Code section 379r(a) and (c). The conclusion of the <em>Gisvold </em>case is persuasive: \u201c[I]n seeking to provide greater consumer protections, Plaintiff targets Merck\u2019s sunscreen label (which complies with current FDA regulations), and proposes a disclaimer regarding the level of sunscreen effectiveness beyond SPF 50. Because the proposed disclaimer plainly adds to and is not identical with the FDA\u2019s requirements, Plaintiff\u2019s action is expressly pre-empted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 379r.\u201d (Gisvold, <em>supra, </em>62 F.Supp.3d at p. 1201, fns. omitted.) Eckler\u2019s claim also seeks to impose state requirements \u201crelating to public information\u201d and is on that basis as well expressly preempted by 21 United States Code section 379r(c)(2). (See <em>Carter, supra, </em>582 F.Supp.2d at p. 1282 [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 379r(c)(2) \u201cexpands the universe of potentially preempted state law claims to include those that require additional warnings in the advertising for nonprescription drugs, and not only on the labeling\u201d].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Finally, for the same reasons discussed concerning Engel\u2019s suit, we conclude that Eckler\u2019s action is foreclosed under the doctrine of implied preemption. That the FDA has not issued a final determination on the issue of products with SPF values above 50 is not a reason to permit suits like Eckler\u2019s. It is a reason to allow the federal agency to complete its congressionally mandated objectives without states imposing a premature patchwork of disparate requirements. The FDA is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of SPF 50+ products because it had insufficient data; it therefore invited public comment. (See 76 Fed.Reg. 35672 (June 17, 2011).) At this point, it is neither Congress\u2019s nor the FDA\u2019s objective to ban SPF 50+ products. The agency acknowledged that \u201csunscreen products with SPF values above 50 could have utility for consumers in certain settings . . . .\u201d (76 Fed.Reg 35672, 35675 (June 17, 2011).) It thus left open consideration of a labeling program that specifies when use of SPF 50+ products would be beneficial. Eckler\u2019s suit, on the other hand, demands that Neutrogena\u2019s products bear a label that denies any added benefit, for anyone, under any circumstances. Her suit would thus impose an obstacle to the FDA\u2019s goal of offering choices to consumers with different needs. The agency\u2019s interest in providing such choices is comparable to the circumstances underlying the implied preemption holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Geier, supra, </em>529 U.S. 861. The court held that a federal auto safety standard that required manufacturers to install either automatic seat belts, air bags, or some other passive restraint device in their vehicles preempted a California tort suit seeking to hold a carmaker liable for failing to install air bags. The Supreme Court observed that the federal Department of Transportation deliberately permitted manufacturers \u201cto choose among different passive restraint mechanisms.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 878.) Reasoning that a rule of state tort law requiring a single system of passive restraints \u201cwould have presented an obstacle to the variety and mix of devices that the federal regulation sought,\u201d the court held that the state tort suit conflicted with the objectives of the federal standards and was, under the doctrine of implied preemption, foreclosed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 881.) In the case before us, the benefits and uses of SPF 50+ products, and the appropriate range of choices that will be open to consumers, are what the FDA is investigating and is yet to pass judgment on. Eckler, though, denies such investigation is needed and that such choices are desirable. Eckler\u2019s suit presents an obstacle to the agency\u2019s express interest in determining if such products may be advantageous in certain circumstances. Until the FDA issues a final rule on this topic, Eckler\u2019s claim usurps Congress\u2019s express goal of uniform national labeling and the FDA\u2019s mandate of determining efficacy based on scientific evidence and making balanced public policy judgments. Accordingly, Eckler\u2019s claim concerning SPF 50+ products is preempted. The superior court correctly dismissed appellants\u2019 complaints.

(76 Fed.Reg. 35672, 35674-35675 (June 17, 2011) [\u201cwe cannot determine from the study summary the amounts of sunscreen products applied, length of sun exposure for individual subjects, or the time of day during which subjects were exposed to the sun\u201d].) In any case, the study was supported in part by a grant from Neutrogena.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\"> The court also denied the motion to dismiss based on primary jurisdiction, standing, and the notice provision of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act. It concluded that the complaint failed to plead a violation of express warranty and dismissed that claim with leave to amend. <em>(Corra v. Energizer Holdings, Inc., supra, </em>962 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1215-1220.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> <em>Gisvold </em>also distinguished a Florida district court case that found preemption commencing with publication of the Final Rule but not before. (See <em>Lombardo v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Cos., Inc. </em>(S.D.Fla., Sept. 10, 2014, Civ. No. 13-60536-Civ-Scola) 2014 U.S.Dist. Lexis 156881.) The court in <em>Gisvold </em>noted: \u201c \u2018Lombardo is not attempting to enforce any sort of state labeling requirement in addition to the Final Rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gisvold, supra, 62 </em>F.Supp.3d at p. 1203.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> <em>Gisvold </em>also dismissed the complaint based on the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> 21 United States Code section 379r(c)(2) defines a \u201crequirement that relates to the regulation of a drug\u201d to include \u201cany requirement relating to public information or any other form of public communication relating to a warning of any kind for a drug.\u201d The <em>Carter </em>court recognized that this provision did not mean that all advertising requirements are \u201cautomatically preempted,\u201d but that state requirements relating to public warnings that are \u201cdifferent from or in addition to\u201d federal requirements <em>are </em>expressly preempted. <em>(Carter, supra, </em>582 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1281-1282.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\"> Other cases that have concluded that 21 United States Code section 379r did not require preemption are inapposite.

But Engel\u2019s 2006 complaint could not allege purchase of a non-compliant product after December 17, 2012, and thus he pleaded no injury or any basis for standing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Based on the pleadings before it, the trial court properly dismissed Engel\u2019s complaint with respect to this narrow time period as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\"> Beyond the injunctive relief they seek, appellants\u2019 claims for purported economic injury are inextricably linked to their labeling and marketing claims. Eckler points to no affirmative representations by Neutrogena concerning added benefits of SP 50+ products, but she assumes that consumers will believe that a higher price \u201creinforced the deceptive message.\u201d Eckler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>insists she is not alleging a \u201cprice premium misrepresentation.\u201d Her claim of economic injury, like her efforts to modify public communications and product labeling, is preempted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
