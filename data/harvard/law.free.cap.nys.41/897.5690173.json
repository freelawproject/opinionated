J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqoV\">This fiction was brought to recover damages occasioned by the alleged wrongful discharge of the plaintiff from the defendant\u2019s employ. The question involved was whether the plaintiff was employed for a year, or whether the hiring was a weekly one. \u25a0 The plaintiff was the only witness upon his own behalf, and several witnesses were examined upon the part of the-defendant. There is no error alleged in the rulings of the court upon the trial, but it is claimed upon this appeal that the verdict is against the weight of evidence. It is conceded upon the part of the defendant that the weight of evidence does not depend upon-the number of witnesses, but rather upon the character of the testimony given, and the facts surrounding the transactions. Upon-an examination of the record in this case we are of opinion that the verdict in question is decidedly against the weight of evidence, and that the story of the plaintiff is successfully impeached by the only writing which is connected with the transaction, and by the testimony of the numerous witnesses whose evidence is more credible and satisfactory than that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff testified that in the year 1893 he was employed by Adolf Hochstadter &amp; Co., and that his friend Mr. Seller, who was in the employ of the Children\u2019s Cloak Company (under which name the defendant did business), asked him whether he was willing to go into the-defendant\u2019s employ as \"a nonunion man. In pursuance of this conversation he went to the office of the defendant the next day, at the dinner hour. This was the first week in January, and on a Saturday afternoon. He saw there a Mr. Reiman, the defendant\u2019s manager, who told him the story of the trouble he had in the-house in regard to the union cutters, and then asked the plaintiff whether he was willing to go against the union, and to work for the defendant. The plaintiff said \u201cYes,\u201d if he could better himself, he would do that. Reiman inquired: \u201cQ. What do you ask a week?\u201d The plaintiff said: \u201cA. I am getting in the old place $24, and I am well liked in the organization. I belong to it years- and years. On account of hating myself\u2014between myself and my brothers\u2014so well, I will accept $30 a week.\u201d Reiman said: \u201cAll right, I am willing to give you that; and I will give you my word of honor that I will give you engagement for a whole year.\u201d The plaintiff thereupon said: \u201cAll right; I believe you. I take your word for it.\u201d Mr. Reiman then said: \u201cWell, if you are agreed upon what I say, you can go upstairs, and fix yourself up. It is Saturday afternoon. The cutters are not upstairs. You can go upstairs, and fix yourself up for Monday morning. You will be ready so as to give them work.\u201d The plaintiff then went upstairs and' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>got ready for work on Monday morning. He further testified that nothing was said in regard to a salary of $27 a week. The witness then testified that he went home on Saturday night perfectly satisfied with the agreement, but, after considering whether he should take the man\u2019s word for real truth, he did not go to work on Monday morning, but waited to make up his mind as to whether he should believe the man or not, because it seemed to him the way the man looked at him\u2014 (Here the witness was interrupted.) The witness then further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">\u201cSo I went down town dinner hour, on the corner of Broadway and Canal street, so Mr. Fox have seen me. He was kind of manager there. He had seen me. He said: \u2018It is just the right man what I want to see. I am looking for you all over. You promised to come up Monday morning to work, and you didn\u2019t come up.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, T hardly believed the man what he says;\u2019 and he said: \u2018Well, Mr. Reiman wants to see you anyway. Come up now.\u2019 So I went upstairs again, and Mr. Reiman said to me: \u2018Don\u2019t you take my word for it? I gave you my word of honor as a gentleman.\u2019 -Mr. Reiman said to me \u2018that you are hired by me for a full year from now until next year this time.\u2019 And he said\u2014 I thought to myself: \u2018Well, now I can believe the man. He said different then.\u2019 \u2018If you don\u2019t believe me what I say, here is Mr. Beller, your own friend, your particular friend, and Mr. Fox. You can take them as witness.\u2019 So I thought this way: If a man talks about witness matters, all right. I thought I could believe the man. And after, I said, \u2018All right; if you talk this way from your own heart and soul, so I can start into work.\u2019 And he shook hands with me. He said: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be afraid. You take mine word again as a man of honor that I give you employment for a whole year.\u2019. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">The witness then testified that there was some talk about a deposit. That Mr. Reiman said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-11\">\u201c T want to be sure with you that you not go to leave me before the year is over.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, what do you want of me then?\u2019 He said: \u2018Well, 1 want you to place $300, a deposit, for a security that you not go to leave me before the year is over.\u2019 So I said: \u2018Mr. Reiman, I am kind of short of money. I have not got always money to spare. I can spare yet for a moment $300, and not to keep it on me long, because I might need it in a month, or two or three months. I don\u2019t know when.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018you can bring me up $300, and any time you have any use for it you can get it back.\u2019 So I gave them the $300 the same day I was engaged, and I started in to work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">It appears that at this time.a receipt for this money was given, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-13\">\u201cNew York, January 10, 1893.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-14\">\u201cReceived this day three hundred (300) dollars from Mr. Nathan Levs\u2019, as security to us for his good faith, honesty, and integrity, and as security to us for his conforming to the rules of our business, in connection with his position in our cutting department; and the consideration of this deposit of Mr. Levy to us is our paying to him thirty (30) dollars per week, with the three hundred (300) dollars security, instead of twenty-seven (27) dollars per week without this security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-15\">\u201c[Signed] Children\u2019s Cloak Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">Reiman and Fox were examined as to this transaction, and each swore that nothing was said about a hiring for a year. Mr. Beller said that he was not present at the hiring, and both Friedlander (the defendant) and Beller testified to statements made by the plaintiff that he had no contract for a year; that\" question having arisen between Fox and the plaintiff from certain statements which were reported to Fox as having been made by the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>of a hiring for a year. Reiman and Fox both testified that the original contract was for $27 a week, and that it was raised to $30 a week only in consideration of the fact of his putting up the $300 as security that he would not leave them so long as they wanted to employ him; and that the $300 was returned to .the plaintiff some time before his discharge. It may be true, as is claimed upon the part of the plaintiff, that the construction to be placed upon Mr. Beller\u2019s testimony was, when the plaintiff said that he had no contract for a year, it might have been inferred from the transaction that he had no contract in writing for a year. But when we consider the testimony of Reiman and Fox in connection with the receipt given, which so distinctly contradicts the testimony of the plaintiff in reference to the terms of tne original agreement, it seems impossible to come to any other conclusion than that plaintiff testified falsely in regard to the question of the original hiring. It seems to be conclusively established that he was originally hired for $27 a week (which he swore was never spoken of), and that his salary wa(s raised because of his deposit of $300, insuring the defendant of his services in hostility to the union with which the defendant was having a contest. In view of this written evidence, clearly impeaching the plaintiff in regard to what he considered a material part of this transaction,\u2014namely, the agreement as to the original hiring,\u2014no confidence whatever can be placed in his testimony in regard to the hiring for a year in opposition to that of the witnesses who testified that nothing was said with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">We are of opinion, upon considering all the evidence in the case, that the jury were unauthorized to come to the conclusion which they did, and that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">BARRETT and INGRAHAM, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b926-8\">O\u2019BRIEN, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"A-i\">We think that the issue here presented as to whether it was a weekly or a yearly hiring was, upon conflicting evidence, peculiarly a question for the jury. It is true that the plaintiff is outweighed in the number of witnesses, and the force of part of his testimony is impaired by a written receipt. But neither of these has such probative force as to justify us in disregarding the plaintiff\u2019s version, which is not only supported by his own evidence, but has certain corroborative circumstances, which may be briefly referred to. The witnesses, with the exception of one, who really knew nothing about the question of hiring, were, besides the defendant, his brother-in-law, who was the manager of his business, and the superintendent and an employ\u00e9 of defendant\u2019s; none of whom are to be regarded, any more than the defendant himself, as entirely disinterested witnesses. As to the discrepancy in the plaintiff\u2019s version, that he made a contract for $30, when the receipt shows that it had been increased from $27 to $30 at the time he made the deposit for which the receipt was given, this was not material upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>the main question, and is a circumstance to be weighed with all his testimony upon the question of his credibility, which was one for the jury. It was shown that the plaintiff did not seek employment from the defendant, but that the latter zealously sought out and persistently urged the plaintiff to enter his employ; that the plaintiff at the time was a member of the union with which the defendant was at war; and that in entering such employment the plaintiff lost his status as a member of the union, and as a security for his faithful performance of the contract was obliged to deposit 1300. The jury had a right very properly to consider whether\u2014if the defendant\u2019s version was true, that the employment was only by the week\u2014they could have prevailed upon the plaintiff to make these sacrifices for so precarious employment; and they were, it seems to us, strong corroborative circumstances that the plaintiff\u2019s agreement was one for a year. Nor do we attach much importance to the admissions claimed to have been made by the plaintiff as to the duration of his employment, it being a fair subject of criticism that at every point a.disposition was shown by the defendant\u2019s witnesses to establish a weekly, as against a yearly, hiring, which would be unusual if there were no question in their minds at any time as to the duration of the employment. Upon this question there was a clear conflict of evidence, and we do not think we should be justified in setting aside this verdict on the ground that it is clearly against the weight of evidence. For this reason we think the judgment should he affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">RUMSEY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
