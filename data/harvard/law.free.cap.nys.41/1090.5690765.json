For a second cause of action, it is alleged that, upon proceedings to probate the said will, costs and expenses were incurred in amount to the sum of $1,770.10, which sum plaintiffs\u2019 testator advanced to the defendant at his re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>quest, and, on account thereof, defendant executed and delivered to said testator an assignment and transfer of sufficient of the rents and proceeds of the said property to pay the interest annually upon the said sum so advanced; that no part of the money thus advanced has been paid, and interest is now due upon said sum from the 13th day of February, 1883. Plaintiffs demand judgment, that a receiver be appointed to collect the rents, and apply the same in discharge of the water rat' s and taxes, and in discharge of the said claim for interest, and for other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The demurrer interposed is based upon the ground that causes of action have been improperly united in the complaint. This is the only ground now urged for our consideration. Appellant insists that the first cause of action alleged is for an injury to real property in the nature of a tort, and the second an action upon contract. Assuming this to be so, the appellant overlooks the fact that the action is in equity, and that both claims relate to the same subject, \u2014i. e. the real property,\u2014and that the main relief sought is the application of the rents produced therefrom in discharge of claims chargeable thereon. We think they are properly described as transactions connected with the same subject of the action, and, as such, are brought within section 484 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as causes of action in which a union is permitted. Lattin v. McCarty, 41 N. Y. 107; Lamming v. Galusha, 135 N. Y. 239, 31 N. E. 1024; Shepard v. Railroad Co., 117 N. Y. 442, 23 N. E. 30; Mahler v. Schmidt, 43 Hun, 512. The cases relied upon by appellant, of which Keep v. Kaufman, 56 N. Y. 332, and Wiles v. Suydam, 64 N. Y. 173, are illustrations, were actions at law for damages, where independent causes were attempted to be united. The rule is plain, and the distinction between the cases clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">It follows that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs, with leave to defendant to answer upon payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
