J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaCb\">The judgment was for a sum equal to one week\u2019s-</p>\n<p id=\"ADn\">salary, on the ground that plaintiffs were discharged without right, before the termination of the agreement; and the question of fact in the case was whether they received two weeks\u2019 notice, of the termination of the contract, under an alleged custom in the theatrical business that engagements should be terminated upon such notice.. The judgment is attacked for alleged errors of the trial justice in the admission and exclusion of evidence, but we find none which calls for reversal. The objection to the contents of the posted notice or paper styled the \u201cTheatrical Call\u201d was not specific. Any error in disallowing the question put to the plaintiff John E. Ince,. upon cross-examination, as to what, in his experience, was the meaning of the theatrical expression \u201csubject to rules and regulations\u201d\" when used in contracts of employment, was cured when he was allowed afterwards to answer the question. The appellant claims, that he should have been allowed to have an answer in order to show that the phrase signified that the contract was terminable upon two weeks\u2019 notice from either party. That he was not prejudiced' by the temporary exclusion of the evidence is clear, because, after a few intervening questions, the question was asked: \u201cYou testify here, as I understand you, that there is no custom with respect to notice being given or received under this contract. Is that so?\u201d\u2014 to which the witness replied: \u201cYes.\u201d The appellant would have-been in no better position had his question as first asked been al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>lowed. As to whether the judgment was against the weight of evidence, we fail to see in the record sufficient reasons for ordering a new trial upon the facts. It was on Saturday night, May 2d, while the company was playing in Philadelphia, that the defendants notified them that the season was to close then and there. Plaintiffs had then been playing eight weeks, and one week remained of the contract. Mrs. Ince testified that she had not received any previous notice of the close of the season, but inasmuch as she admitted that, the week before, she had written to try and secure other employment, it is argued that she must then have had such notice. The inference would be plausible if it were not for the fact that the contract of nine weeks had then but a week and some days to run, and that her writing at that time is consistent with an effort to get employment after the nine weeks, and was without reference to an earlier termination of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
