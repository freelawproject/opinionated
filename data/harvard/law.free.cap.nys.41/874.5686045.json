By his will, duly proved, Gallagher''devised to the plaintiff his house and lot, \u201cNo. 97 Oakland street, Brooklyn.\u201d Gallagher neither at the time of his death, nor at any other time, owned any other real estate than said plot, No. 79 Oakland street. The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of the premises 79 Oakland street. The defendant refuses to carry out the contract, on the ground that the plaintiff has not a good title to the premises agreed to be sold. The sole question presented on this submission is whether, under the devise of the testator\u2019s house and- lot No. 97 Oakland street, the house and lot 79 Oakland street passed. The general rule applicable to errors of the kind that has occurred in this will is, \u201cFalsa demonstratio non nocet,\u201d As to this rule it -is said by Mr. Jarman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-15\">\u2022\u2018It means that where the description is made up of more than one part, and one part is true, but the other false, there, if the part which is true describe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>subject with sufficient legal certainty, the untrue part will be rejected, and will not vitiate the devise.\u201d 1 Jarm. Wills, 742.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">So in Day v. Trig, 1 P. Wms. 286, where one devised all his freehold houses in Aldersgate street, London, having in fact only leasehold houses there, it was held that the word \u201cfreehold\u201d should be rejected, and that the leasehold houses should pass. In Pacy v. Knolls, 8 Vin. Abr. 277, it was held that a devise of houses and lands lying in the parish of Billing, and in a street called \u2018Brook\u2019s Street,\u2019 was a good devise of lands in Billing street, the testator having no lands in the parish of Billing. In Patch v. White, 117. U. S. 210, 6 Sup. Ct. 617, 710, the testator devised lot No. 6 in square 403, in the city of Washington, together with the improvements thereon erected. It was shown that the testator never owned lot No. 6 in square 403, but did own lot 3 in square 406, and also that lot 6 had no improvements on it, while lot 3 in square 406 had thereon a dwelling house occupied by the testator\u2019s tenants. It was held that, under the devise, lot 3 in square 406 passed. In Govin v. Metz, 79 Hun, 461, 29. N. Y. Supp. 988, the testator devised \u201cthe house and lot marked with the number 204 Lexington avenue,\u201d in the city of New York. The testator never-owned 204 Lexington avenue, nor any other house and lot on that avenue, except No. 738. It was held that, under the devise, No. 738 Lexington avenue passed. The rule stated by Mr. Jarman plainly controls the disposition of this case; Eliminating the word and figures \u201cNo. 97,\u201d there is a sufficient designation and description of the premises devised as the testator\u2019s house and lot on Oakland .street, in the city of Brooklyn. There can be no doubt that the testator intended to devise the only piece of real estate he owned, on that street or elsewhere. The error that has crept into the street number is easily explained. There has been a mere transposition of figures, and \u201c97\u201d written instead of \u201c79.\u201d This error can cast no doubt on the testator\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">There should be judgment for the plaintiff on the submitted case, but, under the terms of the stipulation, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
