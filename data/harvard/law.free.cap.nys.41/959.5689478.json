The plaintiff is the successor in title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>of Ross, and his assignee of the lease; the transfer of ownership having taken place. June 1, 1896. The defendant removed from the premises in the month of May, 1896, and claims, in defense to this .action, that Ross accepted her surrender of the lease, and recognized one Neil as the succeeding tenant, accepting payment of rent from him as such tenant. From the evidence, although in conflict, the justice was not unauthorized to find the fact, as he did, favorably to this defense; and we may not properly disturb that finding, which in turn necessarily led to the legal conclusion that the defendant should prevail upon the issue litigated. The defendant\u2019s testimony showed that Ross consented to the affixing of the sign \u201cTo Let\u201d upon the premises, and named one Kenny as the agent to \u201cput the bill out.\u201d Kenny testified that he secured Neil as the tenant, and that Ross, in the course of an interview with the witness, approved of the selection, received rent from Neil, and expressed his willingness'to accept him as tenant for a year. This was denied by Ross, but, in the absence of extraneous circumstances affording substantial corroboration of his testimony, we are not to say that Kenny\u2019s story was improperly given credit by the justice, whose determination as to the facts was aided by his opportunity of observing the manner in which the testimony was given, and the appearance of the witnesses upon the stand. It was quite competent to the parties to this lease (Ross and the defendant) to discharge :it by parol. Tallman v. Earle (Com. Pl.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 805. And the fact of that discharge appears from Kenny\u2019s testimony as to the transaction between Ross and himself when acting, in this regard, in behalf of Mrs. Engel, the defendant. Consideration for the landlord\u2019s agreement to discharge the tenant is to be found in the fact of her surrender and delivery of possession, and no question was raised upon the trial as to the competency of the defendant\u2019s proof in support of that agreement. It would appear, however, that the statute of frauds does not apply to the transaction, since the term surrendered was of no more than a year\u2019s duration, and therefore neither the agreement of surrender, nor the agent\u2019s authority, were required to be evidenced by writing. <em>2 </em>Rev. St. (Banks Bros.\u2019 9th Ed.) p. 1884, \u00a7 6. The question litigated was \u25a0 entirely one of fact,\u2014whether or not there had been an executed oral agreement to discharge the lease (Tallman v. Earle, supra),\u2014and we \u2022should not disturb the conclusion reached in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
