Indeed, they could not well do so, as there was not a particle of evidence connecting the relator with any criminal feature of this fracas. On the contrary, the patrolman Croughan, who was called by the prosecution, testified that the person with whom this fracas is said to have occurred (one Henry Iba) admitted under oath in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>the police court that it was he (Iba) who raised the disturbance that started the row. It is a significant fact that this Henry Iba was not called as a witness before the respondents. Thus, the relator\u2019s story with regard to the occurrence, corroborated, as it is, by numerous witnesses, was entirely uncontradicted. It was substantially the only version of the fracas which the respondents had before them. The case as to the use of the revolver, though not quite so barren of testimony, is exceedingly weak. There is, in fact, no substantial evidence that the relator had or used a revolver upon the occasion in question. A single witness, Casper Iba (and he came upon the scene when the fracas was on the wane), does testify that he \u201cgrabbed\u201d \u2022 a revolver out of the relator\u2019s hands; but he did not adhere to this testimony. Upon cross-examination he said that he was not positive that he took the revolver from Shield\u2019s hands; that, at the time this revolver was \u201cflourishing,\u201d there was great excitement, and a \u201cgreat number of hands were up in the air\u201d; and that somehow he got the revolver in his hand. He was then asked this question, and gave the answer which follows: \u201cQ. Yo\u00fa could not swear positively it was from Officer Shields\u2019 hand that you took the revolver? A. No.\u201d Further on he said he \u201cthought it was Shields had the revolver.\u201d \u201cI think,\u201d he added; \"almost sure; I would not swear to it.\u201d This is all the testimony there was in support of the charge. The relator, on the other\" hand, testified that he had no revolver at the time of the occurrence; that his revolver was then locked up in a closet at the station house; and that, when accused, he took out his keys, and offered them to the sergeant, requesting the latter to open the closet, and see for himself that the pistol was there. At the close of the case, the counsel for the prosecution conceded that the relator\u2019s revolver was in the station house. It also appeared that the revolver which Casper Iba seized and brought to the station house was not the kind of pistol which police officers usually carry. There is a regulation revolver of the caliber 38. The pistol which was produced was of the caliber 32. Then, too, the relator was corroborated by the testimony of many witnesses. Thus, we have a case almost barren of testimony on the part of the prosecution, met with overwhelming evidence on the part of the defense, and surrounded by circumstances which place the probabilities clearly on the relator\u2019s side of the scale. While reaffirming all that was said in Lang\u2019s Case, 5 App. Div. 217, 39 N. Y. Supp. 74, we cannot possibly sustain the present conviction. It is hopelessly unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">The judgment under review must therefore be annulled, with $50 costs and disbursements, and the relator reinstated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
