Said order is modified by striking therefrom the following: \u201cShowing the dates of orders upon the plaintiff for goods for the defendants,\u201d and \u201cwhether any and what goods were returned to the plaintiff, with the date of such return,\u201d as contained in folio 55 of the printed appeal book; also, \u201cand their 'connection with the defendants, or either of them,\u201d and \u201cwhat other persons, if any, were present at the time of making the sale,\u201d as contained in folio 56 of tbe printed appeal book. For the reason that the defendants have better knowledge of their own acts than the plaintiff, and that it is not the office of a bill of particulars to apprise the opposite party of the names of witnesses, order appealed from modified as above, with costs of this appeal to the plaintiff against the defendants.- VAN WYCK, C.
