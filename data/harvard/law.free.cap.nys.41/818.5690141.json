And plaintiff demands that the defendants be compelled to surrender it for cancellation, and other relief. A demurrer was interposed upon the ground that, upon the face of the complaint, it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. A motion made on the pleadings for judgment on the demurrer as frivolous was granted, and from this order the appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">To support the demurrer, three grounds were urged: First, it appearing from the complaint that the parties entered into an alleged fraudulent transaction to injure the Hancock National Bank, neither law nor equity will interfere to relieve the plaintiff, as against the defendants, from the consequences of his misconduct; second, that in the action between the same parties the identical note sought to be canceled was sued upon, and, judgment having been rendered in favor of the plaintiff, the court will not entertain another suit between the same parties, upon the same cause of action, for any relief which the plaintiff might have obtained in the former action; and, third, that suit cannot be entertained in equity for the cancellation of an overdue note, to which there is a perfect defense at law. We think this position was well taken, and that the demurrer was not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
