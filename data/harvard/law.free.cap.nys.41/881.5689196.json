They had reached and passed the corner of 125th street, when a cable car, bound east, approached, and the plaintiff\u2019s horse and carriage, being then between the first, or southerly, track in 125th street and the curb of said street, stopped, and remained standing, to permit the car to pass. While thus standing still, the driver of defendant\u2019s wagon, who was driving behind plaintiff\u2019s carriage at a distance of about 10 feet, and from 2-\u00a1- to 3 feet west of plaintiff\u2019s carriage, drove the horse attached to the wagon in such a manner that in turning the corner of 7th avenue and 125th street, and going easterly, the left shaft of defendant\u2019s wagon struck the plaintiff\u2019s carriage on the westerly side, and ran through the side panel, causing the damage complained of. Immediately after the accident, an officer arrested the defendant\u2019s driver, and upon his promise to pay the damage he was discharged. The defense is that the plaintiff\u2019s son stopped the coup\u00e9 suddenly, and backed up, thereby backing against the side of the shaft of defendant\u2019s wagon, and doing the damage complained of. The defendant\u2019s proof on this subject is both unsatisfactory and improbable. At all events, the facts stated by its witnesses were denied by the plaintiff and her witnesses, and the question became one of fact, on which the finding of the justice is conclusive. According to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony (which seems to have been believed by the justice), the case clearly presented negligence on the nart of the defendant, and no act on her part contributed to the injury; and the theory of inevitable accident advanced by the defendant furnishes no excuse under the circumstances. It will not do to permit one by his negligent misconduct to get so close to a vehicle as to make an accident inevitable, and then obtain discharge on the ground that the inevitable occurred. If the justice had believed the defendant\u2019s witnesses, and found that the plaintiff\u2019s coup\u00e9 had backed against the shaft of the defendant\u2019s wagon, the plaintiff would have been without a right of action. Bierback v. Rubber Co., 14 Fed. 826; St. Clair Mineral Springs Co. v. City of St. Clair, 96 Mich. 463, 56 N. W. 18. Or, if the cable car had sud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>denly and without warning stopped the progress o\u00ed the plaintiff\u2019s coup\u00e9, and the defendant, without fault, had run into the coup\u00e9, its conduct might have been excused. Mueller v. Railway Co., 86 Wis. 340, 56 N. W. 914. But the justice\u2019s finding negatives the existence of any such facts, and .does not permit the application of the cases cited. The defendant\u2019s wagon was going up 7th avenue, behind and west of the plaintiff\u2019s coup\u00e9, and was turning easterly into 125th street, when the accident occurred; so that the shaft of the defendant\u2019s wagon was either driven into the plaintiff\u2019s coup\u00e9 by the act of the defendant\u2019s driver, or the coup\u00e9 must have moved sideways towards the west (almost an impossibility) against the shaft. The defendant\u2019s driver does not complain of a sudden stoppage of the plaintiff\u2019s coup\u00e9, but a backing up against his shaft; while the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testify there was no backing up of the coup\u00e9; that it was standing perfectly still when the shaft of the defendant\u2019s wagon ran into it. The-case therefore presented a clear question of fact on conflicting evidence. The justice saw the witnesses, observed their manner of testifying, and was best qualified to determine the question of credibility. O\u2019Dowd v. Bonnell, 17 Misc. Rep. 620, 40 N. Y. Supp. 650; Huller v. Wynne, 16 Misc. Rep. 580, 38 N. Y. Supp. 700; Katz v. Wolf, 16 Misc. Rep. 82, 37 N. Y. Supp. 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.
