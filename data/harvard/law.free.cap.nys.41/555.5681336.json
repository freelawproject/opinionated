Defendant testified that he only agreed to pay the cost of the labor in making the alterations on representations by plaintiff that he had the materials therefor, and that the labor would not cost over $30. Plaintiff paid $125 for the alterations, but did not furnish the material. <em>Held, </em>that the fact that defendant, before suit, offered to pay plaintiff $50, warranted a finding that he agreed to pay for the labor, and that the labor was worth $50.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b581-9\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-10\">Action by the Hew York Hovelty Company against Ferd.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiH\">The plaintiff contended by proof and pleading that defendant agreed to pay not exceeding $100 for certain alterations to be made in steam-pipe connections in defendant\u2019s premises, which he had leased to plaintiff for a three-years term at $7,500 rent annually; while the defendant testified that, at the conversation he had with plaintiff\u2019s agent about the steam-pipe connections to be made, this agent said that his company already had the pipes \u00edb the premises from which they intended to move, and that the pipes \u2022 could be taken out and brought to defendant\u2019s premises if defendant would pay for making the connections, and that in response he \u25a0 (defendant) had thought it over, and considering that it probably would cost $25 or $30, and that as he did not care for a matter of' $20 or $30, he would stand it. The old pipe was not taken out and brought to defendant\u2019s premises, but plaintiff caused the connections to be made with new pipe, and paid $125 for such pipe and' the labor for connecting same. The plaintiff\u2019s agent testified that before action was brought the defendant had offered to pay $50, which was refused. The jury found for plaintiff for $50, evidently-concluding that defendant had agreed to pay for the labor, but not for the material, and that as defendant had offered to pay $50 the labor was worth that sum. The appellant\u2019s contention is that, because the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses had testified that it was entitled to $100 or nothing, the verdict should have been for plaintiff for that amount, or for the defendant. The jury, as it had the right, believed a part of plaintiff\u2019s evidence and a part of defendant\u2019s evidence, andb their verdict is not against evidence or weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
