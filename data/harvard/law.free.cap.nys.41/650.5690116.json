The action was commenced to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien filed by the plaintiff against the defendant Dennis J. Menton, as contractor, against the property Nos. 503 to 507 West Fiftieth street, New York City, and subsequent to the filing of said lien the defendant Menton had the same discharged by the giving of a bond pursuant to the statute in such case made and provided. The plaintiff, in his complaint, alleges a verbal agreement to have been made on or about July 10, 1895, with the defendant Menton, who was the contractor with the owner,, whereby the plaintiff was -to furnish all the necessary materials for the roof, cornices, leader, and so forth, and the necessary labor for the fitting, etc., for the sum of $775; and on the trial, by his evidence,, he sustained that agreement. The defendant Menton\u2019s evidence on the trial proved that an agreement was made between him and the plaintiff for furnishing and tinning the roof, etc., as aforesaid, for the price of $775, but that the tin to be used in said work should be according to the specifications of the architect, to wit, \u201cMerry\u2019s Old Method\u201d tin. The plaintiff testified at the trial that he gave the' defendant Menton an estimate on the tin mentioned in the defendant Menton\u2019s estimate,\u2014on the tin mentioned in the architect\u2019s specifications, which was \u201cMerry\u2019s Old Method,\u201d for $998; that said defendant said that estimate was too high; that he replied, \u201cI can make it cheaper if you will allow me to use an inferior tin;\u201d that said defendant consented thereto, and the price was then reduced, and fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>upon at $775. The court, in its findings, finds that the said agreement was made between the parties at the agreed price of $775, and that the tin to be used was to be that stated in the specifications, to wit, \u201cMerry\u2019s Old Method\u201d tin. The court then finds that the plaintiff used, instead of \u201cMerry\u2019s Old Method\u201d tin, another and cheaper tin, the difference in price between the two grades being $105, which said $105 the court allowed to be deducted from the contractor\u2019s price of $775, besides $323 paid on account thereof, and gave judgment for the balance. This is an inconsistent finding, because, if the plaintiff performed his contract, as alleged in his complaint, and proved by his evidence on the trial, he is entitled to the contract price of $775, and no $105 should be deducted therefrom; and, if the plaintiff has not used the \u201cMerry\u2019s Old Method\u201d tin, then the plaintiff has failed to perform his contract, and cannot recover at all. As the findings now stand, the judgment based thereon could only be sustained if the findings contained an additional one, to wit, that after the contract, as found in said finding, was made, it was modified subsequently by allowing the plaintiff to use cheaper tin than \u201cMerry\u2019s Old Method\u201d tin.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">There being no such finding found by the court, the judgment cannot be sustained, and must be reversed, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
