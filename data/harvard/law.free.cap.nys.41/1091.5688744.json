The answer is a general denial. The proof upon the part of the plaintiff was of a substantial character, and tended to establish the allegations of the complaint. This proof was fully met by the denial of the defendant that he had spoken the words alleged. The issue was thus sharply defined between the parties, and the finding of the jury thereon is conclusive. The defendant insists that error was committed in the rejection of evidence upon the trial, and that the damages awarded are excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">The first error claimed arose in this wise: Defendant presented to plaintiff, upon cross-examination, a check drawn by plaintiff, and asked if he got the money on.the check. Objection was interposed, and the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-10\">\u201cIf this is to prove that he misappropriated the money, I will exclude it under the pleadings. Mr. Patterson: I will except to it. The Court: You say it is to prove that he misappropriated the money? Mr. Patterson: Yes, sir. The Court: I will exclude it. (Defendant excepts.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">The witness was then asked if he ever used money of defendant\u2019s for his own purposes, and replied that he did not. Again, he was asked if he ever obtained the \"money upon the check, and. upon objection the answer was excluded. It is clear that this testimony was not admissible under the issue as joined, and the ruling of the court was correct. It was offered for the sole purpose, as stated by counsel, of proving a justification, and for no other purpose. But it is now asserted that it was admissible upon the question of malice. It is not apparent how it bore thereon. If we could see that defendant spoke the words induced thereto by the fact that his money had been taken by the plaintiff, such evidence might be admissible upon' the question of defendant\u2019s malice. But here the answer made no such claim. The evidence was offered for an entirely different purpose, and defendant testified that he could not charge the plaintiff with having stolen from him. The fact, if it existed, was unknown to defendant, and therefore could not have influenced him in uttering the slander. The evidence given of the utterance of the slanderous words was within the time alleged in the complaint, and was, therefore, properly received. Distin v. Rose, 69 N. Y. 122. The damages are quite large, but we are unable to find legal ground for interference. Especially is this so as the jury have, upon two trials, found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>for plaintiff the same amount. The charge of the court saved to the defendant any possible right to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
