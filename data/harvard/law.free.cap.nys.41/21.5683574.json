J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS3\">As the action was for wages earned by a female employed other than as a domestic servant, and the amount of damages recovered was less than $10, plaintiff is entitled to $5 additional costs, and the justice should have inserted that amount in the judgment. Laws 1882, c. 410 (Consolidation Act) \u00a7\u00a7 1420, 1424. As the respondent does not dispute this, and there is no question upon which a new trial need be ordered, we shall direct that the judgment be modified by adding the $5 additional costs. Where there is a mere error in a matter of figures, and a new trial will not change the result, a judgment may be modified even by increasing the amount of the recovery. Golde v. Whipple, 7 App. Div. 48, 39 N. Y. Supp. 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">The judgment modified accordingly, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
