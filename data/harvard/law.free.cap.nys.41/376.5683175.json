The mistake was discovered after the defendant had answered and the action had been noticed and placed upon the calendar for trial. Then the plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to discontinue was. made, and granted on payment of \u00a710 costs. It is insisted on the part of the defendant that, as the action was one at law, he was entitled to the amount of costs which would have been taxable for the proceedings had up to that time if he had recovered judgment. In support of that view is cited Claflin v. Robertson (Sup.) 6 N. Y. Supp. 430. It cannot well be supposed that the court in that ease intended to hold that there was, on the question of costs, no discretion in the court on granting to a plaintiff leave to discontinue an action at law. The right to costs is dependent upon the statute, which provides that in such an action the defendant is entitled to specified costs upon the rendition of final judgment. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3229. This provision is not available to the defendant, as it is applicable only when such result is reached in an action. The terms or conditions on which the plaintiff\u2019s application should be granted were addressed to the discretion of the county court, and, leave being given to discontinue the action, the defendant\u2019s right to costs was derived from the order. Overton v. Bank, 3 N. Y. St. Rep. 109; De Bar ante v. Deyermand, 41 N. Y. 355. While it may be usual to require the payment of all accrued costs as a condition of allowing the discontinuance of an action on plaintiff\u2019s application, there may be cases where reasons appear to the court for imposing more moderate terms as to costs. In the present case there were some circumstances which may have been urged upon the application, and considered by the court, in support of the view there taken of it. The order appealed from was made by a court other than that in which the review is sought, and, as the discretionary power of that court is not deemed to have been arbitrarily exercised, the result given by the order should be permitted to remain. Tucker v. Pfau, 70 Hun, 59, 23 N. Y. Supp. 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The order should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
