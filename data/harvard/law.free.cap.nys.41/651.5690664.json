The plaintiff alleges in her complaint, and proves at the trial, a special agreement, engaging her services as an actress by the defendant, for the season from September 2, 1891, to April 5, 1895, or thereabouts, at a salary of $30 per week. The defendant, in his answer and at the trial, denied that any such agreement was made, and especially denied the duration of the said contract. The defendant, at the trial, offered to prove a uniform custom in the profession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>when an actress is engaged for an inferior character, such as the plaintiff, and the engagement is for the season, to have a contract in writing, with the clause reserving the right to either party to terminate the contract on two weeks\u2019 notice. The offer was objected to; the objection sustained; and the exception taken. The defendant, by the sixth request, requested the court to charge the substance of the said offer, which request was denied, and exception taken by the defendant. This brings up squarely the question whether the evidence should have been admitted or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The rule of law seems to be, in controversies where a special agreement is alleged to have been made on one side, and is denied on the other, that it is relevant to put in evidence any circumstances which tend to make the proposition at issue either more or less improbable; and this, not to change the contract, -but as evidence of what it was, and the probability that the agreement or one of the other was made. Barney v. Fuller, 133 N. Y. 605-607, 30 N. E. 1007, 1008; Rubino v. Scott, 118 N. Y. 662, 22 N. E. 1103; Ostrander v. Snyder, 73 Hun, 378-382, 26 N. Y. Supp. 263, 266; Cornell v. Markham, 19 Hun, 275, at page 276. On that rule, we think that the rejected evidence should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The exception being an error, judgment and order must be reversed, with costs to the appellant to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
