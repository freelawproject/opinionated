The affidavit on which said order was granted alleges that the defendant, the judgment debtor, was in the supreme court, part 1, on the 11th day of August, 3886, when said order in supplementary proceedings was served upon him; that he was then in actual attendance in said court, in his capacity as attorney, to answer to and argue a motion there and-then upon the calendar of such court, and pending. This, in our opinion, sufficiently establishes the fact that the said judgment debtor was then actually engaged in the discharge of his professional duties before the court. An attorney at law is an officer in a court of justice who is employed by a party in a cause to manage the same for him. 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 943. At common law, and prior to the Revised Statutes, an attorney was exempted from arrest or being sued during the actual sitting of the court of which he was an officer, if he was employed in some cause pending, and then to be heard in such court, \u201ceundo, morando, et redeundo,\u201d which means \u201cgoing, remaining, and returning.\u201d Gilbert v. Vanderpool, 15 Johns. 242; Van Alstyne v. Dearborn, 2 Wend. 586. But the Revised Statutes (part 3, c. 3, tit. 2, \u00a7 88, vol. 2, p. 290) changed the law so as to restrict the privilege so that they were \u201cexempt from arrest during the sitting of the court of which he was an officer,\u201d if he was \u201cemployed in some cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>pending and then to be heard in such court.\u201d While I cannot too strongty condemn the propriety of serving papers on an attorney in open court, I think such service is legal. The reason of the exemption prior to the Revised Statutes was \u201cnot to take away an attorney while in court in discharge of his duty, by a ca. sa., by which a suit was then instituted.\u201d Under the present procedure a service of a summons or order would not interfere with such a discharge of his duties. The reason for the exemption having ceased to exist, the maxim, \u201cCessante ratione, cessat lex,\u201d applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The order appealed from is therefore reversed, with costs, and the motion below is denied, without costs, and defendant is directed to attend and be examined pursuant to the order. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
