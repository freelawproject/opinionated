It was not error for the justice to allow testimony showing that, within a reasonable time before the time in question, like baskets fell from the machine in question, because it tended to prove the dangerous condition of said machine, and that, because of the lapse of time and the frequency \u25a0of such happenings, the defendants had constructive notice, at least, \u2022of such condition. The charge, we think, was very fair and impartial. If anything, it was rather in the defendants\u2019 favor. The trial justice several times charged that defendants were only required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>use reasonable care in the use of the machinery in question. The question of negligence of the defendants under the circumstances of this case was a question of fact for the jury, and the justice was right in refusing to dismiss the complaint; likewise was the question of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
