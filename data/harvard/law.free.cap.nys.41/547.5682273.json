J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG6\">The application by plaintiff for leave to prosecute as poor person was made under sections 458-460 of the Code, which permits such person, who alleges that he has a cause against another, to apply for such leave by a petition verified by his affidavit, or, if an infant under 14, then by his guardian\u2019s affidavit. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>460 provides that the court so petitioned, \u201cif satisfied of the truth of the facts alleged, and that the applicant has a good cause of action, may, by order, admit him' to prosecute as a poor person.\u201d The plaintiff's only proof of the truth of the facts alleged, and that she had a good cause of action, was by the complaint and petition, in both of which the cause of action was set forth in general terms, and upon information and belief, with no sources of information or grounds of belief stated, and both of which were verified by the affidavit of her guardian, and by the unverified certificate of her counsel. In opposition to plaintiff\u2019s application, the defendant submitted the affidavits, made upon the affiant\u2019s knowledge, of two eyewitnesses of the accident out of which plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was alleged to have arisen; and for some unexplained reason the plaintiff failed to make any reply whatever to these affidavits, and so left the truth of the positive averments of facts contained therein unchallenged, except so far as they might be deemed controverted by the allegations upon information of the complaint and petition. These affidavits, if stating the true facts of the accident, demonstrated not only that the defendant\u2019s driver was not guilty of negligence, but that plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries were caused solely by her own negligence in deliberately running under the wagon to recover a lost \u25a0ball with which she and a boy were playing. These unchallenged and uncontradicted averments should not have been disregarded upon such an application, made under the provision of that section of the Code, and such was the rule laid down in this court in Beyer v. Clark (Super. N. Y.) 22 N. Y. Supp. 540, in which the plaintiff was given two days within which to submit affidavits in opposition to those of defendant, and of which permission plaintiff availed herself. However, her application was denied, and she left this court <em>tb </em>begin her action anew in the superior court, where she secured a verdict, which, however, was set aside at the general term of that court, although the defendant had not taken an exception on the trial, upon the sole ground that her testimony was incredible. Beyer v. Clark (Super. N. Y.) 28 N. Y. Supp. 655. Although the plaintiff obtaining the order appealed from neglected, on the application at special term, to submit affidavits in opposition to those made on defend- \u25a0 ant\u2019s behalf, nevertheless she would have been granted leave there if requested, and will be here, to make reply to the affidavits of defendant. Her proof below shows that she is a poor person, and, if she has a good cause of action, she must have an opportunity to satisfy the court that she has, in order that she may be accorded the right to sue as a poor person vouchsafed to such person under the Code; and to that end the order appealed from will be reversed, without \u25a0costs, with leave to plaintiff to renew her motion upon same papers and such other affidavits as she may be advised.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
