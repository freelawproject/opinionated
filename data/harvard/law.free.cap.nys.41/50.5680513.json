After a careful reading of the record, we are satisfied that there was enough to go to the jury on both questions. There is no suggestion that the verdict was excessive. The case of McQuade v. Railway Co. (Sup.) 39 N. Y. Supp. 335, cited in behalf of the appellant, was so different from the present case in its facts that we do not see how it has any application to the' circumstances of a collision between a street car and a wagon. There the plaintiff, who was crossing the street on foot, with her head bundled up to protect her against the cold, unwittingly ran right into the side of the car. The case at bar presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>no feature analogous to this. In the case cited the New York appellate term refers to Omslaer v. Traction Co., 168 Pa. St., at page 521, 32 Atl. 51, with evident approval, and quotes therefrom as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cThe rule of \u2018stop, look, and listen\u2019 before attempting to cross the tracks of a steam railroad is inflexible, and nonobservance is negligence per se. Bomuch of this rule as requires a person about to cross the tracks of a steam railroad to look and listen to discover whether the' train is approaching is-applicable to the crossing of a street railway operated by cable or electricity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The learned counsel for the appellant copies this quotation in his brief, and the same passage has lately been brought to our attention by counsel in a number of other cases. It seems necessary, therefore, to point out that it is not a correct statement of the law in this state, so far as it declares it to be negligence per se on the part of a person who does not stop before attempting to cross the tracks of a steam railroad. The rule of \u201cstop, look, and listen\u201d prevails in Pennsylvania, but not in New York. Davis v. Railroad Co., 47 N. Y. 400. This hard and fast rule is justly criticised by Mr. C. Stuart Patterson, himself a Pennsylvanian, in his careful and useful treatise on Railway Accident Law (section 175), where he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201cThe Pennsylvania rule also goes further than that in most jurisdictions, in that it requires the person injured not only to look and listen, but also to stop; yet in most cases one who approaches the crossing of a railway line can effectually care for his safety by looking and listening, without stopping.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
