We find neither precedent or principle authorizing that part of the order. (19 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>9. 1 <em>Duer, </em>652. 1 <em>Kern. </em>575. 3 <em>R. S. </em>293.) The code (\u00a7 388) and the revised statutes have prescribed a mode in which the defendants and their witnesses can have an inspection of the draft, if necessary, here and within the jurisdiction of this <em>court; </em>but we see no <em>power </em>in the court to compel the plaintiffs to part with their property (the draft) in the manner and for the purposes contemplated by this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
