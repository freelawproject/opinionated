The action was upon a promissory note, for $641.25, made by the defendant on the 22d of May, 1855, payable to the order of the Atlas Mutual Insurance Co. twelve months after date. The action was tried at the blew York circuit, in February, 1858, before a justice of the court without a jury, a jury being waived. The court specified as the facts found, the following: That the promissory note on which the action was brought, was made and delivered by the defendant, Albus B. Blanchard, to the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, in payment of a premium for insurance. That said note was, with other notes, amounting to $20,307.50, on the 27th day of September, 1855, delivered, as per receipt of Wm. A. Brown, by the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, to the said Brown, as collateral security for payment of a loan of $20,000, on the day and at the time of such delivery, loaned by said Brown to the company. That said loan has not been paid. That said note was, at the time of the commencement of this action, held by the plaintiff. That the said note was, at the time of such delivery to Brown, indorsed as follows: \u201cPay for account of the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\">Geo.

That William A.

And the justice found as conclusions of law the following: That, hy reason of such indorsement, and the want of a resolution of the board of directors of the said Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, the title to said promissory note did not pass, and the property therein remained in the said Atlas Mutual Insurance Company. That the plaintiff was therefore not entitled to recover thereupon, and that the complaint in this action should be dismissed with costs. Judgment was thereupon, on the 13th day of March, 1858, entered, dismissing the complaint in this action, and for costs in favor of the defendant against the plaintiff, amounting to $75.16 as adjusted.</summary>\n<court data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b530-12\">[New York General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AWG\">May 7, 1860.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Anqn\"><em>Sutherland, Bonney </em>and <em>Mullin, </em>Justices.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-5\"><em>J. 8.
