Heard seeks to recover no-fault automobile liability insurance benefits for injuries suffered when he was struck by an automobile while he was pumping gasoline, at a self-service station, into a vehicle owned by him.

Those exceptions spell out when a parked vehicle is deemed to be in use as a motor vehicle; \"[e]ach exception pertains to injuries related to the character of a parked vehicle <em>as a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>motor vehicle </em>\u2014 characteristics which make it unlike other stationary roadside objects that can be involved in vehicle accidents\u201d. <em>Miller v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>411 Mich 633, 640; 309 NW2d 544 (1981). (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">At the time of the accident, Heard\u2019s vehicle was not in use as a motor vehicle; rather, it was like \"other stationary roadside objects that can be involved in vehicle accidents\u201d. Heard was entitled to PIP benefits from State Farm. \u00a7 3115(l)(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The disqualification of an uninsured owner from entitlement to no-fault benefits is not absolute. While the no-fault act does indeed provide that the owner of an uninsured \"motor vehicle involved in the accident\u201d is not entitled to recover PIP benefits, the converse is equally true: the owner of an uninsured vehicle <em>is </em>entitled to recover PIP benefits if his uninsured motor vehicle is <em>not </em>\"involved in the accident\u201d. An owner is entitled to PIP benefits, although he has not insured his vehicle, if he suffers injury in a motor vehicle accident while he is a pedestrian, a bicyclist, a motorcyclist, or a passenger in another vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Since the penalty for failing to purchase no-fault insurance is limited to disqualification for benefits when the uninsured vehicle is involved in the accident, it begs the question to argue that Heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>is \"seeking to take advantage\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of those who have, contributed to the system. Because Heard\u2019s uninsured vehicle was not involved in the accident and he was a pedestrian and not a motorist or occupant of a motor vehicle (or, if one prefers, he was more like a pedestrian than a motorist or occupant), he is as much entitled \u2014 under the terms and policies of the no-fault act \u2014 to recover from the insurer of the vehicle that struck him as is a pedestrian or motorcyclist who does not own an automobile (or a pedestrian or motorcyclist who does own an automobile but who, like Heard, has not purchased no-fault insurance) and who also has not contributed \"to the fund from which benefits are to be paid\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The dissenting opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\"To determine whether a vehicle is involved in an accident, it is necessary to decide the required causal relationship between the injury and the uninsured vehicle. We hold that when one is maintaining his vehicle at the time of an accident, as by pumping gasoline, and is pinned between his car and another car as a result of the accident, there is a sufficient causal connection between his injury and his automobile to constitute involvement. The mere fact that plaintiff\u2019s automobile was stationary does not mean that the vehicle was not involved. Physically, even if a motor vehicle hits a tree or pole, those things are 'involved\u2019 in the accident. If those things had not been at the scene, there might not have been any accident at all, and certainly any accident that did occur would be of a different nature without them. Therefore, plaintiff\u2019s automobile was involved in the accident, and thus, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>an uninsured motorist, plaintiff is precluded from recovering no-fault benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The liability of a no-fault insurer does not depend on there being a \"causal relationship\u201d between the accident or injury and a vehicle. While there is often a causal relationship between the insured vehicle and the accident, a no-fault insurer may be responsible although the insured vehicle is not a cause of the accident. For example, the no-fault insurer of an insured person is subject to liability if the insured person or certain members of his household suffer injury while pedestrians or occupants of other vehicles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Just as the absence of causal relationship or of its corollary, fault, does not necessarily relieve the no-fault insurer of liability, so too the presence of a \"causal relationship\u201d does not resolve the question whether a particular vehicle is \"involved\u201d for the purposes of the act. Whether a vehicle is \"involved\u201d cannot be determined by abstract reasoning or resort to dictionary definitions. It depends on the meaning derived from the purpose and structure of the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">While there will generally (perhaps always) be some causal relationship between the loss incurred and a \"vehicle involved in the accident\u201d, it does not follow that whenever there is any causal relationship the vehicle is \"involved\u201d. \"But for\u201d causal analysis would \"involve\u201d a vehicle which drops off a member of a car pool who, after he reaches the curb, is struck crossing a street; a vehicle which runs out of gas where a person who was an occupant is struck walking along the highway to a service station; and a vehicle left in a parking lot where a person who was an occupant is struck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>crossing the street. \"But for\u201d analysis could even involve a disabled automobile left at home occasioning the use of other transportation setting in motion a chain of events which lead to accidental injury of the owner of the disabled vehicle, members of his family and other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\"But for\u201d analysis can, indeed, be limited by interposing a requirement of physical proximity. Because Heard was pinned between his vehicle and the offending vehicle, his vehicle is involved; or because he, rather than a service station attendant, was pumping the gasoline, his vehicle is involved. Heard had, he testified on deposition, been leaning against his vehicle, and State Farm argues that for that reason also his vehicle is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">We are persuaded, however, on examination of the no-fault act as a whole, that disqualification for benefits and the distribution of losses between insurance carriers (which depends in some circumstances on the meaning given the term \"vehicle involved in the accident\u201d, see part <em>III) </em>were not meant to depend on such adventitious circumstances. Disqualification and loss distribution does not turn on whether a person is pinned against a gasoline pump, the wall of a service station, a tree, his vehicle, or another vehicle unless the vehicle is being used as a motor vehicle. When a vehicle is parked, it is deemed not to be in use as a motor vehicle, and, for purposes of the act, it is like a gasoline pump, the wall of a service station, or a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">This Court observed in <em>Miller v Auto-Owners, </em>p 639:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">\"Injuries involving parked vehicles do not normally involve the vehicle <em>as a motor vehicle. </em>Injuries involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ing parked vehicles typically involve the vehicle in much the same way as any other stationary object (such as a tree, sign post or boulder) would be involved. There is nothing about a parked vehicle <em>as a motor vehicle </em>that would bear on the accident.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">It is apparent, upon examination of the sections of the no-fault act other than \u00a7 3113 (concerning disqualification), that a parked motor vehicle is indeed regarded for purposes of the no-fault act as if it were a \"tree or a pole\u201d. Just as the owner of a tree or pole is not required to purchase no-fault insurance, neither is the insurer of a parked motor vehicle subject to liability for no-fault benefits unless one of the parked vehicle exceptions is applicable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">A basic principle of the no-fault act is that neither a motorist nor his no-fault insurer is subject to liability for damage to a moving vehicle,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but that his no-fault insurer is subject to liability for damage to a parked vehicle. That principle is expressed in language which indicates that a parked vehicle is not \"involved\u201d in an accident with a moving vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>A no-fault insurer is required to pay <em>property </em>protection insurance benefits for damage to tangible personal property (\u00a7 3121).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such benefits are not, however, payable for damage to motor vehicles and their contents \u2014 each owner is required to purchase his own collision insurance \u2014 \"unless the vehicle is parked in a manner as not to cause unreasonable risk of the damage which occurred\u201d. \u00a7 3123(l)(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These provisions of the no-fault act mean that the no-fault insurer of a moving vehicle which collides with a parked vehicle is obliged to pay, without regard to fault, property protection insurance benefits to the owner<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the parked vehicle for damage to the vehicle and its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In Miller, pp 639-640, fn 1, this Court said of \u00a7 3123(1)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\"Similarly, \u00a7 3123 of the act excludes damage to motor vehicles from the statutory obligation to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>benefits for damage to property, unless the motor vehicle is parked in a manner so as not to cause an unreasonable risk of the damage that occurs. MCL 500.3123(l)(a); MSA 24.13123(l)(a). A properly parked motor vehicle is thus treated under the act as non-vehicular property for purposes of the payment of property protection insurance benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The next subsection, 3123(1)(b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides that property protection insurance benefits are not payable for property owned by a person covered by a no-fault policy if such person was the owner or operator of a \"vehicle <em>involved </em>in the motor vehicle accident out of which the property damage arose\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">It thus appears that subdivisions (a) and (b) of \u00a7 3123(1) are complementary. A no-fault insurer is not required to pay property protection benefits for damage to a motor vehicle or its contents. Nor is it required to pay such benefits for personalty owned by a person covered by a no-fault policy in respect to an owned or operated \"vehicle involved in the motor vehicle accident out of which the property damage arose\u201d. Nevertheless, the no-fault insurer of a moving vehicle that strikes a parked vehicle is subject to liability for damage to contents as well as for damage to the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Reading the two subdivisions together, a parked vehicle is not \"involved in the motor vehicle accident out of which the property damage arose\u201d. If a parked vehicle were held to be involved in a motor vehicle accident, the operative effect of \"and their contents\u201d (\u00a7 3123[l][a]) would be largely eliminated because, under \u00a7 3123(l)(b), benefits are not payable for personalty (contents) located in an involved vehicle owned or operated by a person (or family members domiciled in his household) cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ered by no-fault insurance. The incongruous result of such a construction would be that while the insured owner of a parked vehicle is entitled to recover (without regard to fault) for loss of the vehicle, neither he nor any family member domiciled in his household could recover for loss of the contents of the vehicle, and a non-family member alone could recover (without regard to fault) for contents left in the parked vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Nor would the proffered construction be consistent with \u00a7 3125 which states that a person suffering accidental <em>property </em>damage shall claim property protection insurance benefits from the insurers of owners (or of operators) of \"vehicles <em>involved </em>in the accident\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.) Under the proffered construction, the no-fault insurer of the parked vehicle would contribute to the cost of reimbursing its insured for damage to the parked vehicle and its contents although a principle of the act is that a no-fault insurer has no liability to its insured for property damage unless he chooses to purchase collision or other insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Another section of the act, \u00a7 3115(1), provides that a person who is not covered by a no-fault policy who suffers accidental bodily injury while not an occupant of a motor vehicle is entitled to PIP benefits from insurers of owners (or of operators) of \"motor vehicles <em>involved </em>in the accident\u201d,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>(Emphasis supplied.) Suppose a motor vehicle collides with the rear of a properly parked vehicle which moves forward and strikes a pedestrian who is not insured. In the circumstance where another vehicle is involved, it is opposed to a principle of the no-fault act to require the insurer of the parked vehicle \u2014 regarded under the act as a \"stationary roadside object\u201d, <em>Miller v Auto-Owners, supra, </em>p 640 \u2014 to contribute to the payment of PIP benefits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The construction which we believe to be correct is consistent with \u00a7 3111 which makes PIP benefits portable throughout the United States and Canada for persons covered by a no-fault policy and for occupants of a \"vehicle <em>involved </em>in the accident\u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.) By reason of the exceptions to the parked vehicle provision, a parked vehicle is deemed to be involved in the accident where the injury was sustained by a person while \"occupying\u201d a vehicle. \u00a7 3106(l)(c). In such a case, the injury is sustained as a result of the use of the vehicle as a motor vehicle. The vehicle, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>parked, is not a tree or a pole insofar as the occupant is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We have considered whether this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller v Auto-Owners </em>requires a different result. In <em>Miller, </em>this Court held that an insured owner is entitled to PIP benefits for injuries arising from the maintenance of his vehicle whether it is deemed to have been parked or not. <em>Miller </em>concerned a situation where no vehicle was involved in the accident unless it was the insured\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Where no-fault liability arises from maintenance, the injury results from use of the vehicle as a motor vehicle, as when a battery or fuel line explodes or, as in <em>Miller, </em>a vehicle falls upon and injures a person. Heard\u2019s injury did not arise from the maintenance or use of an uninsured vehicle as a motor vehicle, but from the operation and use of the vehicle insured by State Farm as a motor vehicle. The only vehicle being used as a motor vehicle at the time of the accident was the vehicle insured by State Farm. Heard\u2019s vehicle was a \"tree or pole\u201d for purposes of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">We reverse and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-8\">Kavanagh, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\"> \"Sec. 3113.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, concluding that the proximity to and association of the plaintiff with the uninsured vehicle was such that the vehicle was \"involved\u201d in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in a 2 to 1 opinion. <em>Heard v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>93 Mich App 50; 286 NW2d 46 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">II. Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Resolution of this case requires this Court to decide whether the statutory language of MCL 500.3113; MSA 24.13113, which provides that an uninsured motorist is precluded from recovering no-fault benefits if his vehicle is \"involved\u201d in an accident, applies to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">This case presents an issue of first impression regarding the interpretation of the word \"involved\u201d as used in \u00a7 3113 of the no-fault act. Section 3113 provides that no-fault benefits shall not be recovered if the owner of the vehicle \"involved\u201d in the accident was uninsured at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">To determine whether a vehicle is involved in an accident, it is necessary to decide the required causal relationship between the injury and the uninsured vehicle. We would hold that when one is maintaining his vehicle at the time of an accident, as by pumping gasoline, and is pinned between his car and another car as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>accident,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there is a sufficient causal connection between his injury and his automobile to constitute involvement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The mere fact that plaintiffs automobile was stationary does not mean that the vehicle was not involved. Physically, even if a motor vehicle hits a tree or pole, those things are \"involved\u201d in the accident. If those things had not been at the scene, there might not have been any accident at all, and certainly any accident that did occur would be of a different nature without them. Therefore, plaintiffs automobile was involved in the accident, and thus, as an uninsured motorist, plaintiff is precluded from recovering no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">IV. Public Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">While we understand that to so construe the term \"involved\u201d, as we have here, precludes plaintiff from collecting no-fault benefits,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we feel it is in accord with the legislative intent. The no-fault act was: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the long payment delays, inequitable payment structure, and high legal costs inherent in the tort (or 'fault\u2019) liability system. The goal of the no-fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses. The Legislature believed this goal could be most effectively achieved through a system of <em>compulsory </em>insurance, whereby every Michigan motorist would be required to purchase no-fault insurance or be unable to operate a motor vehicle legally in this state. Under this system, victims of motor vehicle accidents would receive insurance benefits for their injuries as a substitute for their common-law remedy in tort.\u201d <em>Shavers v Attorney </em>General, 402 Mich 554, 578-579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\"offered as an innovative social and legal response to</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Thus, the no-fault scheme contemplates that every individual owner will have insurance in order to take advantage of the benefits under this system.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">As a corollary, the act provides for certain penalties and exclusions for those who are uninsured. See MCL 500.3102(2); MSA 24.13102(2), MCL 500.3113; MSA 24.13113. The penalties and exclusions are necessary in order to encourage owners and registrants to obtain insurance so that the no-fault scheme can operate as contemplated. Thus, it is important that the penalties and exclusions be given their full force to achieve the goals of the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Another important goal of the no-fault act is that of cost reduction. An important aspect of reducing costs is assuring that benefits be paid only to those entitled to such benefits under the statute. In this case, if plaintiff were insured, he would, as a contributing member to the fund from which benefits are to be paid, be entitled to recover benefits. However, in this case plaintiff was not insured. He was not a contributor to the success of the no-fault scheme. Rather, by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>lawsuit, he was seeking to take advantage of those who had contributed. We find that the exclusion of \u00a7 3113 is applicable and thus precludes plaintiff from recovering and taking advantage of the contributing members. Obviously, to accomplish the goal of cost reduction, it is essential to give effect to the statutory exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was properly granted and affirmed in this case. The statutory language of \u00a7 3113, as well as the legislative intent and policy of the no-fault scheme as a whole, supports our conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s vehicle, under the facts in this case, was \"involved\u201d in the accident. The decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed, but in part for different reasons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b271-7\">Coleman, C.J., and Fitzgerald, J., concurred with Williams, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> Section 3113 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\"A person is not entitled to be paid personal protection insurance benefits for accidental bodily injury if at the time of the accident any of the following circumstances existed:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\"(b) The person was the owner or registrant of a motor vehicle <em>involved </em>in the accident with respect to which the security required by subsections (3) and (4) of section 3101 was not in effect.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\"> Plaintiff testified in his deposition that he was standing behind his car when another vehicle struck him from behind and pinned him between the two cars. He states these same facts in response to several different questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> We do not hold that physical contact between two cars in an accident is required in order for a motor vehicle to be \"involved\u201d in the accident. The fact that the injured person was pinned between the two cars is enough, regardless of whether the two cars happen to come into contact with each other. In another context, this Court held that physical contact was not mandatory to fall under the \"occupying\u201d language of an automobile insurance policy. <em>Nickerson v Citizens Mutual Ins Co, </em>393 Mich 324; 224 NW2d 896 (1975). Otherwise, recovery and, in this case, denial of recovery will be based on \"fortuitous circumstances\u201d. Whether the bumpers actually come in contact or not should not be the decisive factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\"><em> </em>While it precludes an uninsured person from recovering under these circumstances, our interpretation would permit an insured person to collect from his own insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\"> We find that plaintiffs car was involved in the accident. Unlike the Court of Appeals, however, we do not rely on MCL 500.3106; MSA 24.13106 relative to parked motor vehicles. A discussion of this section is not necessary in order to reach our conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
