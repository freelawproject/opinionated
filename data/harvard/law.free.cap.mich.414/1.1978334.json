Plaintiff argues increases in the cost of living affect both classes alike. However, we find that the greater pecuniary benefit provided by survivors\u2019 loss benefits supports the legislative decision to provide cost-of-living increases for work loss benefits but not for survivors\u2019 loss benefits. Therefore, we hold that there is no lack of equal protection and that there was due process. We reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Since we have reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, the plaintiff is not entitled to the interest requested or attorney fees. We remand the case to the trial court for computation of survivors\u2019 loss benefits not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s husband was killed in a motor vehicle accident on August 7, 1975. The decedent had been insured by the defendant at the time of his death. Defendant was prepared to pay plaintiff, as survivor, the $1,000 maximum benefit authorized by MCL 500.3108; MSA 24.13108<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as the earnings of plaintiff\u2019s decedent entitled her to that amount. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>dispute arose between plaintiff and defendant over the proper amount. Plaintiff filed suit in the Jackson Circuit Court, alleging that she was entitled to the maximum amount of benefits adjusted to $1,-111 per month because of increases in the cost-of-living index as computed by the insurance commissioner. At the time of the accident, \u00a7 3108 did not contain the proviso which subsequently mandated that survivors\u2019 loss benefits reflect changes for increases in cost of living.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff also alleged that the amount of benefits to be paid under \u00a7 3108 did not have to be set off by social security and veterans\u2019 benefits received by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The trial court ruled that the no-fault set-off provision was unconstitutional, since the Court of Appeals had so held in <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>70 Mich App 487; 245 NW2d 801 (1976). It also awarded the plaintiff $1,111 for each 30-day period \u2014 the amount her husband would have been entitled to receive under MCL 500.3107(b); MSA 24.13107(b) if he had survived, but was disabled because of a motor vehicle accident. Section 3107(b) has always been adjusted for increases in cost of living.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>court agreed with the plaintiff that the distinction between work loss benefits and survivors\u2019 loss benefits violated the principle of equal protection of law and that the cost-of-living increase provided under \u00a7 3107(b) should also apply to \u00a7 3108.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979), this Court overruled the Court of Appeals by holding that the set-off provision of the act was constitutional. In 1978, the Legislature amended \u00a7 3108 so as to include cost-of-living increases in survivors\u2019 loss benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">On January 11, 1979, plaintiff filed a motion to enforce its earlier judgment in the trial court, claiming that the defendant had not paid the $1,111 for each 30-day period along with interest and attorney fees as ordered by the court. The trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to enforce the judgment in an opinion dated March 14, 1979. The opinion also indicated that the parties had agreed between themselves as to how to deal with the set-off issue subsequent to this Court\u2019s holding in <em>O\u2019Donnell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The Court of Appeals granted the defendant\u2019s delayed application for leave to appeal. It affirmed in a per curiam opinion since it found no reasonable relation between the no-fault compensation objectives and the cost-of-living distinction, in \u00a7 3108. <em>Davey v DAIIE, </em>98 Mich App 123; 296 NW2d 12 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal on May 8, 1981. 411 Mich 900 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>II. Equal Protection and Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The basic issue in the instant appeal is whether the legislative classification denying cost-of-living adjustments to recipients of <em>survivors\u2019 </em>loss benefits under MCL 500.3108; MSA 24.13108, while allowing such adjustments to recipients of <em>work </em>loss benefits under MCL 500.3107; MSA 24.13107, constitutes a denial of due process or equal protection of law under the state and federal constitutions. Before identifying and applying the proper test of judicial review in determining the constitutional propriety of this classification, an explication of the arguments of the parties may aid in understanding our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">A. <em>The Contentions of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The plaintiff contends that the no-fault statutory scheme arbitrarily creates two classes of people. One class is made up of persons suffering non-fatal injuries in motor vehicle accidents \u2014 along with the dependents of the injured insured. MCL 500.3107(b); MSA 24.13107(b). The other legislative class of people is the surviving dependents of persons suffering fatal injuries in motor vehicle accidents. MCL 500.3108; MSA 24.13108.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">At the time of the adoption of the no-fault act, the maximum amount payable to both groups in any 30-day period was $1,000. Section 3107(b), authorizing the payment of <em>work </em>loss benefits, stated that such benefits should also reflect annual changes in the cost of living. At the time the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was killed in a motor vehicle accident, \u00a7 3108, <em>survivors\u2019 </em>loss benefits, had not yet been amended to include such an adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Plaintiff argues that the compensable loss suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>fered by survivors of a person killed in an automobile accident is subject to the same inflationary pressures as the compensable loss suffered by an injured person and his dependents in a non-fatal automobile accident. Plaintiff further argues that unless the defendant can demonstrate that survivors are less subject to inflationary pressures as compared to persons receiving work loss benefits, this Court should find no rational basis for that distinction. Moreover, the plaintiff believes that her conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the Legislature, after this claim arose, amended \u00a7 3108 to include cost-of-living adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The defendant contends, however, that there is justification in treating the recipients of survivors\u2019 loss benefits differently from the recipients of work loss benefits. The justification is the greater relative compensation for a family when the insured dies as compared with the compensation when the insured does not die. The defendant argues that the recipients of survivors\u2019 loss benefits receive more spendable compensation than do recipients of work loss benefits because in the case of survivors there is one less person to share the compensation. Under the defendant\u2019s reading of the act, the legislative distinction is reasonably related to the objectives of the no-fault scheme which are to provide adequate and prompt reparation while containing the cost of premiums of no-fault automobile insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">B. <em>The Proper Constitutional Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">In determining whether socioeconomic legislation like the no-fault act is constitutionally sound, this Court has fashioned a constitutional test, supported by federal case law, which requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>court to look at both the legislative objectives to be achieved and the legislative means to be used. See <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The proper test for judging socioeconomic legislation such as the no-fault act was stated in <em>Shavers </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">\"The test to determine whether legislation enacted pursuant to the police power comports with due process is whether the legislation bears a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\"The test to determine whether a statute enacted pursuant to the police power comports with equal protection is, essentially, the same.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">In the application of these tests, the challenged legislative scheme is given a presumption of constitutionality. 402 Mich 612-613.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">C. <em>Establishing Permissible Objectives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Enactment of the no-fault act was a major departure from prior methods of obtaining reparation for injuries suffered in motor vehicle accidents. The Legislature modified traditional tort principles of compensation by creating a comprehensive statutory scheme of reparation with the objective of providing assured, adequate and prompt recovery for certain economic losses arising from motor vehicle accidents. <em>Miller v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 538, 568; 302 NW2d 537 (1981); <em>Belcher v Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co, </em>409 Mich 231, 243; 293 NW2d 594 (1980); <em>Shavers, supra, </em>579. We have also recognized a complementary legislative objective which is the containment of the premium costs of no-fault insurance. <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, supra, </em>404 Mich 549, 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>D. <em>Applying the Reasonable Relation Test to \u00a73108</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">It is well-established that the party challenging the constitutional propriety of socioeconomic legislation under the reasonable relation test must show that the legislative scheme is without \"reasonable justification\u201d. See <em>Manistee Bank &amp; Trust Co v McGowan, </em>394 Mich 655, 668; 232 NW2d 636 (1975). Since the permissible objective is to provide assured, adequate and prompt recovery for certain economic losses arising from motor vehicle accidents, it cannot be successfully argued that the benefits provided in \u00a7 3108 are not reasonably related to the permissible objective of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Plaintiff does not appear to deny that the provision of such benefits satisfies due process, but rather focuses on an alleged lack of equal protection. Plaintiff in effect argues that classifying recipients of survivors\u2019 loss benefits under \u00a7 3108 in a different category from recipients of work loss benefits under \u00a7 3107(b), who receive cost-of-living increases which recipients of survivors\u2019 loss benefits do not, is arbitrary, because both alike are subject to cost-of-living increases. By this argument, plaintiff attempts to satisfy the obligation to show that the legislative scheme is without \"reasonable justification\u201d and to cast the burden of showing reasonableness on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">While plaintiff states a patent truism that the Legislature might wish to consider and, in fact, subsequently did consider, that truism by itself does not meet the requirement for a due process or equal protection challenge. In the face of a due process or equal protection challenge, this Court has stated that its inquiry into a legislative action or judgment is restricted to a determination whether \" 'any state of facts either known or which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>could reasonably be assumed affords support for it\u2019 [citation omitted]. A corollary to this rule is that where the legislative judgment <em>is supported by 'any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed/ </em>although such facts may be 'debatable\u2019, the legislative judgment must be accepted\u201d. Shavers, <em>supra, </em>613-614. (Emphasis in original.) Plaintiff\u2019s argument does not meet these tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As a matter of fact, defendant points out that there are indeed two distinguishing features between the two categories that could justify the Legislature\u2019s discretion in treating them differently. First, under \u00a7 3107(b), the beneficiaries other than the injured party have their share of the benefits reduced by the requirements of the injured party, whereas under \u00a7 3108 the injured party is deceased and has no such requirements. Second, as we pointed out in Miller, survivors\u2019 loss benefits, by definition, are broader than work loss benefits in providing compensation, because survivors\u2019 loss benefits encompass the value of items apart from and in addition to salary and wages. This legislative difference led this Court to state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\"Since survivors\u2019 loss benefits will, in many cases, include the value of items other than taxable wage or salary income, while work loss benefits are limited to wage or salary income, reliance on the language of \u00a7 3107(b) in the construction of \u00a7 3108 is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>564.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">We are compelled to assume such a state of facts, and, thus, we hold that the payment of survivors\u2019 loss benefits without an adjustment for cost-of-living increases is reasonably related to the statutory objective of containing no-fault insurance premi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ums under the state and federal constitutions. See <em>Shavers, supra, </em>613-614.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In light of our reading of \u00a7 3107(b) (work loss benefits) and \u00a7 3108 (survivors\u2019 loss benefits), we hold that the exclusion of cost-of-living adjustments from plaintiffs survivors\u2019 loss benefits is reasonably related to the permissible objectives of the no-fault act under the state and federal constitutions. Moreover, the distinction does not violate equal protection or due process of law solely because the Legislature amended \u00a7 3108 to include cost-of-living adjustments after the plaintiff was entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed. We remand the case to the trial court for computation of survivors\u2019 loss benefits not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Because we have reversed the Court of Appeals affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgment, the plaintiff is not entitled to interest or attorney fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b125-9\">Coleman, C.J., and Kavanagh, Levin, Fitzgerald, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\"> MCL 500.3108; MSA 24.13108 as originally enacted read:</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">\"Personal protection insurance benefits are payable for a survivors\u2019 loss which consists of a loss, after the date on which the deceased died, of contributions of tangible things of economic value, not including services, that dependents of the deceased at the time of his death would have received for support during their dependency from the deceased if he had not suffered the accidental bodily injury causing death and expenses, not exceeding $20.00 per day, reasonably incurred by these dependents during their dependency and after the date on which the deceased died in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those that the deceased would have performed for their benefit if he had not suffered the injury causing death.

See fn 2. See also <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979).

Work loss does not include any loss after the date on which the injured person dies.

The most reasonable construction of the legislative action in amending MCL 500.3108; MSA 24.13108 to provide for cost-of-living increases for survivors\u2019 loss benefits as well as for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>work loss benefits is that it represents an attempt to quickly clarify the original meaning of the no-fault insurance act rather than to substantively change the law. Therefore, plaintiff is entitled to cost-of-living increases on the benefits awarded to her as her husband\u2019s survivor, as initially intended by the Legislature. Given this view, there is no need for this Court to address the equal protection and due process arguments advanced by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In discussing the effect of an amendment upon the interpretation of a statute, this Court has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\"While in many and perhaps most instances it undoubtedly is the legislative intent, in enacting an amendment, to change existing law, there are, as undoubtedly, other instances, particularly if uncertainty exists as to the meaning of a statute, when amendments are adopted for the purpose of making plain what the legislative intent had been all along from the time of the statute\u2019s original enactment.\u201d <em>Detroit Edison Co v Janosz, </em>350 Mich 606, 614; 87 NW2d 126 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The uncertainty in the construction of MCL 500.3108; MSA 24.13108 as compared to MCL 500.3107(b); MSA 24.13107(b) is demonstrated by the very existence of this litigation. It is also illustrated by the difficulty the majority has in attempting to explain why the Legislature might have distinguished between work loss benefits and survivors\u2019 loss benefits in terms of cost-of-living increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Further, the relative speed with which the Legislature acted when the issue arose lends support to the conviction that the amendment was not meant to change the law but rather to correct an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>unintended mistake or ambiguity. Finally, the enactment of the amendment indicates that the application of cost-of-living increases to plaintiff\u2019s award would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the trial court to require payments of cost-of-living increases for plaintiff\u2019s no-fault survivors\u2019 loss benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
