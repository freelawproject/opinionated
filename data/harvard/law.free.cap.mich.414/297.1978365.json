Komar. Ms. Hubbard\u2019s father was named administrator of her estate, and he filed this action under the wrongful death provisions of MCL 600.2922; MSA 27A.2922. His complaint sought damages for funeral and burial expenses, for Ms. Hubbard\u2019s pain and suffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ing preceding her death, and for the personal losses of society and companionship sustained by Ms. Hubbard\u2019s five surviving brothers and sisters, her father and her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The defendants admitted liability, and the case was tried to a jury on the issue of damages. At trial, defendants objected to plaintiffs claims on behalf of Ms. Hubbard\u2019s siblings, asserting that the statute precluded them from recovering. The trial judge disagreed, permitted the plaintiff to submit evidence of the loss suffered by all family members and submitted a special verdict form to the jury which was returned after having been completed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\"Form of Verdict</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">\"We, the Jury, Find the Following Damages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">\"1.

Taking into account the unchallenged post-judgment <em>remittitur </em>of $5,000, the amount of the greatest judgment supported by the law is $31,433.55.9</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\"9 The statute is silent on the propriety of such individualized jury 'verdicts\u2019 as were employed in the case at bar. Clearly, such a statement from a jury can never be more than advisory. The trial judge is never released from his obligation to 'advise the probate court by <em>written opinion\u2019 </em>of the proportion of losses suffered by each surviving next of kin. Nor is the probate court ever freed from its obligation to finally determine that apportionment. MCL 600.2922; MSA 27A.2922. Because the courts\u2019 duties of apportionment do not appear to be for the benefit of defendants or of administrators <em>qua </em>administrators, the trial court\u2019s practice can have done no harm to the parties before the court in the case at bar. <em>Cf. Hix v Besser Co, </em>386 Mich 499; 194 NW2d 333 (1972).\u201d 92 Mich App 249.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>As is evident from the quoted footnote, the Court of Appeals considered defendants\u2019 second claim of error and rejected the contention that the trial judge erred in submitting the special verdict form to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">By the same token, the Court of Appeals statement that \"the amount of the greatest judgment supported by law is $31,433.55\u201d is at least an implicit indication of the Court\u2019s rejection of defendants\u2019 claim that the $10,000 award for pain and suffering was excessive and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Defendants have done nothing to pursue either of these latter two claims since the submission of their brief to the Court of Appeals. Contrary to the assertions made in their brief to this Court, nothing in our order granting leave precluded them from advancing those claims here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because they are not asserted here, we do not consider these claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">We turn then to decide whether the brothers and sisters of a person suffering death wrongfully at the hands of another are entitled to seek damages for loss of society and companionship in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>where the decedent has left a surviving spouse and parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Resolution of the issue begins with an interpretation of the meaning of the following statutory passage from \u00a7 2922:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">\"(2) Every such action shall be brought by, and in the names of, the personal representatives of such deceased person, and in every such action the court or jury may give such damages, as, the court or jury, shall deem fair and just, under all of the circumstances to those persons who may be entitled to such damages when recovered including damages for the reasonable medical, hospital, funeral and burial expenses for which the estate is liable and reasonable compensation for the pain and suffering, while conscious, undergone by such deceased person during the period intervening between the time of the inflicting of such injuries and his death. The amount of damages recoverable by civil action for death caused by the wrongful act, neglect or fault of another may also include recovery for the loss of the society and companionship of the deceased. <em>Such person or persons entitled to such damages shall be of that class who, by law, would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate. The amount recovered in every such action shall be distributed to the surviving spouse and next of kin who suffered injury and in proportion thereto. </em>Within 30 days after the entry of such judgment, the judge before whom such case was tried or his successor shall certify to the probate court having jurisdiction of the estate of such deceased person the amount and date of entry thereof, and shall advise the probate court by written opinion as to the amount thereof representing the loss suffered by the surviving spouse and all of the next of kin, and the proportion of such total loss suffered by the surviving spouse and each of the next of kin of such deceased person, as shown by the evidence. After providing for the payment of the reasonable medical, hospital, funeral and burial expenses for which the estate is liable, the probate court shall determine as provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>law the manner in which the amount representing the total loss suffered by the surviving spouse and next of kin shall be distributed, and the proportionate share thereof to be distributed to the surviving spouse and the next of kin. The remainder of the proceeds of such judgment shall be distributed according to the intestate laws.\u201d MCL 600.2922(2); MSA 27A.2922(2). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Our focus is directed primarily toward the emphasized damage entitlement and distribution language, creating a right to seek damages on behalf of that \"class who * * * would be entitled to inherit * * * had [the deceased] died intestate\u201d and providing for distribution of damages to the \"surviving spouse and next of kin\u201d who suffered injury \"and in proportion thereto\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The primary and generally understood meaning of that critical statutory language, construed in light of the effect of its practical application taken together with our assessment of the historical development of \u00a7 2922, and the case law construing its evolving provisions, including the legislative reaction thereto, lead us to conclude that the Legislature\u2019s purpose would be defeated by the Court of Appeals interpretation of \u00a7 2922. We are convinced that the Legislature never intended, in a case such as this one, to limit the right to seek damages for wrongful death to the actual \"heirs at law\u201d by which is meant those persons who are the nearest of kin actually surviving decedent who would be entitled to inherit pursuant to our law of descent and distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">A satisfactory answer to the stated issue is not plainly evident merely upon examination of the naked and somewhat opaque language of the statute. The critical language quoted and emphasized is abstruse and uninstructive, for although it iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>tifies the persons who are entitled to damages for the wrongful death of another as \"the class\u201d who, by law, would be entitled to inherit had the decedent died intestate, it provides no enlightenment to determine <em>when </em>that class is to be identified. Does the statute itself establish the class? In other words, should the language be interpreted as establishing, at the time of enactment, a class of persons entitled to seek recovery which includes all those who, under the countless varying possibilities which might exist in the future at the time of a decedent\u2019s wrongful death, would be eligible to inherit under Michigan\u2019s intestacy laws? If that is the case, Ms. Hubbard\u2019s brothers and sisters are entitled to the recovery awarded to them for Ms. Hubbard\u2019s death. Or does the statute mean that the \"class\u201d named in the statute is left open to be defined only in the future at the actual time of decedent\u2019s death and depending upon the particular legal relationship of the surviving relatives in a particular case? If that is the case, Ms. Hubbard\u2019s surviving parents alone would be entitled to seek damages;</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The search for an answer to these questions is not benefited by resort to the expressions \"surviving spouse\u201d and \"next of kin\u201d which immediately follow the statute\u2019s use of the term \"class\u201d and are repeated throughout the statute\u2019s distribution provisions. Alone or in context, those terms, without more, are unenlightening.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">We are convinced that the statutory language in question, construed in the light of its legislative history and read against the illuminating background of this Court\u2019s decisions, means that the \"class\u201d entitled to seek damages includes at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the \"surviving spouse and next of kin\u201d to whom distribution was ordered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We conclude, first of all, that the Legislature intended that the term \"class\u201d includes <em>at least </em>\"the surviving spouse and next of kin who suffered injury\u201d as a result of the wrongful death of another. We think that much is plain from the Legislature\u2019s reaction in 1939 to the decision in <em>In re Venneman\u2019s Estate, </em>286 Mich 368; 282 NW 180 (1938), in amending the death act, 1939 PA 297, in a way clearly designed to authorize the distribution of an award to the individual who actually suffered a pecuniary loss as a result of the wrongful death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In <em>Venneman, </em>the deceased\u2019s adult son by a former marriage, who made no claim of pecuniary injury, was entitled to share half of a $4,000 settlement paid to the surviving widow. The prior statute, which was in effect at the time <em>Venneman </em>was decided, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\"Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default, and the act, neglect or default is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages, in respect thereof, then and in every such case, the person who, or the corporation which would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">\"Every such action shall be brought by, and in the names of, the personal representatives of such deceased person, <em>and the amount recovered in every such action, shall be distributed to the persons and in the proportions provided by law in relation to the distribution of personal property left by persons dying intestate; </em>and in every such action the jury may give such damages as they shall deem fair and just, with reference to the pecuniary injury resulting from such death, to those persons who may be entitled to such damages when recovered.\u201d 1929 CL 14061, 14062. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In a unanimous opinion for the Court in <em>Venneman, </em>Justice North interpreted this statute as first requiring a determination of the amount of the pecuniary injury resulting from a wrongful death, then requiring distribution of that amount to intestate heirs without regard to actual injury. As Justice Adams pointed out some time later in his dissent in <em>Breckon v Franklin Fuel Co, </em>383 Mich 251, 282; 174 NW2d 836 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\"In effect, the Court determined [in <em>Venneman] </em>that the damages recovered under the provisions of the death act as then in force were to be distributed among the beneficiaries not according to damage suffered by each of them but according to the proportions fixed by the statute of descent and distribution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">As indicated, in apparent response to the perceived injustice of the result in that case, the Legislature, in 1939, amended the damages and distribution portion of \u00a7 2922 to authorize distribution of an award only to those persons actually injured by a wrongful death and entitled to seek a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>If we were now to construe the \"surviving spouse and next of kin\u201d entitled <em>to the distribution </em>of any injury award as consisting of a category of persons different than those entitled <em>to seek </em>wrongful death damages \u2014 the \"class who * * * would be entitled to inherit * * * had [the deceased] died intestate\u201d \u2014 we would be resurrecting a dichotomy between those entitled to generate a wrongful death award and those entitled to its distribution, which was abrogated by legislation in 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Therefore, we are inclined to believe that the expression \"next of kin\u201d, as used in the statute, was intended by the Legislature to mean such persons within the eligible \"class\u201d as can prove a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">That is not the end of our task, however, because the expression \"next of kin\u201d is an inexact, even ambiguous phrase. Does it mean nearest relatives or all relatives? The ambiguities inherent in the expressions \"class\u201d and \"next of kin\u201d as contextually employed by the Legislature in \u00a7 2922(2) requires us to turn elsewhere to discern the will of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">All parties and the Court of Appeals recognize the importance of what was said in <em>MacDonald v Quimby, </em>350 Mich 21; 85 NW2d 157 (1957), as bearing on the proper interpretation of \u00a72922(2). We find that opinion to be of major significance to the resolution of the issue presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Plaintiff claims that <em>MacDonald </em>clearly \"negated the contention that recovery in a wrongful death action is limited * * * to <em>qualifying </em>[as opposed to potential] 'heirs at law\u2019 \u201d, since that Court permitted the decedent\u2019s mother to intervene in the wrongful death action despite the survival <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of the decedent\u2019s spouse and children. He assigns special significance to the passage by Justice Kelly in <em>MacDonald </em>which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\"The petitioning mother was of a class who would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate. The fact that she would not inherit if he died intestate leaving a wife and children would not eliminate her from that class.\u201d 350 Mich 32.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">While at first glance the Court\u2019s statement seems confusing, even contradictory, its meaning becomes clearer when considered in light of the specific issue facing the <em>MacDonald </em>Court and indeed facing us in this case, <em>viz., </em>what is the frame of reference which defines the category of persons the Legislature has called \"the class * * * entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate\u201d? Is \"the class\u201d a universal legal concept intended by the Legislature to mean the broadest group of persons legally authorized to inherit the property of an intestate deceased in a theoretical case, or only those persons who, by reason of the fortuitous circumstances of the size and composition of a particular family and the legal relationship of its members, are actually eligible to inherit the deceased\u2019s property to the exclusion of other relatives lesser ranked in the table of descent and distribution?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Writing for the majority in <em>MacDonald, </em>Justice Kelly plainly was of the view that \"the class\u201d meant the broader, theoretical group of potential heirs. Since, in that case, the deceased\u2019s mother was a member of that category, she was entitled to attempt to prove her pecuniary loss, despite being actually excluded from the category of those entitled to inherit her son\u2019s property because of the happenstance in that case of the existence of a <em>closer </em>heir, the deceased\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Justice Kelly went on to write:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">\"There is no ambiguity in the words of the statute which provide 'the amount recovered in every such action for pecuniary injury resulting from such death <em>shall be distributed to the surviving spouse and next of kin who suffered such pecuniary injury and in proportion thereof.\u2019 * * *.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\"Nor is there ambiguity in the provision that 'the judge before whom such case was tried * * * shall certify to the probate court * * * the amount thereof representing the total pecuniary <em>loss suffered by the surviving spouse and all of the next of kin, and the proportion of such total pecuniary loss suffered by the surviving spouse and each of the next of kin of such deceased person. \u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) 350 Mich 32-33.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Having so concluded, Justice Kelly found at least two compelling reasons to justify the decision to recognize the petitioner-appellant\u2019s claim:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">First, decedent\u2019s survivors in that case, besides his wife, were his children and his mother, all of whom qualify as first-degree kin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, under <em>MacDonald\u2019s </em>specific facts, there was no need to consider whether \"next of kin\u201d means nearest relative or all relatives included in our laws of descent and distribution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, Justice Kelly recognized that the \"next of kin\u201d distribution language of \u00a7 2922(2) was written into the statute in response to <em>Venneman </em>and was intended to ensure that distribution was made to those within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\"class\u201d who were actually damaged by the wrongful death. Therefore, having found the decedent\u2019s mother to be in the \"class\u201d entitled to seek damages, the Court concluded that she was a \"next of kin\u201d for purposes of distribution of an award attributable to her loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We do not agree with the Court of Appeals characterization of <em>MacDonald </em>as involving</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\"the Court\u2019s deliberate adoption of the civil law meaning of 'next of kin\u2019 in contrast with [separately concurring] Mr. Justice Black\u2019s preferred 'blood relative\u2019 equivalent of that term\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">and its conclusion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">\"that while the 'class of persons who, by law, are entitled to inherit\u2019 was 'opened\u2019 by the legislative employment of 'next of kin\u2019 in the same paragraph, that class was expanded only to include those persons who are next of kin according to the civil law meaning of the term.\u201d 92 Mich App 248-249.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Nowhere in <em>MacDonald </em>did the Court expressly adopt a \"nearest relative\u201d interpretation of \"next of kin\u201d. The opinion refers to both possible meanings of \"next of kin\u201d; that is, <em>nearest </em>relative or simply relative, but does not clearly adopt or approve one meaning in preference to the other, probably because such a choice was not necessary to the decision. Similarly, there is no basis to conclude that the <em>MacDonald </em>Court interpreted the \"class\u201d as one of actual intestate heirs \"opened\u201d by the legislative employment of \"next of kin\u201d. Instead, the majority opinion merely concluded that the mother was not eliminated from the statutory \"class\u201d simply because of the survival of decedent\u2019s wife and children. Such a conclusion can only be understood as a finding that the \"class\u201d is one of potential heirs of the intestate\u2019s property, not actual heirs only identifiable at the time of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Concurring separately in <em>MacDonald, </em>Justice Black wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">\"Any 'next of kin,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>blood relative, is a rightful beneficiary in such case provided he or she is shown to have been dependent in fact or law on the decedent when death occurred and is a member of the statutory 'class\u2019 from which, in the variant circumstances of succession, the inheritor or inheritors of the personal estate of one dying intestate are selected.\u201d 350 Mich 34.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">It is apparent that Justice Black interpreted the majority opinion as opening the door to <em>any </em>\"blood\u201d relative, as he put it, who could demonstrate the appropriate pecuniary injury. That same interpretation can be attributed to Justices Talbot Smith and Voelker, who signed the concurring opinion, as well as to Justice Edwards who signed both the majority opinion and Justice Black\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We are in agreement with the <em>MacDonald </em>Court\u2019s assessment of the meaning of the statutory language there and here in issue, and the views expressed by visiting Court of Appeals Judge Quinnell when, in <em>Scott v Burger King Corp, </em>95 Mich App 694, 701; 291 NW2d 174 (1980), he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">\"[The class] as interpreted in <em>MacDonald </em>expresses the class of beneficiaries, <em>i.e., </em>potential (as distinct from actual) inheritors of personal property, who are entitled to recover damages. * * * Read within the structure of the paragraph, the [sentence first referring to] and all later references to 'surviving spouse and next of kin\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>concern the manner of distribution of the damages. The 'surviving spouse and next of kin\u2019 are to recover those damages owing to them individually, certain creditors of the estate are to be paid, and the remainder of the estate passes by the laws of intestacy. Under our reading of the statute, 'surviving spouse and next of kin\u2019 is a shorthand expression \u2014 albeit an inartful one \u2014 for 'such person or persons who, by law, would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">While obedient application of the doctrine of stare decisis alone would justify our adherence to the <em>MacDonald </em>Court\u2019s holding as we understand it, in order to determine who is entitled to seek wrongful death damages in the present case, we have further, and we think, compelling reasons for approving the Court\u2019s holding in <em>MacDonald </em>and reaching the decision we do in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In the first place, we share Justice Kelly\u2019s personal observation concerning the 1939 amendment to \u00a7 2922(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\"The amendment was brought about because of the <em>Venneman </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>which brought into focus the injustice of taking from the surviving wife part of the damages collected and dividing said damages with a son of the deceased by a former marriage who did not suffer pecuniary damages because of the tortious act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">\"It is impossible for the writer of this opinion to conclude that in meeting such injustice the legislature created another injustice \u2014 namely, to hold blameless, as far as damages are concerned, one who brought to his death a son who was contributing to the support of his mother.\u201d 350 Mich 33.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">A generalized view of fundamental notions of distributive justice alone does not support the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>that the Legislature intended to permit any potential intestate heir to establish a loss under our wrongful death provisions. We discern that intent as well from the historical development of this state\u2019s wrongful death legislation and the irrationally arbitrary results of a contrary interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Before 1971, all forms of our wrongful death legislation employed the term \"pecuniary injury\u201d to describe the only compensable loss which could be suffered by a person other than the decedent. Until 1960, it was a term consistently associated with notions of dependency and actual lost monetary support or maintenance occasioned by the wrongful death.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is safe to say that the 1939 amendments which first used the terms \"class\u201d and \"next of kin\u201d, and which undoubtedly were a reaction to the perceived unfairness of <em>Venneman </em>where a non-dependent son was found entitled to share in the $4,000 settlement made with the surviving widow, re-emphasized the need to show some kind of financial dependency before a surviving spouse or next of kin could recover for the wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Dependency arising out of financial support was the historical key to recovery of a \"pecuniary loss\u201d. \"Dependency\u201d became such an important concept in this Court in understanding what constituted a pecuniary injury that it began to take on the added role of defining <em>who </em>was entitled to seek damages for wrongful death.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On two occasions Justice Black cited <em>Poff v Pennsylvania R </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Co, </em>327 US 399; 66 S Ct 603; 90 L Ed 749 (1946), to emphasize that the degree of relationship was a less important criterion for establishing a right to seek wrongful death damages than dependency between related individuals.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In his view, dependency was the controlling factor,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and he used <em>Poff </em>to support that view. In <em>Poff, </em>the United States Supreme Court interpreted the Federal Employers Liability Act, which provided that the employer\u2019s liability, in the case of an employee\u2019s death, runs \" 'to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee; and, if none, then of such employee\u2019s parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee\u2019 \u201d. The deceased left surviving him as kin two sisters, a nephew, and a cousin, of whom only the cousin was dependent on him. Justice Douglas, speaking for the majority, reversed the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and held that within the class \"next of kin\u201d, Congress had not intended to distinguish between degrees of kinship but meant to entitle any <em>dependent </em>kin to seek recovery so long as there were no survivors in the preferred classes. Again, the fact of dependency defined the right to recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Justice Black\u2019s reliance on <em>Poff </em>is illustrative of the prevailing judicial understanding that the legislative purpose in using the term \"pecuniary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>injury\u201d to define compensable losses was to compensate financially dependent kin.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Given that prevailing and highly restrictive understanding of \"pecuniary injury\u201d and the fact that after 1939 and before 1971, despite a number of legislative reenactments and revisions of the death statute,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Legislature never deleted or explained the term, we are led to believe that the Legislature never intended to preclude any financially dependent relative from seeking damages for the wrongful death of his benefactor.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The harshness of the restrictive financial dependency interpretation of \"pecuniary injury\u201d was recognized and judicially abandoned in <em>Wycko v Gnodtke, </em>361 Mich 331; 105 NW2d 118 (1960), when the Court upheld a $14,000 jury award to the parents of a wrongfully killed minor son. While it marked neither the beginning nor the end of judicial debate over the appropriateness of attributing to the Legislature agreement with the broader judicial interpretation of \"pecuniary injury\u201d,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Wycko </em>did represent, for the first time, an interpretation of \"pecuniary injury\u201d broad enough to encompass the loss of \"mutual society and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>protection, in a word, companionship\u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> No longer were damages for wrongful death tied strictly to lost wages or financial support. There was now recognition that the life of a deceased might have been intrinsically valuable to others besides the deceased, although the extent and nature of that value awaited further judicial clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In his dissent in <em>Heider v Michigan Sugar Co, </em>375 Mich 490, 510; 134 NW2d 637 (1965), Justice Adams explained his views on the meaning and extent of \"pecuniary injury\u201d suffered by the family of two young brothers, James and David, who drowned in the defendant\u2019s pond. Although the majority disposed of the case on a finding of no liability, Justice Adams\u2019 disagreement led him to discuss the measure of damages. Joined by Justices T. M. Kavanagh and Souris, he found a right to seek recovery for loss of society and companionship on behalf of siblings and grandparents, despite the survival of the boys\u2019 parents. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\"><em>\"MacDonald v Quimby </em>is applicable yet to the extent that it was there held, by all members of the Court, that the persons whose 'pecuniary injury\u2019 is compensable under the death act are those who, in the variant circumstances of intestate succession, might be entitled to inherit the personal property of one dying intestate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">\"The restriction of the class to Donald Heider, father of James D. Heider, by the trial judge was improper, since, in this case, there were other members of the class who should have been considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\"Since the court did not make an award to cover the pecuniary injury to all of James\u2019 next-of-kin, it will be necessary to remand the case for a reconsideration of such award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\"Some further comment is appropriate with regard to the assessment of damages which the trial judge did make. He awarded $10,989.65 for the cost of raising James. The sum was incorrectly allocated to Donald Heider, father of James, who did not provide such cost. It should have been allocated to James D. Heider\u2019s grandfather, who incurred the cost, and who, being within the statutory class, would be entitled to recover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\"The loss of companionship in David\u2019s case runs not only to the father and mother but also to a younger brother and sister.\u201d 375 Mich 513-515.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">These statements, although expressed in dissent, are the only recorded observations by a member of this Court addressed to the issue of the validity of a claim for damages by a relative other than <em>nearest </em>of kin in a wrongful death action. Justice Adams\u2019 analysis, albeit in dissent, is enlightening to us in ascertaining the meaning of \"the class who * * * would be entitled to inherit * * * had [decedent] died intestate\u201d, but its more important significance is in the fact that some of Justice Adams\u2019 views were promptly adopted by the Legislature, as will be seen below.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The majority in <em>Breckon </em>limited <em>Wycko </em>to its facts and held that <em>Wycko </em>did not authorize an expanded interpretation of \"pecuniary injury\u201d which would include loss of society and companionship. Justice Adams, again in dissent, discussed the history of wrongful death legislation both before and after <em>Wycko </em>and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">\"The legislature was familiar with the opinions of this Court dealing with the recovery of damages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>cases of wrongful death and the manner of distribution to surviving spouse and next of kin when it had under consideration in 1960 a bill calling for a revised judicature act. The fact that a substitute provision was rejected and the existing provisions retained in the wrongful death section as enacted in the Revised Judicature Act of 1961 with subsequent amendment in 1965 shows more than passive acquiescence in the Court\u2019s interpretations of the statutes. It shows actual re-enactment of the statutes after this Court\u2019s interpretive opinions had been published for a sufficient time to permit their consideration by the members of the legislature, as well as by the bench and bar.\u201d 383 Mich 298.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In the course of his <em>Breckon </em>dissent, Justice Adams twice made reference to what he had said in <em>Heider </em>and once made reference to Justice Black\u2019s concurrence<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in <em>MacDonald </em>in an effort to support his belief that the Legislature was aware of the view that \"pecuniary injury\u201d had evolved in meaning to encompass loss of society and companionship attributable to potential intestate heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Legislative reaction to the <em>Breckon </em>opinions, majority and dissenting, was swift and decisive and is embodied in 1971 PA 65, now codified in MCL 600.2922; MSA 27A.2922, the statutory provision presently at issue. The major revision, which can only be viewed as a clear rejection of the <em>Breckon </em>majority\u2019s limited interpretation of \"pecuniary injury\u201d, was to delete the term \"pecuniary injury\u201d in \u00a7 2922, and add \"loss of society and companionship\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In thus addressing an aspect of the wrongful death act which had divided this Court for over ten years,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Legislature vindicated at least that part of Justice Adams\u2019 <em>Breckon </em>dissent which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>argued legislative acquiescence in the judicially announced view</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\"that life has value not only to the person who has been deprived of its enjoyment by a wrongful death but to the spouse and next of kin who have lost those benefits of association we summarize in the word 'companionship\u2019 383 Mich 299.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We are not inclined to the view that in explicitly adopting the lost companionship measure of damages long accepted and advanced by Justice Adams, the Legislature at the same time rejected the Justice\u2019s intimately related view that such lost companionship could run to any potential, as opposed to actual, intestate heir.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">We note that since the 1939 death act amendments there cannot be found any clear statement from any Justice of this Court which would preclude a potential intestate heir, who is not nearest of kin to the deceased, from seeking to recover damages, provided that that potential heir had suffered a compensable \"pecuniary injury\u201d or now, lost \"companionship\u201d. On the contrary, Justice Black, in his concurrence in <em>MacDonald, </em>and Justice Adams in his unopposed views expressed in his dissent in <em>Heider </em>and reaffirmed in his dissent in <em>Breckon, </em>were clearly of the mind that such potential intestate heirs constituted the \"class\u201d entitled under the statute to prove a compensable loss. Furthermore, we think that in <em>Smith v Detroit, </em>388 Mich 637, 649; 202 NW2d 300 (1972), by explicitly adopting the whole of Justice Adams\u2019 dissent in <em>Breckon </em>as the correct statement of law in Michigan, this Court at least implicitly accepted his view that the wrongful death statute, in seeking to compensate for lost \"companionship\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>speaks to all those extended family members identified in our intestacy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Given the fact that there is no record of legislative debate on the subject, we acknowledge a measure of uncertainty as to the specific intention, if any, of the Legislature concerning the meaning of the term \"class\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 2922. We cannot say with absolute certainty that the Legislature has consciously acquiesced in the interpretation of the \"class\u201d we have attributed to <em>MacDonald, </em>especially in light of the more restricted interpretation given <em>MacDonald </em>by the Court of Appeals panel in this case. Nevertheless, because every Justice of this Court who has expressed himself on the issue has interpreted the \"class\u201d language of \u00a7 2922 as encompassing potential intestate heirs, because none of those judicial statements has ever been expressly opposed by any Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court, because the Legislature has never undertaken to \"clarify\u201d the meaning of the \"class\u201d despite ample opportunity to consider the apparently prevailing and historic judicial view, and because the Legislature in 1971 expressly adopted a measure of damages (lost society and companionship) for wrongful death advocated by Justice Adams, a measure that he felt was inextricably bound to a broad interpretation of the \"class\u201d, we are satisfied that the interpretation which we have given to \u00a7 2922 is within the intendment of the Legislature, if indeed it has given any thought to the matter at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">As a final matter, and apart from the inferences to be drawn from the judicial and legislative his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tory of \u00a7 2922, we do not think it was the intention of the Legislature to arbitrarily restrict the right to seek compensation to actual heirs at law and nearest of relatives while expanding the measure of damages to lost companionship. To do so would make the vagaries of familial survival the touchstone of recovery instead of the loss of the society and companionship which ordinarily exists among family members and, generally, to an even greater degree among more closely related individuals.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Instead, we are convinced that the boundary we recognize today, establishing the right to seek compensation for the wrongful death of another, is in accord with the probable legislative judgment concerning human relationships inherent in our intestate succession laws. Those laws presume, as indeed is generally established by common experience, that certain intrafamily relationships are stronger than others and seek to distribute intestate property accordingly. There exists here an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>assumption that <em>some </em>positive relationship exists between almost all relatives. The wrongful death act, with its emphasis on compensating lost companionship, appears designed to compensate for the destruction of family relationships \u2014 those implicitly assumed to exist by our intestacy laws among family members identified as potential intestate takers.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">It may be true that in individual cases it may seem arbitrary to permit recovery for lost companionship where one\u2019s close relative is wrongfully killed but to preclude recovery where one\u2019s equally close friend is wrongfully killed. It may have appeared to the Legislature that a boundary line drawn to distinguish between friends and relatives is considerably more logical than one drawn to distinguish between subclasses of family members recognizing only the nearest of kin as likely to suffer sufficiently from a decedent\u2019s wrongful death to entitle them to damages. Limiting the right to recover for lost relationships only to relatives included in our laws of descent and distribution is a logical reflection of the natural ordering of emotional, psychological, creedal, intellectual, and economic sharing upon which strong relationships are built and which is considered common to our society. The natural distinction between \"family\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>relative, and non-family affords additional weight to our view that the Legislature intends to permit more than the nearest of kin to seek recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-8\">Kavanagh, Williams, Levin, Fitzgerald, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Coleman, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoY7\"><em>(for affirmance). </em>The issue in this case is whether the decedent\u2019s brothers and sisters were entitled to damages for loss of society and companionship under the wrongful death statute, MCL 600.2922; MSA 27A.2922. The pertinent part of that statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">\"The amount of damages recoverable by civil action for death caused by the wrongful act, neglect or fault of another may also include recovery for the loss of the society and companionship of the deceased. <em>Such person or persons entitled to such damages shall be of that class who, by law, would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate. </em>The amount recovered in every such action shall be distributed to the surviving spouse and next of kin who suffered injury and in proportion thereto.\u201d MCL 600.2922(2); MSA 27A.2922(2). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Because the decedent was survived by a spouse and both parents, the brothers and sisters would not have been entitled to inherit any personal property under the intestate laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the unambiguous language of the statute, I believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>this ends our inquiry \u2014 the brothers and sisters are not within the class identified by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Our colleague concludes, however, that in any wrongful death action every brother, sister, grandparent; grandchild, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, and cousin, give or take a few,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> will be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>testify to the society and companionship that they shared with the deceased and have the trier of fact determine a dollar value for their loss. This is more than the language of the statute will bear. While this conclusion does find support in the reasoning of <em>MacDonald v Quimby, </em>350 Mich 21; 85 NW2d 157 (1957), that decision appears to be clearly erroneous and should be overruled. Before considering <em>MacDonald, </em>and the arguments our colleague advances in its behalf, a brief summary of the pertinent legislative history and prior case law is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The common law had no cause of action for wrongful death. <em>Hyatt v Adams, </em>16 Mich 180 (1867). Although the reasons for the common-law rule were not always clearly articulated, Justice Christiancy attributed the rule to a \"natural and almost universal repugnance among enlightened nations to setting a price upon human life, or any attempt to estimate its value by a pecuniary standard\u201d. 16 Mich 191. Statutory remedies, however, were created, the repugnance perhaps being tempered by the need to encourage safety on the part of those to whom individuals were increasingly being required to entrust their lives \u2014 because of new modes of travel and business \u2014 and by the desire to provide relief to close family members in cases of hardship. 16 Mich 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The original wrongful death act in Michigan was enacted in 1848 and provided that any recovery for pecuniary loss would be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\"for the exclusive benefit of the widow and next of kin of such deceased person and shall be distributed to such widow and next of kin in the proportions provided by law in relation to the distribution of personal property, left by persons dying intestate\u201d. 1848 PA 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">See <em>Breckon v Franklin Fuel Co, </em>383 Mich 251, 281; 174 NW2d 836 (1970) (Adams, J., <em>dissenting).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This provision was amended in 1873 to provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\"the amount recovered in every such action, shall be distributed to the persons and in the proportions provided by law in relation to the distribution of personal property, left by persons dying intestate.\u201d 1873 PA 94.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">This amendment allowed a husband an opportunity to seek a recovery for the death of a wife. The husband, not being a next of kin because the husband was not a blood relative of the wife, was precluded from seeking any recovery under the 1848 act. <em>Hyatt, </em>16 Mich 195. This portion of the statute remained unchanged until after this Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Venneman\u2019s Estate, </em>286 Mich 368; 282 NW 180 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In <em>In re Venneman\u2019s Estate, </em>a widow had obtained a settlement of $4,000 for the pecuniary loss she suffered as a result of the wrongful death of her husband. An adult son of the deceased from a former marriage, who admitted suffering no pecuniary loss from the death of his father, sued the widow for one half of the $4,000. He claimed that the wrongful death act required that such settlement be distributed according to the laws of intestate succession, and that under such laws he was entitled to one half of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The statute, part of which was quoted above, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">\"Every such action shall be brought by, and in the names of, the personal representatives of such deceased person, and the amount recovered in every such action, shall be distributed to the persons and in the proportions provided by law in relation to the distribution of personal property left by persons dying intestate; and in every such action the jury may give such damages as they shall deem fair and just, with reference to the pecuniary injury resulting from such death, to those persons who may be entitled to such damages when recovered.\u201d 1929 CL 14062.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Despite the Court\u2019s apparent reservations concerning the wisdom of this legislative scheme, it considered the statute clear in providing that the persons entitled to recovery and the proportions which they would receive were to be calculated solely according to the intestate laws despite the fact that the amount of the total recovery was dependent upon a showing of pecuniary loss. The injustice which the Court sensed was clear: the pecuniary loss was solely the widow\u2019s, but the recovery for that loss had to be shared equally with a son who suffered no loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">After the <em>Venneman\u2019s Estate </em>decision, the Legislature amended the statute changing, <em>inter alia, </em>the manner in which any recovery would be distributed. The amended statute provided in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\"That such person or persons entitled to such damages shall be of that class who, by law, would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate. The amount recovered in every such action for pecuniary injury resulting from such death shall be distributed to the surviving spouse and next of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>kin who suffered such pecuniary injury and in proportion thereto.\u201d 1939 PA 297.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">This portion of the statute has remained unchanged except that under the present statute recovery is not limited to pecuniary injury but may also be obtained for \"the loss of the society and companionship of the deceased\u201d. MCL 600.2922(2); MSA 27A.2922(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In <em>MacDonald v Quimby, </em>350 Mich 21; 85 NW2d 157 (1957), the case most pertinent to the present case, the Court was required to determine whether under the 1939 act the mother of the decedent, who had been supported by the decedent, was entitled to damages for her son\u2019s wrongful death. Because the decedent had a wife and children who survived him, his mother was not an heir under the laws of intestate succession. The Court concluded that the term \"next of kin\u201d as used in the statute was not confined to those who would be entitled to inherit under the intestate laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">\"We cannot agree with appellees\u2019 contention that 'heirs at law and next of kin are synonymous terms,\u2019 or that for this Court to rule otherwise would delete and make inoperative the words found in the first half of the amended section 'that such person or persons entitled to such damages shall be of that class who, by law, would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">\"The petitioning mother was of a class who would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate.

Neither can we justify the statement in defendants\u2019 answer to the mother\u2019s petition to intervene that she had no such right because she 'is not included among that class of persons entitled to recover for pecuniary injuries resulting from the wrongful death of plaintiff\u2019s decedent.\u201d 350 Mich 32-33.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Although the Court concluded that the phrase \"next of kin\u201d as used in the statute was not limited to the actual heirs under the laws of intestate succession, it did not determine whether \"next of kin\u201d included all blood relatives, see 350 Mich 34 (Black, J., <em>concurring), </em>or only those within the nearest degree under the civil-law meaning of the term. See 350 Mich 31-32. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>either alternative the mother would have been \"next of kin\u201d to the deceased.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The error committed by the <em>MacDonald </em>Court was that of removing the phrase \"next of kin\u201d from its context, hence ignoring the fact that the statute was not using a phrase that required judicial definition. As is obvious from the context, the \"surviving spouse and next of kin\u201d as referred to in the statute are those in a clearly delineated class: \"Such person or persons entitled to such damages shall be of that class who, by law, would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate.\u201d The language of the statute leaves no room for doubt. Anyone not \"entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate\u201d is not within the class. The mother in <em>MacDonald </em>was not within this class. Under the laws of intestacy, the decedent\u2019s wife and children were the only ones entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased. In two unexplained sentences, however, the Court ignored the clear statutory language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">\"The petitioning mother was of a class who would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate. The fact that she would not inherit if he died intestate leaving a wife and children would not eliminate her from that class.\u201d 350 Mich 32.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Because the deceased did in fact leave a wife and children, the Court was interpreting the class to include those who might, under some other conceivable set of circumstances, have taken by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>laws of intestacy. Certainly, the statutory language defining the class as those who <em>\"would be entitled to inherit </em>* * * had he died intestate\u201d gives no reason to suppose that it is referring to anything but the actual situation existing at the time of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The focus of the <em>MacDonald </em>Court was on the phrase \"next of kin\u201d, which is used in the statute several times after the identification of the class entitled to damages. The Court put the cart before the horse when it considered whether the meaning of \"next of kin\u201d was synonymous with heirs at law prior to identifying the constituency of the class entitled to damages. Given a class identified in the statute as those entitled to inherit under the laws of intestacy, it was sensible for the statute in the next sentence to refer to the constituency of the class as \"surviving spouse and next of kin\u201d. Anyone entitled to inherit if the decedent had died intestate would be either a surviving spouse or next of kin, regardless what definition one attached to next of kin. One sentence refers to <em>who </em>will receive and the next to the <em>amount </em>to be apportioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The reasonableness of the Legislature\u2019s reference to the class it had created as \"surviving spouse and next of kin\u201d is shown by the use of the term \"next of kin\u201d in an identical way in the original wrongful death act in Michigan. It provided, as previously noted, that any damages would be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\"for the exclusive benefit of the widow and next of kin of such deceased person and shall be distributed to such widow and next of kin in the proportions provided by law in relation to the distribution of personal property, left by persons dying intestate\u201d. 1848 PA 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The statute clearly allows damages to be distributed only to those entitled to inherit under the laws of intestacy and this group, apart from the widow, is merely designated as next of kin. What precise meaning \"next of kin\u201d might have was not an issue under the 1848 act and is not an issue under the present act because in both instances the phrase is merely used as a label for a class explicitly identified elsewhere in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In <em>MacDonald, </em>the Court also looked to the legislative action following <em>Venneman, supra, </em>as supporting its statutory interpretation. The injustice present in <em>Venneman, </em>however, to which the Legislature responded, was not that the class of those entitled to damages was too small, but rather that it was too large \u2014 it included a son who, though suffering no pecuniary loss, was entitled to an equal share of the loss suffered by the widow. Of the amendment following <em>Venneman, </em>the <em>MacDonald </em>opinion stated that it was impossible to conclude that in correcting the injustice present in <em>Venneman,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">\"the legislature created another injustice \u2014 namely, to hold blameless, as far as damages are concerned, one who brought to his death a son who was contributing to the support of his mother\u201d. 350 Mich 33.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">While one may certainly be sympathetic to the view that it would be kind to provide compensation to the mother in such a situation, it was inaccurate to say that by the amendment following <em>Venneman </em>\"the legislature created another injustice\u201d. There was no common-law cause of action for wrongful death, and all of the legislative enactments prior to the 1939 act were expressly conditioned on one\u2019s being entitled to inherit under the laws. as if the deceased died intestate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Thus, the most that one could say concerning the 1939 amendment was that it could have gone further, so as to assure that a dependent mother was provided for in the circumstances present in <em>MacDonald. </em>Nevertheless, whether a clearly delineated class of beneficiaries of the act should be expanded to include other deserving beneficiaries is a matter for legislative, not judicial, determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Our colleague advances essentially two reasons, besides those articulated in <em>MacDonald, </em>why the <em>MacDonald </em>decision should be followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first is that the Legislature has seemingly acquiesced in <em>MacDonald. </em>The second is that he cannot attribute such a \"unjustifiably arbitrary purpose\u201d to the Legislature as that of limiting recovery to actual heirs at law. Neither of these reasons, however, is convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Since <em>MacDonald, </em>the legislative changes in the wrongful death act have been few. 1939 PA 297, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the act as it existed at the time of the <em>MacDonald </em>decision, remained unchanged until editorial changes were made when it was re-enacted as \u00a7 2922 of the Revised Judicature Act of 1961. 1961 PA 236; see <em>Breckon, supra, </em>383 Mich 294 (Adams, J., <em>dissenting). </em>In 1965, the last sentence of the act was amended. 1965 PA 146; see <em>Breckon, </em>p 294. An amendment allowing for damages for the loss of the society and companionship of the deceased was enacted following the <em>Breckon </em>decision. 1971 PA 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Was the Legislature endorsing the 1957 <em>MacDonald </em>decision when it left unchanged the statutory language construed in that decision in the later re-enactm\u00e9nt and amendments of the statute? One can only speculate. We, however, are not inclined to the view that legislative inaction concerning one clearly erroneous statutory construction decision should be treated with the same deference as that accorded legislative enactments. Therefore, we conclude that <em>MacDonald </em>should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">However, even under the reasoning of our colleague that the nonalteration of the pertinent portion of the statute shows acquiescence in the <em>MacDonald </em>decision, that acquiescence should not be assumed to apply beyond the specific holding of that case. One should not conclude that legislative inaction constitutes an endorsement of all the reasoning and ramifications of the reasoning contained in a judicial interpretation of a statute. This is especially true with respect to the <em>MacDonald </em>decision for two reasons. First, because the opinion left open the possibility that \"next of kin\u201d would be defined according to its civil-law definition, the. opinion cannot be read as clearly inform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ing the Legislature that this Court had concluded that essentially all relatives are entitled to damages under the wrongful death statute. Secondly, because of the amendment since <em>MacDonald </em>allowing for damages for loss of society and companionship, the ramifications of my colleague\u2019s interpretation of <em>MacDonald </em>are far beyond its ramifications at the time it was decided. The decision was then limited by the statutory requirement of pecuniary injury \u2014 a requirement that would limit the beneficiaries of the wrongful death statute. Thus, because of the limited and uncertain scope of the <em>MacDonald </em>decision \u2014 both because of the possibility that \"next of kin\u201d would be given a civil-law definition and because of the pecuniary injury requirement \u2014 the opinion cannot tenably be a basis for legislative acquiescence in the broad interpretation of the statute now advocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Our colleague also asserts that he cannot conclude that our Legislature intended to \"arbitrarily restrict the right to seek compensation to actual heirs at law and nearest of relatives while expanding the measure of damages to lost companionship\u201d. To do so would be to limit recovery by the \"vagaries of familial survival\u201d. (What else are the laws of descent and distribution?) He nevertheless concludes that there is a rational basis for limiting recovery to relatives, thereby excluding whatever close friends the decedent may have had who were not relatives. Essentially, then, he agrees that it is possible to draw a rational line between those who should be entitled to damages for the loss of the companionship of the decedent and those who should not, but that it is arbitrary and irrational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>to draw that line at the decedent\u2019s heirs at law. He asserts:</p>\n<author id=\"b452-3\">Dissenting Opinion by Coleman, C. J.</author>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\"The natural distinction between 'family\u2019, <em>i.e., </em>relative, and non-family affords additional weight to our view that the Legislature intends to permit more than the nearest of kin to seek recovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The dividing line between relatives and non-relatives is no more significant or rational than the line between, for example, one\u2019s children and one\u2019s cousins. Certainly, in most people\u2019s lives there are friends closer than some relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">That some line must be drawn between those entitled to recover damages for the lost companionship of the deceased and those not so entitled is apparent. It is true that to allow all friends and acquaintances of a deceased to have a jury put a dollar value on their lost companionship would lead to endless litigation of a potentially very unseemly nature. There might be no end to the number of people trying to establish a friendship with the deceased. Petty jealousies and rivalries would surely be highlighted by defendants seeking to lower the monetary value of particular relationships. If the common-law concern against placing a pecuniary value on one\u2019s life has any merit at all, its fears would be fully realized by asking juries to establish the net worth of all of one\u2019s human relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Given the express statutory limitation that wrongful death damages are recoverable only by those persons entitled to inherit under the intestate laws, it is not for us to question the wisdom of failing to extend further the benefits for loss of society and companionship. The unique nature of damages for lost companionship makes it far more difficult than my colleague would suggest for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Court to assert that the clearly necessary line demarcating those entitled to such damages from those who are not, rationally should have been drawn elsewhere than where it has been drawn.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Whether the line should have been drawn narrowly or broadly was a question for the Legislature, and a question clearly answered by the statute we are called on to construe in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Although our predecessors must be credited with compassion in trying to fashion a means to provide wrongful death benefits for a mother outside of the laws of intestate succession, the Court\u2019s continued attempt to follow that route can predictably lead from statutes of certainty into a prickly tangle of uncertainties. One cannot underestimate the ingenuity of lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">From what appears on its face to have been straightforward legislation, we would not veer into the proposed thicket. It is commendable to respect precedent, but it is foolish to compound error in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The statute now in effect retains the historic words describing the class to which distribution is intended. It added to the damages \"loss of the society and companionship of the deceased\u201d and provided that those benefits should be divided among the persons in that class \u2014 those who would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>take had the deceased died intestate \u2014 in proportion to the injury suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The disposition of an estate does not allow for speculation regarding the \"what ifs\u201d of life and death as suggested. Regardless of emotional ties up and down the ladder of succession, the statutes do not permit such introspection as \"What if the parents of the deceased had died a day earlier than Ms. Hubbard?\u201d, or \"What if she had a child, but an aunt was especially devoted to her?\u201d \u2014 and so on and on.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Understandably, the laws of descent and distribution are exact. They do not rest on dependency per se. They do not encompass the loss of society and companionship per se, except, as specifically carved out by the wrongful death act, the damages to be distributed in proportion to the injury to those \"entitled to inherit the personal property of the deceased had he died intestate\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The Court of Appeals correctly decided that brothers and sisters of the deceased who were not entitled to inherit under the laws of intestacy are not entitled to damages for loss of society and companionship.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\"> Defendants succeeded in obtaining a post-trial order of remittitur reducing the $79,433.55 award by $5,000.

First, it could describe anyone <em>actually </em>identified in <em>any </em>provision of the intestate laws at the time of decedent\u2019s death. Secondly, it could mean anyone who <em>might have been </em>identified by <em>any </em>provision of the intestate laws at the time of decedent\u2019s death. The difference arises because of the definition of \"issue\u201d applicable to the intestate provisions.

Similarly, a cousin would be excluded if the cousin\u2019s parent or grandparent \u2014 the relatives of the decedent \u2014 were still alive.
