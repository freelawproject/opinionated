Plaintiff contended that he was entitled to the tape under the Freedom of Information Act (hereinafter FOIA). Plaintiff stated that he wanted the tape to facilitate political mailings in connection with the November, 1978, election.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Defendants refused the request, offering instead to give plaintiff either a copy of the directory as soon as it was available, or an immediate printout of the information on the tape. The university asserted that its position was supported by the FOIA, specifically the provision exempting from disclosure information within the scope of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 USC 1232g.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Plaintiff subsequently filed suit in Ingham Circuit Court. On October 18, 1978, the trial court ordered defendants to create a duplicate magnetic tape for plaintiff\u2019s use, deleting all information on the original except names and addresses of students. The trial court further directed that plaintiff make no use of the tape other than for political mailings, and that plaintiff return the tape after the election. Plaintiff was denied attorney fees, costs, disbursements or damages because the trial court concluded that defendants\u2019 refusal had not been arbitrary or capricious, and that the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>presented a valid question of first impression with substantial effects on the rights of third persons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Plaintiff appealed the denial of attorney fees and costs. Defendants filed a cross appeal on the issues of whether the students\u2019 names and addresses were exempt from disclosure under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and whether a public body is required under the FOIA to release for a nominal cost items of proprietary interest owned by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of attorney fees and costs, but reversed the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff was entitled to a tape of the students\u2019 names and addresses. <em>Kestenbaum v Michigan State University, </em>97 Mich App 5; 294 NW2d 228 (1980). The Court did not rely upon the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, however, but rather upon \u00a7 13(1)(a) of FOIA, MCL 15.243(1)(a); MSA 4.1801(13)(1)(a), which protects against a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy\u201d. The Court further stated that release of the computer tape would contravene the constitutional prohibition against public funds being used to support a private purpose. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18. Plaintiff\u2019s application for rehearing was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">This Court granted leave to appeal. 411 Mich 869 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Freedom of information acts were passed by Congress and the various state legislatures in response to public concern over bureaucratic abuses and secrecy. The federal act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> preceded its Michigan counterpart by some ten years and served as a model for the state legislation. The thrust of both versions is a policy of disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Under the state act, a <em>public body </em>is required to disclose a <em>public record </em>upon request unless the record falls within the scope of certain enumerated exceptions. The terms \"public body\u201d and \"public record\u201d are defined in the preliminary sections of the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">There is no question that Michigan State University is a public body, having been \"created by state or local authority or which is primarily funded by or through state or local authority\u201d. FOIA \u00a7 2(b)(iv), MCL 15.232(b)(iv); MSA 4.1801(2)(b)(iv). A list of students appears to be a public record, <em>i.e., </em>\"a writing prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by a public body in the performance of an official function, from the time it is created\u201d. FOIA \u00a7 2(c). Further, the term \"writing\u201d specifically includes a magnetic tape. FOIA \u00a7 2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">It is important to note at this point that a significant difference between Michigan\u2019s FOIA and the federal precursor is that the state act begins with a preamble which sets forth legislative intent:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\"It is the public policy of this state that all persons are entitled to full and complete <em>information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them </em>as public officials and public employees, consistent with this act. The people shall be informed <em>so that they may fully participate in the democratic process. </em>MCL 15.231(2); MSA 4.1801(1)(2).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Thus, each provision of the FOIA must be read so as to be consistent with the purpose announced in the preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Whether a list of students is the kind of information envisioned by the Legislature as appropriate for disclosure is debatable, but such a determination is not necessary to our holding in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">By accepting without deciding that the list of students qualifies as a public record, we necessarily turn our focus to the enumerated exemptions. The posture of plaintiffs inquiry then becomes whether Michigan State University, a public body in possession of a public record, to wit, a magnetic tape, was authorized under the FOIA to deny disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">We hold that the university was justified in denying plaintiffs request because the release of the magnetic tape containing the names and addresses of students would run afoul of the exemption set forth in \u00a7 13(l)(a) \u2014 information of a personal nature where the public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">In fact, despite the wording of \u00a7 13, which seems to make withholding of exempt information discretionary with the public body, the university arguably would not have been justified if it had granted plaintiffs request. It is logically persuasive that the public policy implicit in the exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>tions only can be served if nondisclosure prevails in those situations described in \u00a7 13.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The concept of privacy is elusive. Social scientists and legal scholars alike have struggled for a definition expansive enough to include important concerns and yet narrow enough to be workable.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Privacy as an existential condition must be distinguished from a legally cognizable right to privacy. The \"right to privacy\u201d has been described at various times as stemming from either property or trust theories or as flowing from certain constitutional guarantees or a penumbra thereof. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>right, whatever its source, was labeled by Justice Cooley as \"the right to be let alone\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">As society has expanded and distance contracted because of advances in communication and travel, the right to privacy for many has become the ability to choose with whom and under what circumstances they will communicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Obviously, not every interest of every person rises to a level which the law can or should protect. However, despite changing attitudes and changing laws, there has remained throughout this country\u2019s legal history one recognized situs of individual control \u2014 the dwelling place. Without exception, this bastion of privacy has been afforded greater protection against outside assaults than has any other location. The United States Supreme Court on many occasions has re-emphasized the reverence with which the law views the private domicile.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">These prefatory remarks serve to illustrate that any intrusion into the home, no matter the purpose or the extent, is definitionally an invasion of privacy. <em>A fortiori, </em>the release of names and ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>dresses constitutes an invasion of privacy, since it serves as a conduit into the sanctuary of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The United States Supreme Court has refused to endorse the idea that such an intrusion is so minimal as to be inconsequential.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\"We therefore categorically reject the argument that a vendor has a right under the Constitution or otherwise to send unwanted material into the home of another. If this prohibition operates to impede the flow of even valid ideas, the answer is that no one has a right to press even 'good\u2019 ideas on an unwilling recipient. That we are often 'captives\u2019 outside the sanctuary of the home and subject to objectionable speech and other sound does not mean we must be captives everywhere. * * * The asserted right of a mailer, we repeat, stops at the outer boundary of every person\u2019s domain.\u201d <em>Rowan v United States Post Office Dep\u2019t, </em>397 US 728, 738; 90 S Ct 1484; 25 L Ed 2d 736 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">It does not suffice, however, to merely label the release of names and addresses in this case an invasion of privacy. In order to come under exemption (l)(a) of \u00a7 13, the information must be of such a nature that \"the public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The similarity between the FOIA and the federal act invites analogy when deciphering the various sections and attendant judicial interpretations. The exemption in the federal FOIA most similar to exemption (l)(a) of \u00a7 13 provides for the withholding of \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d. 5 USC 552(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The wording of the federal exemption ostensibly makes it more narrow than the state exemption. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Furthermore, it must be remembered that the overlay of legislative intent articulated in the preamble to the FOIA is not present in the federal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The federal act does not require persons seeking information to explain how they will use the material. It generally has been accepted, however, that where the requested information might fall under the federal privacy exemption, a balancing test must be employed, <em>i.e., </em>the public interest in disclosure must be weighed against the potential invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The United States Supreme Court, in an opinion signed by five justices, has endorsed the balancing approach in the FOIA privacy exemption cases. <em>Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v Rose, </em>425 US 352, 372; 96 S Ct 1592; 48 L Ed 2d 11 (1976). \"Congress sought to construct an exemption that would require a balancing of the individual\u2019s right of privacy against the preservation of the basic purpose of the Freedom of Information Act 'to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d The Court quoted from S Rep No 813, p 9: \" 'The phrase \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d enunciates a policy that will involve a balancing of interests between the protection of an individual\u2019s private affairs from unnecessary public scrutiny, and the preservation of the public\u2019s right to governmental information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>It is not clear precisely what comprises the public interest to be weighed in any given instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Only a few courts have considered specifically whether names and addresses come under the protection of the federal privacy exemption. The usual approach in those cases has been to balance the privacy interest against the public benefit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>be realized from the <em>particular use </em>intended by the person seeking the information. See, for example: <em>Wine Hobby USA, Inc v United States Internal Revenue Service, </em>502 F2d 133 (CA 3, 1974), and <em>Getman v NLRB, </em>146 US App DC 209; 450 F2d 670 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The drafters of the state FOIA similarly did not include language which would compel those seeking information to divulge their reasons for doing so. However, legislators recognized that the release of certain information could constitute a \"clearly unwarranted\u201d invasion of privacy and should not be required; thus, it also is necessary under the state act to balance interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">It is important initially to designate the interests that are to be juxtaposed under \u00a7 13(l)(a) of the state act. Each side of the scales is to be measured with respect to the nature of the information requested. If the information is such that its release would be an invasion of priv\u00e1cy, however minimal, balancing is required. This means that potential harm from the invasion must be weighed alongside potential benefits to the public from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The reason the information is sought in a specific instance is not a controlling factor. It is permissible to define the public interest in disclosure by referring to the uses contemplated by <em>some </em>members of the public, but not by <em>exclusively </em>focusing on the intention of the person requesting the information. If release of the material would be consistent with the legislative intent articulated in the preamble of the FOIA, and if the public interest would be sufficiently served, the scales tip in favor of disclosure. The only effective counterbalance would be a determination that, despite the potential benefits of public disclosure, the resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>privacy violation could not be justified because it would be \"clearly unwarranted\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">As the First Circuit Court of Appeals noted when reviewing a privacy exemption case under the federal act, \"[W]e do not believe that the capability of the individual requester is a proper subject of inquiry * * * any more than his relative degree of need for or interest in the information.\u201d <em>Kurzon v Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>649 F2d 65, 68, fn 2 (CA 1, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Another reason why a specific purpose cannot serve as a catalyst nor an impediment to disclosure is because there is no mechanism in the FOIA by which use can be restricted once a public body has permitted release. Only those requests which are reviewed <em>de novo </em>by the courts<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> become subject to such limitations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, once it is deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>mined that disclosure of certain information would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a further inquiry into intended use serves no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In the case at bar, for instance, the trial court held that because plaintiff would use the magnetic tape information in conjunction with an election campaign, the invasion of privacy was justified. Conversely, the Court of Appeals labeled the intended use a commercial one, not sufficient to neutralize the potential harm which would result from an invasion of privacy. Such differences in categorization underscore our point.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Conscious that the basic thrust of the FOIA was to be a policy of disclosure, the Legislature placed upon the public body denying a request the burden of justifying its decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At no time is one seeking the information required to prove entitlement. As we stated, a particular intended use is irrelevant. The Court of Appeals was incorrect, therefore, in concluding that plaintiff was obliged to show that the public interest in release outweighed the possibility of harm to the people involved. It was up to Michigan State University to prove that the information was exempt from the general rule of disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We note, parenthetically, that the courts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>state, long before the enactment of the FOIA, recognized that citizens have a general right of free access to, and inspection of, public records. See <em>Booth Newspapers, Inc v Muskegon Probate Judge, </em>15 Mich App 203; 166 NW2d 546 (1968), and the cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Plaintiff has argued that by making the information available in a printed directory, the university sacrificed any privacy interests that may have existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">However, we think that the university\u2019s decision to publish the directory did not control the later decision to invoke exemption (l)(a) as to the magnetic tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Implicit in the university\u2019s decision to publish the printed directory was its conclusion that the attendant invasion of privacy was not clearly unwarranted. Such a determination was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">In September, 1978, the student body numbered approximately 44,000 persons, a population comparable to that of the City of Muskegon. As it had done in past years, the university compiled a student directory to ease communications within the campus community and with those outside. The availability of the directory likely prevented a great deal of havoc as students attempted to contact acquaintances and settle down to college life.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">The university therefore was justified in concluding that the invasion of privacy was not clearly unwarranted when balanced against the public interest in avoiding a potentially chaotic situation. It is important to note also that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>procedure whereby students could \"opt out\u201d of the directory.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">However, the same reasoning which supports the university\u2019s decision to publish the directory cannot be extrapolated to compel release of the computer tape, even though it contains identical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">It is not seriously debated that the pervasiveness of computer technology has resulted in an ever-increasing erosion of personal privacy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is available a larger storehouse of information about each of us than ever before. Computer information is readily accessible and easily manipulated. Data available on a single tape can be combined with data on other tapes in such a way as to create new, more comprehensive banks of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\"The central problem is to determine how the legal system can best insure that a proper balance is struck between the traditional libertarian ideals embodied in the concept of privacy and the immense social benefit that computer technology offers.\u201d Miller, <em>Personal Privacy in the Computer Age: The Challenge of a New Technology in an Information-Oriented Society, </em>67 Mich L Rev 1089, 1222 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">While it is true that the computer era has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>brought untold benefits for society, it also is fraught with potential dangers to our notions of individual autonomy. Vigilance is necessary, lest the right to privacy atrophy due to lack of exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">\"[T]he computer\u2019s potential as an engine of social change \u2014 and human control \u2014 indicates that a greater threat to freedom may lie in inaction or continued application of ancient or inapposite doctrine in the face, of the growing power of information in contemporary life and the increasing concentration of control over it.\u201d Id</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Form, not just content, affects the nature of information. Seemingly benign data in an intrusive form takes on quite different characteristics than if it were merely printed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The very existence of information in computer-ready form may serve to motivate an invasion of privacy. \"Even if the cost of securing access to computerized information is higher than the cost of dredging out the information in a more traditional form of record, the centralized quality and compactness of a computerized dossier creates an incentive to invade it because the payoff for doing so successfully is much larger.\u201d Miller, Computers, <em>Data Banks and Individual Privacy: An Overview, </em>4 Colum Human Rights L Rev 1, 10 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The university was not wrong in concluding that the release of names and addresses on magnetic tape was a more serious invasion of privacy than disclosure in directory form.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Plaintiff has suggested that students whose names and addresses appeared in the directory no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>longer had an expectation of privacy as to that information. That deduction is not inevitable. Certainly those students who did not opt out should have known that the information was available to persons within the university community free of charge and to others who purchased copies of the directory. Such students also should have known that individuals and organizations with sufficient means could reduce the printed information to computer form and compile mailing lists, or undertake the onerous task of individually contacting each of the 44,000 students.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">However, it does not follow that students should have known that an efficient and intrusive computer mailing system already was available to anyone for a nominal sum.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In deciding whether to appear in or opt out of the directory, students should not have been expected to consider the mechanics by which the university published the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Plaintiff also challenged the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney fees and costs. That issue is moot, since we hold that plaintiff was not entitled to a copy of the computer tape containing the names and addresses of students.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Affirmed. No costs, a public question being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b645-7\">Williams and Coleman, JJ., concurred with Fitzgerald, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b645-8\">Ryan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6g\">This is the first case in which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Court has been called upon to interpret the Michigan Freedom of Information Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (FOIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The plaintiff, Lawrence Kestenbaum, sought disclosure of a magnetic tape containing the student directory at Michigan State University and documentation for that tape. The defendants, Michigan State University and its designated FOIA officer, Dale Arnold, defended their refusal to release the tape on the grounds that the FOIA does not require disclosure; that disclosure would constitute an unconstitutional granting of credit in aid of private persons; and that even if the refusal violated the FOIA, the university should not be required to pay plaintiffs reasonable attorney fees, costs, and disbursements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We hold that the requested magnetic tape is a \"public record\u201d; that the \"public policy\u201d section of the FOIA does not justify nondisclosure; that the tape does not fall within the privacy exemption; that disclosure does not constitute an unconstitutional granting of credit; and that the plaintiff may recover reasonable attorney fees, costs, and disbursements. Accordingly, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The material facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff, president of a registered student political organization, requested a copy of the magnetic tape which the defendant Michigan State University used to produce a student directory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff intended to use the names and addresses to facilitate voter registration and to conduct other politi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>cal mailings in connection with the general election of November, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The defendant Michigan State University denied the plaintiffs request. It is unclear whether the denial was because of defendant\u2019s failure to respond in a timely fashion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or whether the university committee\u2019s decision, dated October 6, 1978, constituted a timely denial. In any event, the denial of the request for the magnetic tape was followed by an offer to provide the plaintiff with a printed copy of the student directory as soon as it was received from the printer, or, if the plaintiff were willing to pay the cost, the university would run a computer printout of the contents of the tape. The plaintiff rejected the compromise offer, maintaining that the magnetic tape was a public record and that he was entitled to inspect and copy it.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The plaintiff then filed suit in Ingham Circuit Court. The defendant argued that the magnetic tape was exempt from disclosure because release of the information in that form would violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, it was argued that the printing of the permanent student directory did not violate the FERPA because the students were separately advised both of their general right to require their consent before the university released even \"directory\u201d information in any form whatsoever, and of their specific right to opt out of the student directory. In addition, MSU employed at least one person who was present at registration and available to discuss with students whether to consent to be included in the directory. Only 20 to 25 of the approximately 44,000 students enrolled at Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>gan State University exercised their option to delete their names from the student directory. The defendant also argued that releasing a copy of the magnetic tape would constitute the use of public funds for a private purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">On October 10, 1978, a hearing upon an order to show cause was held before Judge Harrison. In light of scheduling problems<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the imminence of the November elections, the trial judge suggested that the attorneys cooperate by stipulating to as much as possible. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney indicated that in order to expedite the matter he would not object to an order restricting the use of the magnetic tape to political purposes and requiring that the tape be returned to the university upon the completion of the campaign. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney also stipulated to the deletion of all information to be published in the student directory (home address, major, year in school, and telephone number), except for the names and local addresses required for plaintiff\u2019s political campaign purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">On October 18, 1978, the trial court issued an opinion ordering the defendants to create a copy of the magnetic tape for use by the plaintiff. The stipulated restrictions on use and deletions from the tape were included in the final order. The cost of duplication was to be paid by the plaintiff. The court further ordered that no attorney fees, costs, disbursements, or damages be awarded to the plaintiff, since the denial by Michigan State University was not arbitrary or capricious and the matter presented a valid question of first impression with substantial effects on the rights of third persons. The plaintiff\u2019s motion to modify or amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the order to include reasonable attorney fees, costs, disbursements, and damages was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The plaintiff appealed the denial of attorney fees, costs, disbursements, and damages to the Court of Appeals. The defendants filed a cross appeal on the issues of whether the students\u2019 names and addresses were exempt from disclosure under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and whether a public body is required under the FOIA to release, for a nominal cost, items of proprietary interest owned by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of attorney fees and costs, but reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff was entitled to a copy of the magnetic tape. The Court did not rely upon the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ground asserted in defendants\u2019 claim of appeal; instead, the Court decided <em>sua sponte </em>that the release of the tape constituted a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy\u201d within the meaning of MCL 15.243(l)(a); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(a). The Court also found that release of the computer-readable tape would violate the constitutional provision against granting credit in aid of private persons.

We would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">We must determine initially whether the requested magnetic tape is a \"public record\u201d within the meaning of the Michigan FOIA. Only a \"public record\u201d is subject to the public right to inspect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>copy, or receive copies of documents. MCL 15.233(1); MSA 4.1801(3)(1). If the Court of Appeals correctly held that the requested tape is not a \"public record\u201d, it would be unnecessary to decide whether the \"privacy\u201d exemption, or any exemption, authorizes nondisclosure. Accordingly, the statutory definition of \"public record\u201d must be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The term \"public record\u201d is defined in MCL 15.232(c); MSA 4.1801(2)(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\" 'Public record\u2019 means a writing prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by a public body in the performance of an official function, from the time it is created.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The computer tape that is the subject of this litigation is a \"writing\u201d, since MCL 15.232(e); MSA 4.1801(2)(e) defines a writing to include \"magnetic or paper tapes * * * or other means of recording or retaining meaningful content\u201d. The magnetic tape is undisputably \"prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by\u201d the defendant public body. The only remaining question is whether the computer tape was prepared, owned, used, possessed or retained \"in the performance of an official function\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The expression \"in the performance of an official function\u201d is not defined in the statute. Accordingly, the term must be construed according to its commonly accepted and generally understood meaning. <em>Production Credit Ass\u2019n of Lansing v Dep\u2019t of </em>Treasury, 404 Mich 301, 312; 273 NW2d 10 (1978). The need to exclude unofficial writings belonging to private citizens from the definition of \"public record\u201d is apparent when one recognizes that a state employee is included within the defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>tion of a \"public body\u201d. MCL 15.232(b)(i); MSA 4.1801(2)(b)(i). A public body may not thwart disclosure under the FOIA by the simple expedient of sending sensitive documents home with its employees. However, unofficial private writings belonging solely to an individual should not be subject to public disclosure merely because that individual is a state employee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">We have no difficulty in concluding that the magnetic tape involved in this case was prepared, owned, used, possessed, and retained by the defendant public body \"in the performance of an official function\u201d. As the circuit judge aptly noted in his opinion, \"Indeed, it would be useless to argue [that] such an institution could function without such a list of students\u201d. The specific magnetic tape sought in this litigation was used in the preparation and publication. of a student directory, a publication our brother describes as compiled \"to ease communications within the campus community\u201d and likely to prevent \"a great deal of havoc\u201d. Facilitating communications among students, preventing a great deal of havoc, and simply operating the university in an efficient manner are all \"official functions\u201d of Michigan State University. Since the requested \"writing\u201d was prepared, owned, used, possessed, or retained by Michigan State University in the performance of these official functions, we hold that the magnetic tape is a \"public record\u201d._</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The \"public policy\u201d section of the FOIA<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> does not provide a separate or independent basis for denying disclosure. The first section of the act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\"(1) This act shall be known and may be cited as the 'freedom of information act\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">\"(2) It is the public policy of this state that all persons , are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and public employees, consistent with this act. The people shall be informed so that they may fully participate in the democratic process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">The Court of Appeals apparently concluded that this section creates a special exemption to disclosure of \"public documents\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">A policy section, like a preamble, may be used to clarify ambiguous portions of a statute but may not be used to create an ambiguity. 1A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a720.12, p 63. Here, the statute clearly provides that <em>all </em>\"public records\u201d must be disclosed unless they are exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 13.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As stated in MCL 15.232(c); MSA 14.1801(2)(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">\"This act separates public records into 2 classes: (i) those which are exempt from disclosure under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>13, and (ii) all others, which shall be subject to disclosure under this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">This strict statutory dichotomy belies the assertion that the public record sought in each individual request must inform the general public about the affairs of government. Instead of requiring a judicial declaration in every individual case that disclosure serves the interests of the \"general public\u201d, the Legislature adopted a per se rule requiring the release of <em>all </em>public records, save those falling within an enumerated exception. Such a rule necessarily requires the release of many public records that do not particularly advance the interests of the general public. Unless the release offends one of the \u00a7 13 exemptions, however, no reason exists <em>not </em>to disclose such documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The Legislature recognized that some FOIA disclosures would benefit only private individuals, while other disclosures would primarily benefit the general public. MCL 15.234(1); MSA 4.1801(4X1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\"Copies of public records may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge if the public body determines that a waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing copies of the public record can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">If the preamble required that every FOIA disclosure affirmatively benefit the general public, <em>all </em>FOIA disclosures would qualify for a waiver or reduction of the copying fee. But the Legislature obviously contemplated that many, if not most, FOIA requests would serve \"private\u201d or \"commercial\u201d interests, since it carefully set forth the method of calculating the ordinary copying charge. MCL 15.234; MSA 4.1801(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The presumption in favor of release is clear. The requesting person need not prove any particular need or right to the information, or that the general public interest will be furthered. The test is whether the writing is a \"public record\u201d and whether it falls within an enumerated, exemption. The policy of the act is furthered by this test in that (1) administrative and judicial time is not wasted in applying a subjective standard like \"furthering the general public interest\u201d,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and (2) the risk of erroneous nondisclosure is eliminated except in those cases involving the \u00a7 13 exemptions. Contrary to the assertion of the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the FOIA <em>does </em>provide for free access to public records. The Court does not have an obligation, nor indeed the authority, to narrow by judicial fiat a statute written too broadly to suit its preference; rather the Court has an obligation to enforce the statute as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We hold that the \"public policy\u201d statement of the FOIA does not provide a rationale for denying disclosure of \"public records\u201d. If anything, the policy statement indicates that in close cases, the public body should err on the side of disclosure. The policy statement therefore supports rather than undermines the plaintiff\u2019s request in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">We must now determine whether the requested public record falls within the privacy exemption of \u00a7 13.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> MCL 15.243(l)(a); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\"(1) A public body may exempt from disclosure as a public record under this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">\"(a) Information of a personal' nature where the public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Our initial inquiry is whether the requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>information<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is \"of a personal nature\u201d. Although the Michigan FOIA was patterned after the federal FOIA, the requirement that the information be of a \"personal nature\u201d is unique to the state act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We can find no judicial support for the proposition that names and addresses are \"personal\u201d information.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Our brother cites the case of <em>Rowan v United States Post Office Dep% </em>397 US 728; 90 S Ct 1484; 25 L Ed 2d 736 (1970), for the proposition that the release of names and addresses is per se an invasion of one\u2019s personal privacy. In <em>Rowan, </em>a unanimous Supreme Court held that a federal statute<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> allowing persons to have their names deleted from an advertiser\u2019s mailing lists and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>hibiting future mailings to that person did not violate the sender\u2019s First Amendment right to communicate. Nothing in <em>Rowan </em>suggests that the mere act of obtaining an individual\u2019s name and address constitutes an invasion of privacy, or that mailing one piece of mail to an individual constitutes an invasion of privacy. If the individual finds the mailing objectionable and fills out the appropriate postal form, then and only then is the sender\u2019s right to communicate extinguished. The <em>Rowan </em>Court emphasized that only an \"unwilling\u201d or \"unreceptive\u201d recipient could foreclose the receipt of \"unwanted\u201d material through the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In interpreting 39 USC 4009, the <em>Rowan </em>Court struck a delicate balance between the right to send and the right not to receive mail. While purporting to follow <em>Rowan, </em>our colleague\u2019s opinion strikes a far different balance, one greatly restricting the asserted First Amendment right to communicate. Instead of giving the sender the opportunity to make at least one initial mailing, with additional mailings prohibited to those persons finding the first mailing objectionable, our brother <em>presumes </em>that every person will find the first mailing an objectionable \"invasion of privacy, * * * a conduit into the sanctuary of the home\u201d, and therefore effectively forbids even the first mailing. This presumption is as paternalistic as it is erroneous. The <em>Rowan </em>decision actually supports the release of the names and addresses and the contemplated political mailing in this case, since it provides the mechanism by which individuals may choose whether to receive mailings from the plaintiff. The individual recipients should decide whether they find the plaintiff\u2019s political mailings objectionable; this Court should not make that decision for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>We are satisfied that names, addresses, telephone numbers, and other standard identifying information simply are not embarrassing information \"of a personal nature\u201d for the overwhelming majority of students at Michigan State University.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Most citizens voluntarily divulge their names and addresses on such a widespread basis that any alleged privacy interest in the information is either absent or waived. People applying for employment reveal their names and addresses on their resumes; cashing a check or using a credit card requires the release of one\u2019s address; and ordering magazines or otherwise communicating through the mail reveals one\u2019s address. Being a licensed driver, a car owner, a property owner or taxpayer, an officer of a corporation, an applicant for a marriage license, or a registered voter requires revelation, at a minimum, of one\u2019s name and address, information which is often routinely made available to the public.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While some people might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>prefer </em>that their names and addresses not be known to certain individuals such as advertisers, bill collectors, or freeloading relatives, that preference is simply not based on the fact that one\u2019s address is a \"personal\u201d, intimate, or embarrassing piece of information. We leave for another day the question whether, in certain unusual circumstances, ordinarily impersonal information might take on an intensely personal character. <em>Cf. United States Dep\u2019t of State v Washington Post Co, </em>\u2014 US \u2014, \u2014; 102 S Ct 1957; 72 L Ed 2d 358, 362, fn 2 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">None of the decisions interpreting the federal FOIA<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> suggest that the release of names and addresses, without more, constitutes an invasion of privacy. In one of the earliest \"address list\u201d cases, <em>Getman v NLRB, </em>146 US App DC 209, 213-214; 450 F2d 670 (1971), the court upheld a federal FOIA request by two labor law professors for a list of names, addresses, and telephone numbers of employees eligible to vote in certain labor elections. The professors were studying the effect of campaign tactics utilized by employers and unions. In order to conduct a valid empirical study, the researchers wished to conduct personal interviews both before and after the election. Accordingly, eligible voters would be telephoned in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>solicit their consent to a personal interview. The court characterized any invasion of privacy involved in \"losing their anonymity\u201d and being solicited over the telephone as \"relatively minor\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\"[T]he real thrust of Exemption (6) is to guard against unnecessary disclosure of files * * * which would contain 'intimate details\u2019 of a 'highly personal\u2019 nature. The giving of names and addresses is a very much lower degree of disclosure; in themselves a bare name and address give no information about an individual which is embarrassing.\u201d 146 US App DC 214. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The only cases in which the federal FOIA has been held not to require the release of names and addresses has been when the disclosure would have revealed <em>additional </em>embarrassing information about an individual.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Harbolt v Dep\u2019t of State, </em>616 F2d 772, 774 (CA 5, 1980), the court denied a request for a list of the names and United States addresses of the United States citizens imprisoned in foreign countries on narcotics offenses. The court remarked that \"[n]othing could be more personal than an individual\u2019s name and home address, <em>when linked with the stigma of incarceration </em>abroad(Emphasis added.) Similarly, in <em>Wine Hobby USA, Inc v United States Internal Revenue Service, </em>502 F2d 133 (CA 3, 1974), the release of a list of heads of households registering as making up to 200 gallons of wine per year for personal use was denied not because the release of <em>any </em>list of names and addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>invades the privacy of the persons on the list, but because release of the list would reveal certain potentially embarrassing facts. The court noted that release of the list would reveal (1) that the registering individual was not living alone, (2) that the registering individual was the head of the household, and (3) that winemaking activity was taking place within the home. It is easy to speculate about the embarrassing effect of it being revealed, for example, that the president of the local Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union makes 200 gallons of wine per year in her basement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The release of biographical data, without more, has been held not to be barred by the privacy exemption of the federal FOIA. In <em>Simpson v </em>Vance, 208 US App DC 270; 648 F2d 10 (1980), the court found no clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy in the release of names, addresses, educational background, employment experience, and other biographical information about employees of the United States State Department.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Of course, release of the list sought in this case would reveal that the named persons were enrolled at Michigan State University, but such information is also not personal, intimate, or embarrassing, especially as to those students electing to have their names published in the student directory. _</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Another federal case closely on point is <em>Disabled Officers Ass\u2019n v Rumsfeld, </em>428 F Supp 454 (D DC, 1977). In that case, an unincorporated nonprofit association of officers retired with or for a service-connected disability sought a list of names and addresses of all such disabled officers. The association engages in a number of political activities, including lobbying and testifying before Congressional committees on legislation affecting the interests of retired military personnel. Like the instant plaintiff, the association intended to solicit support for its organization and its political goals by mailing information to the individuals on the list. The court concluded that, as in <em>Getman, supra, </em>the release of names and addresses did not reveal any personal or embarrassing information, and that any invasion of privacy was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In <em>Ditlow v Schultz, </em>170 US App DC 352, 355-356; 517 F2d 166 (1975), the plaintiff sought the names and addresses of all individuals taking trans-Pacific airline flights during a certain time period. The plaintiff intended to use the information to assemble a list of members for his antitrust class action against the airlines. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, his antitrust suit had already been dismissed on the merits, with an appeal pending in the federal circuit court of appeals. The District of Columbia Circuit therefore deferred ruling on the plaintiff\u2019s FOIA lawsuit until such time as it became clear that the antitrust lawsuit was reinstated and it was necessary to compile a list of class members. The <em>Ditlow </em>court did grant the plaintiff the requested relief by enjoining the defendant from destroying the requested data, noting that it was \"doubtful\u201d that the information would reveal \"intimate or highly personal details\u201d <em>(id., </em>fn 12), and noting that, as in <em>Getman, supra, </em>\"disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>sure would result in less than a substantial invasion of privacy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Other cases have presented much more compelling reasons for denying the release of certain names and addresses, yet the federal courts have steadfastly implemented the FOIA policy in favor of disclosure. In <em>Robles v Environmental Protection Agency, </em>484 F2d 843 (CA 4, 1973), the plaintiff sought the names and addresses and radiation levels of some 15,000 homes built with radioactive uranium tailings in and around Grand Junction, Colorado. The homeowners were told that the results of the survey would be confidential. The court held that the privacy exemption did not prevent disclosure, and the information was released. In <em>Kurzon v Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>649 F2d 65 (CA 1, 1981), the court ordered the release of the names and addresses of unsuccessful applicants for research grants from the National Cancer Institute. Despite the damage that might be done to the unsuccessful applicants\u2019 professional reputations, the court found that the case did not fall within the privacy exemption and ordered disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Consistent with federal authority, we hold that names and addresses of students enrolled at Michigan State University are not \"information of a personal nature\u201d within the meaning of MCL 15.243(l)(a); MSA 4.1801(13)(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the requested names and addresses are \"personal\u201d and that disclosure would create an invasion of privacy, the question then becomes whether disclosure would constitute a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy\u201d. In <em>Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v Rose, </em>425 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>352; 96 S Ct 1592; 48 L Ed 2d 11 (1976), the United States Supreme Court adopted a \"balancing test\u201d under which the public interest in disclosure is to be weighed against the individual\u2019s right to privacy. The majority concluded that disclosure of discipline case summaries of honor code violations at the Air Force Academy did not necessarily constitute a \"clearly unwarranted\u201d invasion of privacy, as long as names and other identifying information were deleted. The court acknowledged that some officers\u2019 identities <em>might </em>be known and revealed by fellow cadets who remembered the incident leading to a discipline hearing and that such identification \"could expose the formerly accused men to lifelong embarrassment, perhaps disgrace, as well as practical disabilities, such as loss of employment or friends\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 377. But the Court reasoned that the privacy exemption \"was directed at threats to privacy interests more palpable than mere possibilities\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 380, fn 19. Further, upon remand and <em>in camera </em>inspection, the trial court was free to withhold any case summary if deletion of all identifying information was insufficient to safeguard privacy. <em>Id., </em>p 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Unfortunately, the Supreme Court failed to specify whether the \"balancing\u201d is to be done in light of a hypothetical, unrestricted public disclosure or the specific disclosure and use contemplated by the requesting party. See <em>Ditlow, supra, </em>170 US App DC 357; <em>Getman, supra, </em>146 US App DC 216, fn 24; <em>Disabled Officers Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>428 F Supp 457. Perhaps in <em>Rose </em>it was unnecessary to decide that issue, since the specific use contemplated was unrestricted public disclosure in a law review article. In principle, most courts would find that unrestricted public disclosure is required by the fact that \"any person\u201d or \"a person\u201d may obtain re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>cords under the federal FOIA.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In practice, however, the merits of the specific contemplated use appear to determine whether or not the court will order disclosure.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Our brother notes this dilemma and would hold that \"[i]t is permissible to define the public interest in disclosure by referring to the uses contemplated by <em>some </em>members of the public, but not by <em>exclusively </em>focusing on the intention of the person requesting the information\u201d (emphasis in original), and that \"a specific purpose cannot serve as a catalyst nor an impediment to disclosure\u201d. If the lower courts find it difficult to agree as to whether a specific public benefit is outweighed by a specific invasion of privacy, how can they possibly balance hypothetical public benefits against hypothetical invasions of privacy? The ease with which such a vague hypothetical balancing test can be manipulated is obvious. By failing to mention beneficial uses to which <em>some </em>members of the public might put the information,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and emphasizing the dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>gers of a \"computerized dossier\u201d that <em>some </em>members of the public might create,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> our brother\u2019s conclusion is foreordained. While limiting the uses to which the information is put and the persons to which it is disclosed is not always easy or practical,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> such a procedure should be followed when the alternative is total nondisclosure. The overriding purpose of the FOIA is to require the fullest possible disclosure; when a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy would result from unrestricted disclosure, but not from a disclosure limited to certain persons for specific purposes, the privacy exemption cannot justify the blanket nondisclosure approved by my colleague.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We think the public benefits of voter registration and political campaigning contemplated in this case clearly outweigh any minimal invasion of privacy. The fundamental importance of voter registration and political communication in a democ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>racy cannot be overestimated. However, as in <em>Disabled Officers Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>which did <em>not </em>involve an \"opt out\u201d option, we do not find it necessary to impose any restrictions limiting disclosure to political purposes. One can agree that \"[e]veryman\u2019s mail today is made up overwhelmingly of material he did not seek from persons he does not know\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> without finding that such \"junk mail\u201d constitutes an intolerable or actionable invasion of privacy. In dismissing a suit to enjoin the State of New York from selling the names and addresses of persons registering automobiles, the federal court aptly noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\">\"The short, though regular, journey from mail box to trash can * * * is an acceptable burden, at least as far as the Constitution is concerned.\u201d <em>Lamont v Comm\u2019r of Motor Vehicles, </em>269 F Supp 880, 883 (SD NY, 1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Students at Michigan State University may prevent the release of their names and the consequent receipt of unsolicited \"junk mail\u201d by (1) filing notice under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act that \"directory information\u201d is not to be released absent prior consent, or (2) responding to the specific \"opt out\u201d opportunity to be excluded from the student directory. Once a piece of \"offensive\u201d junk mail is received, further mailings from that sender may be prevented by (3) filing the appropriate form with the post office under 39 USC 3008. The persons listed on the requested tape have not one but three opportunities to avoid undertaking the journey from mail box to trash can; that is more than sufficient to protect their right of privacy. The stated purpose of <em>Rowan, supra, </em>397 US 736, was to \"make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>householder the exclusive and final judge of what will cross his threshold\u201d. Instead, this Court would impose its judgment as to the offensiveness of junk mail on those householders who have failed to exercise not one but three options to avoid such mail. That policy is both unwise and inconsistent with the provisions of the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We therefore hold that unrestricted public disclosure of the requested information does not constitute a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy\u201d within the meaning of the privacy exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Our brother appears to agree that the disclosure of the requested names and addresses in <em>printed </em>form does not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. However, he asserts that disclosure in <em>magnetic tape </em>form does constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>We cannot accept the conclusion that the Legislature intended to allow a public body to exempt otherwise public records from disclosure by the simple expedient of converting the public record from one form to another. Surely such a result would exalt form over substance. The plain language of the statute reveals a legislative intent to treat all governmental \"writings\u201d in the same fashion regardless of form. MCL 15.232(e); MSA 4.1801(2)(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\" 'Writing\u2019 means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, photocopying, and every other means of recording, and includes letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combinations thereof, and papers, maps, <em>magnetic </em>or paper <em>tapes, </em>photographic films or prints, microfilm, microfiche, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, or other means of recording or retaining meaningful content.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The supposed protection of students\u2019 privacy gained by denying disclosure in magnetic tape form is both unfair and illusory. The denial is unfair because it penalizes only those groups or individuals unable to afford the cost of converting the printed information into magnetic tape form.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This cost barrier is illusory in that any commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>cial organization anticipating a return from its solicitation in excess of the cost of creating the tape will have no deterrent whatsoever to putting the information in a computer-readable format. In fact, the actual number of unsolicited mailings to the student body might well increase, since the company has every incentive to recoup its initial investment by selling or renting the tape to as many groups or organizations as possible. The result would be that commercial solicitations of the student body would be feasible while political campaigns would be difficult, except perhaps for the particularly affluent.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The appellee argues that since the <em>information </em>is made available in printed form, the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act have been satisfied. But nowhere in \u00a7 13 can there be found an exemption for \"information\u201d already available to the public. Instead, we find in MCL 15.232(c); MSA 14.1801(2)(c), that \"public records\u201d not public <em>information, </em>must be disclosed unless exempt. Similarly, MCL 15.233; MSA 4.1801(3) gives a person the right to \"inspect, copy, or receive copies of a <em>public record\u201d, </em>not merely to obtain the \"information\u201d contained in a public record in any form in which the public body sees fit to release it. A paper printout is simply not a \"copy\u201d of a magnetic tape. Furthermore, the act directs that \"A public body shall utilize the most economical means available for providing copies of public records\u201d. MCL 15.234(3); MSA 4.1801(4X3). The undisputed testimony revealed that it was both cheaper and faster to copy the magnetic tape than to create a printed list of some 44,000 names and addresses.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The defendant Michigan State Univer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>sity violated this clear statutory directive by attempting to utilize the less economical means of creating printed material from the magnetic tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Our brother holds that nondisclosure of the magnetic tape is justified because it converts \"seemingly benign data\u201d into \"an intrusive form\u201d. It is obvious that the magnetic tape form makes the information more <em>usable </em>for the purposes contemplated by the plaintiff: mailing political information. But to equate usefulness with intrusiveness is to turn the FOIA on its head. A public body should not be allowed to thwart legitimate uses of public information by releasing the information in a format difficult or expensive to use. Releasing the requested names and addresses in handwritten form would make it even more difficult to read and use the information; surely that does not mean that a person requesting a printed copy can be given a handwritten copy because the latter is less usable and therefore less \"intrusive\u201d? Following that rationale would encourage a public body to meet its FOIA requests with the response that the actual public document or \"writing\u201d cannot be copied, but the agency will gladly produce the same \"information\u201d in a \"less intrusive\u201d form such as a foreign language, Morse Code, or hieroglyphics.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Finally, our colleague attaches little significance to the fact that the students listed on the tape failed to exercise not one but two opportunities to prevent their names from even appearing on the tape. It is argued that their consent was limited to release in printed form only. I cannot agree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>light of the unrestricted disclosure of \"directory information\u201d authorized under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 USC 1232g. That statute, as well as 45 CFR 99.37, does not restrict disclosure of names and addresses to any form, unless the student affirmatively forbids disclosure. Any student wishing to prevent identifying information from being disclosed on magnetic tape would have to \"opt out\u201d, since the university could always make a discretionary disclosure not required by the FOIA. <em>Chrysler Corp v Brown, </em>441 US 281; 99 S Ct 1705; 60 L Ed 2d 208 (1979). In fact, the university did sell the requested magnetic tape to a private corporation, which in turn used the tape in a profit-making enterprise, the publication of the 1978-1979 Student Directory. The effect of our colleague\u2019s opinion is that the university could sell or lease the same tape to other private corporations, to one political party and not another, to opponents of initiative proposals and not supporters,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> or to incumbent candidates for the board of trustees and not challengers. Surely the students failing to opt out of the directory did not have any reasonable expectation that their \"directory information\u201d would be released only in certain forms. To the extent any such expectation exists, it can be easily eliminated in the future by this Court\u2019s opinion and any revised \"opt out\u201d notice given by the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>We agree with the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dep\u2019t of Air Force, supra, </em>425 US 361, that the exemptions from disclosure \"must be narrowly construed\u201d. The Court must balance the public interest against the privacy interests with a \"tilt\u201d in favor of disclosure. <em>Disabled Officers Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>428 F Supp 457, and cases cited therein. We are obligated to remember that the alleged invasion of privacy must be \"clearly unwarranted\u201d.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> That standard charges the defendant Michigan State University with the heavy burden of proving that the requested document was exempt from the general rule of disclosure. That burden has not been met. We must dissent from the view that the requested magnetic tape may be exempted from disclosure under the exemption for a \"clearly unwarranted\u201d invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The Court of Appeals assigned as a separate reason for denying disclosure Mich Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18, which provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">\"The credit of the state shall not be granted to, nor in aid of any person, association or corporation, public or private, except as authorized in this constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Without engaging in an extended analysis of pre-1963 cases interpreting the analogous provision of earlier Michigan Constitutions, it is clear that in order to trigger application of art 9, \u00a7 18, there must be a lending of credit. <em>Gaylord v Gaylord City </em>Clerk, 378 Mich 273, 291-294; 144 NW2d 460 (1966); <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1966 PA 346, </em>380 Mich 554, 563-564; 158 NW2d 416 (1968); <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1976 PA 295, 1976 PA 297, </em>401 Mich 686, 701-703; 259 NW2d 129 (1977).

While the definition of \"public purpose\u201d for taxation purposes was once very narrow, the concept has been greatly enlarged in the modern era. See <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v Detroit, </em>410 Mich 616, 664; 304 NW2d 455 (1981) (Ryan, J., <em>dissenting). </em>The public purposes of the Freedom of Information Act are more than sufficient to justify the disclosure of public records on an equal basis to the general public for the incremental cost of copying, rather than the original cost of creating the public record. The general philosophy of the act is that public records \"belong\u201d to the public; we refuse to sanction nondisclosure on the theory that this is \"proprietary\u201d information \"belonging\u201d to the public body.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Our reversal of the Court of Appeals on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>merits necessitates consideration of the attorney-fee issue raised by the plaintiff. The attorney-fee provision of the Michigan FOIA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">\"(4) If a person asserting the right to inspect or to receive a copy of a public record or a portion thereof prevails in an action commenced pursuant to this section, the court shall award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and disbursements. If the person prevails in part, the court may in its discretion award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and disbursements or an appropriate portion thereof. The award shall be assessed against the public body liable for damages under subsection (5).\u201d MCL 15.240(4); MSA 4.1801(10X4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Although the plaintiff prevailed at the circuit-court level by obtaining an order directing production of a copy of the magnetic tape containing student names and addresses, the circuit judge denied the requested attorney fees because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">\"the denial by MSU was not arbitrary or capricious and * * * the matter presented to the court was a valid question of first impression with substantial effects on the rights of third persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">A motion to modify or amend the order to include an award of attorney fees was denied without further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">It may be that the trial court denied the requested attorney fees on the theory that the defendant public body did not \"arbitrarily and capriciously\u201d violate the act within the meaning of MCL 15.240(5); MSA 4.180N10)(5).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> But a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>of an arbitrary and capricious violation is only necessary when the plaintiff seeks additional punitive damages in the amount of $500 pursuant to subsection (5). The absence of any such requirement from the attorney-fee provision of subsection (4) is a persuasive indication that the Legislature intended to allow the plaintiff reasonable attorney fees even if the public body\u2019s denial was not arbitrary and capricious but was in good faith. Under the Michigan FOIA, the court <em>\"shall </em>award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and disbursements\u201d to a prevailing plaintiff.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The denial of attorney fees might also have been based upon the view, as urged by the defendant, that the plaintiff did not prevail but only prevailed \"in part\u201d. It is argued that if the plaintiff only \"prevails in part\u201d the trial judge has the unfettered discretion to deny attorney fees altogether. While at first blush the statute is susceptible of that interpretation, a closer reading convinces us that the court\u2019s discretion is limited to awarding one of the two statutory alternatives; namely, \"reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and disbursements\u201d, or else \"an appropriate portion thereof\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The basic rule set forth in the statute is that a prevailing plaintiff is entitled to his attorney fees, costs, and disbursements. If the plaintiff prevails in full, it matters not a whit that the defendant\u2019s denial was not arbitrary or capricious, that the legal point was one of first impression, or that the defendant may have sought in good faith to protect the rights of third parties by violating the statute. If the plaintiff seeks disclosure of ten documents and the court orders disclosure of the ten documents, the plaintiff has prevailed and the court <em>shall </em>award reasonable attorney fees, costs, and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">But suppose the same plaintiff sought disclosure of one more document in addition to the ten disclosed and the court upheld the denial as to this eleventh document. Must we conclude that since the plaintiff has only prevailed \"in part\u201d the trial judge can exercise his \"discretion\u201d and deny any award of attorney fees? Such an approach would be contrary to the spirit of the FOIA, since it would encourage plaintiffs to include in their FOIA suit only those requests which they are absolutely certain will prevail. Alternatively, that approach would encourage the drastic fragmentation of FOIA claims. A separate complaint would be filed for each document requested (or, in this case, each deletion or restriction on the use of the information) so that the plaintiff could prevail \"in full\u201d as to each document ultimately disclosed. Such a procedure fails to comport with judicial efficiency, legislative intent, or common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In the case of a plaintiff who \"prevails in part\u201d, we read the statute to confer upon the court the discretion to award either the entire amount of plaintiff\u2019s reasonable attorney fees, costs, and disbursements <em>or </em>an appropriate portion thereof. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>appropriateness of the portion awarded is not to be measured by the good faith of the defendant or the novelty of the litigation, but rather by the amount of attorney fees, costs, and disbursements fairly allocable to the successful portion of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In the instant case, the plaintiff prevailed on the critical point in dispute, namely, whether Michigan State University is required to release the requested student names and addresses in magnetic tape form. The deletions from the tape and restrictions upon use were stipulations suggested by the plaintiff to expedite the decision. Whether we conclude that the plaintiff prevailed in full or in part, it is clear that the amount of attorney fees allocable to the \"denied\u201d portion of the magnetic tape was negligible. If anything, the plaintiff\u2019s stipulation saved considerable court time and attorney fees for both sides; such stipulations should be encouraged rather than discouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for a determination of reasonable attorney fees, costs, and disbursements.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b678-7\">Kavanagh and Levin, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b678-8\">The late Justice Blair Moody, Jr., took no part in the decision of this case._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\"> Michigan State University, as a recipient of federal funds, falls within the purview of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (Buckley Amendment; PL 90-247, Title IV, \u00a7 438 as amended; 20 USC 1232g, 45 CFR 99.1 <em>et seq.). </em>That statute provides for access to student records by eligible students and parents, and also establishes the privacy of those records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> Under \u00a7 10 of the FOIA, MCL 15.240; MSA 4.1801(10), a person who challenges the denial of information and prevails in court is entitled to reasonable attorney fees, costs and disbursements.
