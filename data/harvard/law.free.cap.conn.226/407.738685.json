We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The parties do not dispute the underlying facts relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff, Timber Trails Associates, is the owner of 281 acres in the town of New Fairfield, and 673.2 acres in the town of Sherman. In the early 1970s, upon application by Timber Trails Corporation (corporation), the plaintiffs predecessor in title, the state forester had classified these two abutting parcels as forest land pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1988, the corporation was dissolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and transferred all of its assets, including the forest land, to the plaintiff, the only stockholder of the corporation. The real estate conveyance statements provided that no consideration had been received for the deeds,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and neither town clerk collected a conveyance tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The state forester, upon notification of the change of the owner of record of the property, issued to the plaintiff a certificate that continued the designation of the parcels as forest land.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the state forester had continued the property\u2019s designation as forest land, the plaintiff did not apply for classification of the parcels as forest land on the assessment lists of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ants. The defendants maintained that the transfer of the land from the corporation to the plaintiff had terminated the classification of the property as forest land under General Statutes \u00a7 12-504h.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The assessors subsequently declassified the parcels and changed the basis of the property\u2019s assessment from current use value to fair market value pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-63.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The New Fairfield and Sherman parcels had been assessed as forest land with current use values of $19,495 and $67,320, respectively, and were reassessed after the declassification at $606,140 and $1,975,700, respectively. As a result, the property tax levied on the New Fairfield parcel increased from $791.50 to $24,609.28, and the property tax on the Sherman parcel increased from $807.84 to $23,710. The plaintiff appealed the assessments of the land to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-119.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The court sustained both appeals, concluding that the land had remained classified as forest land for assessment purposes because the assessors lacked the authority to declassify it. In this court the defendants claim that: (1) the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiff could appeal directly to it without first appealing to the defendants\u2019 boards of tax review; and (2) \u00a7 12-504h did not permit the defendants to declassify the property as forest land upon its transfer without consideration pursuant to the corporate dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The defendants contend initially that the plaintiff was required to appeal the assessors\u2019 decisions on the declassification of the forest land to the boards of tax review pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-111 before appealing to the Superior Court pursuant to Public Acts 1991, No. 91-221, \u00a7 4 (P.A. 91-221).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d (g) provides that \u201c[a]n owner of land aggrieved by the denial of any application to the assessor of a municipality for classification of land as forest land shall have the same rights and remedies for appeal and relief as are provided in the general statutes for taxpayers claiming to be aggrieved by the doings of assessors or boards of tax review.\u201d Section 12-111 authorizes \u201cany person . . . claiming to be aggrieved by the doings of the assessors\u201d to appeal to the board of tax review; see <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Newington, </em>156 Conn. 107, 114, 239 A.2d 478 (1968); and, at the time in question, P.A. 91-221, \u00a7 4 (now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a), authorized an appeal to the Superior Court \u201cby any person claiming to be aggrieved by an action of the board of tax review.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Newington, </em>supra; see also <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 649-50, 563 A.2d 688 (1989). The defendants argue that because the plaintiff was aggrieved by the assessors\u2019 recalculation of the property taxes on the basis of fair market value, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was an appeal to each defendant\u2019s board of tax review pursuant to \u00a7 12-111. The defendants contend that because the plaintiff could appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to P.A. 91-221, \u00a7 4, only upon an adverse decision by a board of tax review, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff\u2019s direct appeal from the actions of the town assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Neither \u00a7 12-111 nor P.A. 91-221, \u00a7 4, proscribes, however, an appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 12-119 in a proper case. Section 12-119 expressly provides that an owner may appeal to the Superior Court \u201ca tax laid on property . . . computed on an assessment which, under all the circumstances, was manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of such property . . . .\u201d See also <em>Second Stone Ridge Cooperative Corporation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>220 Conn. 335, 341-42, 597 A.2d 326 (1991), and cases cited therein. The plaintiff claims that the defendants disregarded the statutory provisions entitling the plaintiff to the continued designation of the parcels as forest land, and that, therefore, the defendants\u2019 calculation of the property taxes on the basis of fair market value rather than current use value was improper. The assessors\u2019 alleged improper valuations resulted in a tax assessment by each defendant that is approximately thirty times greater than the plaintiff had been required to pay prior to the declassification of the property. Because the plaintiff has claimed that the assessments were both \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d and \u201carrived at . . . by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of such property,\u201d the plaintiffs appeals directly to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 12-119 were proper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The defendants next argue that the trial court improperly concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 12-504h did not permit them to declassify forest land that had been transferred without consideration pursuant to a corporate dissolution. This claim is not supported, however, by the plain language of \u00a7 12-504h, which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>vides that once property has been classified as forest land pursuant to \u00a7 12-107d, it \u201cshall remain so classified without the filing of any new application subsequent to such classification . . . until either of the following shall occur: (1) The use of such land is changed to a use other than that described in the application for the existing classification by [the] record owner, or (2) such land is sold by [the] record owner.\u201d The property could not have been reclassified pursuant to \u00a7 12-504h (1), because it is undisputed that the use of the land has not changed. Nor would reclassification of the property have been permitted under \u00a7 12-504h (2), because the land was not \u201csold\u201d by the corporation to the plaintiff. In this context, \u201csold\u201d means more than \u201cconveyed.\u201d A \u201csale\u201d of property is a \u201ctransfer of the absolute title therein <em>for a price\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Guilford-Chester Water Co. </em>v. <em>Guilford, </em>107 Conn. 519, 527, 141 A. 880 (1928). On the other hand, to \u201cconvey\u201d real estate means simply \u201cto transfer the legal title to it from the present owner to another [by an appropriate instrument].\u201d <em>Abendroth </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>29 Conn. 356, 365 (1860). Because the corporation transferred the forest land to the plaintiff for no consideration, the trial court properly concluded that the property had not been \u201csold by [the] record owner\u201d as required by \u00a7 12-504h (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The defendants contend also that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-504a, 12-504b and 12-504c allow termination of the forest land classification on other grounds. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Section 12-504a (b)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides for a conveyance tax on any land classified as forest land that is sold within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ten years of classification or acquisition, and the recording of the deed and payment of the conveyance tax triggers the automatic declassification of the land pursuant to \u00a7 12-504b. The defendants conceded, however, that \u00a7 12-504a (b) does not apply to a conveyance after the ten year recapture period expires. The trial court properly concluded, therefore, that, because the land had been classified as forest land for more than ten years prior to the dissolution of the corporation, \u00a7 12-504a (b) is inapposite in these circumstances. Section 12-504b<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> requires the payment of the conveyance tax prior to the recording of the deed for the sale of forest land. Because the transfer in the present case, however, was not subject to the conveyance tax, \u00a7 12-504b does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Section 12-504c<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> identifies exemptions to the conveyance tax required by \u00a7 12-504a. The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>argue that the transfer of real property for no consideration in connection with a corporate dissolution is not one of the several exemptions specified in the statute and that the assessors, therefore, could properly have declassified the parcels. Because no conveyance tax was due pursuant to \u00a7 12-504a, however, the issue of exemptions under \u00a7 12-504c is irrelevant to our analysis. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly determined that \u00a7 12-504h rather than \u00a7\u00a7 12-504a, 12-504b or 12-504c applied in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The defendants\u2019 final contention is that the transfers of the property from the corporation to the plaintiff automatically terminated the property\u2019s forest land classification pursuant to \u00a7 12-504\u00cd, which provides that a classification of property as forest land \u201cshall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>deemed personal to the particular owner who requests such classification and shall not run with the land.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendants argue that the claimed termination of the classification of property as forest land required the plaintiff to file a new application with the defendants for assessment purposes pursuant to \u00a7 12-107d. Section 12-504f, however, concerns the issuance and recording of certificates identifying property as forest land for the purpose of the \u201cobligation to pay the conveyance tax imposed by this chapter.\u201d In light of our conclusion that no conveyance tax was due pursuant to \u00a7 12-504a (b), \u00a7 12-504f is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The construction of \u00a7 12-504f urged by the defendants, moreover, conflicts with the plain language of \u00a7 12-504h, which provides that land classified as forest land remains so classified \u201cwithout the filing of any new application subsequent to such classification\u201d until either the use of the land is changed or the land is sold. Neither condition had occurred and the state forester had continued the designation of the property as forest land after the transfer of the property to the plaintiff. In these circumstances, the assessors were required to continue the classification of the property as forest land for assessment purposes pursuant to \u00a7 12-107d (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the state forester properly continued the property\u2019s forest land designation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>pursuant to the unambiguous direction of \u00a7 12-504h and that the defendants were without authority to declassify it. Because the reassessments of the property based upon the improper declassifications were manifestly excessive, the trial court properly sustained the plaintiffs appeals pursuant to \u00a7 12-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-10\"> The defendants each appealed to the Appellate Court and the town of New Fairfield subsequently moved that the appeals be consolidated. The Appellate Court granted the motion and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) An owner of land may file a written application with the state forester for its designation by the state forester as forest land.
