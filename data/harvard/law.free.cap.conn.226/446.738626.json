The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, ruling that, pursuant to the Connecticut Recreational Land Use Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-557f through 52-557i;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>immune from liability for the plaintiffs injuries. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>motion for summary judgment because: (1) the defendants had not made the field \u201cavailable to the public\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-557g (a); and (2) an organized league baseball game is not a \u201crecreational purpose\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 52-557\u00cd (4). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. On June 22,1986, while chasing a batted ball, the plaintiff ran into a stone wall that bordered the baseball field. As a result, he suffered various personal injuries. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was a member of the Daniel-son/Moosup American Legion baseball team, and was playing center field in a league game. The field on which he was injured is adjacent to the Plainfield High School. It is owned by the town and controlled by the board. Since 1973, the town had permitted the American Legion team to use the field without charge, fee, or rent, whenever school was not in session.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The plaintiffs complaint alleged that the defendants were liable for his injuries under theories of both negligence and nuisance. The defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were immune from liability under the act. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, concluding that the act rendered the defendants immune from suit because the field on which the plaintiff had been injured had been made \u201cavailable to the public with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>out charge, rent [or] fee\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-557g (a), and because a baseball game constituted a \u201crecreational purpose\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 52-557\u00cd (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the defendants failed to make the field \u201cavailable to the public\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 52-557g of the act because there were restrictions on its use. The plaintiff argues that because the defendants did not make the field \u201cavailable to the public,\u201d they were not entitled to the immunity afforded by the act and the trial court, therefore, had improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d See <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Carriage Lane Associates, </em>219 Conn. 772, 780-81, 595 A.2d 908 (1991). \u201cOnce the moving party has presented evidence in support of the motion for summary judgment, the opposing party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue. ... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. \u2018Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Burns v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 451, 455, 472 A.2d 1257 (1984). We recognize that \u201c[i]n deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Carriage Lane Associates, </em>supra, 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Section 52-557g (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A]n owner of land who <em>w,akes all or any part of the land available to the public </em>without charge, rent, fee or other commercial service for recreational purposes owes no duty of care to keep the land, or the part thereof so made available, safe for entry or use by others for recreational purposes, or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure or activity on the land to persons entering for recreational purposes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Before the trial court, it was undisputed that, in order to prevail on their motion for summary judgment, the defendants, the owners<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the ball field, were required by \u00a7 52-557g (a) to have made the field \u201cavailable to the public\u201d for recreational purposes. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Barenz, </em>221 Conn. 256, 260, 603 A.2d 399 (1992). In support of their motion, the defendants presented the affidavit of Albert DePetrillo, superintendent of the board, who stated that the high school playing field was made available to the public for recreational purposes without fee, charge or rent. In response, the plaintiff presented evidence that restrictions applied to the public\u2019s use of the field. In particular, the plaintiff presented excerpts from the transcript of the deposition taken of DePetrillo, wherein DePetrillo had stated that the field was available to the public only when school was not in session and that any team desiring to use the field was required to obtain permission to do so in order to avoid scheduling conflicts with another event.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The plaintiff argues on appeal that by limiting the use of the field to times when school was not in session and by requiring permission for its use, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ants did not make the field \u201cavailable to the public\u201d in the manner contemplated by \u00a7 52-557g. The plaintiff further contends that by permitting scheduled league games to occupy the playing field at a given time, the defendants necessarily excluded the concurrent use of the field by others, thereby contravening the purpose of the act to make recreational land available to the public. In support of his argument, the plaintiff cites to the legislative history of the act, claiming that the legislature envisioned that immunity from liability under the act would only be afforded to landowners who \u201callow their property to be used for the entire citizenry.\u201d 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1971 Sess., p. 1806, remarks of Representative David Lavine.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Although the purpose of the act is to make land accessible for recreational use by the public, nothing in the language of \u00a7 52-557g (a) mandates that land, in order to be \u201cavailable to the public\u201d under the act, must be open in its entirety to everyone simultaneously. In <em>Genco </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>7 Conn. App. 164, 508 A.2d 58 (1986), it was held that signs posted by the owner of a lake that expressly restricted the use of the lake in certain locations did not make the land unavailable to the public. Stated differently, the word \u201cpublic\u201d in \u00a7 52-557g (a) does not require that recreational land be made available to all members of the public at all times in order to provide a landowner with immunity from liability. \u201cFor an area to be \u2018open to public use\u2019 it does not have to be open to \u2018everybody all the time.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Anderson </em>v. <em>Witthaus, </em>340 Mo. 1004, 1011, 102 S.W.2d 99 (1937); see also <em>Peachtree on Peachtree Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>120 Ga. App. 403, 410, 170 S.E.2d 709 (1969); <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Baughman, </em>357 Pa. Super. 535, 538, 516 A.2d 390 (1986), appeal denied, 515 Pa. 572, 527 A.2d 534 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>207 Conn. 612, 615, 541 A.2d 865 (1988). The evidence presented by the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>in support of their motion for summary judgment clearly demonstrated that, given certain reasonable restrictions, any group or member of the public was entitled to use the baseball field. The fact that the public\u2019s use of the field was limited to the times when school was not in session, or by the obvious fact that only two teams could play baseball on the same field at the same time, does not mean the field was not \u201cavailable to the public\u201d under \u00a7 52-557g (a). See id. The imposed restrictions merely served to permit the orderly use of the field. Without restrictions, as the trial court noted, the defendants would have had to sanction a \u201cfree for all\u201d in order to be entitled to immunity under the statute, a result clearly not contemplated by \u00a7 52-557g (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s suggested interpretation of \u00a7 52-557g, that there must be no restrictions on the public\u2019s use of land in order for land to be covered by the act, albeit ideal, is impractical given the realities of recreational land use planning. \u201c[Pjrinciples of statutory construction . . . require us to construe a statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 712, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). \u201cWe must avoid a construction that fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the purpose the legislature sought to achieve. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 63-64, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985).\u201d Id., 713. Not all land made available to the public for recreational use consists of limitless expanses which the entire public can enjoy at the same time. The owners of public and private land, lakes, ponds, parks, playgrounds, and playing fields across the state obviously need the ability to place reasonable restrictions on the use of their property in order to induce them to make their land available for the enjoyment of the public. Without the ability to impose some restrictions, the owners of land desirable for recreational purposes would be loath to make it available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>public use for fear that the use would be unmanageable. The plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the act would invite chaos and would undermine its purpose of providing an incentive to landowners to allow their land to be used by the public for recreational purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For instance, any landowner considering allowing public use of his property might think twice before doing so if he or she were required to tolerate its use at all hours of the day or night in order to be entitled to immunity from liability. The legislature, in enacting \u00a7 52-557g (a), must have contemplated reasonable restrictions on the public\u2019s use of land covered by the statute. Because the plaintiff does not claim that the restrictions imposed by the defendants on the use of their land were unreasonable, their land was \u201cavailable to the public\u201d as contemplated by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The plaintiff next claims that because the activity engaged in, a league baseball game, was not a \u201crecreational purpose\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 52-557\u00cd (4), the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Section 52-557f (4) provides that: \u201c \u2018Recreational purpose\u2019 includes, <em>but is not limited to, </em>any of the following, or any combination thereof: Hunting, fishing, swimming, boating, camping, picnicking, hiking, pleasure driving, nature study, water skiing, snow skiing, ice skating, sledding, hang gliding, sport parachuting, hot air ballooning and viewing or enjoying historical, archaeological, scenic or scientific sites.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The plaintiff contends that the absence of any reference to organized team sports in \u00a7 52-557f (4) indicates that the legislature did not intend to include a league baseball game within its definition of \u201crecreational purpose.\u201d The plaintiff acknowledges that the recreational purposes enumerated in \u00a7 52-557f (4) are expressly stated <em>not </em>to be exclusive. Relying on the doctrine of ejusdem generis, however, he points out that the statutory list yields two common characteristics that any activity must possess in order to be properly regarded as \u201crecreational\u201d under \u00a7 52-557\u00cd (4). These characteristics are that the activity: (1) must be regularly engaged in on an informal, unstructured basis; and (2) entail the use or enjoyment of land in its natural state. The plaintiff maintains that because a league baseball game possesses neither of these characteristics, it cannot be regarded as a \u201crecreational purpose\u201d under \u00a7 52-557\u00cd (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u201cAccording to the [doctrine] of ejusdem generis, unless a contrary intent appears, where general terms are followed by specific terms in a statute, the general terms will be construed to embrace things of the same general kind or character as those specifically enumerated. 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands [1986]) \u00a7 47.17.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>218 Conn. 273, 278, 588 A.2d 1376 (1991). The application of this doctrine to the list of recreational purposes in \u00a7 52-557f (4) does not persuade us, however, that the legislature intended to exclude other more popular and more obvious recreational activities, many of which are engaged in as team sports, from furnishing immunity from liability to landowners who provide the public with free facilities for their enjoyment. Nothing in the act specifically manifests such an intention or specifically ordains that it was meant to apply only to individual, informal activities. If the legislature had desired to exclude organized activities and team sports from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>purview of the statute, it would seem logical that it would have done so explicitly. In fact, swimming, ice skating and skiing, which are all listed in the statute, frequently lend themselves to team competition. Moreover, many of the other activities mentioned are often engaged in on a scheduled, competitive or structured basis. The interpretation of the term \u201crecreational purpose\u201d urged by the plaintiff would therefore exclude activities actually enumerated in the statute as \u201crecreational purposefs]\u201d merely because they possessed a certain level of organization, a result not likely to have been intended by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The definition of \u201crecreational purpose\u201d in \u00a7 52-557\u00cd (4), which in reality is simply a nonexclusive list of leisure activities, was originally drawn from a model act promulgated by the Council of State Governments. See 24 Council of State Governments, \u201cPublic Recreation on Private Lands: Limitations on Liability,\u201d Suggested State Legislation (1965) pp. 150-52.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither the prefatory remarks accompanying the model act nor Connecticut\u2019s own legislative history sheds light on the meaning to be attributed to the statute\u2019s use of enumerated examples and its \u201cnot limited to\u201d language. We conclude, however, that the enumerated list serves only to denote a variety of activities, some of which are rather unique and not ordinarily characterized as recreational, that the General Assembly legislated should be regarded as recreational for purposes of the act. The list was not intended to exclude sports, such as baseball, that are universally recognized as recreational.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>In summary, we conclude that the list of activities enumerated in \u00a7 52-557f (4) is not exclusive and \u201cis not limited to\u201d those activities listed. Recreational activities naturally arise from the desires and preferences of the person who is enticed away from the troubles and toil of the workaday world and who is drawn to the outdoors to partake of an activity that is pleasant for its own sake. Had the legislature intended to include as \u201crecreational purpose[s]\u201d only those activities enumerated in the statute and similar activities, and then only if conducted in an informal manner, it would have slighted the recreational preferences of a large portion of the population. Team sports are certainly recreational and no less so if teams are organized into a league. As the late A. Bartlett Giamatti commented, \u201csports are in today\u2019s world what they were in yesterday\u2019s very different one\u2014a shared moment of leisure.\u201d A. Giamatti, Take Time for Paradise: Americans and Their Games (1989) pp. 14-15.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because an amateur sport is organized and played by teams does not deprive it of its recreational qualities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To conclude otherwise would be to impose an overly restrictive meaning on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the term \u201crecreational purpose\u201d in the statute, a meaning that is not warranted by the \u201cincludes, but is not limited to\u201d language of \u00a7 52-557\u00cd (4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The plaintiff next contends that a common characteristic distilled from the listed recreational purposes in \u00a7 52-557f (4) is that the activity must involve the use of a particular type of land, i.e., woodland, fields, lakes or other undeveloped open spaces. There is, however, nothing in the plain language of the statute to indicate that the only land to which the act applies is land in its natural state. The word \u201cland\u201d is broadly defined in \u00a7 52-557f (2), which provides: \u201c \u2018Land\u2019 means land, roads, water, watercourses, private ways and buildings, structures, and machinery or equipment when attached to the realty.\u201d Moreover, in <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Barenz, </em>supra, 261-62, we concluded that the landowner was entitled to immunity despite the fact that the accident took place, not in the forest primeval, but in a municipal park, owned and developed by the municipality and supervised by municipal employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Although the act, as originally passed, appeared to provide immunity primarily to owners of large tracts of land, a subsequent amendment to \u00a7 52-557g (a) indicates that the size of the land is not a relevant consideration in terms of the coverage provided by the act. Originally, General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 52-557g (a) read: \u201cExcept as provided in section 52-557h, an owner of <em>five or more acres of land </em>who makes such land available to the public without charge . . . owes no duty of care . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In 1973, the legislature amended the statute by deleting the phrase \u201cfive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>or more acres of land\u201d and substituting \u201call or any part of the land\u201d made available to the public. Public Acts 1973, No. 73-70. The amendment clearly indicated that the size of the land made available to the public for recreational purposes would not limit the scope of the immunity provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The plaintiff, despite <em>Manning </em>and the 1973 amendment to the act, nonetheless argues that the land intended to be covered by the act was that preserved in its pristine state. Turning to the legislative history of the act, the plaintiff argues that the focus of the act was on \u201cenjoyment of the rural life in Connecticut.\u201d 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1971 Sess., p. 1805, remarks of Representative David Lavine. Consequently, the scope of the act, according to the plaintiff, was not intended to include improved land in suburban or urban settings. The plaintiff further maintains that by expanding the scope of the act to apply to any tract of land, even those in urban and residential areas, it will encourage owners of such land, including municipalities, to manage and supervise their properties negligently. Consequently, the plaintiff suggests that, although the act may encourage landowners to open up their lands to the public for recreational uses, it will also unfairly cloak landowners with immunity from liability and become a formidable hurdle to the recovery of damages in instances where the land involved feasibly could have been supervised and made safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Courts in other jurisdictions are divided on whether their state\u2019s recreational land use acts apply when injuries occur on smaller improved tracts of land. See <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>492 A.2d 241, 244 (Del. 1985) (\u201cwe find [the act] not applicable to urban or residential areas improved with swimming pools, tennis courts, and the like\u201d); <em>Herring </em>v. <em>Hauck, </em>118 Ga. App. 623, 165 S.E.2d 198 (1968) (act not applicable to backyards or vacant lots in residential areas); <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Forest Hill Field </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Club, </em>119 N.J.

App. 281, 288, 600 P.2d 683 (1979) (act not applicable to park because it was \u201cimproved, routinely inspected, and . . . inside the city of Tacoma\u201d); compare <em>Rodrigue </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>449 So. 2d 1042 (La. 1984) (act applied to unsafe bleachers at a playground); <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>State, </em>408 So. 2d 336 (La. App. 1981), cert. denied, 412 So. 2d 1098 (La. 1982) (act applied to drowning at lake adjacent to recreational area); <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Omaha, </em>209 Neb. 835, 312 N.W.2d 256 (1981) (act applied to slippery slide located at a park); <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Harris County, </em>808 S.W.2d 257 (Tex. App. 1991) (act applied to playground equipment).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Our decision in <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Barenz, </em>supra, however, settled the question in Connecticut of whether the act affords immunity from liability for negligence or nuisance to a municipality for an injury suffered on town land developed as a playground.

The one at the core of this opinion is whether the act applies to municipalities. In <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Barenz, </em>221 Conn. 256, 603 A.2d 399 (1992), this court held that the act did apply to municipalities on the basis of the \u201c \u2018clear and unambiguous\u2019 \u201d definition of the term \u201cowner.\u201d Id., 260. Today, the majority builds on this recent decision to afford immunity pursuant to the act to a municipality that allowed a baseball team playing in a league game to use a field adjacent to the town\u2019s high school without charge whenever school was not in session. Because I do not agree that the act applies to municipalities, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>If a statute is absolutely clear on its face, legislative history need not be consulted. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 225, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992). If it is susceptible to alternative conflicting interpretations, however, or if its application to a particular situation reveals a latent ambiguity in seemingly unambiguous language, or if construction of this seemingly unambiguous statute results in an altering of the common law, we look beyond the words of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987). In such cases we will examine the legislative intent, including a consideration of the specific language and its context, pertinent history, the conditions and circumstances surrounding the statute\u2019s enactment, and the objective that the statute was calculated to address. See <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, 54-55, 523 A.2d 477 (1987); <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985). Use of these tools of construction in this case suggests that the immunity conferred by the act was the carrot that legislators dangled before private landowners to encourage them to make their property available for public recreation. I believe that the decision by this court to include municipalities within the act\u2019s definition of owner is not consistent with the true legislative intent and, in effect, bestows a benefit on government never contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The language in the act must be examined in the context of what was happening throughout the country at the time of its enactment. \u201cIdentifying the societal problems which the legislature sought to address may be particularly helpful in determining the true meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 161-62, 496 A.2d 186 (1985). More and more Americans were participating in an expanding range of outdoor recreational activities. Overpopulation and increased leisure time had strained existing public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>recreation areas. State and municipal governments were struggling to locate alternative resources to accommodate increasing demand for recreational property. One such alternative under consideration was the utilization of privately owned land for public recreation. G. Thompson &amp; M. Dettmer, \u201cTrespassing on the Recreational User Statute,\u201d 61 Mich. B.J. 726, 727 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">As part of its attempt to foster availability of private land for public recreational use, the Connecticut legislature created a vehicle to increase public access to private property. Parroting a model act promulgated in 1965 by the Council of State Governments,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>necticut legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 23-27a through 23-27k, entitled \u201cAn Act Limiting the Liability of Property Owners Toward Persons Using Their Land for Recreation,\u201d in 1967.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. Thompson &amp; M. Dettmer, supra, pp. 726-27. This precursor to the Recreational Land Use Act was intended to target an underutilized resource. \u201cThe intention of the act is to encourage the farmer, the party who has hundreds of thousands of acres to invite the public in to make use of the land without having [the] liability that they normally would have under the common law. The Department of Agriculture feels that this would greatly increase the open space use throughout the state of Connecticut.\u201d 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1967 Sess., p. 4254, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>remarks of Representative Bernard Avcollie. \u201cIt will for the most part in my opinion do something that many of us who live in the rural areas have for a long time wanted. . . . Within a very short driving distance of every major city in this state there are vast areas of land that could be used for recreational purposes and the only thing in the path standing in the way, the only thing which has prevented the owners from allowing use of their land for recreational purposes has been the possible liability which they would incur if people using it for recreational purposes were injured on their land this is the target point of this bill. To say to any landowner if you register your land for recreational purposes and those who come on are injured again through no fault of yours, the owner, then you will not be liable. I think the state of Connecticut and a large percentage certainly of the urban population are going to benefit under this bill, it relieves the state of the necessity for purchasing, it relieves the state of the necessity for maintaining land that could very well serve for picnicking, for hiking, for horseback riding and for many other recreational activities which, because of lack of faith in the urban areas is very limited at the present time.\u201d 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1967 Sess., pp. 4255-56, remarks of Representative Robert King. \u201cA review of the legislative history reveals that the clear purpose of \u00a7 52-557g is an attempt to satisfy the public\u2019s need for recreational and open space by encouraging <em>private land owners, </em>through limiting their liability, to open their land to public use.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Genco </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>7 Conn. App. 164, 168-69, 508 A.2d 58 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Connecticut passed the Recreational Land Use Act in 1971. Without published comment, the legislature repealed \u00a7\u00a7 23-27a through 23-27k of title 23, entitled Parks, Forests and Public Shade Trees, and enacted \u00a7\u00a7 52-557\u00cd through 52-5571 in its place. Public Acts 1971, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>No. 249. The philosophy behind the legislation was again made clear\u2014to make the option of opening private land for public recreational use more attractive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Representative David Lavine, one of the primary sponsors of the act, in his remarks before the House of Representatives, clearly contrasted land owned by private individuals with that owned by federal, state and municipal bodies. \u201cWe should realize, though, that neither federal, state or local implementation of recreational plans are going to require or set aside enough land for the recreational needs of our citizens. For certain and many types of outdoor activities such as hiking, hunting, fishing, enjoyment of the rural life in Connecticut, we have long depended and will continue to depend upon the generosity of private owners of land and water to open their property to the use and enjoyment of their fellow citizens.\u201d 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1971 Sess., pp. 1804-1805. Representative Lavine\u2019s comments were echoed by sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>eral other legislators. Senator Romeo Petroni noted that \u201cit is an important bill and . . . it will have I think the positive [e]ffect as far as people who own private lands opening them up for recreation . . . 14 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1971 Sess., p. 1679.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The act helped to make the option of opening private land for public recreational use more viable by decreasing liability to landowners and decreasing costs to governmental entities seeking to provide recreational lands. Absent the exercise of its right of condemnation, the government is powerless to compel private landowners to open their property for recreational use. Moreover, budget deficits limiting governments\u2019 ability to invest in recreational lands sufficient to satisfy the ever increasing demand effectively eliminated even this option. The act furnished a solution. \u201c[T]his would open up land in the state of Connecticut at no cost to the state, town or federal government at all.\u201d 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1971 Sess., p. 1809, remarks of Representative Peter F. Locke, Jr.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">As stated, this act sought to increase the availability of recreational lands by limiting liability for accidents occurring on the property. Landowners are protected in two ways from liability for injuries suffered by entrants. When a landowner directly or indirectly invites another to use his property for a recreational purpose without fees, the entrant does not thereby become a licensee or invitee. General Statutes \u00a7 52-557g. The landowner \u201cowes no duty of care to keep the land, or the part thereof so made available, safe for entry or use by others for recreational purposes, or to give any warning of a dangerous condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>tion, use, structure or activity on the land to persons entering for recreational purposes.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-557g (a). Historically, the common law places a successively greater duty on the landowner to visitors, depending on whether the visitor is a trespasser, a licensee, or an invitee. <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Bell Court Condominium Assn., Inc., </em>223 Conn. 323, 327-28, 612 A.2d 1197 (1992). The act drastically alters these principles. Except where there is consideration; General Statutes \u00a7 52-557h; the act fundamentally changes the law by shifting the burden of liability for injuries from the land occupier, who may be in a better position to prevent accidents, to the entrant, regardless of his or her classification at common law, who may be powerless to avoid them. This fundamental change is consistent with the underlying objective of the legislation to encourage free use of land. The act reflects the judgment of the legislature that the public benefit of attracting private landowners to allow their land to be used outweighs the risk of potential injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The inherent costs to society that can result from removing the caretaking responsibilities and duty to warn against known or discoverable hazards imposed upon public landowners at common law, however, are not outweighed by any benefit conferred upon society by the act. Public lands are lands already held open to the public. Accordingly, there is no appreciable benefit derived by cloaking municipalities with this immunity in derogation of the common law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In contrast to the private landowner, the act does not prompt or motivate municipalities to do anything different with their land. There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the legislature intended or even contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>that the act would provide immunity for governmental entities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, to apply the act to municipalities imposes too high a societal cost and serves no useful or intelligible purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Finally, there is the contrast to be made between our act and legislation in several states that have explicitly extended their states\u2019 recreational use acts to public owners. See footnote 8 of the majority opinion; see also Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-10-102 (1992). In the absence of any express legislative provision covering publicly owned lands, I would refuse to extend the immunity beyond private landowners. See <em>Hovet </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>325 N.W.2d 813 (Minn. 1982); <em>Goodson </em>v. <em>Racine, </em>61 Wis. 2d 554, 213 N.W.2d 16 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The majority is correct when it states that <em>\u201cManning </em>dictates that the defendants here were entitled to immunity from liability pursuant to the act.\u201d Because I disagree with <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Barenz, </em>supra, I dissent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The protection granted through the act was an incentive for private owners to open up new lands for public use. It was not an attempt to provide an immunity-shield for existing state or municipal recreational areas. \u201cStare decisis is not an end in itself. If a decision reflects a public policy that is no longer viable, we should not adhere to a precedent in blind imitation of the past.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, 225 </em>Conn. 782, 802, 626 A.2d 719 (1993) <em>(Peters, C.

G. Thompson <em>&amp; </em>M. Dettmer, \u201cTrespassing on the Recreational User Statute,\u201d 61 Mich. B.J. 726 (1982). The introductory statement of the reasons for the model act is therefore entitled to consideration. The preamble provides: \u201cRecent years have seen a growing awareness of the need for additional recreational areas to serve the general public. The acquisition and operation of outdoor recreational facilities by governmental units is on the increase. However, large acreages of private land could add to the outdoor recreation resources available. . . . [I]n those instances where private owners are willing to make their land available to members of the general public without charge, it is possible to argue that every reasonable encouragement should be given to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u201cIn something less than one-third of the states, legislation has been enacted limiting the liability of private owners who make their premises available for one or more public recreational uses. This is done on the theory that it is not reasonable to expect such owners to undergo the risks of liability for injury to persons and property attendant upon the use of their land by strangers from whom the accommodating owner receives no compensation or other favor in return.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u201cThe suggested act which follows is designed to encourage availability of private lands . . . .\u201d 24 Council of State Governments, \u201cPublic Recreation on Private Lands: Limitations on Liability,\u201d Suggested State Legislation (1965) p. 150.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\"> It was also remarked before the Senate that \u201cthis is an important bill. And will probably do more to open up land to recreation purposes without the expenditure of a single penny on the part of the state.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1971 Sess., p. 1679, remarks of Senator Roger W. Eddy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\"> Because immunity conferred by General Statutes \u00a7 52-557g is in derogation of the common law, it should be strictly construed to effectuate its intended purpose. <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 Conn. 616, 621, 441 A.2d 600 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\"> At common law a municipality was generally immune from liability for its tortious acts. <em>Ryszkiewicz </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>193 Conn. 589, 593, 479 A.2d 793 (1984). Its employees had a qualified immunity in the performance of a governmental duty. If an employee misperformed a ministerial act, he was potentially liable; if, however, he misperformed a discretionary act, he was immune from liability subject to three exceptions. <em>Evon </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>211 Conn. 501, 505, 559 A.2d 1131 (1989). General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n, enacted as part of tort reform in 1986; Public Acts 1986, No. 86-338, \u00a7 13; was \u201cintended, in a general sense, both to codify and to limit municipal liability . . . <em>Sanzone v. Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 188, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). In 1971, when the act was enacted; Public Acts 1971, No. 249; as well as in 1967, immunity for municipalities was alive and well. Accordingly, there was even less incentive to craft the act in order to grant immunity to an entity that was already protected in order to supplement available recreational land.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">We have often stated that we will not assume the legislature enacted legislation that serves no useful purpose. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>162 Conn. 89, 99, 291 A.2d 721 (1971); <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>158 Conn. 556, 565, 265 A.2d 61 (1969). Furthermore, if a statute is susceptible to an interpretation by which such a consequence can be avoided, that interpretation will be found. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b488-11\"> Although we look to legislative inaction following a decision by this court to signify its acquiescence in our interpretation of a particular section; see, e.g., <em>Scheyd v. Bezrucik, </em>205 Conn. 495, 506-507, 535 A.2d 793 (1987); the ink on <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Barenz, </em>221 Conn. 256, 603 A.2d 399 (1992), has barely dried. I, therefore, hesitate to draw any conclusion from the lack of legislative response to this court\u2019s interpretation of the act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
