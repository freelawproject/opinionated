The department appealed the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. On August 26, 1988, Gregory Forsyth, who was twenty-four years old, sustained injuries as a result of a motor vehicle accident that left him unable to care for himself or to man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>age his affairs. The plaintiff, Lynn Forsyth, Gregory\u2019s father, was appointed conservator of his son\u2019s estate and person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff subsequently instituted a suit against the State Farm Insurance Company (State Farm) on Gregory\u2019s behalf to recover for injuries he received in the accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">On August 13, 1990, the plaintiff, acting on behalf of Gregory, entered into a settlement agreement with State Farm whereby State Farm would pay $300,000, minus attorney\u2019s fees, into the Gregory L. Forsyth Trust (trust) in return for the release of the plaintiff\u2019s tort claim. At the recommendation of both the plaintiff and Gregory\u2019s guardian ad litem, a trust agreement was executed on August 24, 1990,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and State Farm, after approval of the settlement and trust agreements by the Probate Court, transferred approximately $195,000 into the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The plaintiff<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> subsequently applied to the state for medicaid benefits for Gregory. The department rejected the plaintiff\u2019s application because Gregory had assets in excess of the department\u2019s maximum asset limit. The department treated the funds in the trust as available to Gregory and included them in its calculation of his assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The plaintiff requested a fair hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-2a to contest the department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>denial of benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the hearing, the plaintiff argued that the trust was not a medicaid qualifying trust because it had been established by him and not Gregory and, therefore, that the trust funds were not available to Gregory. Without the inclusion of these funds, the plaintiff argued, Gregory would have met the department\u2019s asset limitations. The fair hearing officer concluded to the contrary that the acts of the plaintiff in establishing the trust were attributable to Gregory, that the trust was, therefore, a medicaid qualifying trust and that its funds were assets available to Gregory and includible in his assets for the purpose of determining medicaid eligibility. The fair hearing officer therefore concluded that no error had been made by the department and affirmed the denial of benefits to Gregory.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The plaintiff appealed the decision of the fair hearing officer to the trial court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed that the hearing officer had improperly found that the trust had been established by Gregory. The plaintiff main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>tained that he had created the trust and that it was therefore not a medicaid qualifying trust. The trial court agreed with the plaintiff that his acts in setting up the trust were not attributable to Gregory and, therefore, sustained the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In this court, the department contends that Gregory is not eligible for medicaid benefits because the trust assets constitute resources available to him in excess of the department\u2019s resource standard. The department argues that Gregory is both the individual who established the trust and its beneficiary and that the trust, therefore, is a medicaid qualifying trust. The plaintiff, to the contrary, argues that the trust does not fit within the definition of a medicaid qualifying trust because it was established by him as Gregory\u2019s conservator and not by Gregory himself. The plaintiff claims that the plain language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) requires such a result. We believe that the plaintiff\u2019s reading of the statute is too narrow. We agree with the department and hold that for the purposes of \u00a7 1396a (k), Gregory is both the grantor and the beneficiary of the trust and that it is a medicaid qualifying trust. This reading is consistent with the history and purposes of both the medicaid program generally and \u00a7 1396a (k) specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The federal medicaid program was enacted in 1965 as a cooperative federal-state endeavor designed to provide health care to needy individuals. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.; <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Rivera, 477 </em>U.S. 154, 156, 106 S.

The categorically needy were persons whom Congress considered especially deserving of public assistance because of family circumstances, age, or disability. States, if they wished, were permitted to offer assistance also to the \u201cmedically needy\u201d\u2014persons lacking the ability to pay for medical expenses, but with incomes [or resources] too large to qualify for categorical assistance.\u2019 <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 37, 101 S.

Connecticut has chosen to cover the medically needy.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The Medicaid Act requires that participating states determine financial need by setting a resource standard that must be met before assistance can be provided. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17). In Connecticut, the resource standard for a single medically needy applicant is $1600. Department of Income Maintenance, Uniform Policy Manual (1987) \u00a7 4005.10.

Assets held in irrevocable trusts are considered available only to the extent that they are distributed to a beneficiary. <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>179 Conn. 83, 94-95, 425 A.2d 553 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">\u201c[A] \u2018medicaid qualifying trust\u2019 is a trust, or similar legal device, <em>established </em>(other than by will) <em>by an individual </em>(or an individual\u2019s spouse) <em>under which the individual may be the beneficiary </em>of all or part of the payments from the trust and the distribution of such payments is determined by one or more trustees who are permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to the distribution to the individual.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (2). The portion of principal and income from a medicaid qualifying trust considered \u201cavailable\u201d to an applicant \u201cis the maximum amount of payments that may be permitted under the terms of the trust to be distributed to the grantor, assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee or trustees for the distribution of the maximum amount to the grantor.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Neither party disputes that Gregory, who, through the plaintiff, applied for medicaid benefits as a medically needy individual, is a beneficiary of the trust. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>determination of whether the trust is a medicaid qualifying trust, therefore, requires that we determine whether the trust was \u201cestablished . . . by\u201d Gregory as those words are used in \u00a7 1396a (k). We conclude that the trust was established by Gregory because it was funded with the proceeds from the settlement of his tort claim even though the settlement was actually consummated by the plaintiff acting on behalf of Gregory.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">A trust is established by the person who provides the consideration for the trust even though in form it is created by someone else. <em>Matter of Brooks, </em>844 F.2d 258, 263 (5th Cir. 1988); <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>109 F.2d 99, 100 (2d Cir. 1940); <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Merchants National Bank of Aurora, </em>3 Ill. App. 3d 337, 338, 278 N.E.2d 10 (1972); <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New York Trust Co., </em>297 N.Y. 45, 50, 74 N.E.2d 232, 36 N.Y.S.2d 443 (1947). This is true even where an individual provides consideration for the funding of a trust by another. See <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>831 F.2d 641, 648-49 (6th Cir. 1987). The trust in this case was funded with the proceeds from the settlement of the personal injury claim brought by the plaintiff solely on Gregory\u2019s behalf. Gregory provided the funds with which the trust was established when, through the plaintiff, his claim was settled in return for a payment to the trust.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Gregory, therefore, is the individual who established the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The plaintiff would have us read \u00a7 1396a (k) to include only trusts established directly by the individual bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>ficiary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is clear, however, from the purpose and history behind \u00a7 1396a (k) that a medicaid qualifying trust may also be \u201cestablished . . . by an individual\u201d when that individual, acting through his conservator, provides the consideration for the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>\u201cThe objective of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 521, 441 A.2d 158 (1981). It is axiomatic that, where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, construction of the statute by reference to its history and purpose is unnecessary. <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 538, 582 A.2d 1184 (1990). That axiom only applies in full force, however, [w]here . . . the language of a statute is . . . <em>absolutely </em>clear on its face and where no ambiguity is raised in applying the statute in a particular case. (Emphasis in original.) <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 554, 400 A.2d 712 (1978) .... <em>Elections Review Committee of the Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>[219 Conn. 685, 692, 595 A.2d 313 (1991)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 225, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992). The plaintiffs narrow reading of the words \u201cestablished . . . by an individual\u201d discloses an ambiguity in the language of \u00a7 1396a (k) as applied to the facts of this case. It would be anomalous to construe the statute to allow a medicaid applicant to accomplish through a conservator or guardian acting on his behalf what the law prevents that applicant from doing on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Our conclusion reflects the legislative concern that the medicaid program not be used as an estate planning tool. The medicaid program would be at fiscal risk if individuals were permitted to preserve assets for their heirs while receiving medicaid benefits from the state. Congress enacted the medicaid qualifying trust provision as an addition to the \u201cprovisions designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>assure that individuals receiving nursing home and other long-term care services under Medicaid are in fact poor and have not transferred assets that should be used to purchase the needed services before Medicaid benefits are made available.\u201d H. Rep. No. 99-265, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 71 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Section 1396a (k) was enacted as a response to the use of irrevocable inter vivos trusts to transfer one\u2019s own assets and qualify for medicaid benefits. The availability requirement; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17); had created a loophole by which individuals anticipating the need for expensive long-term medical care could impoverish themselves and qualify for medicaid assistance while preserving their resources for their heirs. Assets or income held in irrevocable trusts are not considered resources to a beneficiary or applicant because the asset is not \u201cavailable\u201d to the grantor. <em>Zeoli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>supra, 94-95. An individual could place assets in an irrevocable discretionary trust that paid him the income for life until long-term medical care became necessary. At that point the trustee could exercise his discretion to withhold payments to the beneficiary, thus, allowing the beneficiary to qualify for medicaid assistance while preserving assets for his heirs. Congress closed this loophole by deeming available to the beneficiary the maximum amount that could, at the trustee\u2019s discretion, be distributed to the beneficiary from such a trust regardless of whether or not the funds were distributed. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k); H. Rep. No. 99-265, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 71-72 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Our holding that a trust established by the person who furnishes the consideration is a medicaid qualifying trust for purposes of \u00a7 1396a (k) comports with the present Congressional mandate delineating the assets that are available to a potential medicaid recipient. To permit Gregory to collect medicaid benefits from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>taxpayers when $195,000 of his assets are sheltered in a trust, all of which could potentially go to his heirs,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> would violate the spirit and intent of the medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The determination of Gregory\u2019s eligibility does not, however, end with our conclusion that the trust is a medicaid qualifying trust. The trust assets are considered available to Gregory up to the maximum amount of payments that the trustee could disburse if he exercised his full discretion under the terms of the trust whether the distributions are actually made. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (1). As a result of the trial court\u2019s finding that the trust was not a medicaid qualifying trust, it never reached the determination by the fair hearing officer that the trustee was able to distribute all of the funds in the trust at the trustee\u2019s discretion. In light of our finding that the trust is a medicaid qualifying trust, we remand the case for further proceedings in the trial court regarding the extent of the trustee\u2019s discretion, and if the trustee\u2019s discretion is limited, whether such limitation is valid under the circumstances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\"> Contrary to what the term implies, a finding of a \u201cmedicaid qualifying trust\u201d makes one ineligible for medicaid benefits.

Both cases are distinguishable on their facts and we decline to follow their reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">In <em>Kegel </em>v. <em>State, </em>113 N.M. 646, 830 P.2d 563 (N.M. App. 1992), the trust created by the conservator was funded with the proceeds from settlement of a suit in which both the beneficiary, a minor child, and his parents each were named separately as plaintiffs each on their own behalf. The New Mexico Appellate Court found that there was nothing in the record indicating that the beneficiary was \u201centitled to any particular portion of the proceeds\u201d from the settlement. Id., 567. The court then held that the trust had multiple grantors and that there was insufficient evidence in the record to determine that the beneficiary was the grantor of the trust. Id., 567-68. In the present case, Gregory, represented by the plaintiff, was the only plaintiff named in the suit that yielded the funds for the trust. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record showing that anyone else might have had a claim to those funds. In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>746 F. Sup. 19 (D. Colo. 1990), four trusts created by the probate court for the benefit of four elderly incompetents were all funded by income streams that were insufficient to pay for the beneficiaries\u2019 medical expenses, but were in excess of the eligibility requirements for Colorado medicaid benefits. Id., 20. Each of the trusts designated the Colorado department of social services as the residual beneficiary. Id., 32. The Colorado District Court stated that the Congressional purpose for prohibiting medicaid qualifying trusts is \u201cto prevent wealthy individuals, otherwise ineligible for medicaid benefits, from making themselves eligible by creating irrevocable trusts in order to preserve assets for their heirs.\u201d Id., 34. Noting that the designation of a public agency as residual beneficiary, rather than private heirs, removed any conflict with the purpose behind medicaid eligibility rules, the court held that the trusts were not medicaid qualifying trusts. Id. In the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the trust is sufficient to cover Gregory\u2019s current expenses and once its funds are depleted he will become eligible for medicaid funds. More importantly, the trust is directly contrary to the above stated Congressional purpose in that Gregory\u2019s heirs are the residual beneficiaries of the trust.
