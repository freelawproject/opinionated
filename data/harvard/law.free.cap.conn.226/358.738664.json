Starr, can be held liable pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-432,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to correct a condition on her land that can reasonably be expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> even though she did not create the condition, acquiesce in its creation, or even own the property when the condition was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In response to complaints by local residents voiced by the defendant Scantic Neighborhood Assocation, Inc., of noxious odors emanating from a 44.3 acre parcel of land owned by the plaintiff on Simon Road in Enfield, the defendant commissioner of environmental protection (defendant) in June, 1989, initiated an investigation to determine the source of the odors. The defendant\u2019s investigation, which lasted more than a year, revealed that in the past the plaintiff\u2019s property had been utilized by a now defunct trucking company for the disposal of solid wastes, including demolition debris and industrial waste from the Springfield Gas Company. The defendant determined that the materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>als dumped on the plaintiff\u2019s land had polluted the site and continued to do so, creating a source of pollution to the waters of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In July, 1990, the defendant issued an enforcement order to the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-432 and 22a-433.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the order, the defendant stated that it had been found that materials present on the plaintiff\u2019s land evinced that the land had been used as a disposal site for solid waste. The order went on to assert that tests performed on samples of soil and water obtained from the plaintiff\u2019s property had identified a number of contaminants, including complex and amenable cyanides, heavy metals, and volatile and semi-volatile hydrocarbons. On the basis of these findings, the defendant determined that the plaintiff had created or was maintaining a condition on her property that could reasonably be expected to create a source of pollution to the state\u2019s waters. Consequently, the plaintiff was ordered by the defendant to: \u201c(1) Investigate the solid waste on site and the potential extent and degree of soil, surface and ground water pollution both on and off-site; (2) [t]o perform remedial actions approved by [the defendant] to abate soil, surface, and ground water pollution; and (3) [t]o conduct a monitoring program to determine the effectiveness of the remedial actions taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The plaintiff filed a timely appeal of the defendant\u2019s order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-436.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An administrative hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was held on March 4 and March 11, 1991, before an adjudicator appointed by the defendant. Prior to the hearing, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts that was admitted into evidence and adopted by the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the hearing, the following pertinent facts were therefore not in dispute: The plaintiff is the record owner of the 44.3 acre site in question. She took title to the property on January 30,1987, by virtue of a fiduciary deed from the estate of her late husband. Materials present on the site indicated that in the past the site had been used for the disposal of solid waste that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>included demolition debris and industrial wastes. Tests of soil and water samples obtained from the property identified several contaminants including complex and amenable cyanide, metals, and volatile and semi-volatile hydrocarbons. It was further stipulated that the waste and contaminants located on the plaintiffs property constitute a condition that can reasonably be expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state, that the surface waters emanating from the site are polluted within the meaning of \u201cpollution\u201d as defined by \u00a7 22a-423, and that the wastes and contaminants on site have not been removed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The defendant, after the hearing, concluded that the measures ordered on July 9, 1990, were necessary to remove the potential sources of pollution from the plaintiffs land and confirmed the original order. The defendant\u2019s decision turned on the interpretation of the term \u201cmaintaining\u201d as used in \u00a7 22a-432. In the memorandum of decision, the defendant stated: \u201cThe sole issue at this juncture is whether the respondent is, to use the precise statutory language, \u2018maintaining\u2019 that condition.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant noted that the term \u201cmaintaining\u201d is not defined in the statutes. Consequently, the defendant turned to the dictionary to determine its commonly approved usage. Referring to Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, the defendant concluded that the term \u201cmaintaining,\u201d as used in the statute, meant \u201cto hold or keep in a particular state or condition,\u201d that it entailed no element of scienter or requirement of positive action by the landowner, and that there was \u201cno compelling reason\u201d to read such a limiting condition into the statute\u2019s explicit language. The defendant supported that conclusion, and the propriety of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>order, by citing to a decision in a previous case in which it had been held that mere ownership of real property was a sufficient basis for imposing liability under \u00a7 22a-432.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The plaintiff appealed the defendant\u2019s final decision to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 22a-437 and 4-183.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On appeal, the court found that the plaintiff was aggrieved by the defendant\u2019s decision and had standing to appeal. It thereafter found, in addition to the facts set forth in the stipulation of the parties at the administrative hearing, that \u201cthere was considerable, indeed overwhelming evidence that the dumping of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>pollutants occurred long before the plaintiff or her husband owned the property and the dumping was done by a now defunct trucking company which was hauling the material from gas producing companies in Massachusetts. Although the [defendant] made no findings of fact which specifically identified those responsible for the dumping of the pollutants, all of the evidence showed that it was not the plaintiff. There was also evidence, which was likewise uncontradicted, that the plaintiff was actually denied any access to the property from the time she acquired it until the summer of 1989, when the pollution was first noticed. This circumstance came about as a result of the town\u2019s control of the road leading into the property and its refusal to allow the plaintiff to use that road. The point of this evidence is that it shows that the plaintiff\u2019s ownership of the property was utterly passive up to the time the pollution was discovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The trial court noted that, at the administrative hearing, the defendant had admitted the evidence that indicated the plaintiff\u2019s lack of culpability for causing the pollution on her property, but had \u201cessentially held that it was not relevant in assessing responsibility for the clean-up.\u201d The court also noted that the defendant had \u201cimplicitly conceded that the plaintiff had not \u2018established a facility or created a condition\u2019 causing the pollution\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 22a-432, but had decided rather that the \u201cmere passive ownership\u201d of contaminated real property constituted \u201c \u2018maintaining [a] facility or condition which reasonably can be expected to create a source of pollution\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 22a-432. The trial court concluded that the defendant had been incorrect in determining that \u201c\u00a7\u00a7 22a-432 and 22a-433 impose strict and full liability on the owner of the property for the ehmination of pollution, regardless of the owner\u2019s \u2018innocence\u2019 in causing it and regardless of the culpability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>of other persons.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court, as did the defendant in the administrative hearing, found the dispositive issue to be \u201cwhether an owner of property on which pollutants were dumped by other persons prior to her acquisition of it, but who herself has had no active involvement with the property, not even to go on it to inspect it, is \u2018maintaining\u2019 the condition causing the pollution within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-432.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The trial court, in addressing this issue, as did the defendant in the administrative hearing, looked to the dictionary definitions of the word \u201cmaintaining\u201d in an attempt to determine its meaning. The court, unlike the defendant, deemed that the dictionary definitions of \u201cmaintaining\u201d all \u201cinclude the concept of some positive conduct or effort designed to preserve a particular condition.\u201d The court concluded, therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s mere passive ownership of land could not be considered as \u201c \u2018maintaining any . . . condition which . . . created a source of pollution\u2019 on that property . . . in accordance with the commonly approved usage of the term \u2018maintaining.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The trial court went on to state that the statutory scheme of the Connecticut Water Pollution Control Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 22a-416 et seq.; provides for the liability of an innocent landowner only if the person actually responsible for the pollution does not comply with an enforcement order, cannot be found, or is unknown. It found, for example, that the defendant is authorized, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 22a-451,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to contract to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>pollution of any land or water caused by spill, seepage or discharge removed and to seek reimbursement from those responsible and, only if unsuccessful in securing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>payment, to place a lien for the cost of the cleanup upon the real estate on which the contamination originated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>See General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 22a-452a.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court also noted that if an order to abate pollution is issued to a polluter pursuant to \u00a7 22a-432 and the defendant then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>finds that the person to whom such order was issued is not the owner of the contaminated land, the defendant may then issue a like order to the owner of the land pursuant to \u00a7 22a-433, and the owner only then may be held jointly and severally liable with the person causing the pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The trial court therefore determined that the defendant had improperly held the plaintiff responsible for the cleanup of her property without first attempting to proceed against the actual polluters. Only if that attempt proved fruitless, the court concluded, could the defendant then proceed against the plaintiff. The court concluded that proceeding against an innocent landowner in securing reimbursement for the cleanup of pollution was a last step, not a first. The court remarked that there was good reason to require that an action against an innocent property owner be a last resort because of the possible draconian result of requiring an innocent owner to pay more for the remedial measures than the value of the land on which the pollution exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">We disagree, and conclude that the trial court: (1) failed to give due deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 22a-432 as it applied to the issue raised in this appeal; (2) slighted the legislative history of</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u00a7 22a-432; and (3) misconstrued the statute\u2019s relationship to the overall scheme of the act. Because we conclude that the defendant correctly decided that the plaintiff\u2019s ownership of the land in question could, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-432, render her liable in the first instance to abate potential sources of pollution on her land, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and direct it to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the defendant\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Preliminarily, we note that the usual scope of a court\u2019s review of administrative action is quite limited. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>184 Conn. 317, 322, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981); <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 438, 441, 423 A.2d 87 (1979); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 707-708, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S.

The reviewing court may reverse or modify an administrative decision only if the \u201csubstantial rights of the . . . [appellant] have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error of law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The trial court, in reviewing the defendant\u2019s final decision wherein the defendant had determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u00a7 22a-432 applied to a passive landowner; stated that \u201cthe [defendant\u2019s] interpretation of the statute is a question of law\u201d and was not entitled to any deference. Although the construction and interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the courts to decide; <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 263, 579 A.2d 505 (1990); <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 140, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980); \u201cit is the well established practice of this court to \u2018accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u2019 <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Avco-Lycoming Division, </em>163 Conn. 309, 326, 307 A.2d 155 (1972) <em>(Loiselle, J., </em>concurring), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1116, 93 S.

Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986); see also <em>Crocetto </em>v. <em>Lynn Development Corporation, </em>223 Conn. 376, 381, 612 A.2d 1212 (1992); <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 423, 521 A.2d 569 (1987); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>201 Conn. 685, 698-99, 519 A.2d 41 (1986); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The trial court, however, attached no significance to the role of the defendant as commissioner of environmental protection, whose agency is charged with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>enforcement of \u00a7 22a-432.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor did the court give any weight to the fact that the defendant had, on a previous occasion, interpreted \u00a7 22a-432 to hold an innocent landowner liable to abate a polluted condition on his land. The trial court instead disregarded the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute and, contrary to the defendant\u2019s decision, determined that the term \u201cmaintaining,\u201d as used in \u00a7 22a-432, required the taking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>some affirmative action in creating pollution on the part of the landowner in order for the defendant to be able t\u00f3 hold the landowner liable for abating that pollution. The trial court relied upon the following dictionary definitions of the word \u201cmaintain\u201d to arrive at its conclusion: Webster\u2019s Second New International Dictionary (\u201cto hold or keep in any particular state or condition\u201d); Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (\u201c1. to keep in an existing state [as of repair, efficiency, or valid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ity]: preserve from failure or decline ... 3. to continue or persevere in\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979) (\u201cacts of repairs and other acts to prevent a decline, lapse or cessation from existing state or condition . . . carry on . . . furnish means for subsistence or existence of . . . hold or keep in an existing state or condition\u201d). The court, as previously noted, concluded that such definitions of the word \u201cmaintain\u201d imply affirmative action, and therefore that the plaintiff\u2019s passive ownership of her property could not be considered \u201cmaintaining\u201d a condition under the statute, and that consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s situation fell outside the purview of \u00a7 22a-432.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The dictionary definitions of the word \u201cmaintain,\u201d however, are themselves ambiguous, do little to rein in its inherently broad meaning, and can hardly be interpreted invariably to require the taking of affirmative action. See <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pan American Ins. Co., </em>437 S.W.2d 542, 545 (Tex. 1969) (\u201cmaintenance doubtless includes the idea of keeping in repair, but has a much broader meaning involving the concept of supporting\u201d). Unless we consider who is maintaining what and for what purpose, the word \u201cmaintain\u201d has no fixed, abiding, or useful meaning. As this court has remarked \u201c[t]he word \u2018maintain\u2019 has no precise legal significance in the construction of statutes, its meaning varying with the statute in which it is used, the subject-matter of the law, and the purpose to be accomplished by it.\u201d <em>Davis Holding Corporation </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>112 Conn. 543, 547-48, 153 A. 169 (1930); see also <em>Hasman </em>v. <em>Elk Grove Union High School, </em>76 Cal. App. 629, 245 P. 464 (1926) (\u201c \u2018[maintain\u2019s] meaning . . . depends upon the context in which it appears and the subject matter to which it relates\u2019 \u201d); but see <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 549, 441 A.2d 30 (1981) (applying Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary definition of \u201cmaintenance\u201d as that word is used in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Because we regard the meaning of the word \u201cmaintaining\u201d in \u00a7 22a-432 to be ambiguous, an ambiguity not cured by its dictionary definitions, we believe that the trial court, faced with two equally plausible interpretations of the statutory language, failed to give due deference to the defendant\u2019s interpretation. Moreover, the ambiguity of the word \u201cmaintaining\u201d in \u00a7 22a-432 counsels us to make inquiry into sources other than the language of the statute or dictionary definitions. In order to discern the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 22a-432, we are compelled to look \u201cto the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 589; see also <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 460, 600 A.2d 310 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The Connecticut Water Pollution Control Act (act), set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-416 through 22a-484, was regarded, at the time of its enactment in 1967, as \u201ca declaration of war against water pollution.\u201d 12 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1967 Sess., p. 667, remarks of Senator William B. Stanley, chairman of Water Resources Committee. Initiated by then Governor John Dempsey, the act was intended to \u201cusher ... in a new era in the treatment of our water resources. It embodies the concept that no one, whether individual, industry or community, has the right or privilege to render our water resources unusable by pollution.\u201d Connecticut\u2019s Clean Water Act of 1967: An Analysis of Public Act 57, p. 2.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The act comprehensively addressed issues of municipal and industrial water pollution by setting water quality standards, mandating a permit program, establishing a new enforcement scheme and creating tax incentives and low interest loans for constructing pollution abatement facilities.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The act was not, however, the legislature\u2019s first attempt to control the pollution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>of Connecticut\u2019s waters.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, the act arose from the ashes of several previous failures to arm the agency-charged with enforcing Connecticut\u2019s statutes designed to combat water pollution with adequate powers and procedures to solve the state\u2019s pollution problems. In 1925, the legislature had established the state water commission which, in 1957, was replaced by the water resources commission; both commissions were given the power by the legislature to plan and coordinate \u201call activities concerning the abatement of pollution.\u201d Public Acts 1957, No. 364, \u00a7 2. During the periods of operation of both commissions, however, it was recognized that they were hampered by an inadequate statutory scheme especially as it pertained to the commission\u2019s authority to order the abatement of existing sources of pollution.

Proc., Pt. 2,1967 Sess., pp. 695-98, remarks of Senator Frederick Pope, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Consequently, in 1965, Governor Dempsey created the clean water task force, \u201cto examine the pollution problem that we know exists and tell us the best, quickest, and most efficient and economical way to eliminate it.\u201d The task force\u2019s recommendations were published in a 1966 pamphlet entitled \u201cClean Water for Connecticut: An Action Program.\u201d Although the work of the task force focused on a variety of water pollution control problems, the subcommittee of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>task force devoted to \u201cWater Law and Legislation\u201d specifically addressed the issue of the enforcement of then existing pollution control laws by the commission, and noted that under the extant statutory framework, the water resources commission was unable to attack existing sources of pollution efficiently. According to the subcommittee, the statutes then governing the commission\u2019s activity were ineffective because the commission could not order the abatement of water pollution unless it had considered the rights and interests of all persons involved and had determined that the cost of abatement was not unreasonable or inequitable. See General Statutes (1955 Sup.) \u00a7 2114d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As a member of the subcommittee remarked, the commission could stop existing sources of pollution \u201conly after elaborate advice to the polluter as to a treatment system that is both reasonably available and equitable as to cost.\u201d The subcommittee therefore recommended that \u201ca new legal approach to water pollution seems necessary. . . . What seems needed is the expansion of existing legislation into a water rights code tailored to the needs of this State. The essential elements of such a code are threefold\u2014first, declaration of the public ownership of all water; second, a statement of the conditions pertaining to the private use thereof; and finally, a statement of policy that pollution is illegal.\u201d Clean Water for Connecticut: An Action Program (1966) p. 128. The work of the task force was ultimately embodied in the act. 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1967 Sess., p. 914, remarks of Representative Peter A. Crombie.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Both the House of Representatives and the Senate, while broadly debating a myriad of issues raised by the proposed act, viewed the pollution problem as a \u201ccrisis\u201d situation demanding expedient measures and prompt action. The legislature shared the task force\u2019s impression that the water resources commission needed to be armed with more effective procedures for enforcing its orders to abate pollution. Representative James J. Kennedy, designated to explain the act\u2019s enforcement provisions, noted: \u201cMr. Speaker, this bill seeks to eliminate pollution in the waters of our state by a two-pronged attack. The distinguished gentlemen from the 118th and 167th who have preceded me have addressed themselves to the first of these two prongs in the context of grants to municipalities and tax benefits to industry and in both of these areas seek to encourage the construction of pollution abatement facilities. The second prong in the thrust of our attack upon the extant pollution situation, is a <em>declaration of illegality </em>of water pollution and specific procedures for enforcement of the law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1967 Sess., pp. 923-24, remarks of Representative James J. Kennelly. Representative Kennelly further noted that, under the proposed legislation, the water resources commission could operate more vigorously in issuing orders of abatement and ultimately seeking injunctions to abate water pollution, regardless of concerns of economic feasibility. The enforcement provisions in the act signified a move away from the standard the commission once used to assess a given case. Id., p. 926. The standard under which the commission had operated was \u201ca standard of economic feasibility\u201d which had allowed \u201cfor broad exceptions and exemptions from the meaningful effect of orders of the waters resources commission.\u201d Id. The new, proposed standard for the act, was \u201cone of technological reasonableness.\u201d Id. Regardless of the cost of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>pollution abatement measures issued by the commission, the measures were to be enforced if in fact the technology existed to enforce them.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The legislative sentiment regarding the importance of the act crystallized in the act\u2019s declaration of policy, currently set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-422, which provides that: \u201cIt is found and declared that the pollution of the waters of the state is inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the state, <em>is a public nuisance </em>and is harmful to wildlife, fish and aquatic life and impairs domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational and other legitimate beneficial uses of water, and that the use of public funds and the granting of tax exemptions for the purpose of controlling and eliminating such pollution is a public use and purpose for which public moneys may be expended and tax exemptions granted, and the necessity and public interest for the enactment of this chapter and the elimination of pollution is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The available legislative sources concerning the enactment of the act in 1967 indicate that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the legislature had not specifically addressed the issue of whether the word \u201cmaintaining,\u201d as used in \u00a7 22a-432, included passive ownership of property, the legislature did mandate that the defendant<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> be given broad powers under the act to issue orders necessary to correct existing and potential sources of pollution and to achieve the remedial purposes of the act. Environmental statutes, considered remedial in nature, are to be construed liberally to reach the desired result. <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 57, 441 A.2d 68 (1981). In light of the remedial purposes of the act, we conclude that the legislature intended that the word \u201cmaintaining\u201d in \u00a7 22a-432, be interpreted liberally to include within its purview a landowner who has failed to abate pollution existing on his or her land that reasonably could be expected to create a source of pollution to the state\u2019s waters regardless of blame for the creation of the condition. We conclude that, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-432, the defendant was empowered to order a cleanup of polluted land without regard to fault or economic hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that \u00a7 22a-432 appears to have been intended to track and incorporate the common law of public nuisance. By declaring that \u201cthe pollution of the waters of the state is inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the state, [and] a <em>public nuisance\u201d </em>(emphasis added) in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-422, the legislature appears to have assimilated, where appropriate, the common law of nuisance into the act. The common law, and particularly the law of public nuisance at the time of the passage of \u00a7 22a-422, figured prominently in water pollution control and had set the stage for legislation concerning abatement of water pollution. See Water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Resources of Connecticut, Report to the General Assembly by the Water Resources Commission (1957) p. A-29 (\u201cjudicial decisions constitute the source of most of Connecticut law relating to rights to use water\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Indeed, it hardly seems accidental that the legislature, in \u00a7 22a-432, used the words \u201cmaintaining ... [a] condition,\u201d which condition, it had declared in \u00a7 22a-422, to be a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d \u201cMaintaining a nuisance\u201d is a legal term of art, having a technical meaning in the common law of nuisance. The case law of public nuisance is replete with the use of this phrase and its equivalents, i.e., \u201cmaintaining\u201d or the \u201cmaintenance of\u201d a condition regarded as a nuisance; the phrase also appears in the Practice Book forms of model complaints in nuisance actions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Under the common law of nuisance at the time of the enactment of \u00a7 22a-432, a landowner, once apprised of the existence on his or her land of a contaminated condition, could generally be held liable for \u201cmaintaining a nuisance\u201d on that property, without regard to fault and regardless of whether the landowner had created or caused the condition. See <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Peoples Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>121 Conn. 579, 186 A. 629 (1936); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>13 Conn. 303, 307 (1839). In <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>for instance, this court held that a company could be liable for \u201cmaintaining a nuisance\u201d after contaminated fluid had seeped from the company\u2019s property into the basement of an adjoining building. We noted in <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Peoples Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>supra, 588-89, that \u201c[a] nuisance may grow out of negligence . . . but it may exist where the use a person is making of his property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>is not in any respect negligent but nevertheless results in damage to his neighbor. ... As the percolating of oil into the plaintiffs premises would constitute a nuisance, it was not necessary for it to prove negligence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) See also <em>Southern New England Ice Co. </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>114 Conn. 496, 507-508, 159 A. 470 (1932) (holding that \u201cwhere one builds or maintains upon his land a structure which creates a permanent nuisance upon the lands of another to his injury, not because of any negligence in the construction or maintenance of the structure, the latter is entitled to recover once for all damages for the injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In defining the scope of \u00a7 22a-432 to apply to \u201cany person . . . [who] is maintaining ... [a] condition,\u201d it appears that the legislature envisioned that the word \u201cmaintaining\u201d would, consistent with the common law of nuisance, encompass situations where, without fault, a contaminated condition existed on an owner\u2019s land. The facts of this case amply demonstrate that the plaintiff currently owns property on which there exists a nuisance in the form of pollution of which she has been made aware. Because the plaintiff, under the common law of nuisance at the time \u00a7 22a-432 was enacted, could, regardless of fault, have been subjected to liability for maintaining a nuisance on her land, we conclude that \u00a7 22a-432 was properly applied by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Our conclusion concerning the scope of the term \u201cmaintaining\u201d is also supported by the statutory changes made to \u00a7 22a-432 subsequent to its enactment in 1967. Public Acts 1967, No. 57, \u00a7 11. In 1967, that section permitted the defendant to issue an order to \u201cany person . . . maintaining any facility or condition which can reasonably be expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state.\u201d In 1984, the legislature by Public Acts 1984, No. 84-239, \u00a7 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>amended \u00a7 22a-432 to extend liability to any person who <em>\u201chas established . . </em>. or <em>created\u201d </em>(emphasis added) a condition that \u201creasonably can be expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state.\u201d By this subsequent amendment, the legislature was obviously attempting to make a distinction between the active creation of pollution characterized by the words \u201cestablished or created\u201d and the passive maintenance of a condition characterized by the term \u201cmaintaining\u201d that had incorporated the common law of nuisance. Thus, by the amendment, \u00a7 22a-432 was expanded to reach not only landowners who were passively maintaining a nuisance but also those persons who had actively created or established a source of pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The plaintiff contends, however, that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 22a-432 violates a rule of statutory construction that dictates that legislation must be read as a whole and construed to give effect to and harmonize all its parts and avoid duplication. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 472-73, 497 A.2d 974 (1985); <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>162 Conn. 549, 554, 295 A.2d 547 (1972). The plaintiff argues that if \u00a7 22a-432 is construed so that mere ownership of contaminated land is tantamount to \u201cmaintaining ... [a] condition which reasonably can be expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state,\u201d then \u00a7 22a-432 would render \u00a7 22a-433 superfluous. Section 22a-433 provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever the commissioner issues ... an order to correct potential sources of pollution pursuant to the provisions of section 22a-432 . . . and the commissioner finds that such person is not the owner of the land from which such . . . potential source of pollution emanates, he may issue a like order to the owner of such land.\u201d The plaintiff contends that if the landowner were always responsible for pollution under \u00a7 22a-432, then the defendant would never have need to rely on \u00a7 22a-433 to issue an order to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>owner of contaminated land. The plaintiff therefore asserts that proper effect can be given to both statutes only if \u00a7 22a-432 is interpreted so that mere ownership is not sufficient to constitute \u201cmaintaining\u201d a condition likely to cause pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We do not, however, read \u00a7 22a-432 as necessarily making ownership of contaminated property a sufficient basis for subjecting a landowner to liability for \u201cmaintaining . . . [a] condition.\u201d Under the common law of nuisance, a landowner who was not in fact in possession of his or her property, but who had leased it to a tenant, was not considered liable for a nuisance \u201cwhere that nuisance did not exist when they were leased or was not a result reasonably to be anticipated from their use for the purpose and in the manner intended.\u201d <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Peoples Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>supra, 592; see also <em>Calway </em>v. <em>School &amp; Son, Inc., </em>113 Conn. 586, 592, 155 A. 813 (1931). Because we construe \u00a7 22a-432 as having been intended to embrace the common law of nuisance, we do not read it to authorize the commissioner to issue an abatement order pursuant to that section to a blameless owner who was not in possession of his property, but who had leased it to a tenant. In such a case, the tenant in possession, rather than the landlord, would be considered the person who had created or was maintaining the condition that had the potential to cause pollution to the waters of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Apparently to reach the owners of such leased properties who would not have been liable under the common law, the legislature enacted \u00a7 22a-433. Specifically, if the person or entity to whom an abatement order is issued under \u00a7 22a-432 is not the landowner but a tenant in possession, the defendant could, in addition to holding the tenant responsible for abating the condition, hold the owner-lessor jointly and severally liable with the tenant under \u00a7 22a-433. So understood, \u00a7\u00a7 22a-432 and 22a-433 are complementary rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>duplicative. The statutes operate in conjunction to enable the commissioner to impose liability not only on those who had \u201cestablished ... or created\u201d the pollution or were \u201cmaintaining\u201d a condition, but also on the owner of the land. Section 22a-433, therefore, provides a legal avenue, not available at common law, enabling the defendant to impose liability on a landowner even if the owner did not \u201cestablish or create\u201d the condition or was not \u201cmaintaining\u201d the condition. Together, \u00a7\u00a7 22a-432 and 22a-433 enable the commissioner, in order to achieve the act's remedial purposes, to impose liability on all those who, in some way, have responsibility toward the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Turning to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff, at the time the defendant issued the enforcement order, was not leasing her property to a tenant who could be regarded as \u201cmaintaining\u201d the condition that contaminated her land. In the absence of such a third party, the defendant appropriately issued the plaintiff an enforcement order, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-432, because she was the owner of the fee and had dominion over the land on which the pollution exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The plaintiff, however, argues that \u00a7 22a-432 should not be read to reflect the common law of nuisance because elsewhere in the act the legislature modified the common law. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-428, for example, states that the commissioner can hold municipalities liable whenever \u201ca community pollution problem exists.\u201d Under the applicable common law, however, a municipality is liable for maintaining a nuisance only if, in fact, the municipality both created and maintained the nuisance by some positive act. See <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>West </em>Haven, 151 Conn. 689, 692, 202 A.2d 134 (1964). The plaintiff reasons that because \u00a7 22a-428 does not require that a municipality have taken an affirmative step to create a nuisance in order to be held liable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>abate a community pollution problem, the legislature similarly could not have intended that the common law be reflected in \u00a7 22a-432.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We do not, however, regard the modification of the common law in another section of the act as precluding the incorporation of the common law in \u00a7 22a-432, the specific provision at issue. Nor do we believe it necessary that the legislature expressly have stated that it was incorporating the common law, in order to apply common law principles of nuisance to \u00a7 22a-432. It is assumed that all legislation is interpreted in light of the common law at the time of its enactment. 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984 Rev.) \u00a7 50.01.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Until the enactment of the act, the common law had been the principal means used to force individuals and municipalities to abate water pollution.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We believe, therefore, that the legislature in enacting \u00a7 22a-432, sought to incorporate the common law of nuisance to preserve its effectiveness.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In enacting such provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>as \u00a7\u00a7 22a-433 and 22a-428, however, the legislature intentionally went beyond the common law to provide new avenues to combat the problem of pervasive pollution where there was a question as to the effectiveness of the common law. We, therefore, do not agree with the plaintiffs argument that \u00a7 22a-432 does not embody the common law of public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The plaintiff finally argues that the legislative history of the act suggests that the legislature intended that the public treasury, rather than the landowner, be required to bear the cost of cleaning up contaminated property. The plaintiff supports her argument by noting that the act permits the use of public funds and tax exemptions for the purpose of \u201ccontrolling and eliminating\u201d water pollution. The plaintiff reasons that because the legislature declared, in \u00a7 22a-422, that the control and elimination of water pollution justifies the use of public funds, it would be in keeping with the intent of the act first to use public funds to clean up the pollution on her land and, only after such funds had been expended, to seek reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The trial court embraced the same line of reasoning and noted that pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u00a7 22a-449 (b), the emergency response statute, the defendant should have cleaned up the plaintiffs property and, after having done so, sought out the responsible parties for reimbursement. To achieve this end, the court reasoned that the defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-451, could have contracted to have the pollution cleansed from the plaintiffs land and then sought repayment for the cost of the cleanup from those responsible for the pollution. Thereafter, if unsuccessful, the defendant could have placed a lien against the plaintiffs real estate, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452a, for the amount expended. In a nutshell, the trial court concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 22a-449, 22a-451 and 22a-452a required that the defendant first abate the pollution and then, if possible, identify and assess those responsible and not impose the cost of the cleanup on the innocent landowner except as a last resort. The effect of the trial court\u2019s reasoning is that, faced with two alternatives, the defendant was bound to choose the alternative that was least harmful to the innocent landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We do not, however, read the act as mandating such a choice. Although there exist several provisions in the act that allocate public funds to municipalities and persons through the use of low interest loans and tax exemptions for the purpose of constructing abatement facilities<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and elaborate procedures to fund emergency clean-up operations,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the act does not rule out impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>ing a large portion of the costs for abating water pollution on individual property owners rather than on the public purse. Indeed, the legislative framework for imposing liability for abating water pollution suggests that the act was intended to combine both public and private funds and efforts in a concerted endeavor to improve water quality. For instance, the effect of \u00a7 22a-433, imposing joint and several liability on the landowner and the party ostensibly responsible for pollution, is to make the polluter and the landowner jointly and severally liable for the cleanup of the landowner\u2019s property. The legislature in enacting \u00a7 22a-433 must have recognized that it was quite possibly imposing the ultimate responsibility for abating pollution on what might very well be a blameless landowner rather than on the polluter or the state.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Such a legislative approach, however, saves the taxpayers money and simply places the ultimate responsibility for the elimination of pollution where the elimination of most nuisances was placed by the common law, on the landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In summary, whether the defendant utilizes the act provisions applicable to emergency spills to clean up the plaintiff\u2019s contaminated property or issues an abatement order to the owner under \u00a7 22a-432, is a matter that is delegated to the defendant\u2019s discretion. The legislature has provided the alternatives but has not mandated that the defendant pursue a particular course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>of action. The plaintiff does not contend that the defendant, in this instance, abused that discretion in issuing an abatement order to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 22a-432.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We realize that our resolution of this appeal may result in the imposition of liability on the plaintiff for abating the pollution on her land, the cost of which may be in excess of the value of the land. That appears to be a draconian result that violates notions of fairness.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We also recognize that there may be others who, without fault of their own, find themselves the owners of polluted real estate without their having created or caused the contamination.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Our perception, however, is that the legislature in 1967, when \u00a7 22a-432 was enacted, saw the state\u2019s water pollution problem as being so grave that its concern for the public welfare outweighed any sympathy for individual property owners. What legislative history is available suggests that the legislature in fact anticipated, weighed, and ultimately resolved the various concerns engendered by \u00a7 22a-432 against the landowner and in favor of the public and clean water.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The legislature was aware when enacting \u00a7 22a-432 that previous legislation governing the now defunct water resources commission had included several equitable considerations that were required to be entertained whenever the commission issued an abatement order. General Statutes (1955 Sup.) \u00a7 2114d, for instance, provided that the commission \u201cmay make an order directing such person, firm or corporation to use or to operate some practicable and reasonably available system or means which will reduce, control or eliminate such pollution having regard for the rights and interests of all persons concerned, provided the cost of installation, maintenance and operation thereof shall not be unreasonable or inequitable.\u201d The absence of any mention of economic feasibility in the act\u2019s current enforcement provisions signals a move away from the considerations the water resources commission had once used to determine its course of action in an individual case. The present provisions do not require the defendant to consider the economic impact of a given abatement order, but only its technological feasibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The emphasis on clean water over possible individual hardship is manifested in the act\u2019s declaration, in \u00a7 22a-422, that water pollution is a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d See <em>New York </em>v. <em>Shore Realty Corporation, </em>759 F.2d 1032 (2d Cir. 1985), in which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals carefully analyzed and applied the common law of public nuisance to impose strict liability on landowners for the cleanup of hazardous waste. Simply, the legislature, in declaring pollution of our waters to be a \u201cpublic nuisance,\u201d established a policy that clean water was a public right. Under the common law, \u201c[n]uisances are public where they violate public rights, and produce a common injury, and where they constitute an obstruction to public rights . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>129 Conn. 606, 611, 30 A.2d 388 (1943). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201cA public nuisance is one that injures the citizens generally who may be so circumstanced as to come within its influence.\u201d <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>69 Conn. 668, 678, 38 A. 703 (1897). Because a public nuisance implicates the rights of the public and the exercise of the state\u2019s police power, the legislature could legitimately determine that the plaintiff\u2019s lack of culpability for the existence of the contaminated condition is outweighed by the state\u2019s interest in protecting public resources. The application of this principle was manifested in <em>National Wood Preservers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Environmental Resources, </em>489 Pa. 221, 414 A.2d 37, appeal dismissed, 449 U.S. 803, 101 S. Ct. 47, 66 L. Ed. 2d 7 (1980), in the context of a challenge to \u00a7 316 of the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law. In that case, the plaintiffs had argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it imposed liability solely on the basis of ownership or occupancy, and regardless of who caused the pollution. In response, the court stated: \u201cIt is appropriate that a property holder\u2019s responsibility has little significance in determining the validity of the state regulation. . . .

We are today about to assure that one of Connecticut\u2019s priceless resources\u2014 the water of our State\u2014will be restored to cleanliness and thereafter remain so for generations to come. The problem of pollution is both extensive and growing. It is estimated that although more than 90 percent of the effluent from municipalities and industrial operations receive treatment of some kind, only about one-half of the municipal sewage and a quarter of the industrial effluent is adequately treated. The inadequately treated municipal waste discharged into Connecticut waterways is the equivalent of 100,000,000 gallons per day of raw sewage. The industrial wastes discharged into our rivers and streams is the equivalent of another 100,000,000 gallons per day of untreated industrial effluent.

One of the aspects of conservation, and perhaps, the most immediate one is the matter of water pollution.

We note that statutes specifically addressing emergency response to hazardous spills, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-449, 22a-451 and 22a-452, were not originally part of the act, as enacted in 1967.

In that instance, there is nothing unfair about placing the cost on the landowner who derives benefit from the land, rather than on the taxpayers. Thus, whether the result appears \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cunfair\u201d will often turn on the particulars of the case.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a property owner, without any fault on his or her part, may be required to remove pollutants from his or her property, even though the cost of removal could substantially exceed the value of the property. I agree with the trial court\u2019s well reasoned opinion that \u201cmaintaining any facility or condition which reasonably can be expected to create a source of pollution\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-432 requires more than passive ownership. Active, or positive conduct\u2014that is, some fault on the part of the property owner\u2014is required for one to <em>maintain </em>the condition that pollutes the waters. Without this conduct, a property owner should not be liable for full remediation costs. If this becomes our law, persons will be compelled to obtain costly environmental surveys before they acquire title to any property. Indeed, it would be foolhardy for a person to accept an inheritance, as the plaintiff did here, without such a costly survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">I cannot believe that the legislature intended such a draconian result. The majority concedes that the result \u201cviolates notions of fairness.\u201d Neither the plaintiff nor her deceased husband, from whom she inherited the property, were at fault in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Yet, the majority interprets the statute to hold her personally liable for the cleanup as well as subjecting her to fines of up to $25,000 per day. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-438.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Furthermore, the majority opinion will raise havoc with our financial institutions, with the state economy and with the ability of persons to purchase homes. Although General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452b provides an exemption for mortgagees who acquire title to real estate by foreclosure, the exemption, as the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>concedes, is a limited one. The exemption merely relieves the mortgagee who obtains title to property by way of foreclosure or tender of a deed in lieu of foreclosure from \u201cassessment, fine or other costs imposed by the state.\u201d It does not exempt the mortgagee from an order issued by the defendant, similar to the one issued in this case, to abate and remove the pollution. In addition, such an order can clearly be enforced by issuance of a mandatory injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The amicus brief filed by the Connecticut Bankers Association and The Banks\u2019 Association of Connecticut forcefully points out (pp. 2-5) the substantial impact of the decision: \u201c[T]he amici wish to emphasize to this court that a ruling contrary to that issued by the Superior Court will not only have a devastating impact upon [the plaintiff], but will also have a significant adverse impact on an already struggling commercial real estate industry in the State of Connecticut. ...

Rather, the DEP would have the unilateral ability to impose liability upon other innocent parties such as secured lenders and fiduciaries who hold properties in trust. Moreover, taken to its logical extreme, the DEP\u2019s interpretation of ... \u00a7 22a-432 would make an innocent lender potentially liable for environmental cleanup costs from the very moment that the closing papers are signed because the DEP, on its own authority, could conclude that a lender \u2018maintained\u2019 a condition giving rise to liability under ... \u00a7 22a-432 by entering into contractual agreements (e.g., a mortgage) with a borrower who owns contaminated land. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201cThe inevitable result of this decision will be a further reduction in the availability of credit and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>increase in the costs of loan transactions. The shock wave from a reversal of the Superior Court\u2019s decision will spread far beyond [the plaintiff] and secured lenders, and will be felt by all persons seeking financial assistance to fund new plantfs] or property\u2014even those persons who have not caused or contributed to the contamination. At a time when Connecticut\u2019s economy is suffering through the throes of a recession, the lending industry and manufacturers can ill afford the uncertainty and risks that will result if the Superior Court\u2019s decision is overruled.\u201d See also amicus curiae brief of the Banking Law Section of the Connecticut Bar Association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">It is important to note that the defendant is not without a remedy for pollution that occurs without fault on the part of the landowner. If the party that caused the pollution does not act immediately to contain and remove or mitigate the condition, or if the party is unknown, the defendant may contract to clean up the site. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-451 (b). General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452a provides that \u201cany amount paid by the commissioner . . . pursuant to subsection (b) of section 22a-451 to contain and remove or mitigate the effects of a spill shall be a lien against the real estate on which the spill occurred or from which it emanated . . . .\u201d Thus, in this case, under the alternative statutory scheme which allowed the defendant to recover remediation costs by filing a lien on the plaintiff\u2019s property, the plaintiff could have been held liable to the extent of the value of her land.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">This case is not about being for or against the environment. Certainly, no one wants to pollute or endanger our drinking water. This case boils down to the simple issue of <em>fairness. </em>No one is suggesting that the innocent property owner should not ultimately be responsible to the extent of the value of the land. Rather, the issue is whether the <em>innocent </em>landowner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>should be financially liable for the enormous cost of remediation, which is likely to amount to sums over and above the value of her property, subjected to staggering fines or open to even more severe action by the court. I do not believe that the legislature intended such a harsh result.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In addition, I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis. For \u00a7 22a-432 to impose liability in this case, as the majority points out, the court must find that mere ownership of property, without fault, amounts to \u201cmaintaining\u201d a condition that \u201creasonably can be expected to create a source of pollution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">First, the majority sets an erroneous standard by stating that our review is \u201cquite limited.\u201d Although our review may be somewhat limited, we are not required to abstain from review or to give carte blanche to the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation. On the contrary, we have a legislative mandate to review and reverse decisions that are in \u201cviolation of . . . statutory provisions\u201d or \u201cin excess of the statutory authority of the agency . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The majority concludes that we must travel down the path set by the defendant\u2019s construction of \u00a7 22a-432 by according the defendant\u2019s interpretation great deference. We have long held that \u201c[although the <em>factual and discretionary </em>determination of administrative agencies are to be given considerable weight by the courts ... it is <em>for the courts, </em>and not for administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Humane Society </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>218 Conn. 757, 762, 591 A.2d 395 (1991). Furthermore, we have always withheld this deference when there has been no previous judicial scrutiny. \u201cOrdinarily, the construction and interpretation of a statute is a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>of law for the courts where the administrative decision <em>is not entitled to special deference, </em>particularly where, as here, the statute has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny or time-tested agency interpretations. <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 423, 521 A.2d 569 (1987); see also <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>201 Conn. 685, 698-99, 519 A.2d 41 (1986); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980). <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 773-74, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 718-19, 546 A.2d 830 (1988); see also <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>210 Conn. 349, 357, 554 A.2d 1089 (1989); <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>209 Conn. 191, 203, 550 A.2d 309 (1988). I do not usually string cite, but feel compelled to do so in this case since the majority erroneously places such great weight on the defendant\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The majority also states that the deference to the defendant on the interpretation of the law in this case is greater because the defendant has on one occasion \u201cinterpreted \u00a7 22a-432 to hold an innocent landowner liable to abate a polluted condition on his land.\u201d This sole circumstance cannot be sufficient for this court to turn our judicial function over to the executive branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Moreover, we have held that since the term \u201cmaintain\u201d is not defined by the legislature, we must assess its meaning \u201c \u2018according to the commonly approved usage of the language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 548, 441 A.2d 30 (1981); General Statutes \u00a7 1-1.1 agree that the word maintain may have varying meanings, but all the definitions have one thing in common\u2014that is, some action or positive conduct. See majority opinion p. 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The majority opinion is contrary to our own precedent. We have consistently held, in the context of environmental law and within the same statutory title, that the word \u201cmaintenance\u201d requires some conduct on the part of the individual. <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 549.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Likewise, in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>23 Conn. Sup. 87, 89, 177 A.2d 227 (1961), the word maintain was used to connote some action on the part of the person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Nevertheless, even if we conclude that maintenance is susceptible to two constructions \u201cone of which would have an absurd consequence, a legislative intent to attain a rational result may be assumed.\u201d <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>162 Conn. 89, 103, 291 A.2d 721 (1971). We do not leave our common sense at home when interpreting a stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ute. \u201cAs Justice Holmes put it in <em>Roschen </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>279 U.S. 337, 339, 49 S. Ct. 336, 73 L. Ed. 722 (1929): \u2018[TJhere is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 153, 460 A.2d 26 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Furthermore, although I agree that the legislature intended to abate pollution and protect our water, that sentiment alone does not indicate that the legislature intended to hold innocent landowners personally liable beyond the value of the land. The majority\u2019s discussion regarding the water pollution \u201ccrisis\u201d is totally irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Finally, I also disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis regarding the law of nuisance. In the Mianus Bridge case, we made it absolutely clear that the state of Connecticut could not maintain an action for public nuisance absent intentional conduct on the part of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton, </em>204 Conn. 177, 183, 527 A.2d 688 (1987). In the context of the law of nuisance, we have held that intentional means \u201cnot that a wrong or the existence of a nuisance was intended but that the creator of them intended to bring about the conditions which are in fact found to be a nuisance.\u201d <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>129 Conn. 506, 511, 29 A.2d 775 (1942). There was no such intentional conduct on the part of the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Furthermore, the Restatement (Second) of Torts is instructive. Section 839 places on the possessor of land the obligation to abate an artificial condition that constitutes a nuisance. The scope of the possessor\u2019s duty is \u201cnot an absolute duty to prevent harm to others at all costs, but merely a duty to do what is practicable and reasonable under the circumstances. . . . If he does take the action [to abate the unnatural condition] but it proves insufficient to stop or prevent the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>tion from causing harm, he may or may not be liable depending on whether the action that he took was reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 839, comment (e). For an innocent landowner to be held liable for costs of abatement beyond the value of the land is not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">It is an \u201c \u2018elementary rule of statutory construction that we must read the legislative scheme as a whole in order to give effect to and harmonize all of the parts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>216 Conn. 627, 636, 583 A.2d 906 (1990). The statutory scheme is clear\u2014the legislature intended to hold persons who have intentionally caused pollution liable for the full extent of damage. The legislature did not intend to hold innocent landowners liable beyond the value of their land, but instead intended to have the defendant contract to do the cleanup and place a lien on the property pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 22a-451 and 22a-452a.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The majority opinion will place enormous costs not only on property owners, but also on the financial market. A significant portion of the state\u2019s land and landowners may be affected by this decision. The majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 22a-432 may have a large impact on landowners because significant parts of greater Hartford, Bridgeport and New London are located over groundwater that may be problematic.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>a devastating effect on the ability of individuals to purchase homes. Sound public policy requires that we interpret \u201cmaintain\u201d to require some conduct on the part of the landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> Indeed, as the majority points out, the plaintiff did not have access to the property from the time she took title until the pollutants were discovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> The defendant argues that the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of <em>fact </em>only.

Sup. 87, 177 A.2d 227 (1961), the defendants purchased property that contained a covenant that required owners to \u201ckeep and maintain\u201d a dam located on the premises. The dam was later destroyed in a flood and the plaintiffs sought a decree ordering the defendants to rebuild the dam to its former height. The court found that the words \u201ckeep\u201d and \u201cmaintain\u201d required the defendants to take action to prevent the dam from gradually deteriorating, although it did not include a duty to reconstruct or restore the dam.

A classification of GB means that the water \u2018may not be suitable for direct human consumption due to waste discharges, spills or leaks of chemicals or land use impacts\u2019 .... A classification of GC means that discharges to the groundwaters are permitted and \u2018the historic waste disposal practices may have, for all practical purposes, permanently rendered the groundwater unsuitable for drinking water without treatment.\u2019 \u201d Amicus brief of the Connecticut Bankers Association and the Banks\u2019 Association of Connecticut p. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
