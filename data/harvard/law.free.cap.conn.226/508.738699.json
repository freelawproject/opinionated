See General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-275 (5) (E), now recodified as \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B) (v), \u00a7 31-275 (6) (D), now recodified as \u00a7 31-275 (10) (D), and \u00a7 31-321.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff, Marian Russell, appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirming the denial of an award by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fifth district (commissioner). The plaintiff claims that the board improperly concluded that the exclusion form signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>by her spouse, the decedent Robin N. Russell, effectively excluded his dependents from receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits. That conclusion was mistaken, according to the plaintiff, because the exclusion form had not been properly served on the decedent\u2019s corporate employer. We disagree, and we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. The decedent was the president, treasurer, agent for service of process and sole shareholder of R. N. Russell Welding, Inc. (Russell Welding).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He died in an explosion in Waterbury on April 12,1989, during the course of his employment with Russell Welding as a subcontractor for Wesson, Inc. (Wesson).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to his death, the decedent, against the advice of his insurance agent, had executed an exclusion form that stated his election to exclude himself and his dependents from coverage under the act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The decedent, therefore, was not charged and did not pay any premiums for workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The parties stipulated that the exclusion form had been properly served on the compensation commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>sioner,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but there was no evidence that the decedent had mailed a copy of the exclusion form or other written notice of his election by registered or certified mail to Russell Welding. The plaintiff claimed at the hearing before the commissioner that because the decedent had failed to mail such notice to Russell Welding, the decedent and his dependents were covered by the act and, therefore, were entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The commissioner concluded, however, that under the circumstances the decedent\u2019s execution of the exclusion form had satisfied the statutory requirement of service of notice upon Russell Welding. Upon appeal by the plaintiff, the board unanimously affirmed the denial of an award by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In this court, the plaintiff argues that the board improperly denied her claim because: (1) notice of the decedent\u2019s election had not been properly served on Russell Welding; and (2) the exclusion form was not effective against Wesson as a principal employer. We disagree with both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim that the board improperly concluded that the exclusion form had been served on the decedent\u2019s corporate employer as required by statute is without merit. Section 31-275 (5) (E) provides that \u201can employee of a corporation who is a corporate officer and who elects to be excluded from coverage under this chapter by notice in writing to his employer\u201d shall do so as provided by \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 (6) (D) and 31-321. Those sections direct that notice to an employer shall be given either by certified or registered mail or by personal service.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>It is not disputed that the decedent personally signed the exclusion form that was forwarded to the workers\u2019 compensation commission. The commissioner and the board found that Russell Welding had received notice of the decedent\u2019s election at the time the decedent had executed the written exclusion form, and that such notice satisfied the statutory requirement of personal service. Because the decedent was Russell Welding\u2019s president, treasurer, agent for service of process and sole shareholder when he executed the form, we agree that the notice and service requirements of the statute have been met. The corporation had contemporaneous written notice of the decedent\u2019s election to exclude himself from workers\u2019 compensation coverage when the decedent completed the exclusion form.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The plaintiff contends that because there is no evidence that the exclusion form was ever actually delivered to the corporate office, the decedent\u2019s election to exclude himself from coverage under the act was ineffective and that his dependents, therefore, are entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The plaintiff concedes that the result she urges directly contradicts the express intent of the decedent and the clear understanding of the defendants that the decedent was not to be covered. She argues, however, that the service and notice requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 (6) (D) and 31-321 must be strictly construed; see <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 200, 585 A.2d 96 (1991); <em>Pacelli Bros. Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacelli, </em>189 Conn. 401, 414, 456 A.2d 325 (1983); and that they were not satisfied in this case. The plaintiff\u2019s argument fails, however, because in these circumstances the corporation must be deemed to have been personally presented with actual notice of the decedent\u2019s election upon his completion of the exclusion form. Physical delivery of the form to the corporate office, therefore, was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The plaintiff next asserts that the board improperly concluded that it need not review the commissioner\u2019s finding that Wesson was not the decedent\u2019s principal employer pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-291.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the board that this issue need not have been reviewed because the decedent\u2019s election to withdraw from coverage under the act precluded his dependents from receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits from either Russell Welding or Wesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Section 31-291 requires that a principal employer \u201cpay all compensation under this chapter to the same extent as if the work were done without the intervention of [a] contractor or subcontractor.\u201d Sections 31-275 (5) (E) and 31-275 (6) (D), however, authorize a corporate officer who is also an employee of the corporation to elect to be excluded from coverage under the act. The execution of the exclusion form and its proper service on the commissioner and the decedent\u2019s corporate employer, Russell Welding, thereby excluded the decedent and his dependents from coverage under the act. Wesson was entitled to rely upon the decedent\u2019s election, notice of which had been properly served upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the commissioner and Russell Welding. We conclude, therefore, that the decedent\u2019s dependents would not be entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Wesson even if the commissioner had found that Wesson was a principal employer under \u00a7 31-291.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 through 31-355a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-275 (5) (E), now recodified as \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B) (v), provided that the \u201cterm [\u2018employee\u2019] shall not be construed to include . . .
