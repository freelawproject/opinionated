On January 30, 1991, the named plaintiff, Dennis Lynn, allegedly sustained work related injuries while demonstrating an industrial grinder, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Haybuster Model I.G.10, that had been manufactured by the defendant, Haybuster Manufacturing, Inc. As a result of the accident, Dennis Lynn and his wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Theresa Lynn, the plaintiff in this appeal (plaintiff),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed an eight count complaint in the Superior Court for the judicial district of Middlesex. Upon motion by the defendant, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint in two counts. The first count was brought on behalf of Dennis Lynn pursuant to the act. The second count alleged a loss of consortium by Theresa Lynn. The defendant subsequently moved to dismiss the second count of the amended complaint challenging the plaintiffs right to bring a loss of consortium claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, <em>Covello, J., </em>thereafter certified the issue to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The defendant maintains that the exclusivity provision of the act bars the plaintiffs claim for loss of consortium.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant recognizes that at common law the plaintiffs claim for loss of consortium would have been permitted as derivative of her injured spouse\u2019s underlying claim. See <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 305, 312, 524 A.2d 641 (1987); <em>Hopson </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>176 Conn. 485, 494, 408 A.2d 260 (1979). The defendant contends, however, that the language of General Statutes \u00a7 52-572n (a), which provides that \u201c[a] product liability claim . . . shall be in lieu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>of all other claims against product sellers . . .\u2019\u2019abolished Dennis Lynn\u2019s right to claim common law negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s right to claim loss of consortium. Relying on cases<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> wherein this court held that certain \u201cexclusive\u201d statutory schemes did not provide a right to claim a loss of consortium, the defendant argues that this derivative and dependent action is similarly prohibited by the act. We disagree because we conclude that prior to the enactment of the act the plaintiff could have brought, pursuant to the common law, a claim for loss of consortium for the negligent act of a third party, and because the act does not explicitly bar such action. We further conclude that \u201cclaim\u201d as defined in the act continues to include a spouse asserting a derivative claim for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Our analysis begins with several familiar principles.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Article first, \u00a7 10 of the Connecticut constitution protects \u201cincorporated common law or statutory rights from abolition or significant limitation,\u201d if those rights existed in and prior to 1818. <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>209 Conn. 59, 64, 546 A.2d 846 (1988). Common law causes of action that emerged after 1818, however, are not afforded such protection and are susceptible to limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tion and abrogation by the legislature. <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 283, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976). Although a husband was empowered to claim a loss of consortium prior to 1818; <em>Marri </em>v. <em>Stamford Street R. Co., </em>84 Conn. 9, 14-17, 78 A. 582 (1911); the right of a wife to bring a loss of consortium claim was not recognized until well into the twentieth century. <em>Hopson </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>supra, 487-95. We followed therein the growing majority of courts in recognizing a right of action for loss of consortium in either spouse, and held that a wife has a right to bring an action for loss of consortium arising from a personal injury to her husband caused by the negligence of a third person and claim, as elements of damage, loss of companionship, society, affection, sexual relations and moral support. Id., 496. Because the husband\u2019s right to bring a loss of consortium claim existed prior to 1818, the legislature was not free to eradicate it where the underlying claim of negligence was against a third party who was not a municipality. <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 199, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). The claim by a wife for loss of consortium, although not in existence prior to 1818, is now firmly rooted in our common law. <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>supra, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Interpreting a statute to impair an existing interest or to change radically existing law-is appropriate only if the language of the legislature plainly and unambiguously reflects such an intent. \u201c[W]hen a statute is in derogation of common law or creates a liability where formerly none existed, it should receive a strict construction and is not to be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of [statutory] construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ahern </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>190 Conn. 77, 82, 459 A.2d 118 (1983). \u201cIn determining whether or not a statute abro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>gates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope.\u201d <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>123 Conn. 446, 454, 197 A. 85 (1937). Although the legislature may eliminate a common law right by statute, the presumption that the legislature does not have such a purpose can be overcome only if the legislative intent is clearly and plainly expressed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>204 Conn. 472, 479, 528 A.2d 573 (1987). We recognize only those alterations of the common law that are clearly expressed in the language of the statute because the traditional principles of justice upon which the common law is founded should be perpetuated. \u201cThe rule that statutes in derogation of the common law are strictly construed can be seen to serve the same policy of continuity and stability in the legal system as the doctrine of stare decisis in relation to case law.\u201d 3 J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992 Rev.) \u00a7 61.01, pp. 172-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">In accordance with these principles, we first examine the language of the act to determine whether it clearly abrogates the common law right to loss of consortium. The legislature\u2019s intent is derived \u201cnot in what it meant to say, but in what it did say.\u201d <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 571, 512 A.2d 893 (1986). The act makes no explicit mention of whether a loss of consortium claim survives or is abrogated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, there has been no expressed intent of the legislature \u201cas found from the words employed\u201d to eliminate a spouse\u2019s claim for loss of consortium in product liability cases. <em>Park Regional Corporation </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>144 Conn. 677, 682, 136 A.2d 785 (1957). Certainly, the legislature is capable of providing explicit limitations when that is its intent. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-555d (\u201c[n]o <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>action with respect to any claim or cause of action for loss of consortium shall be brought by one spouse against an employer of the other spouse if such other spouse is entitled to receive, is receiving or has received [workers\u2019 compensation benefits]\u201d). In the absence of similar explicit language, we will not presume that the legislature intended the act to operate in derogation of this common law cause of action for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On the contrary, we conclude that the broad definition of \u201cclaimant\u201d as provided under the act encompasses a spouse claiming a loss of consortium. General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (c) provides that \u201c \u2018[claimant\u2019 means a person asserting a product liability claim for damages incurred by the claimant . . . .\u201d A \u201c \u2018[p]roduct liability claim\u2019 includes all claims or actions brought for personal injury . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b). This court determined in <em>Hopson </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>supra, 493, that a claim for loss of consortium includes \u201cpersonal and compensable, though not physical, injuries as a direct result of the defendant\u2019s negligence . . . .\u201d Although \u201cdamages\u201d is not defined in the act, we have held that damages includes a loss of consortium shown to arise from a personal injury to a spouse caused by the negligence of a third person. Id., 496. <em>Hopson </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>supra, was argued on November 14, 1978, and the decision was released on January 23, 1979. The act; General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq.; was effective on October 1, 1979. The House of Representatives approved the final version of the act on May 11,1979, and the Senate approved the act on May 29, 1979. 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21, 1979 Sess., p. 7306; 22 S. Proc., Pt. 14, 1979 Sess., p. 4650. \u201cBecause the legislature is presumed to know the state of the law when it enacts a statute; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 201, 506 A.2d 118 (1986); we can assume that, absent an affirm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ative statement to the contrary, it did not intend to change the existing law . . . .\u201d <em>In re Ralph M., </em>211 Conn. 289, 300, 559 A.2d 179 (1989). Accordingly, we conclude that a spouse asserting a derivative claim of loss of consortium falls within the general definition of \u201cclaimant\u201d in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Even if the language of the act were deemed to be unambiguous or opaque, its legislative history demonstrates no intent to abolish the common law right to loss of consortium for either spouse. An examination of the legislative history of the act supports the plaintiffs claim that the legislature was merely recasting an existing cause of action and was not creating a wholly new right for claimants harmed by a product. The intent of the legislature was to eliminate the complex pleading provided at common law: breach of warranty, strict liability and negligence. 22 S. Proc., Pt. 14, 1979 Sess., pp. 4637-38; 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 20, 1979 Sess., pp. 7021-22. \u201cStatements of legislators often provide strong indication of legislative intent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golino, </em>201 Conn. 435, 445, 518 A.2d 57 (1986). As Senator Salvatore C. DePiano explained, the act was intended to merge various theories into one cause of action rather than to abolish all prior existing rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Finally, the defendant relies on other cases decided by this court in which we interpreted statutes that provided new and exclusive causes of action in derogation of the common law to preclude a loss of consortium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>claim. <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra; <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Douglas Trucking Co., </em>203 Conn. 187, 523 A.2d 1301 (1987); <em>Wesson </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>5 Conn. App. 369, 498 A.2d 505, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 817, 500 A.2d 1337 (1985). Because we conclude that the act does not create a new cause of action, these cases and the statutes interpreted therein are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, we held that General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n makes a defective highway claim under General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 (\u201chighway defect statute\u201d) a plaintiffs exclusive remedy against a municipality for damages resulting from a highway defect. \u201cThe availability of redress under \u00a7 13a-149 permits the legislature constitutionally to eliminate common law remedies, if any, that may have existed prior to 1818 and that continued to exist prior to the Tort Reform Act of 1986, for injuries arising out of highway defects.\u201d Id., 196-97. In addressing the derivative loss of consortium claim, we stated that although \u201c[a]t common law, prior to 1818, a husband could bring an action on the case [in negligence] seeking damages for loss of consortium resulting from his wife\u2019s injury,\u201d neither the parties, nor this court had uncovered any negligence action prior to 1818 that sought a loss of consortium claim against a municipality. Id., 199. Even <em>Eldredge </em>v. <em>Pomfret, </em>1 Root (Conn.) 270 (1791), and <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Litchfield, 2 </em>Root (Conn.) 436 (1796), which contemplated a common law negligence action arising out of a highway defect in addition to the statutory remedy, did not suggest a derivative loss of consortium claim against the municipality. <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 199. We declined to assume that a husband \u201cwhose wife was injured by a defective highway would have been able, prior to 1818, to seek damages for loss of consortium from the [municipality] responsible.\u201d Id. We did not, therefore, require that \u00a7 52-557n be interpreted to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>vide for a cause of action in negligence and the derivative action of loss of consortium in order to withstand constitutional challenge. Id., 199-200. We concluded that \u00a7 13a-149, the exclusive remedy, does not permit damages for loss of consortium, but allows recovery only by the injured \u201ctraveler.\u201d <em>Frechette </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>104 Conn. 83, 88, 132 A. 467 (1926). Reluctant to circumvent the general common law immunity of municipalities absent specific legislative authorization, we concluded that \u00a7 52-557n barred claims for loss of consortium. Because it rested on common law principles of municipal immunity, our holding in <em>Sanzone </em>does not illuminate the continued common law right to recover for loss of consortium against defendants not protected by this special immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Equally of little precedential value to the defendant is <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Douglas Trucking Co., </em>supra, 191, wherein we upheld the right of a spouse to bring a claim for antemortem loss of consortium in a wrongful death action when it has been joined with the wrongful death action brought by the decedent\u2019s estate pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-555. We reasoned that \u201c[bjecause the death of a victim does not terminate his claim for antemortem injuries, whether fatal or not,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it would be wholly incongruous for his death to result in wiping out the related claim of his spouse for the antemortem loss of consortium flowing from the same injuries.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We held that \u201c[a] claim for loss of antemortem consortium may be regarded as derivative of the portion of the claim of the deceased relating to the recovery of antemortem damages for the death that the estate is authorized by \u00a7 52-555 to pursue.\u201d Id., 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>In addressing the spouse\u2019s claim for postmortem loss of consortium, however, we concluded that there was neither a statutory nor a common law right to recover. Id., 196-97. The lack of a common law right of recovery for the wrongful death of a victim on the part of his estate or family proved fatal to the spouse\u2019s claim. Prior to the enactment of chapter 5, \u00a7 2 of the 1848 Public Acts, the predecessor of \u00a7 52-555, the victim\u2019s estate could not recover for damages resulting from his death. <em>Broughel </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>72 Conn. 617, 621-22, 45 A. 435 (1900). Such damages were deemed recoverable only pursuant to statute. The wrongful death statute; General Statutes \u00a7 52-555; is the sole basis upon which an action that includes as an element of damages a person\u2019s death or its consequences can be brought. At common law, the death of the injured person, whether contemporaneous with the wrongful act or not, terminated liability of the wrongdoer because the right to enforce it ended with the death. See <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Fruit Industries, Inc., </em>144 Conn. 659, 668, 136 A.2d 918 (1957). Death and its direct consequences can constitute recoverable elements of damages only if, and to the extent that, they are made so by statute. <em>Foran </em>v. <em>Carangelo, </em>153 Conn. 356, 359, 216 A.2d 638 (1966). Because it is in derogation of the common law, an action for wrongful death is limited to matters clearly within its scope. Unless the statute provided that death and its direct consequences were recoverable elements of damages, as it did in the case of the victim, a claim by the spouse for loss of consortium resulting from the victim\u2019s death was unavailable. <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Douglas Trucking Co., </em>supra, 196. In effect, there was no common law right from which a derivative action could stem. \u201cA claim for loss of postmortem consortium, however, cannot be derivative of the decedent\u2019s claim for postmortem damages under [\u00a7 52-555] because the statute itself provides the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>authority for the recovery of <em>any </em>damages resulting from a death.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 195. <em>Ladd </em>stands for the proposition that if a statute creates a cause of action that did not exist at common law, such that it is the exclusive means by which damages resulting from a particular injury are recoverable, they are recoverable only to the extent that they have been specifically articulated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Our examination of these two cases demonstrates that the act, as a codification of common law, if it were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to deal expressly with claims for loss of consortium would require a statutory provision specifically excluding such claims in derogation of common law. By contrast, these two other statutory actions would require statutory amendments expressly permitting claims of loss of consortium, in derogation of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The defendant also relies on <em>Wesson </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>supra, as an example of a statutory action that precludes recovery for a loss of consortium. Once again, this reliance is misplaced. <em>Wesson </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>supra, concerned a loss of consortium claim in a workers\u2019 compensation case. The purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.; is to provide compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, regardless of fault. <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 240 A.2d 886 (1968). Under the statute, the employee surrenders his right to bring a common law action against the employer, thereby limiting the employer\u2019s liability to the statutory amount. <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979). \u201cIn a word, these statutes compromise an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation.\u201d <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a statutory scheme in derogation of common law, and must be \u201climited to matters clearly brought within its scope.\u201d <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . <em>.All rights and claims between employer and employees, or any representatives or dependents of such employees . . . are abolished </em>other than rights and claims given by this chapter . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Appellate Court held that this language is \u201cclear and unambiguous in its exclusion or abolition of claims and rights between employer and employees . . . [and] dependents . . . arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Wesson </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>supra, 373. In its decision sustaining the trial court\u2019s judgment granting a motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for loss of consortium damages arising from her spouse\u2019s injuries, for which he had already received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the Appellate Court relied upon the clear and unambiguous language of \u00a7 31-284 (a) to conclude that \u201c[s]ince the injury to the spouse of the employee is derivative in nature, it is barred by the sweeping language describing the employer\u2019s immunity.\u201d Id., 375. Because the injured party no longer had his common law cause of action, the spouse no longer had her derivative claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The express statutory prohibition contained in \u00a7 31-284 (a) compelled that conclusion, and, therefore, precluded both causes of action. Unlike the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the Product Liability Act contains no sweeping language, such as \u201c[a]ll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>rights and claims . . . are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter. . . .\u201d There is, therefore, no such statutory prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The certified question is answered: \u201cNo; a loss of consortium claim by the spouse of an injured person is not barred in an action brought pursuant to the Product Liability Act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\"> We granted the United States District Court\u2019s request for certification pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199a and Practice Book \u00a7 4168 to determine the following issue: \u201c[W]hether a loss of consortium claim by the spouse of an injured person is barred in an action brought pursuant to the Product Liability Act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m provides: \u201cproduct liability actions, definitions.

Portions of the colloquy between various representatives illustrate that the legislature\u2019s reasons for limiting the loss of consortium statute to cases of wrongful death were in fact because we had already recognized the existence of a loss of consortium claim for injuries if the underlying action was based in common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u201c[Representative Jay B. Levin]: Thank you. Mr. Speaker, the file copy would have permitted an action for loss of consortium, which is basically the right for a person to sue for emotional and moral support and other damages, emotional non-economic damages suffered by a spouse, due to the injury or death of another, for either injury or death of that spouse. This amendment clarifies that that action will lie, the loss of consortium action, will be valid only in the occasion of the death of the spouse, that being because common law now recognizes an action for loss of consortium where there is an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u201cOur State Supreme Court has found however that common law rule did not apply to a situation where there had been a wrongful death. This makes it clear that it is applicable to wrongful death. I would ask, move adoption of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u201c[Representative Linda N. Emmons]: [W]hy are you taking the injuries part [out]?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\u201c[Representative Jay B. Levin]: [T]he common law now permits an action for loss of consortium where there has been an injury short of death. This statute is intended to correct the situation that was pointed out by . . . our Supreme Court ... in 1987, that would not apply the common law rule which had been accepted by our courts, to a wrongful death situation, which is a statutory action. . , .</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">\u201c[Representative Linda N. Emmons]: [B]ecause we have now put this into the statutes relative to death, that would in no way affect common law?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">\u201c[Representative Jay B. Levin]: That is correct. . . . What is correct is that this would not override the common law. This would merely modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the situation with respect to death actions.\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14, 1989 Sess., pp. 4862-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Because the wrongful death statute is a statute in derogation of common law, creating a liability that theretofore did not exist, and contained no provisions or language that could be interpreted to include a loss of consortium claim, the legislature had to enact General Statutes \u00a7 52-555a to include specifically the loss of consortium provision. The legislature chose to limit the bill solely to a wrongful death action under \u00a7 52-555 and leave for another day other statutory actions not recognized at common law for which a claim for loss of consortium could not be made in the absence of a specific statutory provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b316-5\"> To be consistent, the legislature also chose to enact General Statutes \u00a7 52-555(1, which provides: \u201cNo action with respect to any claim or cause of action for loss of consortium shall be brought by one spouse against an employer of the other spouse if such other spouse is entitled to receive, is receiving or has received [workers' compensation benefits].\u201d Had the legislature wanted to prohibit loss of consortium claims in conjunction with a product liability claim, it could have enacted a statute similar to \u00a7 52-555d. In its absence, we will not limit the scope of the act beyond its evident intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
