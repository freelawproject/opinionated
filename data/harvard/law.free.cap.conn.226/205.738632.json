J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aahv\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether monetary penalties imposed for disposal of solid wastes in violation of the applicable environmental statutes were so excessive as to constitute an abuse of discretion. The plaintiff, Timothy R.E. Keeney, the commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner), filed a multicount complaint charging the defendants L and S Construction, Cathy Morsey, Lee B. Morsey and Steven Hinckley (defendants)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the dumping of demolition debris without a permit, at five different sites in Connecticut, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-208a (b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 22a-430<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and with hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ing thereby caused pollution in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-14 et seq.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court found that the defendants had violated each of the statutes as charged, granted injunctive relief to the commissioner, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,032,800. The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred their appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision establishes the following facts. The defendant L and S Construction is a partnership. The acts of the partnership are attributable to the individual defendants, who are either partners or agents of the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">During 1990 and 1991, without having applied for any state permits, the defendants disposed of massive amounts of construction debris at five different sites in the state. One of these sites was their own property in New Milford, while the others were sites on which they deposited waste materials with the consent of the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">At their own property at 322 Kent Road in New Milford, abutting the Housatonic River, the defendants buried several thousand cubic yards of waste material on the site, and accumulated more than 51,000 cubic yards altogether. The waste materials constitute an environmental hazard to the site\u2019s subsurface water and to the contiguous river.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">At 44 Black Bridge Road in Newtown, although the defendants received consent to deposit clean fill, they instead deposited 700 cubic yards of construction debris. The solid waste is within fifty to seventy-five feet of a well, and its leachate will pollute the ground and endanger the water supply at the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>On Saw Mill Road in Torrington, the defendants dumped 1800 cubic yards of construction debris on the property of a subdivision for which they had contracted to construct a road. Because this solid waste is a danger to the water supply and to the environment, the developers removed it from the site at a cost of $78,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On Route 55 in Sherman, the defendants dumped 3000 to 4000 cubic yards of construction debris on property for which they had agreed to dig a foundation hole and to build an access road. These solid waste materials constitute a danger to the water supply in the area and to the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">On property in or near a wetland in New Preston, with the unwitting consent of the owner, the defendants dumped 2000 cubic yards of construction debris. These solid wastes constitute a danger to the water supply, to the environment in general and to the wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The trial court concluded that the defendants had violated three different environmental statutes by their disposal of significant amounts of construction debris at each of these five sites without the necessary permits. First, the defendants\u2019 dumping of construction materials contravened the requirements of \u00a7 22a-208a regulating the disposal of solid waste. Construction debris falls within the definition of \u201csolid waste.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-207 (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The disposal of more than ten cubic yards of solid waste constitutes the establishment of a solid waste facility; General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u00a7 22a-207 (4) and (6);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for which a license is required by \u00a7 22a-208a. Second, the defendants\u2019 unlicensed discharge of leachate contravened \u00a7 22a-430, which forbids the discharge of any substance or material into the water of the state without a permit for discharge issued by the commissioner of environmental protection. Third, the presence of these solid waste materials and the accompanying discharge of leachate into the waters of the state constituted unreasonable pollution in violation of the Environmental Protection Act, \u00a7 22a-14 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Having found that the commissioner had proven these three statutory violations, the trial court issued a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from dumping future deposits of solid waste anywhere within the state without a permit and requiring their compliance with detailed specifications for the removal of the illegal solid waste previously deposited at each of the sites other than Torrington.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court\u2019s order included penalties in the event of noncompliance and indicated that the court would retain supervisory jurisdiction to assure compliance with its mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In addition, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 22a-208a and 22a-430, the trial court imposed civil penalties of $1,032,800 on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>defendants. The court determined that such penalties were appropriate, in accordance with the criteria outlined in <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Capozziello, </em>215 Conn. 82, 103-104, 574 A.2d 1268 (1990), and General Statutes \u00a7 22a-438,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because the statutory violations were severe, serious, knowing and flagrant. The court found that the defendants had profited substantially from their illegal conduct, and that they had failed to substantiate their alleged financial inability to pay a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The defendants\u2019 appeal raises two issues. They maintain that the judgment of the trial court should be set aside because: (1) there was insufficient evidence of their violation of \u00a7 22a-16 of the Environmental Protection Act; and (2) the amount of the civil penalties constituted an abuse of discretion. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The defendants\u2019 claim of insufficiency of the evidence is a limited one. They do not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that their unlicensed disposal of construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>debris came within, and violated, the permit requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 22a-208a and 22a-430. They contend, instead, that the state failed to prove that their activities constituted unreasonable pollution in violation of \u00a7 22a-16 of the Environmental Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In support of its conclusion that the defendants had violated the Environmental Protection Act, the trial court found that, at each of the five sites at issue in this case, the defendants had deposited construction debris in close proximity to water resources. At each site, the leachate from this construction debris constituted an environmental hazard to a river, to the local water supply or to a wetlands. These findings of fact would be reversible on appeal only if they were clearly erroneous. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The defendants do not question the trial court\u2019s findings relating to their improper disposal of the construction debris or to the leachate emanating from such debris. They maintain, however, that the court improperly determined that they had violated \u00a7 22a-16 of the Environmental Protection Act because whatever pollution, impairment or destruction of the environment resulted from their activities was not shown to have been unreasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The state\u2019s evidence on the adverse impact of the defendants\u2019 activities on the health and well-being of the community and the environment principally took the form of expert opinions offered by three environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>mental analysts with the department of environmental protection and a director of health for the town of New Milford. The experts testified that the leachate from the defendants\u2019 construction debris would pollute nearby subsurface or ground water and surface waters and that pollution of such waters would endanger other persons using the groundwaters as a source of drinking water. There was testimony about a risk of fire hazard and rodent harborage associated with the decomposition of construction debris. Finally, there was testimony that the defendants\u2019 disposal activities had impaired the quality of the river adjacent to their own property and had destroyed a portion of the wetlands on the New Preston property.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Although the defendants do not challenge the qualifications of the state\u2019s witnesses to give expert opinions on environmental matters, they nonetheless maintain that the trial court could not have relied on these expert opinions because the experts testified in large part on the basis of hypothetical questions rather than on the basis of their own personal observations. The defendants cite no authority in support of this proposition of law, and our law is to the contrary. The established rule is that, on direct examination, the stated assumptions on which a hypothetical question is based must be the essential facts established by the evidence. See <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Fruit Industries, Inc., </em>144 Conn. 659, 666, 136 A.2d 918 (1957); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Toscano, </em>144 Conn. 582, 589-90, 136 A.2d 341 (1957); <em>Graybill </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>138 Conn. 397, 403, 85 A.2d 238 (1951); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Handbook of Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 7.16.8, pp. 180-81. If the hypothetical question has the proper factual foundation, the expert may give his opinion without having personally verified the accuracy of these assumed facts. See <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 67, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986); <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>166 Conn. 418, 425-26, 352 A.2d 773 (1974); <em>Pischitto </em>v. <em>Waldron, </em>147 Conn. 171, 176-77, 158 A.2d 168 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The defendants, therefore, have not shown that the trial court\u2019s finding that they violated \u00a7 22a-16 of the Environmental Protection Act was clearly erroneous. The trial court\u2019s injunctive order is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Although the defendants do not contest the trial court\u2019s finding that they violated \u00a7\u00a7 22a-208a and 22a-430, they claim that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,032,800 because of these violations. The trial court arrived at the amount of the civil penalties by separately assessing a fine of $200 per day, under each statute, for the violations at each of the five sites at which the defendants had illegally deposited demolition debris.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In making its assessment, the trial court appropriately relied on the guidelines defined in <em>Carothers </em>v. Capozziello, supra, and \u00a7 22a-438 (a). For violations of \u00a7 22a-208a, the <em>Carothers </em>guidelines require the trial court to exercise its discretion by conducting an inquiry including, but not limited to, the following factors: \u201c(1) the size of the business involved; (2) the effect of the penalty or injunctive relief on its ability to continue operation; (3) the gravity of the violation; (4) the good faith efforts made by the business to comply with applicable statutory requirements; (5) any economic benefit gained by the violations; (6) deterrence of future violations; and (7) the fair and equitable treatment of the regulated community.\u201d Id., 103-104. Similarly, for violations of \u00a7 22a-430, the \u00a7 22a-438 (a) guidelines direct the court to consider \u201cthe nature, circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>extent and gravity of the violation, the person or municipality\u2019s prior history of violations, the economic benefit resulting to the person or municipality from the violation, and such other factors deemed appropriate by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In conformity with these guidelines, the trial court made the following findings. The defendants\u2019 violations were \u201csevere and extremely serious. Not only did the defendants dump toxic demolition debris near water supplies at the various sites but also dumped it next to the Housatonic River in New Milford in huge quantities. The 51,000 cubic yards of waste at that site were buried over a 2 acre area up to 18 feet deep. They totally dumped over the five sites in excess of 58,000 cubic yards of waste. Of further significance is that much of this dumping occurred after the defendants were told by the authorities that they were violating the law.\u201d The defendants made substantial profits as a result of their illegal dumping, not only because they entered into profitable contracts for the illegal disposal of demolition debris but also because they did not incur the costs associated with lawful disposition. They had profited from a contract to transport and dump demolition material from New York at $8 per cubic yard and they had saved the costs of proper disposition in an amount \u201cin excess of $1,000,000.\u201d The court further noted that, in assessing penalties against the defendant, it had considered the effect of the fine on future violations by these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The court expressly inquired into the defendants\u2019 ability to pay a substantial fine. In part, this inquiry was grounded in the court\u2019s initial findings about the size of the defendants\u2019 business. The court determined that the defendants were actively engaged in the demolition business, having grossed at least $269,000 in the first six months of 1991. They owned the land and the buildings in New Milford, as well as \u201csix large trucks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>and additional equipment.\u201d The court noted that the defendants had offered no credible evidence about their inability to pay any fine except for the testimony of one of the defendants that the partnership \u201chad contacted a bankruptcy attorney because of its financial problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The defendants challenge the trial court\u2019s findings in several respects. Significantly, they do not contest the considerable number of days that the court found them to have violated the statute at each of the five sites at which they illegally disposed of demolition debris. They maintain, however, that the court improperly: (1) ignored testimony about their financial circumstances; (2) found that 51,000 cubic yards of waste had been deposited at the New Milford site;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (3) overlooked their attempts at remediation; (4) calculated the benefits they had received from their statutory violations; and (5) imposed a penalty in addition to ordering them to remove the debris. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The defendants presented only one witness to testify about their financial ability to pay a penalty. That witness was the defendant Cathy Morsey, the manager of the defendant partnership. Although she testified on direct examination that the company was under severe financial stress, on cross-examination she acknowledged that she had little or no direct knowledge of the underlying financial data, inasmuch as the figures upon which she relied had come from a bookkeeper who was no longer in the company\u2019s employ. In these circumstances, the court was not required to attribute persuasive weight to her testimony. We agree with the commissioner that, especially after flagrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>and knowing statutory violations have been shown, the trial court may place the burden of establishing mitigating financial circumstances on the defendants. See <em>Chesapeake Bay Foundation </em>v. <em>Gwaltney of Smithfield, </em>791 F.2d 304, 315-16 (4th Cir. 1986); <em>Public Interest Research Group </em>v. <em>Powell Duffryn Terminals, Inc., </em>720 F. Sup. 1158, 1165-66 (D.N.J. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The defendants challenge the court\u2019s finding about the extent of their dumping activities at the New Milford site. Specifically, the court found that \u201c51,000 cubic yards of waste at that site were buried over a 2 acre area up to 18 feet deep.\u201d The defendants\u2019 contention that no evidence was adduced to support the finding cannot prevail in light of the testimony of Peter Carpenter, a field inspector of the department of environmental protection engineering enforcement division, solid waste unit. On the basis of test borings performed at the site, Carpenter testified that demolition debris had been buried over a two acre area up to sixteen to eighteen feet deep. With the appropriate conversion into cubic yardage, this evidence substantiates the court\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The defendants\u2019 contention that the court ignored their attempts to remedy their illegal use of the New Milford site cannot be sustained. Not only did they fail to ask the trial court to articulate what role such attempts might have played in its decision; see Practice Book \u00a7 4051; but they overlooked substantial evidence in the record that shows that their activity continued long after the department of environmental protection had notified them of its illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The defendants also argue that the trial court lacked a factual foundation for its findings about the economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>benefits that they had received from their illegal disposal activities. We disagree. The defendants have offered no tenable challenge to the trial court\u2019s findings that they dumped nearly 60,000 cubic yards of demolition debris without incurring the costs of licensed disposal. Accepting the expert testimony of Thomas Pregman, the trial court could reasonably have found that the defendants saved more than $1,000,000 by their illegal disposal. The court could equally have inferred that the defendants received an unwarranted profit from a contract in which they were paid for disposing of unwanted waste materials,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> when that profit would have reflected their failure to assume the costs legally associated with such disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Finally, we reject the defendants\u2019 contention that the court did not have the discretion to impose both a removal order and a civil penalty in the circumstances of this case. The governing statutes do not forbid the trial court to order cumulative remedies. Indeed, as the commissioner points out, a remedy limited to the costs of removal would not achieve the primary purpose of civil penalties, which is deterrence. See, e.g., <em>United States v. T &amp; S Brass and Bronze Works, Inc., </em>681 F. Sup. 314, 322 (D.S.C. 1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Phelps Dodge Industries, Inc., </em>589 F. Sup. 1340, 1365 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\"> The commissioner also brought charges against the owners of the properties, the defendants Leonard F.

The court\u2019s determination that the demolition debris was hazardous to local water supplies and to local wetlands is not a finding that the debris fell within the legal classification of hazardous waste.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\"> The penalty was assessed, under each statute, in accordance with the trial court\u2019s findings that the defendants\u2019 continuing violations had occurred as follows: New Milford, 649 days; Sherman, 639 days; New Preston, 636 days; Newtown, 606 days; and Torrington, 89 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> The defendants claim that the trial court made an improper factual finding because it allegedly adopted the representation of the commissioner, at trial, that \u201cthis case involves the largest amount of dumping of hazardous waste in the State\u2019s history.\u201d Nothing in the memorandum of decision substantiates the proposition that the court made such a finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> An acre consists of 4840 square yards. Two acres consist of 9680 square yards. At a depth of sixteen feet, or 5.33 yards, the site contained 51,626 cubic yards of debris.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\"> The trial court\u2019s finding must stand, despite the testimony of the defendant Cathy Morsey. Her testimony on this issue was neither dispositive nor did the court have to find it credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
