The defendant, the Milford zoning board of appeals (board),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals, upon our grant of certification; id.; from the judgment of the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court concluded that: (1) the trial court had applied the proper scope of review to the decision of the board; but (2) the trial court improperly failed to consider an additional issue that had been raised concerning the board\u2019s decision. In accordance with this reasoning, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We disagree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the trial court employed the proper scope of review to the board\u2019s decision. We conclude that, following an appeal from the action of a zoning enforcement officer to a zoning board of appeals, a court reviewing the decision of the zoning board of appeals must focus, not on the decision of the zoning enforcement officer, but on the decision of the board and the record before the board. We also conclude, however, that in this case the trial court has yet to determine the propriety of the decision of the board in accordance with the proper scope of review. Accordingly, we affirm in part and modify in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">This is the fourth time that this case has been before the appellate courts of this state. See <em>Caserta </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>23 Conn. App. 232, 580 A.2d 528 (1990) <em>(Caserta I); Caserta </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>219 Conn. 352, 593 A.2d 118 (1991) <em>(Caserta II); </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Caserta </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>28 Conn. App. 256, 610 A.2d 713 (1992) <em>(Caserta III). A </em>brief history is nonetheless in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Peter Crabtree, the Milford zoning enforcement officer, issued a zoning permit to the plaintiff, James Caserta, to make certain alterations to the plaintiffs building. See <em>Caserta II, </em>supra, 354. Thereafter, Crab-tree revoked the permit on the order of the chairman of the Milford planning and zoning board. The plaintiff appealed the revocation to the zoning board of appeals. Among the issues before that board were: (1) whether the plaintiffs proposed use of the property was a continuation of a nonconforming use or whether, to the contrary, the proposed use would involve a change of use from a nonconforming use; and (2) whether the plaintiff had abandoned any nonconforming use. Id., 355-56. A number of witnesses testified before the board. These witnesses included several who testified that the prior nonconforming use of the building as a hotel had been abandoned. <em>Caserta II, </em>supra, 356. Also, Crabtree testified that there had been neither a change of the nonconforming use nor an abandonment thereof. Id., 355. The board denied the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id., 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The plaintiff appealed to the trial court from the decision of the board denying his appeal from the revocation of the permit. The trial court sustained the plaintiffs appeal, ruling that: (1) Crabtree had properly issued the permit; (2) the permit had been illegally revoked; and (3) Crabtree\u2019s determination that the nonconforming use had not been abandoned could have been reasonably reached. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The board appealed, upon a grant of certification; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-9; to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court had not applied the proper scope of review to the board\u2019s decision and had not recognized facts and reasons in the record supporting the board's decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 357. The crux of these claims was that \u201cthe trial court improperly focused on whether Crabtree\u2019s decision to issue the permit had been supported by sufficient evidence, rather than on whether the de novo decision of the board to reject the plaintiff\u2019s appeal had been supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d Id., 357 n.5 The Appellate Court did not address these claims. It held, instead, that the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction to affirm Crabtree\u2019s revocation of the permit due to Crabtree\u2019s improper motive in revoking the permit. <em>Caserta I, </em>supra, 236-37. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the decision of the board. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We granted the board\u2019s petition for certification, limited to the following issue: \u201cWas the Appellate Court correct in holding that the zoning board of appeals lacked jurisdiction and that it was unnecessary to decide the board\u2019s scope of review?\u201d See <em>Caserta II, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>353-54. In <em>Caserta II, </em>we agreed with the board\u2019s contention that \u201cthe Appellate Court improperly concluded that (1) the board lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs appeal, and (2) it was unnecessary, therefore, [for the Appellate Court] to decide whether the trial court applied an improper scope of review to the board\u2019s decision.\u201d Id., 358. We therefore reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court in <em>Caserta I, </em>supra, and remanded the case \u201cto that court for determination of whether the trial court applied a proper scope of review to the decision of the board.\u201d <em>Caserta II, </em>supra, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">This remand engendered <em>Caserta III, </em>from which the board now appeals to this court. In <em>Caserta III, </em>supra, 259, the Appellate Court disagreed with the board\u2019s contention that the trial court \u201cimproperly considered the actions of the zoning enforcement officer rather than the entire record on which the board relied.\u201d The Appellate Court held that the trial court had applied a proper scope of review. Id., 260-61.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The board claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court had applied a proper scope of review to the decision of the board. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In order to analyze this claim, it is necessary to review the trial court\u2019s decision anew. In the portion of its decision regarding the plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to the permit, the trial court focused entirely on Crab-tree\u2019s testimony before the board, and on his opinions that the permit had been validly issued and that the plaintiff had not abandoned the nonconforming use. The trial court then stated: \u201cIt is obvious that Mr. Crab-tree knew the situation concerning the plaintiff\u2019s prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>erty. It is also obvious that he had determined to his own satisfaction that all requirements of the Zoning Regulations had been met.\u201d The trial court then concluded: \u201cMr. Crabtree felt that there was no abandonment. He found this on his knowledge of the property and the ruling of the City Attorney in the Midtown Package Store case that in that case there had been no abandonment. <em>The court cannot find that Mr. Crabtree\u2019s ruling could not have been reasonably reached under the circumstances. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">It is clear, therefore, that the trial court considered that its function was to determine whether Crabtree\u2019s initial decision to issue the permit was supported by evidence in the record\u2014i.e., whether Crabtree could have reasonably reached that decision. Crabtree\u2019s decision to issue the permit was contrary to the decision of the board upholding the revocation. Thus, the trial court focused on the evidence before the board that did not support its decision. Absent from the trial court\u2019s analysis, however, is any consideration of the evidence before the board that did support its decision. The trial court focused on the wrong body of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In this case, as the Appellate Court noted, the board stated the reasons for its action in a letter to the plaintiff informing him that the board had upheld the revocation of the permit. <em>Caserta III, </em>supra, 260; see footnote 2. It is not disputed that this letter constituted the kind of \u201cformal, official, collective statement of reasons for its action[s]\u201d; <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 527, 544, 600 A.2d 757 (1991); that serves to invoke the following scope of review of zoning decisions: \u201cWhere a zoning agency has stated its reasons for its actions, the court should determine only whether the assigned grounds are reasonably supported by the record and whether they are pertinent to the considerations which the authority was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>required to apply under the zoning regulations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Under this traditional and long-standing scope of review, the proper focus of a reviewing court is on the decision of the zoning agency and, with regard to its factual determinations, on the evidence before it that supports, rather than contradicts, its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The conclusion that this scope of review applies upon judicial review is not undermined by the fact that, as in this case, the zoning agency was a zoning board of appeals reviewing the decision of a zoning enforcement officer in an \u201cappeal\u201d from that decision pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-6 through 8-7b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>have never precisely held it to be so, it is clear from both the entire statutory scheme and our zoning case law that the zoning board hears and decides such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u201cappeal\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> de novo, and that the action of the zoning enforcement officer that is the subject of the appeal is entitled to no special deference by the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-7 provides that a zoning board of appeals hearing such an appeal \u201cmay reverse or affirm wholly or partly or may modify any order, requirement or decision appealed from and shall make such order, requirement or decision as in its opinion should be made in the premises and shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal has been taken but only in accordance with the provisions of this section.\u201d Section 8-7 also requires that the board \u201cstate upon its records the reason for its decision. . . .\u2019\u2019Furthermore, \u00a7 8-7a, which requires that any evidence taken be either stenographically or sound recorded; see footnote 5; contemplates that such a board may take evidence, as it did in this case. There is no statutory requirement that a zoning enforcement officer make and preserve a record regarding his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Our case law further reinforces the de novo nature of the hearing conducted by the zoning board of appeals. It is the board\u2019s responsibility, pursuant to the statutorily required hearing, to find the facts and to apply the pertinent zoning regulations to those facts. <em>Toffolon </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 558, 560-61, 236 A.2d 96 (1967); <em>Connecticut Sand &amp; Stone Corporation v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>150 Conn. 439, 442, 190 A.2d 594 (1963). In doing so, the board \u201cis endowed with a liberal discretion . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. Indeed, under appropriate circumstances, the board \u201cmay act upon facts which are known to it even though they are not produced at the hearing.\u201d <em>Parsons v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 290, 99 A.2d 149 (1953). The principal procedural limitations on the hearing are that \u201cthere must be due notice of the hearing, and at the hearing no one may be deprived of the right to produce relevant evidence or to cross-examine witnesses produced by his adversary or to be fairly apprised of the facts upon which the board is asked to act.\u201d Id., 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">It would be inconsistent with these broad grants of power to the board, and with the concomitant procedural limitations thereon, to envision the board\u2019s function as anything less than a de novo determination of the issue before it, unfettered by deference to the decision of the zoning officer. It follows from the de novo nature of the board\u2019s consideration of the issues decided by the zoning enforcement officer that the trial court, upon a judicial appeal from the board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> must focus on the decision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>board and the record before it, because it is that decision and record that are the subject of the appeal under \u00a78-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In this case, the Appellate Court, although giving undue deference to Crabtree\u2019s decision, recognized that the trial court had not yet considered the validity of the board\u2019s decision under the appropriate scope of review and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Appellate Court, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings. Although we disagree with the reasoning of the Appellate Court regarding the scope of review applied by the trial court, and although we disagree with the language of the Appellate Court\u2019s remand; see footnote 9; we agree with that court that the judgment of the trial court must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings. These further proceedings are to consider the remaining issues in the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the decision of the board pursuant to the appropriate scope of review of such decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed in part and modified in part in that the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand it to the trial court with direction to reverse the judgment sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, and for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\"> Although the Milford city clerk was originally cited as an additional defendant, throughout the course of the litigation, both at trial and on appeal, the board has been regarded as the sole defendant. See <em>Caserta </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>219 Conn. 352, 353 n.1, 593 A.2d 118 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\"> By letter dated April 22, 1988, from the chairman of the board to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the board gave the following as its reasons for denying the plaintiff\u2019s appeal: \u201cAt its meeting held on April 12, 1988, the Zoning Board of Appeals voted to deny the appeal of the decision of the Zoning Enforcement Officer, thereby upholding the revocation of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u201cIt was felt the permit was improperly issued and there was no evidence of reliance on the permit or work begun to establish vested rights, therefore, no rights were denied in the process of revocation. It was noted there was no attempt to remedy violations during this period of discontinuance of use and this evidences abandonment, and noted there is authority to provide for abandonment of non-conforming use when there is presumption of intent to abandon.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u201cAppeals to this ruling must be filed with the proper judicial court of law within fifteen days of the publication of the legal advertisement. Said legal notice to be published in the Milford Citizen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> The board also claimed that the trial court had improperly admitted evidence and had improperly determined that Crabtree was the zoning enforcement officer of Milford. These issues have been determined adversely to the board, and are no longer part of this case. <em>Caserta </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>219 Conn. 352, 357 n.5, 593 A.2d 118 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\"> The Appellaie Couri also held, however, \u00edha\u00ed \u00edhe irial court had never addressed an addiiional issue \u00edha\u00ed had been before ii, namely, wheiher \u201cbecause of a \u2018presumption of abandonment\u2019 ihe plaintiff\u2019s cessation of the nonconforming use resulied in the plaintiff\u2019s relinquishing the right to use the property in the nonconforming manner.\u201d <em>Caserta </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>28 Conn.

It is not an \u201cappeal\u201d in the sense of what we have come to recognize as an appeal from an administrative agency\u2019s decision to a court, in which there is a deferential scope of review of the administrative decision. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. It is, however, an \u201cappeal\u201d in the same sense that a decision of a court of probate may be appealed to the Superior Court, which then hears the matter de novo. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\"> Our recent decision in <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>225 Conn. 432, 623 A.2d 1007 (1993), is not to the contrary. It is true that we stated in that case that \u201c[z]oning boards of appeals do not adjudicate initial land use applications, but review those already acted upon by a municipality\u2019s zoning commission or enforcement officer.\u201d Id., 445. To the extent, however, that that language can be read as indicating a deferential scope of review of the enforcement officer\u2019s decision, it was dictum, because the issue in that case did not involve the proper scope of review by a court of a decision of a zoning board of appeals following the action of a zoning enforcement officer. We did not adress in that case the issue in this case of the proper scope of review of a zoning board of appeals decision, and we did not mean to intimate that such a board does not decide the issues before it de novo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 provides in relevant part: \u201cappeal from board TO COURT.
