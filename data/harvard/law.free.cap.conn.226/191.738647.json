On November 28,1989, the defendant, William Guekian, pleaded guilty to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) and to reckless driving in violation of Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 14-222. The defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of six months on each count, execution suspended and probation for one year. In addition, the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle operator\u2019s license was suspended for one year. These convictions are not presently at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The defendant was subsequently charged with operating a motor vehicle while his license was suspended in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c) and with violating his probation contrary to \u00a7 53a-32. The defendant was released from custody on a promise to appear on the condition that he participate in a substance abuse counseling program called Neon. Neon personnel referred the defendant to another treatment program at the Meriden Center. The Meriden Center counselors determined that the defendant needed residential treatment for his alcohol dependency and recommended Berkshire Woods Treatment Center. The defendant voluntarily entered Berkshire Woods Treatment Center on May 8, 1990. After successfully completing the treatment program, he was discharged on August 3, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">On August 16,1990, the defendant appeared before the trial court, <em>Bingham, J., </em>and moved for an examination for drug or alcohol dependency pursuant to \u00a7 17a-650. The state objected, arguing that the defendant, having been charged with a motor vehicle violation as opposed to a crime, was not eligible for treatment under the act. The trial court overruled the state\u2019s objection, granted the defendant\u2019s motion and ordered an evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">After a hearing on August 23, 1990, the trial court concluded that the legislature intended the term \u201ccrime,\u201d as used in the act, to include motor vehicle violations. The trial court noted that in \u00a7 6 of the act, now codified in \u00a7 17a-653, the legislature had specifically excluded persons charged or convicted of driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ing under the influence of drugs or alcohol pursuant to \u00a7 14-227a. The court determined that \u201cthere would be no reason to mention an exemption of \u00a7 14-227a in Section 6\u201d if the term \u201ccrime,\u201d as used in the act, did not include motor vehicle violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">After the defendant pleaded guilty to both charges on August 23, 1990, the trial court found that (1) the defendant was alcohol-dependent when he was charged with driving while his license was suspended, (2) there was a sufficient relationship between the defendant\u2019s alcohol dependency and the crime charged, and (3) the defendant needed and was likely to benefit from treatment. The trial court therefore concluded that the defendant was eligible for participation in the treatment plan pursuant to \u00a7 17a-656. Consequently, the trial court sentenced the defendant to six months imprisonment, suspended after thirty days with eighteen months probation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court also ordered, as a condition of probation, that the defendant submit to alcohol evaluation and treatment as deemed necessary by the probation department.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">With the trial court\u2019s permission, the state appealed to the Appellate Court, which upheld the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c) is a crime for purposes of the act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Guckian, </em>27 Conn. App. 225, 238, 605 A.2d 874 (1992). The Appellate Court also concurred in the trial court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 17a-656 (b) does not require the defendant to show a contributory or causal link between the defendant\u2019s drug or alcohol dependency and the crime committed. Id., 242-43. The Appellate Court concluded, however, that a remand was required for other matters not germane to the issues raised in this appeal. Id., 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following questions: \u201c(1) Did the Appellate Court properly determine that the term \u2018crime\u2019 as used in Public Acts 1989, No. 89-390 [now codified in \u00a7\u00a7 17a-648 through 17a-658] includes motor vehicle violations? (2) Did the Appellate Court properly determine that the requirement of Public Acts 1989, No. 89-390 that there be a \u2018relationship\u2019 between the alcohol or drug dependency and the crime committed does not require a showing of a causal or contributory link between the dependency and the crime?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Guckian, </em>223 Conn. 907, 612 A.2d 57 (1992). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The state argues that the defendant is not eligible for the treatment program because he was charged with a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c), which is a motor vehicle violation and not a crime. Under \u00a7 17a-650, \u201c[t]he court, on its own motion or on motion of the state\u2019s attorney or a person <em>charged with a crime or convicted of a crime </em>but not yet sentenced, may order, if the interests of justice will be served, that such person be examined ... to determine if the person is alcohol-dependent or drug-dependent and eligible for treatment . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Under \u00a7 17a-656 (b), the court may order alcohol or drug treatment for a convicted person who was alcohol-dependent or drug-dependent <em>\u201cat the time of the crime for which he was convicted\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In this case, the defendant was admitted to the treatment program pursuant to \u00a7 17a-656.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The narrow question before us is whether the term \u201ccrime,\u201d as used in the treatment program statute, includes motor vehicle violations. The term \u201ccrime\u201d is not defined in the statutory sections that establish the treatment program, nor is it defined in chapter 319j <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>(alcohol and drug abuse) or title 17a (social and human services and resources) of the General Statutes, in which the treatment program is codified. Generally, when a statutory term is not defined, we focus on its ordinary meaning. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1. The term \u201ccrime\u201d is ordinarily so broadly defined, however, that its common meaning is not instructive in determining whether the statutory term \u201ccrime\u201d includes motor vehicle violations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In the absense of an instructive definition of the term \u201ccrime\u201d for purposes of determining whether an individual is eligible for the treatment program, we must construe the statute in accordance with the legislature\u2019s intent and purpose in drafting the legislation. \u201c[T]he fundamental objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Warkentin </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>223 Conn. 14, 20, 610 A.2d 1287 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The state argues that our analysis should begin and end with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24, which defines the term \u201ccrime\u201d for purposes of the penal code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. \u201cWhat may or may not be a criminal offense for purposes of a particular statutory categorization is not necessarily determinative of whether it is a criminal offense for [other] purposes . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kluttz, </em>9 Conn. App. 686, 699, 521 A.2d 178 (1987).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 547 A.2d 10 (1988), we concluded that a violation of \u00a7 14-215 was a crime for purposes of a search of the defendant\u2019s person without reaching the distinct question of whether a violation of \u00a7 14-215 is a crime for general classification purposes under \u00a7 53a-24 of the penal code. Similarly, the Appellate Court held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>22 Conn. App. 108, 112, 575 A.2d 699, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 811, 580 A.2d 61 (1990), that \u201ca violation of . . . \u00a7 14-227a was, for purposes of the defendant\u2019s conditions of probation, a violation of the criminal laws of this state,\u201d even though a violation of \u00a7 14-227a is categorized as a motor vehicle violation and not a crime under \u00a7 53a-24. The Appellate Court noted that \u201cwhether the particular transgression of the law invoked here, which the legislature has deemed to be noncriminal for purposes of. . . \u00a7 53a-24 (a), should be regarded, nonetheless, as criminal for purposes of a condition of probation, depends not on that categorization but on the functions and purposes of probation. Those functions and purposes lead us to conclude that, under the facts of this case, a violation of . . . \u00a7 14-227a was, for purposes of the defendant\u2019s conditions of probation, a violation of the criminal laws of this state.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In construing the term \u201ccrime,\u201d we turn to the legislative history and the circumstances surrounding its enactment to ascertain the legislature\u2019s purpose in establishing the treatment program. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>210 Conn. 573, 576, 556 A.2d 584 (1989). \u201cAlthough statements made on the floor of the legislature are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>controlling on statutory interpretation, we may take judicial notice of those statements, which are strong indications of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 303, 310-11, 592 A.2d 953 (1991). A review of the legislative history of the act reveals that it was adopted to provide \u201cnew programs, new initiatives, new ideas, [and] consolidation of some programs in the effort to combat drugs in the state of Connecticut.\u201d 32 S. Proc., Pt. 11, 1989 Sess., p. 3630, remarks of Senator John C. Daniels. As part of this new initiative, the legislature sought to provide \u201ca drug [or alcohol] rehabilitation system for people who come into the criminal justice system.\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 40, 1989 Sess., p. 14,288, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano. The legislature also afforded the trial court greater discretion in recommending and ordering substance abuse treatment. \u201cCurrently in our system, we have something similar to this, but it\u2019s not being used, because prosecutors have a veto power over it. . . . So, we\u2019ve given the judges some discretion. The prosecutors can recommend this, but also, now, the judges can.\u201d 32 S. Proc., Pt. 11, 1989 Sess., pp. 3637-38, remarks of Senator Anthony V. Avallone.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">These statements demonstrate that the legislature sought to provide greater access to treatment by making substance abuse treatment readily available and by giving the trial court the power to allow qualified persons to participate in the program. We conclude from the legislative history that the statutory scheme is remedial in nature and as such must be \u201cliberally construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>220 Conn. 400, 404, 599 A.2d 738 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In discussing the statutory scheme, Senator Avallone made it clear that the act sought \u201cto give the court discretion, <em>in less serious cases, </em>misdemeanors and class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>D felonies, to suspend prosecution in drug and alcohol treatment [cases], to give people an opportunity, those who have not yet been tried, and those who have been tried and found guilty, but have not yet been sentenced, an alternative to jail, for treatment programs.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 32 S. Proc., Pt. 11, 1989 Sess., p. 3635. Indeed, \u00a7 17a-653 (b) gives the trial court the power to waive the ineligibility provisions for persons charged with class A, B or C felonies, and violations of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (operating a vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol) and \u00a7 53a-60d (assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Given the remedial purpose of the statutory scheme, it stands to reason that an individual who has been charged with driving while his license was suspended, in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c), is eligible for the treatment program. \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Warkentin </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 20. We agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c) is a \u201ccrime\u201d for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 17a-648 through 17a-658.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Our conclusion is further supported by the fact that the legislature specifically excluded from the statutory scheme persons charged with \u00a7 14-227a, which is a motor vehicle violation. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-653. If motor vehicle violations were not crimes for purposes of the act, there would be no need specifically to exclude \u00a7 14-227a. Furthermore, in \u00a7 17a-656, the legislature specifically excluded certain convicted persons from participation in the treatment program. The legislature excluded from \u00a7 17a-656 <em>only </em>persons convicted of murder, attempt to commit murder, kidnapping, robbery in the first degree, any felony involving serious physical injury, or persons previously treated. \u201cUnless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>cates that the legislature intended the list to be exclusive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 766, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982). As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended that the word \u201ccrime\u201d incorporate motor vehicle violations. We conclude that a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c) is a \u201ccrime\u201d for purposes of qualifying for the treatment program under \u00a7\u00a7 17a-648 through 17a-658.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In its second claim, the state challenges the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the term \u201crelationship,\u201d as used in \u00a7 17a-656 (b) does not require the defendant to show a causal or contributory link between the dependency and the crime. Section 17a-656 (b) provides that \u201c[t]he court may impose a sentence and order treatment . . . if the court finds that . . . (2) there was a relationship between the dependency and the crime . . . .\u201d The term \u201crelationship\u201d is not defined within the statutory scheme. Accordingly, we must \u201c \u2018focus upon its common understanding as expressed in the law and upon its dictionary meaning.\u2019 ... \u2018In the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language. . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Builders Service Corporation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 276, 545 A.2d 530 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">A \u201crelationship\u201d is \u201cthe state or character of being related or interrelated: a connection by way of relation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979) defines \u201crelated\u201d as \u201cconnected.\u201d See also <em>Bolt Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 220, 228, 567 A.2d 371 (1989). Thus, the statutory requirement of a \u201crelationship\u201d between the dependency and the crime calls for some logical associ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ation or connection between the two. It does not, however, require that the connection be causal in nature. If the legislature had intended to place such a burden on the defendant, it would have specified that the court is required to find a <em>camal </em>relationship or a <em>carnal </em>connection between the dependency and the crime. We conclude that although the statute requires a connection between the defendant\u2019s alcohol or drug dependency and the crime committed, it does not require a showing of a contributory or causal link. Our conclusion gains further support from the legislature\u2019s liberal intention, as set forth in part I, to provide drug or alcohol treatment when reasonably possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Finally, we find ample support in the record for the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s alcohol dependency was related to his violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c). In its articulation, the trial court outlined the following facts to support its finding of a relationship between the defendant\u2019s alcohol dependency and his violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c). The trial court found that when the defendant was arrested for driving while his license was suspended, he was on probation for driving under the influence of alcohol. His license had been suspended as a result of his driving under the influence of alcohol. In addition, the trial court found that the defendant had been admitted to Berkshire Woods Treatment Center from May 8, 1990, until August 3, 1990, and that he was an alcohol-dependent person during that time. Moreover, the trial court relied on testimony from Kenneth Hodge, a counselor at Neon, who testified that the defendant, as an alcoholic, had a continuing need for treatment. We agree with the trial court and the Appellate Court that this evidence furnished an ample foundation for the trial court\u2019s finding of a \u201crelationship\u201d between the defendant\u2019s alcohol dependency and his violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

App. 686, 698-99, 521 A.2d 178 (1987), the Appellate Court held that although a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a, negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, was a motor vehicle violation rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>than a crime, it could be considered a crime for purposes of the lesser included offense doctrine. \u201cWhether the lesser included offense doctrine should apply to include a transgression of the law which the legislature has categorized for certain purposes as noncriminal depends, not on that categorization, but on the functions and purposes of the doctrine itself. We conclude that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle is an offense for purposes of the lesser included offense doctrine.\u201d Id., 699.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b222-7\">Borden, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0c\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with part I of the majority opinion, and with so much of part II as defines the relationship between the preexisting dependency and the crime with which the defendant now stands charged, namely, \u201csome logical association or connection\u201d between the dependency and the crime committed. Even under that broad standard, however, I fail to see any logical connection between the two in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The defendant is alcohol-dependent, and has been so for some period of time. He is now charged with the crime of driving under suspension. The support that the majority marshals for the trial court\u2019s finding of a logical connection between his dependency and the crime with which he now stands charged amounts to the facts that: (1) he was alcohol-dependent when he was first put on probation for driving under the influence; and (2) he is still alcohol-dependent and in need of treatment. There is nothing in these facts that supports a logical connection between his preexisting dependency and his present criminal conduct. If all that is needed to establish such a connection is that the defendant is still dependent, then the factor of a logical connection between the two becomes superfluous, because that will always be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The only other possible connection that I can divine from the majority opinion is that the defendant\u2019s previous crimes were motor vehicle offenses and his current crime is also a motor vehicle offense. That does not seem to me what the legislature meant by a \u201crelationship\u201d between the defendant\u2019s dependency and his current crime. There must be something in the facts of the defendant\u2019s current criminal conduct that relates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>logically to his dependency, more than the fact that he is now charged with the same type of crime that he had committed before.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">I therefore dissent, and would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
