J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2S\">The motion of the plaintiff Thomas Grieco for permission to file a petition for certification to review the Appellate Court\u2019s denial of a petition for certification is denied pursuant to <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>194 Conn. 277, 479 A.2d 1207 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is defined by statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983), and the cases cited therein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The applicable statute, General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f, limits our review of decisions of the Appellate Court to those that constitute a \u201cfinal determination of any appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 338-41, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992). In <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 279, we held that a decision by the Appellate Court denying a petition for certification is not a \u201cfinal determination of any appeal.\u201d We declined to reconsider that decision in <em>Udolf </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>206 Conn. 803, 535 A.2d 1316 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Our decisions in <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, and <em>Udolf </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, that a denial of certification is not a \u201cfinal determination of any appeal\u201d were based upon the language that is currently found in General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 8-8 (o) and 8-9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 8-9 provides that <em>\u201c[a]ppeals </em>from zoning commissions and planning and zoning commissions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may be taken . . . <em>upon certification for review, </em>to the appellate court in the manner provided in section 8-8.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 8-8 (o) provides that \u201c[tjhere shall be no right to further review [of a decision by the Superior Court in a zoning appeal] except to the appellate court by <em>certification for review,\u201d </em>and that \u201c[t]he procedure on <em>appeal </em>to the appellate court shall ... be in accordance with the procedures provided by rule or law for the appeal of judgments rendered by the superior court . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Taken together, these statutes manifest the legislature\u2019s intent that, until the Appellate Court certifies a case for appeal, there <em>is </em>no appeal to that court. The statutes expressly differentiate between a right to \u201creview\u201d and a right to an \u201cappeal.\u201d This statutory distinction is reflected also in our rules of practice, which specify that, until the Appellate Court has granted a petition for certification to appeal, the petitioner may not file an appeal, is not required to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the appellate filing fee and cannot take other steps to initiate the appellate process. See generally Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4142 through 4142.4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">As we held in <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, our authority to grant petitions for certification does not, in light of these statutory and Practice Book provisions, encompass the authority to review the Appellate Court\u2019s denial of a petition for certification. The Appellate Court\u2019s denial of a petition for certification means that a predicate for an appeal to the Appellate Court has not been met. A fortiori, such a denial prevents the Appellate Court from reaching a \u201cfinal determination of any appeal\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In other instances involving zoning appeals, if our construction of a jurisdictional statute was mistaken, the legislature has readily responded by amending the statute. The text of \u00a7 51-197f has, however, remained unchanged since <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, was decided in 1984. We may, therefore, \u201cpresume legislative acquiescence in our interpretation of the . . . statute.\u201d <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Garofalo, </em>219 Conn. 810, 817, 595 A.2d 341 (1991); see <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 134, 527 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>672 (1987). It is reasonable to assume that the legislature decided to continue the policy, originally enacted before the establishment of the Appellate Court, that one opportunity for discretionary appellate review of a zoning decision, after a full hearing in the Superior Court, strikes the proper balance between protecting property rights and assuring the finality of zoning decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Because a petition for certification to review the Appellate Court\u2019s denial of a petition for certification must be dismissed, the plaintiff Thomas Grieco\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In this opinion Callahan, Borden, Norcott, Katz and Palmer, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\"> The two-part <em>Curcio </em>test upon which the dissent relies for the contrary-assertion is not a source of independent judicial authority to determine when appeals may be taken to this court. As the opinion makes clear, the test is a judicial gloss on whether certain trial court rulings are final judgments \u201cwithin the meaning of [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 52-263 and 51-197a.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 provides in relevant part: \u201cappeal from board TO COURT.

The exercise of discretionary jurisdiction, by way of certification, is premised on the understanding that a denial of discretionary review leaves the underlying judgment in place without an endorsement of its merits. <em>\u201c </em>\u2018[A] denial of certification does not necessarily indicate our approval either of the result reached by the Appellate Division or of the opinion rendered by it. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Chisholm, </em>155 Conn. 706, 707, 236 A.2d 465 (1967)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Doscher, </em>172 Conn. 592, 376 A.2d 359 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b252-7\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"As4\">dissenting. The plaintiff Thomas Grieco\u2019s motion for permission to file a petition for certification raises an important issue\u2014whether this court has jurisdiction to certify an appeal from the Appellate Court in a zoning matter when the Appellate Court fails to certify the appeal from the trial court as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (o).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority relies on the per curiam decision in <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>194 Conn. 277, 479 A.2d 1207 (1984), to support its denial of the motion. Because I believe <em>Ingersoll </em>was wrongly decided and that we have jurisdiction, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">First, it is helpful to examine the issue within the context of the plaintiffs claim. The plaintiff owns real prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>erty on the northerly side of Blueberry Hill Road in Redding. The defendants R.K. Health Services, Inc., and Gilbert Hill Corporation filed a site plan application to develop land, partly owned by the defendant Perkin-Elmer Corporation (Perkin-Elmer), located on the southerly side of Blueberry Hill Road. Appurtenant to Perkin-Elmer\u2019s land is an easement providing a right-of-way over its adjoining residential land. The defendant zoning commission of the town of Redding approved the site plan application, permitting the development of a 299 unit health care facility, on the condition that Perkin-Elmer abandon the easement. The plaintiffs property and the easement are separated by Blueberry Hill Road, which is fifty feet in width. The plaintiff appealed the commission\u2019s decision, claiming that he was statutorily aggrieved because he owned land \u201cwithin a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) (1). The defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing. While the motion to dismiss was still pending, Perkin-Elmer conveyed the easement to others. The effect of the conveyance was to place the plaintiff\u2019s land a distance of more than 100 feet from the property that was the subject of the site plan approval. The trial court dismissed the appeal because the plaintiff did not own land within a radius of 100 feet of land involved in the commission\u2019s decision, and, therefore, was not statutorily aggrieved. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, review of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Our jurisdiction to review decisions of the Appellate Court is limited by General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f, which provides in part: \u201cUpon final determination of any appeal by the appellate court, there shall be no right to further review except the supreme court shall have the power to certify cases for its review upon petition by an aggrieved party or by the appellate panel which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>heard the matter and upon the vote of two justices of the supreme court so to certify and under such other rules as the justices of the supreme court shall establish.\u201d The Appellate Court\u2019s refusal to grant certification in this case could not be more final. A reasonable interpretation of the term \u201cappeal\u201d must include petitions for certification to appeal. Not only must we interpret our statutes with common sense; <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 276, 545 A.2d 530 (1988); but \u201c[e]very presumption which favors the jurisdiction of the court should be indulged.\u201d <em>Tuccio </em>v. <em>Zehrung, </em>164 Conn. 231, 232, 319 A.2d 406 (1973). By refusing to grant the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification, the Appellate Court has effectively extinguished the plaintiff\u2019s claim. For practical purposes, the trial court\u2019s decision has become a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d because the Appellate Court has allowed it to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We have never held that the right of appeal is strictly grounded upon statutory authority. Indeed, we have recognized exceptions to the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d rule. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983), we held that an \u201cotherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d Certainly, the Appellate Court\u2019s refusal to grant certification, which in effect allows the judgment of the trial court to stand, invokes this court\u2019s right to grant the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Accordingly, I believe that we should grant the motion for permission to file a petition for certification to appeal, vote affirmatively on the merits of the petition and decide the substantive issue raised by the plaintiff. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (o) provides: \u201cThere shall be no right to further review except to the appellate court by certification for review, on the vote of two judges of the appellate court so to certify and under such other rules as the judges of the appellate court establish. The procedure on appeal to the appellate court shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be in accordance with the procedures provided by rule or law for the appeal of judgments rendered by the superior court unless modified by rule of the judges of the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
