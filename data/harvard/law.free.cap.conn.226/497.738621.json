J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOG\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether a witness may invoke his fifth amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>right against compelled self-incrimination if principles of double jeopardy may bar his future prosecution for crimes relating to the testimony sought. The state charged the juvenile respondent, Keijam T., in a delinquency petition with the serious juvenile offense of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for intentionally causing the death of another person on August 13, 1990.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Riddle, J., </em>found probable cause to believe that the respondent had committed murder as charged,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and transferred him to the regular criminal docket pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The respondent appealed this transfer order to the Appellate Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-127, 46b-142 and 52-263,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> claiming that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>court had improperly sustained a rebuttal witness\u2019 fifth amendment privilege not to testify and, thus, had violated the respondent\u2019s constitutional right to compel witnesses in his defense. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The trial court made the following written findings pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Between midnight and 12:30 a.m. on August 13, 1990, Tythron Blue and Moses James were walking along a sidewalk on Arthur Street, in New Haven, moving toward Rosette Street on the odd numbered side of the road. Blue was walking slightly behind James. Upon hearing <em>\u201ca </em>thump\u201d in the backyard of 23 Arthur Street, James turned and saw the respondent running out of the backyard and shooting a gun that looked like an Uzi.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> James turned and ran toward Rosette Street; Blue hesitated, but then followed James on Arthur Street, staying nearer to the houses than James. James saw Rodney Lewis<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in front of him on the opposite, even numbered side of the street, firing at them with a nine millimeter handgun with an eight or nine inch barrel and moving backward toward Rosette Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>James ran past three or four houses, and then turned right into an alley. As Blue followed, he turned his right side toward the respondent, who was behind them on Arthur Street. After Blue had moved a few feet into the alley, he leaned against the back of a car saying to James, \u201cMo, I\u2019m shot. Mo, I\u2019m shot.\u201d James ran through the alley to a backyard at DeWitt Street, and laid in the grass for about five minutes. When he returned to Arthur Street, James saw Blue lying in the middle of the road, bleeding. When the respondent fired two or three more shots, James ran back toward DeWitt Street. When he returned finally to Arthur Street, James found a number of girls screaming and holding Blue. Lewis then stopped firing the gun and ran back to the respondent\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The court found that Blue had been fatally shot on August 13, 1990, at approximately 12:30 a.m. Blue\u2019s death resulted from a medium caliber bullet that entered his right side, the trajectory of the bullet being from right to left and horizontal.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The respondent was arrested for the murder of Blue. Lewis was also arrested and charged with attempt to commit assault in the first degree and criminal use of a firearm for his conduct in the shooting incident. Lewis was not charged with murder because, comparing the relative positions from which the respondent and Lewis had been firing, the police concluded that the bullet that had struck Blue had come from the respondent\u2019s gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">At the transfer hearing, the respondent offered Lewis as a rebuttal witness to prove that Lewis, rather than the respondent, had shot Blue and that the respondent had not been on the scene at the time of the shooting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the time that his testimony was offered, Lewis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>had been convicted of and was serving the sentence imposed for the crime of criminal attempt to commit assault in the first degree that arose from his participation in the shooting incident on August 13, 1990. Lewis took the stand but, before being questioned, claimed his fifth amendment privilege not to testify, on the ground that his attempted assault conviction might not bar his subsequent prosecution for other offenses arising out of the death of Blue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court ruled that \u201cthe use of the privilege by Mr. Lewis is proper because answers to the questions could provide a link in the chain of evidence and ultimately put this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>witness at risk of possible additional prosecution.\u201d The respondent took exception, claiming that any further prosecution of Lewis would be barred by Lewis\u2019 constitutional right against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The respondent\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly sustained Lewis\u2019 assertion of his fifth amendment privilege not to testify at the respondent\u2019s hearing. According to the respondent, applicable principles of double jeopardy would bar Lewis\u2019 future prosecution for the murder of Blue. We disagree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">A court may not deny a witness\u2019 invocation of the fifth amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination unless it is \u201c \u2018 <em>\u201cperfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have [a] tendency\u201d to incriminate.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>200 Conn. 310, 319, 511 A.2d 1000 (1986), quoting <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 488, 71 S. Ct. 814, 95 L. Ed. 1118 (1951); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>170 Conn. 206, 209, 365 A.2d 821, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 954, 96 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Ct. 1732, 48 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1976). \u201cTo sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 486-87; <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>supra. In appraising a fifth amendment claim by a witness, a judge \u201cmust be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the facts actually in evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The parties do not dispute that, in the absence of a double jeopardy bar, the testimony to be given by Lewis would be incriminating. The respondent\u2019s offer of proof regarding Lewis\u2019 testimony was that Lewis, not the respondent, had fired the shot that had killed Blue. Although Lewis would normally be able to invoke his fifth amendment privilege to avoid giving such testimony, the respondent maintains that Lewis could testify with impunity because his conviction of attempted assault triggered a double jeopardy bar against any future prosecution stemming from the shooting incident that resulted in Blue\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u201c[T]he right to one\u2019s privilege against prosecution that could result from the testimony sought does not depend upon the likelihood of prosecution but upon the <em>possibility </em>of prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The trial court was not obligated, therefore, to reach the ultimate merits of the underlying double jeopardy claim in resolving the fifth amendment issue. Under <em>Williams, </em>the trial court was obligated to assess only whether a possibility of future prosecution existed, dr could arise, by virtue of the proffered testimony in light of existing law. The trial court could consider the facts actually in evidence, and the peculiarities of the case; id.; but the court was not compelled to conduct a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>trial to reach a definitive conclusion concerning the future availability of a defense of double jeopardy to a nonparty witness in the trial at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">As a matter of procedure, in sustaining Lewis\u2019 fifth amendment privilege, the trial court carefully and thoroughly addressed the considerations mandated by <em>Williams. </em>It was only after hearing argument by counsel, reviewing the memorandum submitted by the respondent\u2019s counsel, reviewing the transcripts of Lewis\u2019 plea and sentencing hearings, and considering the questions in the context of this proceeding that the court determined that any relevant inquiry addressed to Lewis could provide a link in the chain of evidence and ultimately put him at risk of possible additional prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Under <em>Williams, </em>whether Lewis could invoke his fifth amendment privilege devolves, therefore, into a substantive question of whether there was a possibility that Lewis might be subject to prosecution for Blue\u2019s murder. This question must be analyzed in light of <em>State </em>v. <em>Lonergan, </em>213 Conn. 74, 566 A.2d 677 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905, 100 S. Ct. 2586, 110 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1990), which sets forth the standard for determining when double jeopardy attaches in consecutive prosecution situations in this state. The <em>Lonergan </em>test states that \u201cin successive prosecution cases if the same evidence offered to prove a violation of the offense charged in the first prosecution is the sole evidence offered to prove an element of the offense charged in the second prosecution, then prosecution of the second offense is barred on double jeopardy grounds, regardless of whether either offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Although exposure to future prosecution is more attenuated under the <em>Lonergan </em>standard than under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the standard for simultaneous prosecutions; see <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> State v. <em>Goldson, </em>178 Conn. 422, 424, 423 A.2d 114 (1979); we nonetheless agree with the trial court that a possibility exists that Lewis could be prosecuted for crimes relating to the death of Blue if his testimony were compelled.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The complex factual circumstances of this case involve two victims, two assailants, and more than two shots being fired by each assailant over a span of time. The record is unclear whether, in charging Lewis with attempted assault in the first degree, the state was charging him with having assaulted Blue or James. Although the transcript of Lewis\u2019 plea hearing reflects a discussion of two victims, the transcript of his plea and sentencing hearings indicate that Lewis was being charged with attempt to commit an assault on James, the \u201cvictim\u201d who was not physically harmed by the shootings. Yet, at the respondent\u2019s transfer hearing, Sergeant Vaughn Maher, the officer in charge of the investigation of the August 13, 1990 shooting, testified that Lewis had been arrested solely because of his conduct vis-a-vis Blue, the victim who was killed. The long form information, charging Lewis with attempted assault in the first degree, does not specify the particular victim to whom the charge referred. In light of these ambiguities concerning the scope and nature of Lewis\u2019 guilty plea, the trial court could not be certain that applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tion of the <em>Lonergan </em>standard would exclude the possibility that Lewis would be tried in the future for the murder of Blue.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The respondent maintains, however, that a different ruling is required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>23 Conn. App. 215, 579 A.2d 1104, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 826, 582 A.2d 204 (1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 922, 111 S. Ct. 1315, 113 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1991). He maintains that the state is estopped from charging a greater offense than that pleaded to in relation to a particular incident if the state has failed to reserve the right to future prosecution in a plea agreement. This interpretation is over-broad and misplaced. <em>Nelson </em>involved an assertion by a defendant who was the party to a plea agreement that the prosecutor had violated that plea agreement. The defendant in <em>Nelson </em>had pleaded guilty to assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle at a time when all parties knew the condition of the single victim was serious and life threatening. Id., 219. The Appellate Court held that <em>\u201c[u]nder the circumstances, </em>it was incumbent upon the state to enunciate what was and was not covered by the agreement lest the defendant be allowed to go to plea under the impression that the criminal portion of this tragic episode was closed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. <em>Nelson </em>is inapposite in the circumstances of this case, in which the exact scope of Lewis\u2019 plea is uncertain. The trial court had no obligation to conduct a separate trial to determine the intentions of the parties to a plea agreement to which the respondent was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person <em>. . .</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"><em> </em>The delinquency petition also charged the respondent with the serious juvenile offense of attempted murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-49, and with the offenses of criminal use of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-216, carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-206, reckless endangerment in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-63, escape from a correctional institution in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-169, and two counts of unlawful discharge of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\"> This transfer hearing was the second to take place in this matter on the issue of probable cause.
