Dalia, the widow of Thomas Dalia (decedent) and the administratrix of his estate, appeals from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the judgment of the trial court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rendered after a court trial, determining that title to certain personal and real property is in the defendants, Julia Lawrence, Carmen Dalia and Paul Dalia, the children of the decedent by a prior marriage. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) two trust savings accounts established by the decedent during his life were not part of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate share; (2) the transfer of certain real estate by the decedent during his life was a valid inter vivos gift; and (3) a certain survivorship bank account established by the decedent during his life was a valid inter vivos gift. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The plaintiff, acting both individually and as the administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate, brought this action against the defendants, claiming that: (1) as the administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate, she was entitled to immediate possession of certain bank accounts and real property in the defendants\u2019 possession; and (2) as the widow of the decedent, she was entitled to her intestate share of those accounts and real property. The trial court rendered judgment for the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The trial court found the following facts: The plaintiff and the decedent married on September 1, 1967. After their wedding, the plaintiff and the decedent resided in a two-family house owned by the decedent in New Haven. On May 3,1968, the decedent executed a quitclaim deed of the house to the three defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>After the deed was recorded on the New Haven land records on May 7, 1968, it was mailed to the defendant Julia Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The trial court further found that, after the defendants had become the owners of the house by virtue of the deed, they gave the decedent permission to continue to use and occupy the premises for the duration of his life, as if he were still the fee owner. Although from May 3,1968, through November 21,1989, when the decedent died, the insurance policy covering the house named the defendants as the owners of the premises, the decedent continued to bear all the expenses of the house, including taxes, insurance, sewer charges, repairs and mortgage payments. The decedent also continued to collect all the rental income generated by the property, entered into leases with tenants, and responded to the tenants\u2019 complaints and needs. The decedent reported all the income on his and the plaintiff\u2019s joint income tax returns, and took the available depreciation and expense deductions. On various occasions, the decedent stated to his accountant, his neighbors and the municipal authorities that he was the owner of the property. The decedent told his children that it was his intention that they have the property, in accordance with his promise to their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The trial court specifically found that the defendants had proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that the decedent had intended to pass title immediately and irrevocably to the defendants, and that the recording of the deed, coupled with that intent, constituted an immediate legal delivery to the defendants. The court also specifically stated that this finding was not contravened by the fact that the decedent had continued to control the property, with the defendants\u2019 consent, during his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The trial court also found that the decedent had opened two trust savings accounts: (1) an account with the Second Bank of New Haven, now the Bank of Boston, in his name as trustee for Carmen Dalia; and (2) an account with the Colonial Bank, also now the Bank of Boston, in the name of the decedent as trustee for Julia Lawrence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to both accounts, the decedent was the sole signatory, the accounts were listed under his social security number, and he continued to exercise complete control over the accounts and the funds in them. Under the rules of the banks, only the decedent was allowed access to the accounts during his life, and upon his death the funds would be payable to the named beneficiaries. The passbooks to these accounts were kept either in the decedent\u2019s house or in a safety deposit box located at one of the banks. The trial court found that, until he was near death, the decedent had been the only person who had opened the safety deposit box.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The decedent also opened a joint survivorship savings account with the Bank of Boston, in his name and that of Paul Dalia. This account was listed under the decedent\u2019s social security number, and until November 13, 1989, he exercised complete control over the account and the funds in it. Under the rules of the bank, both the decedent and Paul Dalia had access to this account while both were alive. The passbook was kept either in the decedent\u2019s house or in the safety deposit box mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The trial court also found that on November 13,1989, as the decedent was dying, he gave Paul Dalia the keys to the safety deposit box and told him: (1) to close out the joint survivorship account and use the funds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>amounting to approximately $17,000, to pay for the decedent\u2019s burial and to buy a truck for himself; and (2) to hold the trust savings account passbooks for Julia Lawrence and Carmen Dalia. The trial court found that the decedent had delivered the joint survivorship account passbook to Paul Dalia with the authority to use the money in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">With respect to all the bank accounts, the trial court also found that the decedent had told the defendants that it was his intention that they have the money in the accounts, in accordance with his promise to the defendants\u2019 mother. With respect to the joint account, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to rebut the statutory presumption created by General Statutes \u00a7 36-3 that the decedent had intended to pass to Paul Dalia a present beneficial ownership interest in the account when the decedent opened the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">On November 21,1989, the decedent died intestate. On November 28,1989, the bank paid Julia Lawrence the funds in the trust account for her, in the amount of approximately $14,000, and on November 29,1989, the bank paid Carmen Dalia the funds in the trust account for her, in the amount of approximately $17,000. The defendants filed a state succession tax return conceding their tax liability for the full value of the real property and of the funds in the bank accounts. The department of revenue services assessed the defendants accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"A6U\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the trust savings accounts were not part of the decedent\u2019s intestate estate for purposes of determining the plaintiff\u2019s intestate share. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Some brief history is in order. In <em>Fasano </em>v. <em>Meliso, </em>146 Conn. 496, 152 A.2d 512 (1959), this court held that a trust account, similar to the accounts in the present case, was invalid as \u201can attempted testamentary disposition of the trustee\u2019s own property in a manner forbidden by the Statute of Wills.\u201d Id., 499. In response, \u201cthe 1961 General Assembly enacted Public Act No. 306 in order to overrule the consequence of that decision and to give full effect to a savings account trust deposit despite the requirements of the Statute of Wills.\u201d <em>Manulik </em>v. <em>Devitt, </em>176 Conn. 663, 667, 410 A.2d 469 (1979). Number 306 of the 1961 Public Acts is now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 36-110 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In <em>Manulik </em>v. <em>Devitt, </em>supra, we concluded that a trust savings account that had been established by a mother as trustee for her daughter, the defendant in the case, was valid. After the mother\u2019s death, the plaintiffs, who were the defendant\u2019s brothers, contended that their mother had intended that the money in the account be divided equally among her children upon her death. Id., 665. We held, however, that \u00a7 36-110 (a) established \u201ca conclusive presumption\u201d that the depositor had intended to create a trust upon the terms stated in the statute; see footnote 1; and specifically that \u201cthe effect of the foregoing [presumption] 'shall not be denied, abridged or in any way affected because such signed statement . . . fails to comply with . . . the laws of this state prescribing the requirements to effect a valid testamentary disposition of property or because of any absence of delivery or compliance with other requirements to effect a valid gift or transfer in trust.\u2019 [General Statutes \u00a7 36-110 (a) (2).]\u201d Id., 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In <em>Manulik, </em>moreover, we rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u00a7 36-110 had been enacted solely for the protection of banks and that, therefore, the ownership of the trust account should be determined in accordance with the settlor\u2019s intent and \u201ccommon-law prereq<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>uisites for the establishment of a valid trust.\u201d Id., 668. We stated: \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 36-110, as amended, attaches specific consequences to the acts of the depositor-trustee when compliance with the statute is satisfied. It is unmistakable that the statute was based upon the premise that the creation and maintenance of such an account itself manifested the depositor-trustee\u2019s intent and that this conclusively presumed intent should be accorded full effect through the instrumentality of a \u2018statutory trust\u2019 in spite of the fact that the transaction fails to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Wills or of the common-law concepts of gifts or transfers in trusts. Cf. <em>Howard Savings Institution </em>v. <em>Kielb, </em>38 N. J. 186, 202, 183 A.2d 401 [1962] (construing a statute virtually identical with \u00a7 36-110). In sum, \u00a7 36-110 gives effect to the intention of the depositor to make a \u2018poor man\u2019s will,\u2019 but at the same time to retain the sole right to the moneys during his lifetime. See Hearings, Joint Standing Committee on Banks, 1961 Session, pp. 129-132. By virtue of the statute\u2019s conclusive presumption regarding the depositor-trustee\u2019s intent, therefore, the defendant in the present case, as beneficiary, acquired all rights to the funds contained in the account upon the death of her mother.\u201d <em>Manulik </em>v. <em>Devitt, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In <em>Salvio </em>v. <em>Salvio, </em>186 Conn. 311, 441 A.2d 190 (1982), we considered the effect of \u00a7 36-110 (a) in the context of a marital dissolution action. At issue in that case was \u201cwhether savings accounts held by one or both parties in trust for their children may be included by the trial court in its division of marital property accompanying the parents\u2019 [marital dissolution].\u201d Id., 312. We held that the accounts could be included by the trial court in its division of marital property because \u00a7 36-110 (a) provides that the beneficiary of a savings account trust acquires no legal interest in the funds on deposit until the trustee\u2019s death. Id., 322-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Furthermore, we noted in <em>Salvio </em>that such funds may be reached by the depositor\u2019s creditors during the depositor\u2019s lifetime, and by the depositor\u2019s creditors after the depositor\u2019s death if the depositor dies insolvent. Id., 320. Similarly, the depositor remains liable for the income tax on the interest earned by the funds, and the depositor\u2019s estate is liable for the federal estate and state succession taxes. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In <em>Salvio, </em>we adverted to the fact that \u201c[although there is no ... consensus on the right of a spouse to reach funds deposited in savings account trusts when computing an elective share of the depositor\u2019s estate, the prevailing view is that, since the decedent spouse exercised such complete power over the funds during his lifetime, the surviving spouse should be permitted to include them.\u201d Id., 321. Noting, however, that New York had by statute included trust savings accounts in the decedent spouse\u2019s estate, we also stated: \u201cThe issue has not yet been squarely addressed in Connecticut, although it is clear that \u2018neither husband nor wife acquires, by virtue of the marriage, any interest in the real or personal property of the other during that other\u2019s lifetime,\u2019 and \u2018either spouse may, in his lifetime, without the consent or knowledge of the other, make a valid gift or otherwise dispose of his property, to a third party.\u2019 <em>Cherniack </em>v. <em>Home National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>151 Conn. 367, 370, 198 A.2d 58 (1964); <em>see Hodge </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>178 Conn. 308, 314, 422 A.2d 280 (1979); Clark, \u2018The Recapture of Testamentary Substitutes to Preserve the Spouse\u2019s Elective Share: An Appraisal of Recent Statutory Reforms,\u2019 2 Conn. L. Rev. 513, 522 (1970).\u201d <em>Salvio </em>v. <em>Salvio, </em>supra, 321 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">This case, therefore, squarely presents the issue to which the court in <em>Salvio </em>referred but that it did not decide. The plaintiff argues that Connecticut has a strong public policy, reflected in General Statutes (Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to 1989) \u00a7 45-273a, now recodified at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-436 and 45a-437,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> against permitting a husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>to leave his widow destitute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying for specific authority on comment (e) of \u00a7 58 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts (1959),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the position taken by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Professors Scott and Fratcher,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and on what she claims is the pervasive trend in other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiff contends that the surviving spouse should, for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 36-110 (a) and 45-273a (b), be treated like a creditor of the decedent and like the spouse in the marital dissolution context, rather than like the sibling of the beneficiary of the trust savings account. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>We first note that most of the authorities that include such trust accounts in the decedent\u2019s' estate, including the dissent in this case, do so on the basis of an unstated premise: that the issue should be decided, not by interpretation of the applicable statutory provisions, but rather as a matter of policy in light of general common law and equitable principles. See, e.g., <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Michaels, </em>54 Ill. 2d 532, 301 N.E.2d 465 (1973); <em>Klosiewski </em>v. <em>Slovan Building &amp; Loan Assn., </em>247 Md. 82, 230 A.2d 285 (1967); <em>In re Estate of Jeruzal, </em>269 Minn. 183, 130 N.W.2d 473 (1964). We do not share that premise. In our view, whether a surviving spouse may treat such a trust as part of his or her intestate share is a question of statutory interpretation: whether such property is within the meaning of the phrase, \u201cthe intestate estate of the deceased,\u201d as used in \u00a7 45-273a (b). That statute is the sole source of, and provides the sole measurement of, the surviving spouse\u2019s right to inherit from the decedent. In order for the plaintiff to prevail on this claim, therefore, she must establish that the funds in the trust savings accounts are part of the decedent\u2019s \u201cintestate estate\u201d under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We do not believe that they are. Reading \u00a7 36-110 (a) and \u00a7 45-273a (b) together, as we must, we conclude that the legislature did not intend that valid trust savings accounts, established pursuant to \u00a7 36-110 (a), be considered part of a decedent\u2019s intestate estate for purposes of determining the surviving spouse\u2019s share of that estate under \u00a7 45-273a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">First, both the language of \u00a7 36-110 (a) and our interpretation of it in <em>Manulik </em>v. <em>Devilt, </em>supra, strongly suggest that such accounts pass according to their terms and according to the terms of \u00a7 36-110 (a), and that no exception was intended by the legislature for surviving spouses. The language of \u00a7 36-110 (a) is particularly definite. Unless the depositor has stated to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>trary, \u201cit shall be conclusively presumed that the depositor intends to create a trust . . . upon the following terms . . . (C) if the named beneficiary survives the depositor, the depositor\u2019s death shall terminate the trust and the moneys to the credit of the trust shall vest in the named beneficiary free and clear of the trust. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36-110 (a) (1). Furthermore, \u201cthe title of [the named beneficiary] to the moneys to the credit of such account and . . . the effect of . . . the presumptions contained in this subsection shall not be denied, abridged or in any way affected because such signed statement [of the depositor establishing the account] was not executed in accordance with, or otherwise fails to comply with, the laws of this state prescribing the requirements to effect a valid testamentary disposition of property or because of any absence of delivery or compliance with other requirements to effect a valid gift or transfer in trust.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36-110 (a) (2). We perceive no implied exception in this language, vesting title to the funds in a trust account in the named beneficiary, for cases in which the named beneficiary is someone other than the surviving spouse of an intestate decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">This conclusion is consistent with our construction of \u00a7 36-110 (a) in <em>Manulik </em>v. <em>Devitt, </em>supra. Although concededly we were not faced with a challenge mounted by a surviving spouse, in that case we read \u00a7 36-110 (a) as intended \u201cto <em>give full effect to a savings account trust </em>deposit despite the requirements of the Statute of Wills.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 667. We also stated that the statute was intended to attach \u201cspecific consequences\u201d to the creation of such a trust, and that such creation manifested the \u201cconclusively presumed intent\u201d of the settlor,, which should \u201cbe accorded full effect through the instrumentality of a \u2018statutory trust\u2019 . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 668. By transporting the proceeds of the trusts in this case into the decedent\u2019s intestate estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>for purposes of the plaintiffs share thereof, we would not be giving \u201cfull effect\u201d to the trusts, and would be contradicting the decedent\u2019s statutorily \u201cconclusively presumed intent\u201d that the proceeds go to the defendants. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Furthermore, if a decedent were to die intestate but were not survived by a spouse, the fiduciary of the intestate estate could not successfully require the named beneficiary of a \u00a7 36-110 (a) trust to disgorge its proceeds on the ground that they were properly part of the decedent\u2019s \u201cintestate estate\u201d under \u00a7 45-273a. The plaintiff, however, would in effect have us interpret the phrase \u201cintestate estate\u201d in \u00a7 45-273a to include the proceeds of such a trust depending on the identity of the claimant thereto: if the claimant is the surviving spouse, the phrase includes such a trust; if the claimant is anyone other than the surviving spouse, the phrase does not include such a trust. In the absence of clear legislative direction to do so, we decline to give different meanings to the same phrase in the same statute depending on the identity of the party claiming entitlement to the property described by such phrase. See <em>Red Rooster Construction Co. </em>v. <em>River Associates, Inc., </em>224 Conn. 563, 571, 620 A.2d 118 (1993); <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 517, 613 A.2d 748 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Moreover, in <em>Cherniack </em>v. <em>Home National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>151 Conn. 367, 368, 198 A.2d 58 (1964), the testator, without his wife\u2019s knowledge, had transferred the bulk of his estate to an inter vivos trust, reserving to himself the net income for his life and the powers of revocation and amendment, and providing for the trust assets to pass to his brothers upon his death. This court held that: (1) the trust was not invalid as an attempted testamentary disposition; id., 370; and (2) the transfer could not be set aside as fraudulent as to his widow because she \u201chad no right or interest in the property of the decedent during his lifetime.\u201d Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>371; see also <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>5 Conn. 316 (1824) (decedent executed deed in trust of all his real estate, to be delivered to his children upon his death; held not fraudulent as to decedent\u2019s widow\u2019s right of dower in decedent\u2019s real estate). Commentators have acknowledged other legal arrangements by which a Connecticut decedent may validly avoid his or her surviving spouse\u2019s intestate share.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The ready availability of these alternative arrangements further supports our conclusion that \u00a7 45-273a does not include a \u00a7 36-110 (a) savings account. Because a financially sophisticated decedent would have been able to take advantage of these arrangements with a minimum of loss of control and inconvenience, there is little reason to believe that the legislature intended \u00a7 45-273a to prevent the same ends from being accomplished by the less sophisticated means of such a trust account. Indeed, although in <em>Manulik </em>v. <em>Devitt, </em>supra, 668, we stated that \u201c\u00a7 36-110 gives effect to the intention of the depositor to make a \u2018poor man\u2019s will,\u2019 \u201d it is probably more accurate to describe such an account as an \u201cunsophisticated person\u2019s revocable trust.\u201d See <em>Cherniack </em>v. <em>Home National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Finally, our conclusion is buttressed by reference to \u00a7\u00a7 45a-436 and 45a-437. See footnote 5. Whereas \u00a7 45-273a covered a surviving spouse\u2019s elective share in lieu of that given by a will under subsection (a) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>a surviving spouse\u2019s intestate share under subsection (b), in 1990 the legislature, as part of a technical, non-substantive recodification of title 45, enacted Public Acts 1990, No. 90-146. Sections 9 and 10 of that public act recodified \u00a7 45-273a by separating out the surviving spouse\u2019s elective share into what is now \u00a7 45a-436, and the surviving spouse\u2019s intestate share into what is now \u00a7 45a-437.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Of particular significance is \u00a7 45a-436 (a), which provides in pertinent part that the \u201csurviving spouse may elect ... to take a statutory share of the real and personal property <em>passing under the will </em>of the deceased spouse. The \u2018statutory share\u2019 means a life estate of one-third in value of all the property <em>passing under the will, </em>real and personal, legally or equitably owned by the deceased spouse at the time of his or her death . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The emphasized language, which was not present in \u00a7 45-273a, was added by the 1990 recodification.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The legislative history, however, makes unmistakably clear that this recodification was nonsubstantive in nature, and that any changes in language were intended solely for the purposes of clarifying the preexisting meaning. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1990 Sess., pp. 417, 501, 545, 617-18, 681. Thus, we must regard that language as retroactively clarifying the meaning of \u00a7 45-273a (a). See <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 393, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993); <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 345-47, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">It is evident, therefore, that a surviving spouse\u2019s elective share in lieu of what he or she would take under a will does not include the proceeds of a \u00a7 36-110 (a) account, because those proceeds cannot be regarded as \u201cpassing under the will\u201d within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u00a7 45a-436 (a). General Statutes \u00a7 45a-437 (a), regarding the surviving spouse\u2019s intestate share, retained the parallel language\u2014\u201cany part of the property, real or personal, legally or equitably owned by the decedent at the time of his or her death\u201d\u2014that defined the decedent\u2019s \u201cintestate estate\u201d under \u00a7 45-273a (b). That same parallel language defines the decedent\u2019s testate estate under \u00a7 45a-436 (a). This recodification strongly suggests, therefore, that the phrase, \u201cintestate estate,\u201d as used in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 45-273a and General Statutes \u00a7 45a-437 (a), refers to property owned by the decedent in such form that it would, if willed, pass under such will. This would exclude the proceeds of a \u00a7 36-110 (a) savings account.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim challenges the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the transfer of the real property. The plaintiff claims that the transfer was not a valid inter vivos gift to the defendants because: (1) there was no conveyance of a present interest; and (2) the findings were not in accord with the substantial weight of the evidence and ignored the relevant evidence of the decedent\u2019s intent. The plaintiff argues that \u201c[i]t is clear [the decedent\u2019s] intent was neither to part with control of the property nor to pass title immediately and irrevocably to the [defendants]. It is likewise clear that the conveyance was made to become operative and create interests in the [defendants] only upon [the decedent\u2019s] death.\u201d This claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u201cWhen an estate is a party, the burden is on the person claiming the gift to prove the claim by clear and satisfactory proof. <em>Kukanskis </em>v. <em>Jasut, </em>169 Conn. 29, 32, 362 A.2d 898 (1975). The question of whether a gift inter vivos or causa mortis has been made is within the exclusive province of the court. Id., 32-33; <em>Bell </em>v.

The determination of whether a gift has been made is not reviewable unless the conclusion of the court is one which cannot reasonably be made. <em>Kriedel </em>v. <em>Krampitz, </em>137 Conn. 532, 534, 79 A.2d 181 (1951).

New Britain, </em>148 Conn. 349, 352, 170 A.2d 891 (1961). This court does not try issues of fact or pass upon the credibility of witnesses. <em>Soneco Service, Inc. v.

With respect to a gift of real property, the fact that the donor retains control of the property after recording and delivering the deed does not necessarily defeat an otherwise valid gift. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>49 Conn. 570 (1882); <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it; <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 479, 483, 533 A.2d 1211 (1987); or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Kulesza, </em>197 Conn. 101, 105, 495 A.2d 1074 (1985), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S. Ct. 525, 92 L. Ed. 746 (1948). Because it is the trial court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, we give great deference to its findings. <em>Rostain </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>214 Conn. 713, 716, 573 A.2d 710 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency </em>v. <em>Landmark Investment Group, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 703, 708, 590 A.2d 968 (1991); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>sion on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>223 Conn. 450, 458, 612 A.2d 1217 (1992). Gauged by this standard, the trial court\u2019s findings must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The trial court found that the decedent had intended to vest title to the real property in the defendants immediately and irrevocably. This critical finding was supported by the following evidence. At the time of the conveyance, the decedent told the defendants that it was his intention that they have the property then, in accordance with his promise to their mother. After the decedent executed and recorded the deed, it was not mailed back to him but was mailed to the defendant Julia Lawrence. The decedent\u2019s continued control of the property thereafter was with the permission of the defendants. Between 1968 and 1991, Julia Lawrence and her husband made repairs to the house. Indeed, there was evidence that, in 1969, the defendants acted consistently with the decedent\u2019s intent to vest title to the property in them: they exercised ownership of the properly by serving the decedent and the plaintiff with notices to quit the premises, although evidently the defendants never actually filed a summary process action. Finally, the plaintiff had told tenants who complained about the condition of the building that they should contact Julia Lawrence. There is, therefore, ample evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s findings, and we cannot say that we are left with a definite and firm conviction that there has been a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s final claim is that the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the joint survivorship account is clearly erroneous. The plaintiff argues that the court could not find, as it did, that the decedent intended to vest ownership of the account in Paul Dalia because, contrary to the court\u2019s finding that the decedent gave Paul Dalia the keys to his safety deposit box as he lay dying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>November 13,1989, the bank records indicate that the decedent had closed out the box on September 28,1989. Although the plaintiff\u2019s characterization of the documentary evidence regarding the safety deposit box is accurate, we are not persuaded that this slight inaccuracy in the trial court\u2019s finding is sufficient to undermine its conclusion regarding the survivorship account.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The plaintiff does not dispute that the ownership of the survivorship account is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 36-3.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nor does she dispute that, pursuant to this statute, she had the burden of persuading the trial court, by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d that the creation of the account by the decedent did <em>not </em>evidence his intention \u201cto vest title to such deposit or account, including all additions and increments thereto, in [the] survivor . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36-3 (a); see <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cavallaro, </em>2 Conn. App. 622, 626, 481 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>101 (1984) (plaintiff required, under \u00a7 36-3, to prove by clear and convincing evidence that survivorship account was not valid inter vivos gift). The gist of the plaintiffs claim is that the conflict between Paul Dalia\u2019s testimony regarding his conversation with the decedent on November 13,1989, and the documentary evidence rendered his \u201ctestimony as [to] the purported conversation and his actions thereafter . . . completely and wholly incredible.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">First, as the defendants point out, Paul Dalia did not testify that he took the passbook from the safety deposit box on November 13,1989; he testified that he closed out the survivorship account on that date. Thus, although the trial court\u2019s finding is inaccurate in this regard, the gist of that finding is accurate, namely, that on November 13,1989, the decedent relinquished full control of the passbook to Paul Dalia, and that Paul Dalia thereafter acted consistently with that relinquishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Second, the trial court specifically found that the plaintiff had failed to convince it by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory presumption created by \u00a7 36-3 was rebutted. There is nothing in this record that would justify our upsetting that factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Indeed, in order to pursue this litigation, she was required to appeal in forma pauperis. The majority\u2019s conclusion that trust savings accounts established by a decedent pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 36-110 (a) (Totten trust) can defeat the rights of a surviving spouse to her statutory share of the funds in those accounts is <em>contrary </em>to the public policy of this state; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-436 and 45a-437;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>contrary </em>to the prevailing view acknowledged by this court in <em>Salvio </em>v. <em>Salvio, </em>186 Conn. 311, 441 A.2d 190 (1982); <em>contrary </em>to the public policy of the majority of jurisdictions that have ruled on this issue;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>contrary </em>to the Restatement of Trusts; 1 Restatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 58, comment e;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>contrary </em>to the leading treatise on trust law; IA A.

See, e.g., M. Wenig, \u201cThe Marital Property Law of Connecticut: Past, Present and Future,\u201d 1990 Wis. L. Rev. 807, 855 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It troubles me that the majority fails to protect poor widows and widowers, yet would not hesitate to set aside the trust for creditors of the spouse\u2019s estate. See <em>Salvio </em>v. <em>Salvio, </em>supra, 320 (\u201c[i]t is generally accepted that the funds on deposit may be reached by the depositor\u2019s creditors during his lifetime and, if he dies insolvent, after his death\u201d). The majority apparently supports this inequity.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Indeed, Chief Justice Peters in <em>Salvio </em>v. <em>Salvio, </em>supra, 320-21, wrote for a unanimous court the following: \u201cAlthough there is no such consensus on the right of a spouse to reach funds deposited in savings account trusts when computing an elective share of the depositor\u2019s estate, <em>the prevailing view </em>is that, since the decedent spouse exercised such complete power over the funds during his lifetime, the surviving spouse should be permitted to include them.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">It is clear that a person has a right to make a gift of property during his or her lifetime, even though the gift deprives the surviving spouse of his or her statutory share. Nevertheless, if the decedent, after making the purported gift, retained complete and absolute dominion and control over the property, the surviving spouse cannot be deprived of his or her statutory share in the property. \u201c Tf the disposition by the husband be bona fide, and no right is reserved to him, then, though made to defeat the claim of the wife, it will be good against her, because an act cannot be denounced as fraudulent which the law authorizes to be done. But if it be a mere device or contrivance, by which the husband, not parting with the absolute dominion over the property during his life, seeks, at his death, to deny his widow that share of his personal estate which the law assigns to her, then it will be ineffectual against her.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sturgis </em>v. <em>Citizens National Bank, </em>152 Md. 654, 659-60, 137 A. 378 (1927), quoting <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>1 Md. Ch. 337 (1848); see also <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Michaels, </em>54 Ill. 2d 532, 537-38, 301 N.E.2d 465 (1973); <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Whittington, </em>205 Md. 1, 11, 106 A.2d 72 (1953); <em>Mushaw </em>v. <em>Mushaw, </em>183 Md. 511, 519, 39 A.2d 465 (1944). The present case is even more compelling because the decedent treated the property as if it were his own up until the time of death. The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>sets us back more than one hundred years to a time when a decedent could elect to deprive the spouse of any part of his or her estate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the decedent had intended to vest title to the real property in the defendants immediately and irrevocably. I recognize that the determination of whether a gift has been made is \u201c \u2018not reviewable unless the conclusion drawn by the trier is one which cannot reasonably be made\u2019 <em>Kriedel </em>v. <em>Krampitz, </em>137 Conn. 532, 534, 79 A.2d 181 (1951); and that we must give deference to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Rostain </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>214 Conn. 713, 716, 573 A.2d 710 (1990). Nevertheless, our deference does not preclude review entirely, nor does it give the trial court carte blanche. Here, the defendants had the burden of proving by <em>dear and satisfactory evidence </em>that the decedent had made an inter vivos gift of the house to his children. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Schull, </em>184 Conn. 252, 255, 439 A.2d 975 (1981). \u201cClear and satisfactory\u201d evidence is the equivalent to \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence. C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 4.4.1 (b), pp. 73-74. This standard of proof is sustained only if the evidence \u201cinduces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief that the facts asserted are <em>highly probably true, </em>that the probability that they are true or exist is <em>substantially greater </em>than the probability that they are false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>or do not exist.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lopinto </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>185 Conn. 527, 534, 441 A. 2d 151 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We have long held that a gift inter vivos is valid, but one causa mortis is not. \u201cOne may transfer property in such a way that interests in it will arise only at his death, and he may transfer it in contemplation of his death, in lieu of making a will; but to be valid such transfers must convey a present interest. . . . One may not make a valid transfer of property where the intent is not to convey a present interest, but solely to create interests which will arise at death, except in compliance with the requirements of the Statute of Wills; and any such attempted transfer is void. ... If this were not so it would lie in the power of any person at any time, by making conveyances of property, to circumvent the statute. The intent of the transferor, whether to convey a present interest or to make a disposition of his property to take effect only at his death, is the controlling element in determining the validity of a transfer. . . . That a transfer of property was executed and delivered with intent to make a testamentary disposition of it, may be shown by parol evidence; this would not be to vary the terms of the instrument but to establish the underlying illegality of the transaction.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Morgillo, </em>127 Conn. 161, 167, 14 A.2d 724 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The undisputed facts concerning the twenty-two years after the execution of the deed in 1968 prevent a finding that the defendants sustained their burden by <em>clear and convincing evidence </em>that the decedent had made a valid gift of the house to the defendants. The property was a home to the decedent and the plaintiff for twenty-two years. They maintained the property by \u201cdoing repairs, hiring and paying contractors, paying real property taxes, insurance for the house, sewer use charges, water use charges. [They] rented the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>apartment unit and collected the rents, reported the income on their joint tax returns, took deductions on their tax returns, negotiated leases with the tenants, [and] dealt with tenant issues.\u201d In addition, when the decedent took out a building permit, he listed himself as the owner of the home. The decedent held himself out as the owner of the property to tenants and neighbors. Indeed, the decedent stated to his children that they would receive the property upon his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">I would hold that the defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that there had been a valid inter vivos transfer of the home in 1968 and would order that the home is part of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Because General Statutes \u00a7 36-3 places the burden on the plaintiff to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the decedent did not intend to make a gift of the survivorship savings account, and because the plaintiff neither challenges the statute nor claims that the public policy of the state is to make the deposit subject to the surviving spouse\u2019s rights under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-436 and 45a-437,1 concur in the result of part III.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\"> See footnote 5 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\"> See <em>Montgomery v.
