The state attempted to increase the rent on all of its housing, and thereby reduce the cost of this benefit. The increased rent was applied unilaterally to the defendants, who as managerial employees have no collective bargaining rights. The state was required, however, to negotiate the increase with collective bargaining unit employees, and at least one bargaining unit took the matter to arbitration and won a lower rent increase. The issue to be resolved is whether this difference in outcomes, resulting from collective bargaining law, constitutes a form of discrimination within the jurisdiction and remedial authority of the review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The facts, as found by the review board, are as follows. The defendant Marietta G. Sonido is a state employed psychiatrist and medical director at Fairfield Hills Hospital (hospital), a state hospital for the mentally ill. The defendant Okhikadu Devarajan is also employed by the state as chief of psychiatry at the hospital. The defendants lived for a number of years in state owned rental housing on the hospital grounds. Their rents were heavily subsidized by the state as a recruitment and retention incentive, so that the defendants were able to pay rents that were considerably below the contemporary rental market value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>housing. The defendants are managerial employees, and thus, unlike many of their physician and psychiatrist colleagues at the hospital, the defendants have no state employee collective bargaining rights. General Statutes \u00a7 5-270 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In 1987, the state reappraised its state employee housing rental rates to reflect the prevailing market rate. The commissioner of administrative services ordered that all state employees occupying state housing, including managerial and collective bargaining employees, pay rent at 70 percent of the appraised market value, to be phased in over a three year period. The commissioner unilaterally applied the new rent levels to the defendants, resulting in a 797 percent increase in Devarajan\u2019s biweekly rent from $51 in 1987 to a completely phased in rent of $402 in 1990, including utilities. Sonido received a 669 percent increase, from $77 paid biweekly in 1987 to a completely phased in rent of $515 in 1990, including utilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The review board found that these increases, in essence, constituted a pay cut for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The commissioner was not able to apply higher rents unilaterally to bargaining unit employees, due to collective bargaining law which places a duty upon employers to bargain in good faith with the representatives of the employees prior to instituting modifications in terms and conditions of employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>bargaining units acquiesced in the increases, the Health Care (P-1) collective bargaining unit took the matter to arbitration and won much smaller rent increases, amounting to a total increase of 52 percent over a three year period.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Citing the disparity between rental increases for managerial employees and collective bargaining employees, the defendants filed grievances in November, 1988. General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 5-202.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>defendants\u2019 supervisor and appointing authority waived the first two steps of the preliminary review procedure; General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 5-202 (g) and (h); and the office of labor relations of the department of administrative services denied the grievances at the third and final stage of the preliminary review procedure. Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>eral Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 5-202 (i).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants appealed to the review board claiming that the disparity in rental increases constituted a form of discrimination within the review board\u2019s remedial authority under \u00a7 5-202 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Before the review board, the state argued that the rental increases did not constitute discrimination within the review board\u2019s jurisdiction. The review board held in favor of the defendants, finding discrimination within the meaning of \u00a7 5-202 (a) on the basis of the different treatment between managerial employees and collective bargaining employees. The review board defined \u201cdiscrimination\u201d as \u201ctreating similarly-situated persons differently on a matter of importance.\u201d The review board concluded that the defendants and the health care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>collective bargaining employees were similarly situated, and stated that while \u201c[pjerfect equality in compensation\u201d between managers and nonmanagerial employees is not required, a \u201cgross differential\u201d between the two groups is unacceptable. The review board found such a gross differential and ordered restitution of part of the difference between the rents paid by the defendants and the rents paid by the employees in the health care collective bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The plaintiffs appealed to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-202 <em>(l) </em>and 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court sustained the appeal, holding that the review board had exceeded its statutory authority because the disparities complained of did not constitute \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We now affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Section 5-202 (a) delimits the jurisdiction of the review board. It provides that \u201c[a]ny employee who is not included in any collective bargaining unit of state employees and who has achieved a permanent appointment as defined in subsection (r) of section 5-196 may appeal to the employees\u2019 review board if he or she . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>is demoted, suspended or dismissed, <em>or is aggrieved as a result of alleged discrimination . . . </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The defendants rely on the \u201cdiscrimination\u201d clause of \u00a7 5-202 (a) as the basis for the review board\u2019s jurisdiction over their appeal. The discrimination that the defendants allege is that managerial employees must pay 70 percent of the market value of employee housing rent, while at least some nonmanagerial employees covered by collective bargaining agreements pay a substantially lower rent. Section 5-202 does not define the term \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d nor does General Statutes \u00a7 5-196, the definitional section of the State Personnel Act. We are therefore presented with an issue of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The purpose of statutory construction is to determine the intent of the legislature. <em>Police Department </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>225 Conn. 297, 303 n.7, 622 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 194, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989). Ordinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. <em>Police Department </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 300; <em>Crocetto </em>v. <em>Lynn Development Corporation, </em>223 Conn. 376, 381, 612 A.2d 1212 (1992). \u201c[A]n <em>agency\u2019s </em>factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts.\u201d <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 262, 579 A.2d 505 (1990). This case, however, presents a pure question of law, and therefore \u201cinvokes a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d Id., 263; <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 718, 546 A.2d 830 (1988). Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>thermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny, as in this case, the agency is not entitled to special deference. <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>210 Conn. 349, 357, 554 A.2d 1089 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Section 5-202 is part of the State Personnel Act (personnel act), codified in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-193 through 5-269. \u201cWe are obligated ... to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter.\u201d <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Siting Council, </em>215 Conn. 474, 482-83, 576 A.2d 510 (1990). This is because of the presumption that the legislature intended to create a harmonious body of law. <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>192 Conn. 581, 589, 473 A.2d 782 (1984). We are therefore directed to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 5-227, also found within the personnel act, which provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person in the classified service or seeking admission thereto may be appointed, demoted or dismissed or be in any way favored or <em>discriminated against because of his political opinions or affiliations or as the result of a discriminatory employment practice as defined in section 4-6a-51.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 5-227 is not expressly set out as a definition for \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d and the venerable policy expressed in \u00a7 5-227 predates the creation of the review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>board by at least thirty-two years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nevertheless, this court presumes that a law was enacted in view of existing relevant statutes and that the legislature intended them to be read together so as to constitute one consistent body of law. <em>Shortt </em>v. <em>New Milford Police Department, </em>212 Conn. 294, 302, 562 A.2d 7 (1989). This principle is particularly applicable in this case since General Statutes \u00a7 5-194 of the personnel act states in relevant part: \u201cThis chapter shall be so construed and administered as to provide a <em>uniform </em>and equitable system of personnel administration of employees in the state service. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The language of \u00a7\u00a7 5-202 and 5-227, read together, indicate that \u00a7 5-202 was intended to establish jurisdiction in the review board for the types of discrimination that had earlier been set out in \u00a7 5-227. Under \u00a7 5-227, managerial employees may seek relief from the review board for claims of discrimination solely on the bases of political considerations or the forbidden grounds of a \u201cdiscriminatory employment practice\u201d as defined in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 46a-51. \u201cDiscriminatory employment practice\u201d is defined in \u00a7 46a-51 (7),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and pertains to certain types of employment discrimination. Section 46a-51 (7) does not prohibit discrimination between managerial employees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>employees covered by a collective bargaining contract. We conclude, therefore, that the review board\u2019s authority to redress discrimination does not extend to a claim based upon differences between compensation of managerial employees and collective bargaining employees that resulted from the arbitral process.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Our conclusion is bolstered by an examination of the purposes underlying the statutory scheme of the personnel act. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>225 Conn. 177, 182, 621 A.2d 1322 (1993). The purposes of that act and its statutory predecessors are to establish a system of public employment based on merit principles, eliminate political patronage, personal favoritism and discrimination against disfavored political and religious factions, and thereby prevent governmental corruption. <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>175 Conn. 127, 131, 135, 394 A.2d 731 (1978); <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Appeal Board, </em>170 Conn. 668, 671, 368 A.2d 20 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The statutory predecessors to the personnel act attempted to further the same policy of merit based employment, and also sought to combat the same evils of political patronage and religious discrimination. See, e.g., General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 2047 (a predecessor to \u00a7 5-227, barring employment examination questions relating to political and religious opinions and affiliations). This court, in addressing a municipal civil service ordinance, described the background of these statutes as follows: \u201cSoon after the formation of political parties in this country, the maxim \u2018[t]o the victor belong the spoils\u2019 became current and its wide application gave birth to the so-called \u2018spoils system.\u2019 This in turn resulted in political scandals which have rocked the nation to its foundation. In an attempt to remedy this condition, various forms of merit systems have been adopted aimed to obtain qualified appointees and to ensure them a tenure of office free from interfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ence on political or religious grounds.\u201d <em>State ex rel. McNamara </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>128 Conn. 585, 588, 24 A.2d 846 (1942). Subsequent cases have made clear that these purposes undergird the personnel act. For example, in <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>supra, 135, this court stated that the intent of the personnel act was in part to \u201celiminate as far as practicable the element of partisanship and personal favoritism in making appointments.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See also <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Appeal Board, </em>supra, 674 (personnel act affords state employees \u201cample and laudable protection against the evils of preference\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). On the basis of this history, it stands to reason that the meaning of the term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in the review board jurisdictional statute, \u00a7 5-202 (a), is limited by the types of discrimination prohibited in \u00a7 5-227.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Finally, a review of the legislative history of the personnel act, and our examination of the relationship between that act and the state employee collective bargaining law; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-270 through 5-280; also leads us to reject the view that the review board has the authority to compare the compensation of managerial employees and collective bargaining employees and remedy a perceived unfair differential. Before 1979, the review board\u2019s jurisdiction, as set out by \u00a7 5-202 (a), included grievances complaining of \u201calleged discrimination\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cunfair treatment.\u201d The provision was amended in 1979 by No. 79-621 of the 1979 Public Acts, however, and while \u201calleged discrimination\u201d was left in, \u201cunfair treatment\u201d was eliminated as a ground for agency jurisdiction. The 1979 amendment also amended \u00a7 5-200 (r) by vesting in the commissioner of administrative services discretionary authority to compensate managerial employees with employment benefits that are equal to those of collec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>tive bargaining employees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These amendments were part of a comprehensive overhaul of the personnel act. It is clear from the legislative history that the 1979 amendments were intended, inter alia, to harmonize the personnel act and the public employee collective bargaining law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The two statutes together create a scheme under which the compensation of collective bargaining employees is to be determined by the bargaining and arbitral process, and jurisdiction over questions of unfair treatment of managerial employees is transferred from the review board to the commissioner of administrative services. It is the commissioner, not the review board, that has the discretionary authority to compare and equalize the compensation of collective bargaining and managerial employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Moreover, we have upheld different treatment of managerial and unionized employees with respect to collective bargaining rights. <em>State Management Assn. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>204 Conn. 746, 529 A.2d 1276 (1987). In <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>we reasoned that managers have the responsibility to decide major personnel decisions and formulate agency policies, and therefore managers are differently situated than nonmanagerial employees and supervisors. These responsibilities give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>managers prestige, autonomy and managerial authority that is not enjoyed by other employees. On the other hand, because managers administer collective bargaining agreements; id., 759; they have no bargaining or organizational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We conclude that disparate treatment of managerial employees and employees subject to collective bargaining is not a form of discrimination within the review board\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 5-202 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-5\"> Although the employees\u2019 review board is the named defendant in this appeal, it has not submitted a brief or otherwise actively participated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\"> The plaintiffs are the state department of administrative services, the state of Connecticut, and the state of Connecticut department of mental health.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\"> The rent increases for Devarajan were phased in as follows. In 1987 the rent was $51 every two weeks; the rent was subsequently increased to $173 in 1988, to $288 in 1989, and then to $402 in 1990 respectively. The rent for Sonido\u2019s housing in 1987 was $77; rent was subsequently increased to $216 in 1988, to $366 in 1989, and then to $515 in 1990 respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\"> The commissioner of administrative services has the authority to modify unilaterally the benefits and compensation of state employees. General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 5-200 (i), (q) and (r), recodified as \u00a7 5-200 (k), (o) and (p) respectively. This authority is limited, however, by the state employee collective bargaining law. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-270 through 5-280. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>this law, the state has the duty to bargain with state employees who are represented by an employee organization over questions of \u201cwages, hours and other conditions of employment.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5-272 (c). The result of the duty to bargain in this context is that the state may not unilaterally alter the compensation or employment benefits of union represented employees without first bargaining to impasse. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-272 (a) (4) and (c), 5-276a (c); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 120-21, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991). Managerial employees, however, have no collective bargaining rights; General Statutes \u00a7 5-270 (b); and their compensation may be modified unilaterally without prior bargaining.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b692-9\"> As an example, the review board noted that one grade 4 psychiatrist lived in an identical residence, in the same duplex, as Devarajan but because he was a supervisor, rather than a manager like Devarajan, he enjoyed union representation and received the smaller rent increase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b692-10\"> The relevant subsections of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 5-202 read as follows: \u201c(a) Any employee who is not included in any collective bargaining unit of state employees and who has achieved a permanent appointment as defined in subsection (r) of section 5-196 may appeal to the employees\u2019 review board if he or she receives an unsatisfactory performance evaluation or is demoted, suspended or dismissed, or is aggrieved as a result of alleged discrimination, or unsafe or unhealthy working conditions or violations involving the interpretation and application of a specific state personnel statute or regulation.

Because we determine that the term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in \u00a7 5-202 (a) does not include disparate treatment between managerial employees and collective bargaining employees, we do not reach the issue of application of the phrase \u201ccompensation for duties\u201d in \u00a7 5-202 (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b697-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 5-227 provides: \u201cNo person in the classified service or seeking admission thereto may be appointed, demoted or dismissed or be in any way favored or discriminated against because of his political opinions or affiliations or as the result of a discriminatory employment practice as deilned in section 46a-51.
