The defendant appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from that judgment, claiming entitlement to a new trial because the trial court improperly: (1) instructed the jury to draw a conclusive presumption; (2) complied only partially with a jury request to rehear testimony; (3) denied his motion for a mistrial; (4) denied his motions during jury selection to excuse certain venirepersons for cause and for an additional peremptory challenge; (5) sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict; and (6) instructed the jury concerning the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The jury could have reasonably found the following facts. At approximately 5:30 a.m., on August 25,1990, New Haven police officer Michael Quinn responded to a 911 emergency telephone call in which the caller reported having been awakened by \u201cblood curdling screams\u201d for help coming from the area of the Edge of the Woods store in New Haven. The caller also said that he had heard a woman pleading \u201cDon't do it to me.\u201d Quinn drove behind the store, illuminated the area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>with his spotlight and observed the defendant standing over the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s trousers and underwear were lowered below his knees; the victim was \u201cscreaming hysterically.\u201d Quinn ordered the defendant to halt, but the defendant pulled up his pants and fled. Quinn exited the cruiser and pursued the defendant on foot. Because Quinn was familiar with the area and knew that an alley into which the defendant had run exited on Sherman Avenue, he decided not to scale fences but rather to run around the store so that he could intercept the defendant. Although Quinn had lost sight of the defendant for approximately thirty seconds before apprehending him, Quinn was certain that he had apprehended the person whom he had observed standing over the victim. Quinn walked the defendant to the rear of the store where the victim positively identified the defendant as the perpetrator of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Brian Donnelly, another New Haven police officer who had been dispatched in response to the 911 call, found the victim, slumped on the ground and crying hysterically, and summoned medical assistance and hospital transport for her. She had \u201cmassive injuries to [her] head,\u201d and her swollen and bleeding face had been beaten \u201calmost . . . beyond recognition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The defendant, a stranger to the victim, had followed her along Edgewood Avenue. He had then approached her, grabbed her hands, picked her up, carried her behind the store and thrown her to the ground. The victim had attempted to resist and the defendant had punched her in the face numerous times, choked her and threatened that he would kill her if she continued to resist and scream. The defendant had then ripped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>off the victim\u2019s slacks and underpants, had pulled down his own trousers and had forced the victim to engage in vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The medical and scientific testimony, based on observations of the victim and laboratory examinations of physical evidence, was consistent with these facts. On the morning of the incident, Margaret Alexander, a resident in obstetrics-gynecology at St. Raphael\u2019s Hospital, secured from the victim a history of the events that had resulted in her traumatic injuries, conducted a physical examination in order to locate evidence of trauma, laceration or assault, and proceeded through the Sirchie sex crimes kit protocol.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Sanders Hawkins, the chief toxicologist at the state department of health services, conducted tests on clothing of the defendant and the victim. The defendant\u2019s T-shirt contained semen stains and his jacket contained traces of blood. The victim\u2019s jacket and shirt tested positive for traces of her own blood. The victim\u2019s vaginal and anal smears contained spermatozoa, and a vaginal swab taken from the victim contained seminal acid phosphatase.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury to draw a conclusive presumption and thereby removed from the jury\u2019s consideration an element of the offense of kidnapping in the first degree, in violation of the defendant\u2019s federal and state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>constitutional rights to a fair trial as guaranteed by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the course of its instructions, the trial court stated: \u201cIf the acts complained of were accompanied by the use of force or violence no further proof is required to establish the lack of consent on the victim\u2019s part.\u201d The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction relieved the state of the burden of proving the element of lack of consent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant did not object to the court\u2019s instruction at trial. We therefore analyze this unpreserved claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">\u201cA mandatory presumption instructs the jury that it must infer the presumed fact if the State proves cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tain predicate facts. ... A mandatory presumption violates the due process clause if it relieves the state of the burden of proving an essential element of the offense . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>199 Conn. 30, 36, 505 A.2d 699 (1986). The defendant argues that the instruction in this case violated the <em>Sandstrom </em>doctrine; <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 517-24, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); thereby rendering \u201cirrelevant the evidence on the issue because the jury may have relied upon the presumption rather than upon that evidence.\u201d <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>460 U.S. 73, 85, 103 S. Ct. 969, 74 L. Ed. 2d 823 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim, we assume, without deciding, that the challenged instruction constituted a <em>Sandstrom </em>violation. This assumption, however, \u201cdoes not end the inquiry because such an error is harmless if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cerilli, </em>222 Conn. 556, 584, 610 A.2d 1130 (1992). \u201cWhen the verdict of guilty reached in a case in which <em>Sandstrom </em>error was committed is correct beyond a reasonable doubt, reversal of the conviction does nothing to promote the interest that the rule serves.\u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 580, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 92 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Upon review of the entire record, we conclude that the assumed instructional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence of the victim\u2019s lack of consent to the abduction was overwhelming and undisputed. The jury heard testimony that: (1) the perpetrator was not known to the victim; (2) the victim had cried out \u201cblood curdling\u201d screams of \u201cHelp me,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t do it to me\u201d and \u201cWhy are you doing it to me\u201d; (3) the victim had attempted to escape from the perpetrator by kicking, fighting and screaming; (4) the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>petrator had severely beaten the victim; and (5) officer Quinn saw the perpetrator standing over the traumatized, injured victim, thereby limiting the victim\u2019s liberty to move.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These facts compel the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that, in the absence of the assumably erroneous instruction, the jury would have concluded that the victim did not consent. Consequently, the defendant has not satisfied the fourth prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The defendant next claims that his right to a fair trial was impaired because the trial court abused its discretion by complying only partially with a request by the jury to rehear testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">During its deliberations, the jury requested to hear again \u201cDoctor Alexander\u2019s testimony concerning the examination of [the victim].\u201d The defendant contended, however, that all of Alexander\u2019s testimony should be read back to the jury. He argued that, because the adjective \u201cphysical\u201d had not modified \u201cexamination\u201d in the jury\u2019s request, the trial court should have had read back, not only testimony concerning the physical examination, but also the history that Alexander had taken from the victim prior to conducting the physical examination and the Sirchie sex crimes kit protocol. Specifically, the defendant stressed that the jurors should again hear Alexander\u2019s testimony that the victim had described the perpetrator of the assault as \u201ca <em>short </em>black man\u201d and had alleged that \u201che [had] raped her with <em>anal </em>penetration\u201d; (emphasis added); because he claimed that the victim\u2019s statements to Alexander conflicted with the victim\u2019s own testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>judge conferred with counsel and then told the jury that he had decided \u201cto read what I think it is that you want. If you want a more expansive reading kindly caucus among yourselves and indicate that to me.\u201d Alexander\u2019s testimony concerning her physical findings was thereupon read to the jury and the trial court reminded the jury that other portions of the Alexander testimony were available and could be read. The jury, however, asked for no further testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">\u201cNo good reason occurs to us why a jury may not, at times during . . . the consideration of cases before them, be permitted ... to have read to them parts of the official court stenographer\u2019s shorthand notes of the testimony .... This entire matter of causing the stenographer\u2019s notes to be so read . . . must rest, to a great extent, in the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rubaka, </em>82 Conn. 59, 67-68, 72 A. 566 (1909); see Practice Book \u00a7 863; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>171 Conn. 47, 58-59, 368 A.2d 184 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>10 Conn. App. 697, 703, 525 A.2d 535 (1987), aff\u2019d, 207 Conn. 191, 540 A.2d 370 (1988). \u201cWe cannot conclude, as the defendant [argues], that the trial court was required as a matter of law to replay more of the witnesses\u2019 testimony than the jury believed it needed to rehear in order to reach a verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>223 Conn. 41, 48, 612 A.2d 749 (1992). We find no merit in this claim of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant his motion for a mistrial deprived him of a fair trial, as guaranteed by the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant contends that a trial court reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>him as \u201cthe prisoner\u201d was so prejudicial that it undermined the presumption of innocence to which he was entitled. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The defendant properly preserved this claim for appeal. \u201cEstablished principles of law govern the granting of a motion for a mistrial. The general rule in this state is that a mistrial should be granted only when it is apparent to the court that some occurrence during the trial has so prejudiced a party that he can no longer receive a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 25, 438 A.2d 867 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 143, 422 A.2d 749 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1013, 100 S. Ct. 661, 62 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1980). The trial court enjoys wide discretion in deciding whether a mistrial is warranted; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nowakowski, </em>188 Conn. 620, 624, 452 A.2d 938 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>supra; and its decision will be reversed on appeal only if it is established that this discretion has been abused.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 264, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Following the direct testimony of the victim, the trial court, having decided that it was appropriate to recess for the day, provided the customary cautionary instructions to the jury and then stated: \u201cOkay, with that I will see you back here tomorrow morning at ten o\u2019clock. I\u2019m advising counsel I want everybody here including <em>the prisoner, </em>Mr. Sheriff, here at ten so we can kick off right then. Thank you very much.\u201d (Emphasis added.) After the jury had exited, the defendant moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion but immediately offered to provide a curative instruction. The defendant asked to be allowed to ponder overnight the potential ameliorative and exacerbating effects of such an instruction. The next morning the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>offered to admonish the jurors \u201cthat I had inadvertently and mistakenly referred to [the defendant] as the prisoner and to ask them to strike that from their minds and memories. In addition thereto, I am going to give . . . an admonition that obviously the defendant is presumed to be innocent and anything that I may have said should not be used in any way against him. I\u2019m in your hands. What would you like to do?\u201d The defendant declined the curative instruction and argued that \u201cby saying the word \u2018prisoner\u2019 you\u2019re saying he\u2019s presumed to be guilty\u201d and that the jury would not \u201caccept the court\u2019s previous instructions on the presumption of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\u201cNot every reference to a defendant\u2019s pretrial incarceration is grounds for a mistrial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>176 Conn. 367, 371-74, 407 A.2d 1001 (1978). . . . There is nothing sacrosanct about a defendant\u2019s pretrial incarceration.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 129, 496 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1985). The jurors had been questioned during voir dire concerning their predisposition to believe that the defendant was guilty simply because he had been arrested. They therefore knew that the defendant had been arrested and that, at some point, he must have been in police custody. The information concerning the criminal allegations against the defendant had also been read to the jury. It certainly could not have surprised the jury, therefore, to have heard the defendant referred to as \u201cthe prisoner\u201d and, if the reference registered with the jury at all, its meaning would in all likelihood have been ambiguous. Moreover, the court provided both preliminary and final instructions concerning the presumption of innocence that the jury is presumed to have followed. Included in those instructions was an admonition that no inference was to be drawn from the defendant\u2019s arrest. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>210 Conn. 315, 332-33, 554 A.2d 1080 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The trial court, in its discretion, concluded that, under all the circumstances, its single remark was within the healing power of a curative instruction and did not require the drastic response of a mistrial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 510, 518 A.2d 388 (1986). We are unpersuaded that this isolated reference to the defendant as \u201cthe prisoner\u201d in the overall context of carefully crafted instructions and overwhelming evidence of guilt infected the trial with unfairness and contributed to the verdict. See <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S. Ct. 2464, 91 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 508, 590 A.2d 901 (1991). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial and that its denial did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The defendant next claims that he was deprived of his constitutional rights to a fair trial by an impartial jury and to due process of law, as guaranteed by the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by article fourth of the amendments to the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-82b, 54-82f, 54-82g and 54-82h and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 843 and 847 through 849. The defendant\u2019s claim rests on the allegedly prejudicial effects of the trial court\u2019s rulings on his challenges for cause directed to certain venirepersons and its ruling denying his request for an additional peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The defendant was accorded his right to exercise eight peremptory challenges pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-82g and 54-82h (a). After he had exhausted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>all eight of his peremptory challenges but before the fifth and sixth members of the six person jury had been selected, the defendant requested an additional peremptory challenge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 303, 613 A.2d 242 (1992); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>190 Conn. 219, 224-25, 460 A.2d 961 (1983). The trial court refused his request. The defendant subsequently challenged the sixth juror for cause and, after the trial court had overruled his challenge, stated that he would have exercised the requested additional peremptory challenge if the court had granted it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\u201cThe constitutional standard of fairness requires that a defendant have \u2018a panel of impartial, \u201cindifferent\u201d jurors.\u2019 <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>[366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961).]\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 799, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 308-309. We agree with the defendant that the enactment of article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended, \u201creflects the abiding belief of our citizenry that an impartial and fairly chosen jury is the cornerstone of our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>200 Conn. 615, 625, 513 A.2d 638 (1986). We have held that if a potential juror has such a fixed and settled opinion in a case that he cannot judge impartially the guilt of the defendant, he should not be selected to sit on the panel. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>197 Conn. 60, 66, 495 A.2d 1050 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\u201cThe trial court is vested with wide discretion in determining the competency of jurors to serve, and that judgment will not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>203 Conn. 81, 88-89, 523 A.2d 495 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>172 Conn. 172, 175, 374 A.2d 156 (1976). On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>defendant bears the burden of showing that the rulings of the trial court resulted in a jury that could not judge his guilt impartially. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>195 Conn. 421, 432, 489 A.2d 350 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions to excuse for cause five venirepersons, thereby forcing him unnecessarily to use peremptory challenges.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> By the time four jurors had been accepted, the defendant had exhausted his statutory allotment of eight peremptory challenges. He subsequently challenged unsuccessfully the sixth juror for cause and stated that he would have excused the fifth and sixth jurors if he had not exhausted his allotment of peremptory challenges, or if he had been granted the requested additional peremptory challenge.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant did not challenge the two alternates for cause and does not claim, nor does the record support a claim, that he would have peremptorily challenged either of the alternates had his statutory allotment of challenges not been exhausted. Thus, according to the defendant, if he had not been forced to exercise his peremptory challenges to remove jurors whom the court had improperly refused to remove for cause, he would have used his peremptory challenges to excuse the venirepersons who subsequently became the fifth and sixth members of the jury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We focus on those jurors who actually decided the defendant\u2019s fate rather than on those venirepersons who were excused for cause or peremptorily. <em>Ross </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>Oklahoma, </em>487 U.S. 81, 85, 108 S. Ct. 2273, 101 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>209 Conn. 564, 572-73, 552 A.2d 805 (1989). In the present case, no juror who participated in reaching the verdict had been challenged for cause. During the trial, the sixth juror, whom the defendant had challenged for cause and who he claims he would have challenged peremptorily, was arrested, and he was therefore replaced by an alternate, designated by lot, whom the defendant had not deemed to be unacceptable. General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h (c). The defendant dismisses the importance of the final composition of the jury because it was not foreseeable and urges us to decide his claim instead on the basis of the jury as impaneled initially rather than the jury that ultimately returned the verdict. In any case, however, unless the trial court improperly overruled the defendant\u2019s challenges for cause, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim that the trial court improperly limited his peremptory challenges to the number prescribed by \u00a7\u00a7 54-82g and 54-82h (a), pursuant to article first, \u00a7 19, of the state constitution, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We have held that the state constitutional right to a trial by jury is abridged if the \u201ctrial court . . . force[s] an accused to use peremptory challenges on persons who should have been excused for cause, provided the party subsequently exhausts all of his or her peremptory challenges and an additional challenge is sought and denied.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 313.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>review carefully the bases upon which the defendant challenged five prospective jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The defendant challenged venireperson Karen Goddard for cause on the basis of her answers to questions concerning interracial marriage.

And that doesn\u2019t mean\u2014maybe that is called prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">After Goddard had left the courtroom, the defendant moved that she be excused for cause and the court overruled the request.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Similar exchanges occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>with and concerning juror Ronald Alcorn. The defendant argues that Alcorn similarly manifested bias and should have been excused for cause. Because the defendant\u2019s arguments concerning Alcorn involve no substantial factual or legal distinctions that are not present in the case of Goddard, our analysis of the defendant\u2019s arguments concerning Goddard applies, as well, to his claim concerning Alcorn.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">\u201cTo succeed on a claim of bias the defendant must raise his contention of bias from the realm of speculation to the realm of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra, 433; <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>189 Conn. 303, 313, 455 A.2d 1326 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>167 Conn. 526, 532, 356 A.2d 162 (1975). \u201cAlthough we believe that the question on interracial marriage was relevant in that it might have revealed subconscious racism on the part of a prospec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tive juror, we do not look at that question in isolation to determine whether the defendant\u2019s claim has merit. Instead, we assess the claim in the context of the entire voir dire to determine whether the defendant was afforded a sufficient opportunity to expose racist attitudes among the prospective jurors.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 7, 608 A.2d 63, cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 383, 121 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1992). Although the parties have reflected on alternative meanings and inferences that can be drawn from the venirepersons\u2019 terse responses to the defendant\u2019s lengthy, sometimes convoluted and often hostile questions<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> concerning a complex and sensitive contemporary social issue,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the venirepersons\u2019 answers reflected a viewpoint regarding interracial marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>that did not affect their ability to sit as impartial jurors in this case. The trial court was able to observe the conduct of all the participants. Demeanor plays an important part in the determination of a juror\u2019s impartiality. The assessment of a potential juror\u2019s impartiality under such circumstances \u201cis particularly within the province of the trial judge and the trial judge has broad discretion in deciding whether to excuse a juror for cause.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>203 Conn. 570, 584, 525 A.2d 1319 (1987). The record lacks adequate factual support for the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court abused its discretion by overruling his requests to remove Goddard and Alcorn for cause.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the record before us does not support the defendant\u2019s contention that the court abused its discretion by refusing to excuse Goddard and Alcorn for cause, and that, as a matter of law, Goddard and Alcorn were not competent to judge this case fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In this case, Goddard testified not only about her negative feelings concerning racial intermarriage<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>also about her discomfort when she lived in a part of New Haven that she described as <em>\u201ca </em>black neighborhood.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> She also testified, however, that she and her son had had amicable social relationships with black friends.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Alcorn testified to his negative feelings about intermarriage.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although he had had little occasion to have social relationships with black people, his testimony also indicated his open-mindedness,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and the defendant\u2019s sole basis for claiming that he be excused for cause was his responses to the questions regarding intermarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">This case serves as an occasion to remind the trial courts of the difficulties of proving racial prejudice. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>juror is not likely to admit being a prejudiced person, against African-Americans or Asian-Americans or Hispanics, as the case may be, and indeed might not recognize the extent to which unconscious racial stereotypes might affect his or her evaluation of a defendant of a different race, or of the witnesses produced on that defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">There are some questions regarding racial attitudes the responses to which may raise red flags that should heighten the attention of the court. Although, as we have noted, a negative attitude toward racial intermarriage may well stem from racially benign motivations, we also have recognized the possibility that it may stem from racially invidious motivations. Because of the sensitivity of the issue and the importance of probing investigation into the possibility of bias, if a venireperson\u2019s response reveals an antagonism toward racial intermarriage the trial court should, as it did in this case, extend substantial latitude to explorative inquiries by counsel and, if necessary, should itself question the venireperson, as the trial court also did in this case. If that exploration leaves the trial court in doubt<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> about the juror\u2019s ability to evaluate the defendant\u2019s case on the evidence, without bias or predilection, the court should exercise its discretion to excuse the juror. Our state and national commitment to equal justice demands no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The defendant sought to remove Janet Doerner for cause because she expressed her reluctance to serve as a juror in a rape case and because she had been the victim of a burglary eight years before this trial. The defendant\u2019s claim focuses on the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel:] Would you like to be a juror in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">\u201c[Janet Doerner:] Very difficult case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">\u201cQ.

But if his Honor basically tells you quite simply that that is the State\u2019s burden, they must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and if at the end of hearing all the evidence you were of the opinion that Mr. Tucker probably did it, but according to the Judge\u2019s instructions that you use you felt according to those instructions that the State had not proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt, would you have any difficulty in accepting that instruction and finding him not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\u201cA.

Now that is not beyond all doubt, but beyond a reasonable doubt, and I will define that for you later. If they can\u2019t prove that you have to find him not guilty.

She stated that the incident did not have any sexual overtones and that it would not affect her judgment in this case. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s request to excuse Savvidou for cause and stated that the court had allowed the defendant to \u201cgo much farther afield than I normally would\u201d to examine the shoving incident. The trial court concluded that Savvidou would be \u201can excellent juror. . . . I find absolutely no cause here.\u201d Our review of the transcript again precludes any conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion by overruling the defendant\u2019s request to excuse Savvidou for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">After hearing the arguments of counsel and deliberating on each challenge for cause, the trial court concluded that the challenged venirepersons could afford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the defendant a fair and impartial trial. Although a \u201c \u2018juror\u2019s assurances that he is equal to this task cannot be dispositive of the accused\u2019s rights . . .\u2019 <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>[421 U.S. 794, 800, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975)]\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra, 433; the defendant has failed to demonstrate convincingly why these five venirepersons could not have been fair and impartial jurors. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court acted within its discretion by refusing to excuse for cause the five venirepersons who were subsequently peremptorily challenged by the defendant. We also conclude that, under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant the defendant\u2019s request for an additional peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The defendant next claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court, in instructing on the elements of sexual assault in the first degree, did not expressly inform the jury that it had to be unanimous in finding whether the defendant either used force <em>or </em>threatened the use of force against the victim to accomplish intercourse.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (l).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The defendant invokes the guarantees of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by article fourth of the amendments to the constitution.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 619, 595 A.2d 306 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 690, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S.

We agree with the defendant that \u201c[a] claim bearing on the defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict implicates a fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial and is thus reviewable despite the defendant\u2019s failure to request a specific unanimity charge or to take proper exceptions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>supra, 619, and cases cited therein. We also agree with the defendant that the record is adequate to review his claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">After a trial, the defendant was found guilty by a jury of having committed sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1). A person is guilty of having committed sexual assault in the first degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) if he \u201ccompels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force . . . <em>or </em>by the threat of use of force . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) In its charge to the jury, the trial court defined both the use of force and the threat of the use of force. The court then instructed the jury in the disjunctive, stating that \u201cit can be either physical force <em>or </em>threat of force, physical force. You don\u2019t have to be unanimous on which one under our law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant contends that the trial court thereby impermissibly sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">\u201cAlthough a . . . defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict is clear, the scope of that right, unfortunately, is not.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gipson, </em>553 F.2d 453, 456 (5th Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Recently, however, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>supra, we explained that even if the trial court\u2019s instructions can be read to have expressly sanctioned a nonunanimous verdict, a defendant is entitled to a new trial only if: (1) the alternative acts with which the defendant has been charged are conceptually distinct; and (2) the state has presented evidence to support each of the alternative acts with which the defendant has been charged. Id., 619-20, and cases cited therein. In the present case, the trial court expressly instructed the jury that it was not required to reach unanimity as to how exactly the defendant had violated the statute; and the state had presented evidence of both the defendant\u2019s use of force and the defendant\u2019s threats to use force against the victim. We conclude, however, that there is no conceptual distinction between the alternative acts with which the defendant was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">\u201c[T]he language of \u00a7 53a-70 divides the statute, not into two crimes, but into two methods of committing the same crime . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Secore, </em>194 Conn. 692, 698, 485 A.2d 1280 (1984); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanzella, </em>226 Conn. 601, 611, 628 A.2d 973 (1993). The use of force and the threat of the use of force are quite simply two alternative methods of compulsion used by an actor to commit the one crime of sexual assault in the first degree. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>State, </em>311 Md. 116, 136, 532 A.2d 1357 (1987). To invalidate a jury instruction that mirrors the disjunctive language of the statute defies both logic and experience. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchen, </em>110 Wash. 2d 403, 410, 756 P.2d 105 (1988). \u201c \u2018Where a trial court charges a jury that the commission of any one of several alternative acts would subject a defendant to criminal liability, a unanimity charge on a specific act is required only if two conditions are met: (1) the alternative acts are <em>conceptually distinct </em>from each other; <em>and </em>(2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>state has presented <em>supporting evidence </em>on each alternative act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Benite, </em>[6 Conn. App. 667, 674-75, 507 A.2d 478 (1986)].\u2019 (Emphasis in original.) <em>[State </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>14 Conn. App. 10, 38, 539 A.2d 1005, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 891, 109 S. Ct. 226, 102 L. Ed. 2d 217 (1988)].</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\u201cIn essence, the unanimity requirement as enunciated in <em>Gipson </em>and its progeny requires the jury to agree on the factual basis of the offense. The rationale underlying the requirement is that a jury cannot be deemed to be unanimous if it applies inconsistent factual conclusions to alternative theories of criminal liability. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\u201cAs <em>Gipson </em>itself recognizes, however, specific unanimity instructions are not required if the alternative bases of liability are not \u2018conceptually distinct.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gipson, </em>supra, 458. \u2018The jury should not be obliged to decide between two statutorily prohibited ways of committing the crime if the two ways are practically indistinguishable.\u2019 <em>Manson </em>v. <em>State, </em>101 Wis. 2d 413, 430, 304 N.W.2d 729 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Giwosky, </em>109 Wis. 2d 446, 455, 326 N.W.2d 232 (1982). \u2018The determination of whether actions are conceptually distinct must be made with reference to the purpose behind the proposed charge: to ensure that the jurors are in unanimous agreement as to what conduct the defendant committed.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Benite, </em>supra, 675.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 322, 334-35, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\"><em>Gipson\u2019s </em>requirement that a jury verdict be unanimous applies only if the acts on which unanimity is required fall into \u201c \u2018distinct conceptual groupings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>768 F.2d 64, 66-67 (2d Cir. 1985).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> \u201cThe <em>Gipson </em>logic requires the jury to agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>on the factual theory or \u2018concept\u2019 underlying criminal liability but does not require it to split hairs over nomenclature.\u201d <em>Holland </em>v. <em>State, </em>91 Wis. 2d 134, 139, 280 N.W.2d 288 (1979). In the present case, the two methods of compulsion are not conceptually distinct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>18 Conn. App. 134, 148, 556 A.2d 1040 (1989); <em>Manson </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra. \u201c[T]he element of compulsion, the utter subjugation of the victim\u2019s free will, is no different in character if it results from the raised fist or the first blow. . . . [W]e are convinced that the phrase \u2018use or threat of force or violence\u2019 is a sound and reasonable attempt to capture the essence of the proscribed conduct [sexual assault], and we conclude that to require jury unanimity on \u2018use of force\u2019 as opposed to \u2018threat of force\u2019 . . . would be inconsistent with the aim of the legislature in defining the offense and, more important, would reduce the efficacy of the statute itself.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>101 Wis. 2d 441, 450-52, 304 N.W.2d 742 (1981); see <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>3 Conn.

The victim testified that the defendant picked her up, carried her behind a store and threw her down onto the ground. When the victim tried to resist the defendant, he punched her in the face repeatedly and choked her and, when she screamed, he threatened to kill her if she did not stop. She complied with his demands. The essence of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) is to proscribe and punish compelled sexual intercourse. To agree with the defendant\u2019s argument would be inconsistent with that purpose.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Because the record contains compelling evidence that the defendant both used force and also threatened to use force, no constitutional purpose would be served by requiring that a defendant be set free if reasonable jurors unanimously had agreed that a raised fist following a blow constituted either the threat of additional force or the use of additional force to coerce intercourse, but had not unanimously agreed that the defendant compelled sexual intercourse through the use of force alone, the threat of the use of force alone, or by both the threat of the use of force <em>and </em>the use of force.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Just as the several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ways in which compelled sexual intercourse may be performed within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2) constitute one offense; <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>224 Conn. 397, 413, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Conn. 18, 35, 557 A.2d 917 (1989); the alternative behaviors evidencing the coercion by which this defendant compelled sexual intercourse comprise only one offense under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1). \u201c[W]e do not believe the defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous jury verdict extends to jury unanimity with respect to the alternative method of satisfying the force component of [first degree sexual assault] contained in [\u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the disjunctive instruction given was not constitutionally flawed because the single count of sexual assault in the first degree charged comprised but one continuing criminal episode, there was ample evidence of both statutorily proscribed methods of compulsion and they are not conceptually distinct. Accordingly, in the absence of a constitutional violation, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The defendant claims finally that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court violated his federal and state constitutional right to a fair trial by improperly instructing the jury concerning the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court instructed the jury that \u201ca reasonable doubt is a doubt for which you could in your own mind consciously find a reason,\u201d and that the principles of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence \u201care made to protect the innocent, not the guilty.\u201d The defendant did not object to the charge as given. He now claims, however, that these instructions \u201cincorrectly stated the law by diluting the State\u2019s burden of proof . . . and undermining the presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>907 F.2d 347, 354 (2d Cir. 1990). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">We analyze this unpreserved claim in accordance with the framework set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, and conclude that the defendant has not established a clear violation of his constitutional right to a fair trial. \u201c \u2018The record reveals that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions concerning the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt are the same or similar to jury instructions that previously have been approved by this court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 14, 28, 505 A.2d 690 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 538-39, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S.

Those instructions, and any deviation from the previously approved language of those instructions did not, when viewed in the context of the entire charge, dilute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence or lessen the state\u2019s burden of proof as claimed by the defendant. It is clear after reading the court's charge in its entirety that the jury was adequately informed that the defendant was presumed innocent until the state proved otherwise and that it was the state\u2019s burden to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 170-71, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S.

In other individuals, as in this case, it may not be the result of such animus, because that view may stem solely from religious, cultural, philosophical or other personally held conceptions that do not implicate racial prejudice. That is why it is necessary for both the trial court, and for this court upon review, to gauge the response, not in isolation, but in the context of the venireperson\u2019s responses to other race-related questions; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 7, 608 A.2d 63, cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S.

Within each grouping, the acts are sufficiently analogous to permit a jury finding of the actus reus element of the offense to be deemed \u2018unanimous\u2019 despite differences among the jurors as to which of the intragroup acts the defendant committed. This is so for two reasons. First, the acts within each grouping are not conceptually distinct. The single act of keeping a vehicle in a certain place may constitute both concealing and storing; or the single act of marketing a vehicle may simultaneously constitute bartering, selling, and disposing. Second, distinguishing among the acts within each grouping presents characterization problems. One juror may view a defendant\u2019s actions in housing a stolen vehicle as receiving, while another juror may conclude that the same actions constitute concealing or storing.\u201d Id., 458.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b667-4\"> The defendant also argues that \u201cuse\u201d offeree is distinct from a \u201cthreat\u201d of force because the former exists in the present and the latter involves an act that may occur in the future. The defendant has discerned an etymological difference but not a distinction. The defendant\u2019s standard would involve juries in characterization problems that would set defendants free not because the jury could not unanimously agree that a defendant had committed the act prohibited by the penal statute but because the jury was required to decide between two statutorily prohibited ways of committing the same crime that are practically indistinguishable.
