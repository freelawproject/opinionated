These appeals arise from two separate actions: <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care </em>(Docket No. 14586), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>and <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care </em>(Docket No. 14617). In the first case, the plaintiffs, the New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. (NERHH),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hartford Hospital, The Institute of Living and AdvantageHealth Corporation, appeal from the judgment of the trial court dismissing their appeal from the decision of CHHC granting permission to the defendants, Central Connecticut Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc. (CCRH),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, the Mount Sinai Hospital Corporation and the Hartford Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc., to build and operate a rehabilitation hospital in Hartford. In the second case, the plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the trial court dismissing their appeal from the decision of CHHC denying them permission to build and operate a rehabilitation hospital in Hartford. Because both applications were heard together by CHHC and because the underlying facts are similar, we consider them in one opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The following facts, as set forth in CHHC\u2019s rulings and in the trial court opinions, are undisputed. On October 10,1990, the defendants filed a letter of intent to apply for a certificate of need to develop, construct and operate a rehabilitation facility in Hartford. On November 26, 1990, the plaintiffs filed a letter of intent to apply for a certificate of need to develop, construct and operate a rehabilitation hospital in Hartford. Pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7\u00a7 19a-154 and 19a-155,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiffs submitted a certificate of need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>application to CHHC on January 18,1991, to develop, construct and operate a ninety bed comprehensive medical rehabilitation hospital on the grounds of The Institute of Living in Hartford, at a capital expenditure of $13,350,000. The defendants submitted a certificate of need application to CHHC on May 20,1991, to develop, construct and operate an eighty bed comprehensive medical rehabilitation hospital at the former site of the Hebrew Home and Hospital in Hartford, at a capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>expenditure of $17,290,627. Both the plaintiffs\u2019 and the defendants\u2019 applications were deemed complete by CHHC on July 18,1991. The plaintiffs\u2019 application was assigned Docket No. 91-906 and the defendants\u2019 application was assigned Docket No. 91-917. Additionally, R.H.S.C. Hospital, Inc. (RHSC), submitted a certificate of need application to CHHC to develop, construct and operate a sixty bed rehabilitation hospital at a capital expenditure of $13,827,000, and was assigned Docket No. 91-901.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>On January 29, 1991, after the plaintiffs had filed their certificate of need application, but before the defendants had filed their application, CHHC adopted a resolution stating that it was going to conduct an investigation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-149<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201cto determine the availability, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation services in Connecticut acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals, and other settings where these services may be offered.\u201d The resolution stated that CHHC was aware of at least six proposals that would be submitted to introduce rehabilitation services and that \u201cin order to carry out its duties pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 19a-153,\u201d CHHC needed information that was not then available to it. The CHHC assigned Docket No. 91-100RES to this investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">As part of its investigation, CHHC sent questionnaires to rehabilitation physicians and psychiatrists, inpatient and outpatient providers of interdisciplinary rehabilitation services, and acute care hospital discharge planners in Connecticut. CHHC also invited those same people to attend an investigatory proceeding at its offices on February 28,1991, to testify as to the present status of rehabilitation services in Connecticut. CHHC instructed that \u201c[n]o testimony concerning the specific proposals for any rehabilitation service [certificates of need] filed or expected to be filed with [CHHC] will be received at this proceeding.\u201d John J. Farrell, a CHHC commissioner, conducted the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The plaintiffs filed an application for party status in the investigation, Docket No. 91-100RES, on February 22, 1991, which CHHC subsequently denied. As part of its investigation, CHHC held a public hearing on February 28,1991, at which a series of speakers testified, including representatives of Hartford Hospital as well as two other speakers who were later witnesses on behalf of AdvantageHealth Corporation at a contested proceeding on the plaintiffs\u2019 application on August 21,1991. Participants in the investigation were permitted to comment in writing to CHHC at various stages before CHHC issued its report. Participants, however, were not allowed to cross-examine others who appeared before CHHC,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and none of the participants in this investigatory hearing were designated as parties. On May 1, 1991, CHHC issued an investigative report.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Thereafter, on August 2, 1991, CHHC published in the Hartford Courant legal notice that CHHC was to hold a joint public hearing on all three applications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following RHSC\u2019s withdrawal of its certificate of need application,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Docket Nos. 91-917 and 91-906 \u201cwere consolidated for purposes of hearing,\u201d which CHHC held on August 20, 21, 22 and September 12, 1991, before Farrell. Other commission members in attendance as observers were Steven J. Bongard, Donald G. Reed and Mary T. Collier. The hearing was conducted as a \u201ccontested case\u201d pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 19a-154 and 19a-155 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA). General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In addition to the evidence presented by the plaintiffs and the defendants, CHHC introduced its investigative report into the record of both cases: the plaintiffs\u2019 Docket No. 91-906 and the defendants\u2019 Docket No. 91-917. At the joint hearing, CHHC also heard testimony from a number of witnesses subpoenaed by it, intervenors<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and interested persons. CHHC reviewed community and regional need, cost-effectiveness and utilization, financial feasibility, quality and accessibility, teaching and research responsibilities, efforts to improve productivity and contain costs, managerial competency and technical expertise and the impact of the proposals on consumers and payers of health care.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In response to questions regarding the defendants\u2019 certificate of need application and CHHC\u2019s questioning at the hearing, the defendants submitted alternatives to their initial proposal of a newly constructed freestanding rehabilitation hospital. The defendants\u2019 \u201cScheme A\u201d proposed an eighty bed facility comprised of the existing medical office building on the campus of Mount Sinai Hospital and new construction of a two story building for a capital cost of $14,344,902, without capitalized financing costs. \u201cScheme A-60\u201d proposed the same basic facility as Scheme A with twenty fewer general rehabilitation beds costing $13,944,902, without capitalized financing costs. \u201cScheme B\u201d proposed an eighty bed facility comprised of new construction on level three (the ground level of Mount Sinai Hospital) and renovation of what is level four of Mount Sinai Hospital, for a capital cost of $13,244,902, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>out capitalized financing costs. \u201cScheme B-60\u201d proposed the same basic facility as Scheme B with twenty fewer beds, for a capital cost of $12,894,902, without capitalized financing costs. All of the above alternatives included costs for the demolition and removal of the Hebrew Home and Hospital. CHHC found each of these alternatives to be comparable to the defendants\u2019 initial application.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The plaintiffs did not submit alternative schemes in response to the certificate of need application questions, and instead indicated that no alternative had been considered to the proposal submitted. In response to CHHC questioning, the plaintiffs thereafter submitted descriptions of reduced bed alternatives: (1) a sixty bed freestanding hospital on the campus of the Institute of Living at a capital cost of $7,674,320; (2) a sixty bed facility on the second floor of one of the buildings already in existence on the campus of the Institute of Living, at a capital cost of $2,320,167; and (3) a forty bed facility in an existing building on the Hartford Hospital campus at a capital cost of $2,030,000. The plaintiffs considered the second alternative to be the most attractive and viable. CHHC, however, found that the plaintiffs\u2019 second alternative was not comparable in program scope to the initial application. It further found that this alternative would have no patient dining room, no space for a therapeutic pool program and no separate identity from the psychiatric hospital on whose grounds the rehabilitation hospital would operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">On November 25, 1991, CHHC issued its final decision in Docket No. 91-917, unanimously approving the defendants\u2019 certificate of need application as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">On that same day, CHHC issued its final decision in Docket No. 91-906, unanimously denying the plaintiffs\u2019 certificate of need application. CHHC found that although the plaintiffs\u2019 and the defendants\u2019 original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>applications were quite similar in scope, the alternative proposals were not. The certificate of need granted to the defendants was for a sixty bed facility that will have a capital cost of $13,670,265 and will add no new beds to the system. Because the defendants\u2019 final proposal included shutting down the twenty-four bed rehabilitation unit at Mount Sinai Hospital, and also eliminating the nine rehabilitation beds currently in service at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, CHHC found that an annual cost savings of $3,214,797 to consumers and payers of health care services would be realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 of the UAPA and \u00a7 19a-158,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the plaintiffs appealed to the trial court from the final decision on their own application; <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV-92-506106 (July 20, 1992); as well as from the decision granting the defendants\u2019 application; <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV-92-506105 (April 6, 1992). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the former complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that CHHC, by conducting its own investigation pertaining to the availability, quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation services in Connecticut, in effect had conducted a contested case, thereby denying the plaintiffs participation therein in violation of the procedures established by the UAPA. The plaintiffs claimed that this conduct constituted an ex parte communication that was presumptively prejudicial and thereby invalidated CHHC\u2019s decision denying their certificate of need application.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, thus affirming CHHC\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 application. <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>42 Conn. Sup. 413, 622 A.2d 1067 (1992). In its memorandum of decision, the court first observed that \u00a7 19a-149 does not contain any \u201cprohibition against a general investigation because of the pendency of an application to build a particular proposed facility and the statute contains no requirement that the parties to a pending application be made parties in a general investigation by [CHHC].\u201d Id., 418-19. The trial court concluded that the general investigation held by CHHC pursuant to \u00a7 19a-149 did not constitute a contested case and thus CHHC had not violated the procedures required by the UAPA in contested cases. Although General Statutes \u00a7 4-178 (5) expressly provides for the right to cross-examine witnesses in contested hearings conducted by agencies, the trial court reasoned that general investigations pursuant to \u00a7 19a-149 are not contested cases as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The trial court further concluded that there was no indication that the plaintiffs had been prevented from calling any of the witnesses from the investigative hearing to testify. Id. Farrell, the hearing officer, stated at the contested hearing that the plaintiffs could address any deficiencies they found in the investigative report. Id. The trial court concluded, therefore, that the plaintiffs failed to support their claim that \u201cthey were denied the opportunity to offer full advocacy as to the need for a facility in the proceedings as to their application.\u201d Id., 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In their appeal from the decision granting the defendants\u2019 application, the plaintiffs alleged that the decision to approve the defendants\u2019 application in Docket No. 91-917 had been arbitrary, illegal and an abuse of discretion. The plaintiffs claimed that CHHC\u2019s approval of the defendants\u2019 application had exceeded CHHC\u2019s statutory authority and was erroneous in light of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence in the record. The plaintiffs additionally alleged that CHHC\u2019s decision had been arbitrary and an abuse of discretion because \u201c[CHHC had been] critical of [the plaintiffs], but not of [the defendants], on issues where the respective applications were substantially similar.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations distilled to the claim that CHHC had \u201crelied on substantially the same evidence to reach inconsistent decisions in granting [the defendants\u2019] application while denying [the plaintiffs\u2019] application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The defendants thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of CHHC\u2019s approval of the defendants\u2019 certificate of need application on the grounds that the plaintiffs were not aggrieved by the granting of the defendants\u2019 application and thus did not have standing to appeal that decision. At the hearing on the motion, the only evidence offered to support the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of aggrievement was the affidavits that had been appended to the plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum in oppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>sition to the defendants\u2019 motion. In its decision dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the trial court ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of loss of opportunity to provide a service and gain revenues contained within these affidavits were insufficient to substantiate their claim that they had a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of CHHC\u2019s decision to approve the defendants\u2019 certificate of need application. Because the plaintiffs failed to meet the first prong of the aggrievement test, they had no standing to appeal the decision. Following reargument of the motion to dismiss, the court maintained its earlier decision that the plaintiffs had failed to present any evidence to establish aggrievement<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and reaffirmed the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The plaintiffs thereafter filed separate appeals to the Appellate Court and we transferred both appeals to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). In their appeal from the judgment of the trial court dismissing their challenge to the granting of the defendants\u2019 certificate of need, the plaintiffs raise the sole claim that the trial court incorrectly determined that they were not aggrieved and improperly dismissed their appeal. In their appeal from the judgment of the trial court affirming the denial of their own certificate of need, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court failed to recognize that by incorporating its own investigative report, based on information gathered in Docket No. 91-100RES, CHHC used its investigative docket in a manner that curtailed the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to participate in the presentation of evidence concerning their application. We disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">It is well established that the right to appeal an administrative action is created only by statute and a party must exercise that right in accordance with the statute in order for the court to have jurisdiction. <em>Munhall </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>221 Conn. 46, 50, 602 A.2d 566 (1992). In this case, the plaintiffs appealed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-158 and 4-183a. Section \u00a7 19a-158, which is the specific statutory authority permitting the appeal of a CHHC decision, states in pertinent part: \u201cAny health care facility or institution and any state health care facility or institution aggrieved by any final decision of said commission under the provisions of sections 19a-145 to 19a-156, inclusive . . . may appeal therefrom in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183 . . . .\u201d Section 4-183 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the superior court as provided in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Accordingly, in order to have standing to bring an administrative appeal, a person or entity must be aggrieved. <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>214 Conn. 726, 729, 573 A.2d 736 (1990); <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>198 Conn. 498, 501, 503 A.2d 1161 (1986). Aggrievement is a question of fact for the trial court and the plaintiff has the burden of proving that fact. <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>6 Conn. App. 715, 718, 507 A.2d 495 (1986). Pleading and proof of facts that constitute aggrievement are essential prerequisites to the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over an administrative appeal. <em>Park City Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>210 Conn. 697, 702, 556 A.2d 602 (1989); <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>supra; <em>Ribicoff </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>v. <em>Division of Public Utility Control, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 24, 26-27, 445 A.2d 325 (1980), aff'd, 187 Conn. 247, 445 A.2d 324 (1982). In the absence of aggrievement, an administrative appeal must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 729-30; <em>Local 1303 &amp; Local 1378 </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>191 Conn. 173, 177, 463 A.2d 613 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The test for determining aggrievement is a two part inquiry: \u201c[Fjirst, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision. ...\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>203 Conn. 295, 299-300, 524 A.2d 636 (1987); <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 65, 475 A.2d 283 (1984). The defendants argue that the plaintiffs failed to allege and prove the infringement of any legally protected interest in the subject matter of CHHC\u2019s decision to approve the defendants\u2019 certificate of need application and that the plaintiffs, therefore, failed to demonstrate aggrievement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In its attempt to establish aggrievement, the plaintiffs submitted three affidavits with their memorandum of law in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. These affidavits, collectively, asserted that: (1) approval of the defendants\u2019 certificate of need appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>cation adversely affected the economic value of NERHH; (2) the plaintiffs \u201cwill lose the opportunity to gain the revenues, profits, diversification of services, improvement of their respective competitive positions in the health care marketplace and the overall growth which they otherwise [would] have gained\u201d; (3) the existence of additional certificates of need cause a dilution and diminution in value of each certificate of need for a similar service; and (4) The Institute of Living would \u201close the opportunity to gain the revenues, profits and improvement of their competitive position in the health care marketplace\u201d and The Institute \u201cwill be further harmed as it will be prevented from diversifying its programs and from instituting a campus reutilization program . . . . \u201d Additionally, the plaintiffs have alleged that certain findings and conclusions in CHHC\u2019s decision granting the defendants\u2019 application, which are also contained in CHHC\u2019s decision denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application, will become res judicata as to the appeal from that decision. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that their application had been denied because the defendants\u2019 application had been approved. That approval, according to the plaintiffs, was \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201cunfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">It was the function of the trial court to determine, first, whether the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, if proved, would constitute aggrievement as a matter of law, and second, whether the plaintiffs had proved the truth of those allegations. <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>166 Conn. 43, 51, 347 A.2d 89 (1974). Because we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, if proved, do not constitute aggrievement as a matter of law, we do not reach the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The party claiming aggrievement from a decision directed to another person or entity must establish the certainty of a \u201cspecific personal and legal interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the subject matter of the decision . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 47. In <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 300, we found that a <em>licensed </em>physician specializing in orthopedics had a \u201c \u2018right and estate in his profession\u2019 \u201d to appeal from a declaratory ruling of the board of examiners in podiatry that involved the practice of orthopedic medicine. \u201cCases are legion holding, in one way or another, that the right of a licentiate to practice his profession is a property right, or a right in the nature of a property right, or a valuable franchise, or a valuable privilege.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Similarly, we have held that an attorney at law, admitted to practice, has a franchise regarded as a property right. <em>In re Application of Pagano, </em>207 Conn. 336, 341, 541 A.2d 104 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">In <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 300, 603 A.2d 1131 (1992), the plaintiff chief state\u2019s attorney was denied party status in a freedom of information commission (FOIC) proceeding. A newspaper editor had filed a complaint after the Windsor Locks chief of police refused to disclose publicly a police report concerning the arrest of two individuals. After the FOIC ordered the police department to release the report, the plaintiff appealed to the trial court, which dismissed the appeal because it found no aggrievement. We reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, concluding that the plaintiff, who is the person responsible for the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases in Connecticut, was aggrieved because of the impact that the FOIC\u2019s order would have on the prosecution of cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>for which he bears statutory responsibility. Id., 312. We held that \u201cthe plaintiff has demonstrated that his <em>present </em>interest in the unimpeded prosecution of criminal cases is jeopardized by the FOIC decision . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 313-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 168, 178, 592 A.2d 386 (1991), we concluded that the plaintiff motor carriers had been aggrieved by a decision of the department of public utility control (DPUC) granting a competitor a license. In <em>Light Rigging Co., </em>the plaintiff motor carriers owned motor carrier certificates issued by DPUC, which were transferable, saleable and tradable in commerce as assets of economic value. Id., 173-74. DPUC had granted a similar certificate to a competitor without, the plaintiffs contended, the consideration of the public need for such additional certificates, required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 16-286, now recodified as \u00a7 13b-392. The parties agreed, and we concurred, that the plaintiffs had met the first prong of the aggrievement test. \u201cThe plaintiffs demonstrated their specific personal and legal interest in the subject of the DPUC\u2019s decision by alleging and providing evidence that their DPUC certificates . . . authorize them to provide services similar to those that . . . [the competitor\u2019s] contested certificate would authorize [the competitor] to provide.\u201d Id., 173.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In <em>Light Rigging Co., </em>however, unlike this case, DPUC was specifically required by statute to consider the effect of granting a new certificate of public convenience and necessity on the existing competitors who already held certificates, as well as considering the public need in general. General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u00a7 16-286, expressly required DPUC to consider \u201cthe existing motor transportation facilities and the effect upon them of granting such certificate\u201d and \u201cthe public need for the service the applicant proposes to render . . . .\u201d Id., 176. Additionally, DPUC certificates are transferable, saleable and tradable in commerce as assets of economic value, and therefore, we recognized that new certificates can cause dilution and diminution in the value of those already in existence. Id., 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">CHHC has different requirements to consider. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-153 requires that CHHC consider \u201cwhether there is a clear public need for any proposal or request\u201d and \u201cthe impact of such proposal, request or submission on the interests of consumers of health care services and the payers for such services.\u201d There is no specific statutory requirement, however, on the part of CHHC to consider the impact of an application on existing health care facilities. Nor is there a preexisting presumption of need as stated in General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 16-286: \u201cWhen it appears that no motor common carrier service is being supplied over the route or routes applied for, public convenience and necessity <em>shall be presumed to require operation of such service. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Finally, the plaintiffs are not \u201cexisting certificate holders who are entitled to be free of competition for which no need has been shown.\u201d <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 177. Accordingly, the existence of a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision has not been substantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The plaintiffs rely on three United States Supreme Court decisions to support their claim that, as business competitors, they have a legal interest in the defendants\u2019 certificate of need application. Notwithstanding the fact that the federal Uniform Administrative Procedure Act differs from the Connecticut UAPA, the cases cited by the plaintiffs do not afford them the sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>port they seek. In both <em>Alton R. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 15, 62 S. Ct. 432, 86 L. Ed. 586 (1942), and <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U.S. 1, 80 S. Ct. 1570, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1527 (1960), the aggrieved plaintiffs were existing common carrier certificate holders, comparable to the plaintiffs in <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra. In <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S. Ct. 827, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1970), existing sellers of data processing services challenged a ruling of the comptroller of currency that allowed national banks to provide such services despite the seemingly contrary provisions of \u00a7 4 of the Bank Service Corporation Act of 1962. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1864 (1962). At issue was whether Congress, in passing the statute, intended to protect data processors in companies other than banks from bank competition. If so, then the complainant\u2019s interest was at least \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\u201d Id., 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Neither the plaintiff NERHH nor its stockholders<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> are existing competitors,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> whose present business operations either are adversely affected by CHHC\u2019s decision granting the defendants\u2019 certificate of need, or are within the zone of interests to be protected by a particular state statute or constitutional guarantee.

A speculative loss of revenue is insufficient to confer standing and establish aggrievement. See <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 301. The plaintiffs claim that the granting of the defendants\u2019 certificate of need application caused them to \u201close profits, revenues and their competitive positions in the health care community.\u201d Specifically, they claim that by granting the defendants\u2019 certificate of need application, CHHC has: (1) undermined their ability to demonstrate a need for their facility; (2) diluted the value of their intended certificate of need; and (3) bound them to certain findings made in connection with the defendants\u2019 application that would have negative impact in their appeal from the denial of their own application. The first two allegations constitute no more than a suggestion of economic disadvantage caused by competition. This is not sufficient to qualify.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, and cases cites therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In the plaintiffs\u2019 third allegation, they claim that they are aggrieved because of the res judicata effect that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>they contend, the decision regarding the defendants\u2019 application will have on their appeal from the denial of their own application. They argue that if they are not permitted to appeal CHHC\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 application, the factual findings and conclusions underlying the decision granting the defendants\u2019 certificate of need will become res judicata in their appeal of CHHC\u2019s decision denying their own application.

See part II, infra. Before the trial court, the plaintiffs were not collaterally estopped from challenging any finding in the decision made by CHHC regarding their own application because of or as a result of any findings that CHHC had made in connection with the defendants\u2019 application. The plaintiffs were not controlled by the findings regarding the defendants\u2019 application, nor have they cited any instance where an applicant, when challenging a decision on its own application for a certificate of need, license or review of the same, has been bound by a finding of fact made in connection with another application. The plaintiffs did not argue this danger to the trial court nor is this claim supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The order of CHHC granting the defendants\u2019 certificate of need application is not addressed to or directed at the plaintiffs. This case differs significantly from <em>Carothers </em>v. Capozziello, supra, 95-96, on which the plaintiffs heavily rely. In <em>Carothers, </em>we applied the principles of collateral estoppel to a trial regarding violations of clean-up orders issued by the department of environmental protection (DEP) emanating from a hearing held by the commissioner at which the defendants\u2019 conduct was the sole issue. Because in one case the defendants had entered into a final consent order, which was entitled to preclusive effect, and because in another case they had been present before the DEP and chose to abandon their opportunity to challenge the conclusion of the commissioner of environmental protection that their activities were illegal, we ruled that the issue of whether the defendants\u2019 past behavior constituted a violation of the relevant statutes had been determined between the parties under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In this case, at issue in the adjudication of the defendants\u2019 application to CHHC was whether the defendants had demonstrated that their project would improve the delivery of health care to the region pursuant to the standards set forth in the governing statutes and regulations. In Docket No. 91-917, CHHC adjudicated only the defendants\u2019 application, not the plaintiffs\u2019 application. Although the plaintiffs and the defendants had a joint public hearing regarding the relevant facts, the action taken in each application was separate and distinct. CHHC determined the relationship between the plaintiffs\u2019 and the defendants\u2019 proposals and the community need in each ruling, and the trial court was asked in each of the two appeals to consider whether CHHC\u2019s actions had been arbitrary and illegal. The plaintiffs alleged that CHHC had abused its discretion because it had reached inconsistent decisions in both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>granting the defendants\u2019 application and denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application despite reliance on the same evidence. The plaintiffs did not challenge findings made regarding the defendants\u2019 application or the use. of such findings in their application.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In the absence of any such claim thus far, the plaintiffs, in effect, are asking this court to determine now that certain findings in the decision granting the defendants\u2019 application will be res judicata, and that, as a result, the plaintiffs will be estopped from challenging them in their appeal from the denial of their own application. We decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The plaintiffs further claim that because they were designated parties to the joint public hearing, they are aggrieved. We disagree with the legal conclusion they ask us to draw as well as with their rendition of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">This court has often stated that \u201c[mjere status . . . as a party or a participant in a hearing before an administrative agency does not in and of itself constitute aggrievement for the purposes of appellate review.\u201d <em>Hartford Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>177 Conn. 616, 620, 419 A.2d 346 (1979); see also <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Local 1566, </em>200 Conn. 91, 96, 510 A.2d 177 (1986); <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 66, 475 A.2d 283 (1984); <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>6 Conn. App. 715, 718, 507 A.2d 495 (1986). If designation as a party in an agency proceeding were construed to be the equivalent of the right to be a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>in a judicial proceeding, an agency\u2019s presiding officer would be vested with the authority to decide not only who could appear before the agency and what rights they would have during that proceeding, but also who could challenge an adverse decision of the agency in court. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 226, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The plaintiffs reliance <em>on Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, to support their contention that their designation as parties to the consolidated proceedings before CHHC satisfies the first prong of the aggrievement test, is misplaced. The plaintiffs in <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>demonstrated more than mere party status to support their claims of aggrievement. Indeed, this court specifically stated: \u201cThe trial court concluded, and we agree, that the plaintiffs satisfied the first prong of the aggrievement test. The plaintiffs <em>demonstrated their specific personal and legal interest </em>in the subject of the DPUC\u2019s decision <em>by alleging and providing evidence </em>that their DPUC certificates, for the intrastate operations that they own, authorize them to provide services similar to those that [the competitor\u2019s] contested certificate would authorize [the competitor] to provide.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">This court in <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, did not state that the plaintiffs\u2019 designation as parties automatically satisfied the first prong of the aggrievement test. We noted only that the trial court should have considered the plaintiffs\u2019 designation as parties when determining whether they had been aggrieved. Id., 177-78. The trial court involved herein did consider the plaintiffs\u2019 designation as parties and concluded that \u201cthe plaintiff[s] offer nothing [other than] such designation was anything more than that accorded an applicant seeking a privilege from the commission,\u201d \u201cwhose legal rights, duties or privileges will be specifically affected by the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>mission\u2019s decision.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-160-29. The designation by CHHC of the plaintiffs and the defendants as \u201cparties in this proceeding\u201d was done in accordance with \u00a7 19a-160-29 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies by notice in the Hartford Courant after the two applications were consolidated for purposes of hearing. This regulation states in pertinent part: \u201cIn issuing the notice of hearing the commission will designate as parties those persons known to the commission . . . whose legal rights, duties or privileges will be specifically affected by the commission\u2019s decision and any person who is required by law to be a party in the proceeding.\u201d The legal notice stated: \u201cPursuant to Sections 19a-154 and [19a-]155 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Commission on Hospitals and Health Care will hold a joint public hearing to hear testimony on the requests of the following facilities .... The applicants are designated as parties to this proceeding. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">CHHC is allowed to hold a consolidated hearing pursuant to its authority as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155 (c), which states in pertinent part: \u201cIn conducting its activities under this section and section 19a-154, the commission may hold hearings on applications of a similar nature at the same time.\u201d The administrative and trial court records show that the plaintiffs were made a party to the public hearing by virtue of their <em>own </em>application because all applicants were made parties to the hearing. This is evidenced from the roster of parties, intervenors and informal participants. RHSC had submitted an application for a certificate of need and was designated as a party in the newspaper legal notice. RHSC, however, withdrew its application prior to the joint hearing, and was designated an intervenor pursuant to \u00a7 19a-160-31 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Gaylord Hospital, which did not submit an application, but which specifically claimed to be personally and legally affected by CHHC\u2019s decision in that it is authorized to operate a rehabilitation hospital and would suffer a competitive effect, requested and was denied party status. Instead, Gaylord Hospital participated as an intervenor. Both parties and intervenors were allowed to present statements, offer testimony and cross-examine all witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Persons or entities applying for party status under \u00a7 19a-160-30 of the Regulations of Connecticut State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Agencies must demonstrate how their legal rights, duties and privileges will be affected by CHHC\u2019s decision, and CHHC, through its presiding officer, is thereby given the opportunity to make a judgment in this regard. In this case, the plaintiffs did not argue for party status in regard to the defendants\u2019 application pursuant to any regulation, and CHHC never specifically ruled on the issue. In <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 177, the trial court noted, <em>after </em>finding that the first prong of the aggrievement test had been satisfied, that the plaintiffs had been made parties pursuant to \u00a7 16-1-17 (c) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. This regulation requires that the person requesting party status file a petition describing the manner in which the petitioner claims to be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding, and the nature of the evidence. The DPUC then considers the petition and makes a determination. This court stated in <em>Light Rigging Co.: </em>\u201c[A]t the administrative level, there was a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s legal rights, duties or privileges would be affected by the agency\u2019s decision regarding the issuance of a certificate to [a competitor]. While the plaintiffs\u2019 status as parties at the agency level does not constitute aggrievement; <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 66; the trial court should have closely reviewed this administrative finding because many of the elements considered by the agency in granting this status closely track the elements that the court would have to find to determine whether a party is aggrieved.\u201d <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The trial court in this case was correct to look behind the label of \u201cparty status\u201d to see if there were facts in the record to establish that the plaintiffs had a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision about the defendants\u2019 certificate of need, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>and what CHHC actually did or, in this case, did not do\u2014namely to make a judgment on the merits of the party status in this case. The administrative record indicates that the proceedings were consolidated specifically for the purpose of the public hearing. The applications themselves were never consolidated into a single docket number and separate decisions were issued for each docket number. In fact, CHHC, in its proposed final decision with regard to the defendants\u2019 application, did not list the plaintiffs as parties, intervenors or informal participants to the application. Rather, CHHC acknowledged the consolidation of the hearings on both the plaintiffs\u2019 and the defendants\u2019 certificate of need applications and merely identified the plaintiffs as \u201cthe participants for [the plaintiffs\u2019] application].\u201d As such, there is nothing in the administrative record or the trial court record to indicate that CHHC\u2019s designation of the plaintiffs as parties to the joint public hearing was based on any particular determination regarding the legal effect of the defendants\u2019 application on the plaintiffs\u2019 application. The designation of \u201cparty status\u201d under the facts of this case, therefore, confers no personal or legal interest that would justify a conclusion that the plaintiffs were aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Even assuming that the plaintiffs had established a specific personal and legal interest to satisfy the first part of the <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>test, they failed as to the second prong, namely, to prove that such interest had been specially and injuriously affected by CHHC\u2019s decision. Loss of future revenues is but a prospective and speculative injury, insufficient to qualify the plaintiff as aggrieved, unless the competition at issue is \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cillegal.\u201d <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>203 Conn. 295, 302-303, 524 A.2d 636 (1987), and cases cited therein; see <em>Unisys Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Labor, </em>220 Conn. 689, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>693-95, 600 A.2d 1019 (1991). In such instance, this court has recognized \u201c \u2018that it has always been [proper] that a professional man has standing to prevent the <em>improper </em>invasion of his profession.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The plaintiffs claim that it was unfair competition, indistinguishable from that alleged in <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, for CHHC to grant the defendants\u2019 certificate of need <em>for </em>a sixty bed facility despite having found in its denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 application that \u201cthere was no need for 90 (or even 60) new rehabilitation beds in the Hartford area.\u201d CHHC approved the defendants\u2019 alternative Scheme B-60 plan that provided for the closing of sixty beds at two of the three defendant hospitals and for the opening of a new sixty bed rehabilitation hospital at the site of the former Hebrew Home and Hospital. Approval of the new facility, Central Connecticut Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc., \u201callows the creation of a facility with a 60 rehabilitation bed configuration without adding any beds to the system. A 60 bed facility will provide the anchor which is necessary to address the quality/accessibility issues that have resulted from the current fragmentation in the delivery of rehabilitation services.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 plan, on the contrary, was deemed \u201climited in scope . . . addressing] the needs of the applicant and not the needs of the health care delivery system in a cost-effective manner. Instead of improving upon the fragmentation that currently exists, the proposal only serves to create an additional facility and 90 additional beds . . . with minimal savings. For example, there are no reductions in the number of beds at Hartford Hospital or in the Hartford area due to the implementation of this proposal. The addition of rehabilitative beds with no major savings is not warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>CHHC denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application because it found that it would not be cost-effective to the health care system on a long term basis. The plaintiffs had not proven that there was a need for a new ninety bed facility or even for a facility of sixty <em>new </em>rehabilitation beds. Furthermore, CHHC found the plaintiffs\u2019 smaller sixty bed alternative to be lacking in other significant ways: it would not have a separate identity from the psychiatric hospital; and it would lack a patient dining room and a pool. The plaintiffs\u2019 application for a smaller facility simply did not meet the criteria under General Statutes \u00a7 19a-153.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The label that CHHC\u2019s decision was \u201cillegal\u201d or \u201cunfair,\u201d ascribed by the plaintiffs in order to fit within the <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>analysis, does not fit. \u201cUnfairness\u201d <em>in Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, stemmed from the fact that, despite a statutory mandate, DPUC never considered public need in issuing a certificate of need to the applicant. The final decision of CHHC in the present case reflects great consideration of the public need and the potential of substantial savings to the existing health care delivery system.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In the plaintiffs\u2019 second appeal, they claim that the trial court incorrectly concluded that CHHC had properly (1) conducted an investigatory hearing after the plaintiffs had filed their application for a certificate of need, (2) introduced a report containing the findings and conclusions from this hearing into evidence at the subsequent contested hearing, and (3) permitted Commissioner Farrell to conduct both the investigative hearing and the contested hearing in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 4-176e. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first two claims essentially challenge the interaction of two distinct, yet often overlapping, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>functions of CHHC as an administrative agency: regulation and adjudication.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Each of these functions entails separate and distinct duties, and the rights afforded to the parties in relation to each function are quite different. Because CHHC is responsible for ultimately regulating Connecticut\u2019s health care in the best interests of the state; see General Statutes \u00a7 19a-150;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> however, its regulatory and adjudicatory duties often necessarily overlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">As a regulatory agency, CHHC must manage and control the amount and cost of health care in this state. General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 19a-150; 16 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1973 Sess., p. 1466, remarks of Senator Louise S. Berry (CHHC will \u201cimprove the delivery and the quality of health care services for the people of this state, while serving the public\u2019s interest through review and regulation of the increases in costs in order to improve efficiency, coordinate the use of facilities and services, lower costs and expand the availability of health care throughout the State\u201d); see generally <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care </em>v. <em>Lakoff, </em>214 Conn. 321, 331, 572 A.2d 316 (1990). Specifically, CHHC has a duty to determine the need, if any, for rehabilitation services in the Hartford area and the most cost-effective man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ner to provide for that need. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 19a-150; see also 16 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1973 Sess., pp. 1469-70, remarks of Senator Louise S. Berry (the \u201cpower to review and regulate capital improvements should over a period of time minimize the waste that occurs ... in over building hospital bed space\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In assessing this state\u2019s need for particular health services, CHHC has the authority to conduct investigations. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-149;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> see 3 J. Stein, G. Mitchell &amp; B. Mezines, Administrative Law (1992) \u00a7 19.01. \u201c \u2018The investigatory function is designed to produce information. . . .\u2019 \u201d 3 J. Stein, G. Mitchell &amp; B. Mezines, supra, p. 19-2 n.4. It is \u201cnonpartisan and nonadversary.\u201d Id., p. 19-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Because investigations in this regulatory context are generally nonadversary proceedings, they are not contested cases within the meaning of the UAPA. A contested case is \u201ca proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a74-166(2). The UAPA requires agencies to provide certain protections and safeguards to assure full and fair administrative proceedings in contested cases. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 4-177c (\u201c[i]n a contested case, each party and the agency conducting the proceeding shall be afforded the opportunity [1] to inspect and copy relevant and material records, papers and documents not in the possession of the party of such agency . . . and [2] at a hearing, to respond, to cross-examine other parties, intervenors, and witnesses, and to present evidence and argument on all issues involved\u201d). The protections of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the UAPA are not required or necessary in general investigations because the parties\u2019 rights are not being adjudicated. See <em>Benton-Hecht Moving &amp; Storage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Call, </em>782 S.W.2d 668 (Mo. App. 1989) (because uncontested cases are not adversarial, cross-examination is not necessary). Rather, CHHC, in the course of these general investigations, objectively determines, in the best interest of the state, the need, if any, for rehabilitation services.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The adjudicatory duties of CHHC include presiding, through hearing officers, in contested cases. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-155 (a). Because parties\u2019 rights or duties are being adjudicated in contested cases, the UAPA requires an agency to provide certain protections for the parties in order to ensure a full and fair hearing. \u201cAll parties must be fully apprised of the evidence submitted or to be considered, and must be given an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, to inspect documents and to offer evidence in explanation or rebuttal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Department of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 346, 64 A.2d 330 (1949), quoting <em>Interstate Commerce Commission </em>v. <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., </em>227 U.S. 88, 93, 33 S. Ct. 185, 57 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1913); see <em>Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>183 Conn. 128, 139 n.9, 439 A.2d 282 (1981) (\u201cBefore an administrative agency may lawfully rely on material nonrecord facts within its special knowledge and experience <em>or which it has learned through investigation, </em>it must allow a party adversely affected thereby an opportunity to rebut at an appropriate stage in the proceedings.\u201d [Emphasis added.]); <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 290, 292-93, 99 A.2d 149 (1953); see also C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 1.2.5. Against this background, we will examine the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The plaintiffs first claim that CHHC improperly held an independent investigation after the plaintiffs filed their application for a certificate of need. The plaintiffs concede that CHHC generally has the authority to hold an investigatory hearing under \u00a7 19a-149, and that the investigatory hearing was uncontested. The plaintiffs further concede that if CHHC had initiated the investigatory proceeding prior to the plaintiffs\u2019 filing of their application, the plaintiffs could not make the same challenge regarding the investigation that it does in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The plaintiffs contend, however, that once they filed their application, CHHC could no longer initiate an independent investigation into need without the plaintiffs\u2019 adversarial participation. The essence of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument appears to be that because CHHC was required to assess need and cost-effectiveness in the context of its review of the plaintiffs\u2019 application in the contested case pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-153,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>it could not, while the plaintiffs\u2019 application was pending,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and without their adversarial participation, conduct an independent regulatory investigation pursuant to \u00a7 19a-149 to discover the status of rehabilitative care in Connecticut. Thus, although the plaintiffs concede that the investigation was an uncontested case, they claim that investigations pursuant to \u00a7 19a-149 that are conducted following the filing of an application are, in effect, contested cases, and that the plaintiffs should be afforded all the rights the UAPA grants to parties in contested cases. The plaintiffs specifically contend that by conducting this investigation, CHHC deprived the plaintiffs of the rights granted by the UAPA to cross-examine witnesses and present relevant evidence. We decline to interpret \u00a7 19a-149 in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">First, \u00a7 19a-149 does not expressly prohibit CHHC from conducting a general independent investigation after a related application is pending, nor does it require that the parties to a pending application be made parties to the general investigation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Therefore, CHHC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>was not prohibited by statute from conducting an investigation while the plaintiffs\u2019 application was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Second, it is clear that CHHC\u2019s investigation in this case was not a contested case. The investigation conducted by CHHC was a general fact finding investigation and did not determine any parties\u2019 applications or particular proposals. The findings and conclusions reached by CHHC concerned only the status of rehabilitation services in Connecticut. Indeed, CHHC specifically instructed that \u201c[n]o testimony concerning the specific proposals for any rehabilitation service certificates of need filed or expected to be filed with the Commission will be received at this proceeding.\u201d Because the investigatory hearing was not a contested case, the UAPA protections did not apply to that hearing. There is no requirement under the UAPA that CHHC provide all the rights afforded parties in a contested case in an investigatory proceeding. The plaintiffs, therefore, did not have the right at the investigatory hearing to cross-examine witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Moreover, the investigatory proceeding was not, in this case, an adjudicatory function of CHHC. Although the investigation may be related to the plaintiffs\u2019 contested case, the scope of the investigation itself was associated with CHHC\u2019s regulatory duty. This is an example of the overlap of CHHC\u2019s regulatory and adjudicatory functions. CHHC was investigating the needs of the state of Connecticut concerning rehabilitation facilities. CHHC must be able to assess objectively and accurately the health care needs of the state in order to satisfy its regulatory duty to provide a comprehensive and efficient medical care system. To accept the plaintiffs\u2019 argument would be to tie CHHC\u2019s hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>by requiring it to make a decision that affects the regulation of rehabilitation in the state based solely on the \u201cevidentiary record and arguments advanced by the parties.\u201d C. Peck, \u201cRegulation and Control of Ex Parte Communications with Administrative Agencies,\u201d 76 Harv. L. Rev. 233, 261 n.113 (1962). Although, in some cases, presentation of the evidence by the parties may be adequate, the parties may occasionally fail to present the necessary evidence. Additionally, CHHC has the duty to act in the best interest of the state, while the parties generally act in their own best interest. These two objectives may occasionally conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that CHHC was within its authority to initiate a general fact finding investigation pursuant to \u00a7 19a-149.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The plaintiffs further argue that even if it was proper for CHHC to conduct an investigation, it was improper to introduce the report containing those findings into evidence in the contested case. This report, the plaintiffs claim, constituted an ex parte communication, and thus, the defendants had the burden of proving that the report did not prejudice the plaintiffs. See <em>Martone </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>207 Conn. 296, 301, 541 A.2d 488 (1988). Because we conclude that the report was not an ex parte communication within the meaning of the UAPA, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">After making findings and conclusions regarding the existing and needed rehabilitation facility, CHHC had to perform its adjudicatory function because the plaintiffs and the defendants submitted proposals to provide rehabilitation services. As adjudicators, CHHC was required to determine which proposal or proposals would fulfill the need for rehabilitation services in the most cost-effective manner. Because CHHC was then determining the right of the parties to provide reha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>bilitation services, this hearing constituted a contested case. As such, CHHC was required to afford all the rights and protections provided by the UAPA to the parties. At the contested hearing, it is undisputed that CHHC allowed the parties the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and to present relevant evidence. CHHC also introduced into evidence the report containing the findings and conclusions made at the prior investigatory hearing. The presiding officer, Farrell, specifically stated at the beginning of the contested hearing that the plaintiffs \u201ccould address any deficiencies [they] found in [the investigative report].\u201d The plaintiffs did not challenge the findings in the report, nor did they subpoena the witnesses from the investigatory hearing to cross-examine them at the contested hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The plaintiffs claim that, because CHHC introduced the report of the findings and conclusions from the uncontested hearing into evidence at the contested case, they were deprived of the protections and rights of the UAPA. The plaintiffs are contending, in effect, that CHHC\u2019s regulatory duty improperly interfered with their adjudicatory duty to provide the plaintiffs with a fair hearing. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the report was an ex parte communication and thus the burden is on the defendants to prove that it was not prejudicial to the plaintiffs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">An ex parte communication is not expressly defined in the UAPA. Instead, the UAPA provides restrictions on communications received or directed at the decision maker in a <em>contested case. </em>General Statutes \u00a7 4-181 (a)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>provides in part that \u201cno hearing officer ... in a contested case . . . shall communicate, directly or indirectly, in connection with any issue of fact, with any person or party, or, in connection with any issue of law . . . without notice and opportunity for all parties to participate.\u201d This court has stated that the purpose of \u00a7 4-181 is \u201cto prevent one party from exerting improper influence on the decisionmaker.\u201d <em>Martone </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The language of \u00a7 4-181 does not apply to this situation. Farrell, the decision maker, did not communicate with a person or party regarding any issue of fact or law in a contested case because the investigatory hearing, as conceded by the plaintiffs, was not a contested case. The communication received during that proceeding, therefore, was not a prohibited communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Moreover, the prohibition of certain communications in administrative proceedings is based on the principle that the decision maker should not receive information to which one or all of the parties are not given an opportunity to respond. The prohibition against ex parte communications \u201cis intended to preclude litigious facts reaching the deciding minds without getting into the record.\u201d Model State Administrative Procedure Act, comment to \u00a7 13,15 U.L. A. 292 (Master Ed. 1990); <em>Martone </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>supra, 303. This did not occur here. The report was introduced into evidence at the contested hearing and the plaintiffs were given an opportunity to explain or rebut the conclusions in the report or subpoena and cross-examine the witnesses at the investigatory hearing. Additionally, the plaintiffs were able to comment in writing regarding the investigatory hearing at various stages prior to the issuance of CHHC\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Unlike judicial proceedings, an administrative board \u201cmay act upon facts which are known to it even though they are not produced at the hearing.\u201d <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 292; <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, </em>supra, 349. Administrative agencies are \u201cnot bound as is a court to acquire information concerning matters involved in the proceedings before it entirely from the evidence produced.\u201d 2 Am. Jur. 2d 195, Administrative Law \u00a7 388. \u201c[I]t is generally held that even though an administrative authority has statutory power to make independent investigations, it is improper for it to base a decision or findings upon facts so obtained, unless such evidence is introduced at a hearing or otherwise brought to the knowledge of the interested parties prior to the decision, with an opportunity to explain and rebut.\u201d Id. An administrative agency may make use of reports and data gathered by members of its own staff or outside investigators or investigating bodies or reports or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>advisory panels, but generally cannot properly base its decision and findings upon such reports without introducing them in evidence so as to afford interested parties an opportunity to meet them. Id. \u201c[A]t the [contested] hearing no one may be deprived of the right to produce relevant evidence or to cross-examine witnesses produced by his adversary . . . .\u201d <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In this case, the plaintiffs were given the opportunity to rebut the conclusions in the report and an opportunity to subpoena witnesses and cross-examine them regarding their previous testimony.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The hearing officer, Farrell, stated at the beginning of the contested case that the parties could challenge the conclusions and findings in CHHC\u2019s report. Thus, although the plaintiffs chose not to challenge the findings and conclusions of the report or to subpoena witnesses, they were provided with the opportunity to do so. Accordingly, the report was properly introduced into evidence in the plaintiffs\u2019 contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that CHHC violated General Statutes \u00a7 4-176e<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> by assigning Farrell to preside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>over the contested hearing because he had also conducted the prior independent investigation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Section 4-176e provides in pertinent part that \u201ca hearing in an agency proceeding may be held before . . . one or more hearing officers, provided no individual who has personally carried out the function of an investigator in a <em>contested case </em>may serve as a hearing officer in <em>that case . . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This statute forbids a person who has acted as an investigator in a contested case to sit as an adjudicator in that contested case. The statute does not apply to hearing officers sitting as presiding officers in general investigations that are not contested cases. The statute does not forbid an officer from conducting a general investigation in an uncontested case and subsequently presiding as the adjudicator in a contested case. In this case, the plaintiffs do not dispute that the general investigation conducted by Farrell was an uncontested case. Because Farrell conducted an investigation in an uncontested case, not a contested case, \u00a7 4-176e does not apply. Consequently, Farrell was not prohibited from sitting as the presiding officer in the plaintiffs\u2019 contested hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Furthermore, the fact that Farrell conducted a prior general investigation does not necessarily mean that his mind was \u201cirrevocably closed on the subject.\u201d <em>Federal Trade Commission </em>v. <em>Cement Institute, </em>333 U.S. 683, 701, 68 S. Ct. 793, 92 L. Ed. 1010 (1948). \u201cIt is not violative of due process for the same authority which initiated the subject of the hearing to listen to and determine its outcome as long as that authority gives the person appearing before it a fair, open and impartial hearing.\u201d <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, 2 </em>Conn. App. 551, 554 n.5, 481 A.2d 1096 (1984), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 199 Conn. 231, 506 A.2d 139 (1986), appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 802, 107 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>42, 93 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1986). An administrative agency-can be the investigator and adjudicator of the same matter without violating due process. <em>Withrow </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 46-55, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 43 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1975); <em>Petrowski </em>v. <em>Norwich Free Academy, </em>supra, 571 <em>(Borden, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Moreover, it should be noted that the plaintiffs failed to raise the disqualification of Farrell at the beginning of their contested case. The plaintiffs clearly knew, from their participation in the investigative hearing and the contested case, that Farrell was the investigative hearing officer and that he was subsequently appointed as the hearing officer in the contested case. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs did not request a different adjudicator at the contested hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u201cWe have made it clear that we will not permit parties to anticipate a favorable decision, reserving a right to impeach it or set it aside if it happens to be against them, for a cause which was well known to them before or during the trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>202 Conn. 453, 462, 521 A.2d 1040 (1987); see <em>Knock </em>v. <em>Knock, </em>224 Conn. 776, 792, 621 A.2d 267 (1993). \u201cThe failure to raise a claim of disqualification with reasonable promptness after learning the ground for such a claim ordinarily constitutes a waiver thereof.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Clisham </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>223 Conn. 354, 367, 613 A.2d 254 (1992); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The plaintiffs obviously knew of Farrell\u2019s dual participation, but nevertheless \u201ccontinued to participate at the hearing and to seek a favorable resolution of the proceeding on the merits.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 463. We conclude, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>that the plaintiffs failed to raise the argument of disqualification pursuant to \u00a7 4-176e within a reasonable period of time and have thus waived it.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In this opinion Borden and F.

In this consolidated case, two medical consortium groups, one headed by Hartford Hospital (the plaintiffs) and the other by St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center (the defendants) submitted applications for a certificate of need to the commission on hospitals and health care to create an additional rehabilitation facility in Hartford. Both groups had rehabilitative beds in their current operations. CHHC consolidated the two applications in one hearing, deciding that, at best, there was room for only one additional rehabilitation facility. It granted the defendants\u2019 application as amended and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The plaintiffs took two separate appeals to the Superior Court from the decision of CHHC. In Docket No. 14586, the plaintiffs appealed the decision granting the defendants\u2019 application. In Docket No. 14617, the plaintiffs appealed the decision denying their application. Both appeals raised the same issues on the merits. The court, <em>Bums, J., </em>granted a motion to dismiss in Docket No. 14586 based on a claim of lack of standing of the plaintiffs to appeal a decision granting the defendants\u2019 application. The court, <em>Hodgson, J., </em>rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the denial of their own application on the merits of the case. The plaintiffs appealed from both decisions and the cases were consolidated for argument in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">How far the court door should be open to plaintiffs in administrative appeals has been the subject of debate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>throughout the country. On one end of the spectrum of decisions on the subject of \u201caggrievement\u201d or \u201cstanding to appeal\u201d are those jurists who would open the door of aggrievement only when the merits of the case invite their philosophical attention. At the other end of the spectrum are those jurists who would allow most plaintiffs through the door of aggrievement without much question. See comment, \u201cStanding of Third Parties to Challenge Administrative Agency Actions,\u201d 76 Cal. L. Rev. 1061 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">If Connecticut is to have a practical concept of aggrievement to ensure that there is a real case with a real injury as philosophically commended in <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, 210 Conn. 646, 556 A.2d 1020 (1989), then the facts of this case call out for \u201cstanding\u201d and \u201caggrievement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The decision to grant the defendants\u2019 application is the alter ego of the decision to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 application. The two are inextricably linked and should be linked and consolidated for purposes of aggrievement and appeal. .</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">If similar cases in the future are not consolidated by this court or the Superior Court for aggrievement purposes, CHHC could be faced with reconsidering an unsuccessful applicant\u2019s application after a successful applicant had commenced service in an area where CHHC found service should be limited to only one service provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The plaintiffs here do have a specific personal and legal interest in the granting of the defendants\u2019 application, and additionally, the plaintiffs\u2019 interests have been legally and injuriously affected by the granting of the defendants\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">I agree with the dissent\u2019s treatment of aggrievement.

I agree that we must have some rules to protect litigants from unjusticiable litigation\u2014 but those rules of jurisdiction must be reasonable. We have repeatedly held that \u201c[sjtanding is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented. . . . These two objectives are ordinarily held to have been met when a complainant makes a colorable claim of [a] direct injury he has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity. Such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy . . . provides the requisite assurance of concrete adverseness and diligent advocacy.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>210 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Conn. 646, 648-49, 556 A.2d 1020, on remand, 19 Conn. App. 539, 563 A.2d 314 (1989). I would find that the plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> have standing to appeal from the order of the defendant Commission on Hospitals and Health Care (CHHC) granting to the defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a certificate of need for rehabilitation beds.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">What is especially troubling to me is that this appeal involves not only the rights of the litigant health care providers, but also the interests of the public in cost effective and efficient medical treatment. The public interest is not served unless we give competing health care providers standing to appeal the grant of a competitor\u2019s certificate of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The majority holds that the plaintiffs are not aggrieved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I agree that ordinarily \u201caggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>I believe that the plaintiffs have satisfied this standard because they are health care providers competing with the defendants for the same certificate of need to provide rehabilitative services.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The record made it clear that the parties were in competition with each other and that one and only one certificate of need would be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both parties submitted applications for a certificate of need for rehabilitation beds, which were consolidated by CHHC for hearing purposes. The CHHC record indicates that there was a limited need for rehabilitation beds in the service area targeted by the plaintiffs and the defendants. CHHC inventoried the existing rehabilitation beds in this area and found that the recent use of the total of 113 beds was approximately 58 percent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>CHHC compared the quality of current rehabilitative services delivered by the defendants to that delivered by the plaintiffs in granting the defendants their certif\u00edcate of need. These facts demonstrate unequivocally that the parties were competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Common sense dictates that when CHHC acts upon competing proposals, granting one and denying the other, the party who is denied the certificate of need is aggrieved. This is especially so when only one certificate will be awarded. The fact that the order is not directed at the party who claims aggrievement is not controlling. We have recently held that a party \u201cmay legitimately claim to have been adversely affected by an administrative . . . action without having been the person to whom the order is directed.\u201d <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 300, 311, 603 A.2d 1131 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">What is particularly significant is that CHHC would be required to consider the fact that it had already granted the defendants a certificate of need in a limited service area if it were asked to reconsider the plaintiffs\u2019 application. In <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Carey. Stamford Hospital, </em>208 Conn. 663, 668-69, 546 A.2d 257 (1988), this court held that \u201c[General Statutes] \u00a7 19a-154 specifies a number of factors [CHHC] must consider in determining whether to approve a request for a new function or service. These factors include the availability of such service or function at other inpatient rehabilitation facilities . . . within the area to be served, the need for such service or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>function within such area, and other factors that the commission deems relevant to the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Furthermore, and of great significance, CHHC designated the plaintiffs a \u201cparty\u201d to the consolidated proceedings. \u201cWhile the plaintiffs\u2019 status as parties at the agency level does not constitute aggrievement; <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>[193 Conn. 59, 66, 475 A.2d 283 (1984)]; the trial court should have closely reviewed this administrative finding because many of the elements considered by the agency in granting this status closely track the elements that the court would have to find to determine whether a party is aggrieved.\u201d <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 168, 178, 592 A.2d 386 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The majority misconstrues our recent decision in <em>Unisys Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Labor, </em>220 Conn. 689, 600 A.2d 1019 (1991). In <em>Unisys Corporation, </em>a unanimous court recognized that the plaintiff would have established a specific personal and legal interest to challenge the state\u2019s award of a contract to a \u201cpotential competitor\u201d if the plaintiff could show that it would have submitted a bid but for the single source specifications. Id., 694-95.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The present case is far more compelling than <em>Unisys Corporation. </em>The plaintiffs in this case were more than potential competitors; they were actual competitors seeking a certificate of need from CHHC. Hartford Hospital was an actual competitor in the business of operating rehabilitation beds. We should grant standing to the plaintiffs in this case on the basis of the public policy concerns that guided our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>in <em>Unisys Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Labor, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he public interest in preventing the granting of contracts through arbitrary or capricious action can properly be vindicated through a suit <em>brought by one who suffers injury </em>as a result of the illegal activity, but the suit itself is brought in the public interest by one acting essentially as a \u2018private attorney general.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., 694; <em>Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>424 F.2d 859, 864 (D.C. Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The facts establish with certainty that (1) the plaintiffs have a specific personal and legal interest in the granting of the defendants\u2019 application for a certificate of need for rehabilitation beds in the service area in which they both operate, and (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 interest has been specially and injuriously affected by CHHC\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Even if we should view the aggrievement issue by focusing our lens <em>only on the application granted to the defendants, </em>as the majority does, the plaintiffs are still aggrieved. This court recently held in <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 173, that a plaintiff could satisfy the first prong of the aggrievement test by demonstrating that it provided similar services that would be authorized by the agency granting the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">That is precisely the case here. Although Hartford Hospital does not have a certificate of need, it does have ten rehabilitation beds, as acknowledged by CHHC.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Given that the test under <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, is the supply of similar services, and that Hartford Hospital and the defendants provide the same service\u2014rehabilitation beds\u2014the test is clearly satisfied in this case. The majority never explains why the supply of similar services fails to satisfy the test in this case. Instead, the majority sidesteps the plaintiffs\u2019 claim by noting that Hartford Hospital was merely a coapplicant and that Hartford Hospital never claimed aggrievement on the basis of its existing rehabilitation beds. First, whether Hartford Hospital is aggrieved is not dependent upon its status as a coapplicant or as the sole applicant. The majority cites no authority for this unusual claim. Second, the plaintiffs unequivocally argue that they were in competition with the defendants. They claim aggrievement under <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, on the basis of their interest in being free from unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The trial court did not reach the second prong of the aggrievement test, which merely requires the possibility of injury. The following facts more than establish the <em>possibility </em>that the plaintiffs\u2019 interest has been specially and injuriously affected by CHHC\u2019s granting of the defendants\u2019 application. As noted above, in granting the defendants\u2019 certificate of need, CHHC was required to consider the availability of rehabilitative services in the service area. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154 (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court held in <em>Light Rigging Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 177, that since the statute required the agency \u201cto consider public need for the services to be rendered by an applicant before granting a certificate . . . existing certificate holders are entitled to be free of competition for which no need has been shown.\u201d Hartford Hospital is presently authorized to provide ten rehabilitation beds, and it, too, is entitled to be free of competition for which no need has been shown. When CHHC ultimately granted the certificate of need to the defendants, there was at least a possibility that Hartford Hospital\u2019s ability to operate these beds would be injured. Although the defendants\u2019 certificate of need ostensibly did not add general hospital beds, it did in fact add twenty-seven <em>rehabilitation </em>beds to the service area.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This increases the number of rehabilitation beds by 23 percent, over the current total of 113 beds, and will undoubtedly affect Hartford Hospital\u2019s ability to market its ten beds. This is especially significant when one considers that there is presently only a 58 percent utilization rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">By sustaining the trial court\u2019s decision on the issue of aggrievement and foreclosing the plaintiffs from a judicial review of CHHC\u2019s determination, the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>fails to give effect to our time honored rules regarding aggrievement for jurisdictional purposes. First, \u201c[e]very presumption which favors the jurisdiction of the court should be indulged.\u201d <em>Tuccio </em>v. <em>Zehrung, </em>164 Conn. 231, 232, 319 A.2d 406 (1973). Second, \u201cstanding is an examination of the parties, not the merits of the action.\u201d <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 64, 441 A.2d 68 (1981). Third, aggrievement is established if there \u201cis a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660 (1953). Instead, the majority uses aggrievement as a bolt on the doors of the courthouse to exclude the plaintiffs from a review of CHHC\u2019s decision and thereby deprives the public of a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d who could vindicate their rights by assuring that these health care services are delivered in a cost effective and efficient manner. The real losers today are the public. I would reverse the decision of the trial court and remand the case for a hearing on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 Case for a Certificate of Need</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">(14617)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Although CHHC is authorized to conduct an investigation to determine the availability, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of rehabilitative services in Connecticut hospitals; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-149; the investigative report should not have been entered into evidence, over the plaintiffs\u2019 objection, in considering their application for a certificate of need. Due process, which entails fundamental fairness, is not left outside the door just because it is an administrative hearing. \u2018 \u2018Due process of law requires that the parties involved [in an administrative proceeding] have an opportunity to know the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>facts on which the commission is asked to act, to cross-examine witnesses and to offer rebuttal evidence.\u201d <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, 167 Conn. 202, 207, 355 A.2d 21 (1974); <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Department of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 346, 64 A.2d 330 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In the present case, Commissioner Farrell acted as both the investigator and the adjudicator in determining whether a certificate of need would be granted and to whom it would be granted. His conclusions about the accessibility and delivery of rehabilitative services, which he first made in the investigation and later entered into evidence as an adjudicator, were directly contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in support of their application. Since Farrell failed to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 application for party status in the investigation, the investigative report and his conclusions should not have been admitted into evidence in the hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">First, the plaintiffs were not able to cross-examine the sources of the evidence because they were not given party status for the investigatory proceedings, notwithstanding their specific request. Not only does due process require that a party who will be affected be given the right to cross-examine a witness; <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 207; but General Statutes \u00a7 4-178 (5) also provides that \u201ca party . . . may conduct cross-examinations required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\u201d The majority would permit CHHC to avoid these constitutional and statutory safeguards merely by convening an investigatory proceeding and barring an interested party from participating in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The majority rejects this claim because \u201cthe plaintiffs were given the opportunity to rebut the conclusions in the report and an opportunity to subpoena witnesses and cross-examine them regarding their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>previous testimony.\u201d The plaintiffs point out, however, that contemporaneous cross-examination is essential for effective cross-examination. Moreover, cross-examination, to be effective, must occur before the investigating officer finalizes his conclusions. The touchstone of due process is the right to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S. Ct. 1187, 14 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Second, and most important, is the fact that Farrell was both the investigating officer and the adjudicating officer. As the investigating officer, Farrell arrived at conclusions bearing on the certificate of need that are directly contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 position. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs were never given a chance to be heard before he made his decision as an investigator. Farrell, later acting as the adjudicator on the plaintiffs\u2019 application, allowed his investigative report with all its findings and conclusions to be entered into evidence, thereby placing the plaintiffs in the awkward position of undermining his investigation in order to prove him wrong. This procedure turns a neutral adjudicator into one who has a stake in the proceedings\u2014 that is, the plaintiffs must assume the uphill burden of demonstrating to the adjudicator that his investigatory findings and conclusions, which were publicly announced, are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The legislature sought to avoid this danger by enacting General Statutes \u00a7 4-176e, which provides that \u201cno individual who has personally carried out the function of an investigator in a contested case may serve as a hearing officer in that case . . . .\u2019\u2019The majority avoids \u00a7 4-176e by employing a narrow reading of the statute. It would allow CHHC to avoid \u00a7 4-176e, as it did in this case, simply by declaring that the investigation is separate and distinct from the consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>merits of any pending application and assigning a different docket number to the investigation. This conflicts with our longstanding rule of construction under which we \u201cassume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 507-508, 542 A.2d 700 (1988). Furthermore, the majority allows CHHC to do exactly the mischief that the legislature intended to avoid\u2014that is, to have the same person be an investigator and adjudicator for the same matter. In construing a statute we \u201cmust avoid a consequence which fails to attain a rational and sensible result which bears most directly on the object which the legislation sought to obtain.\u201d <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 276, 545 A.2d 530 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">I would find that CHHC, under the circumstances of this case, should not have allowed the investigative report into evidence. Accordingly, I would remand this case to the trial court with instruction to sustain the appeal and remand it to CHHC for the purpose of affording the plaintiffs a hearing on their application for a certificate of need by an adjudicator other than Farrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\"> The plaintiffs in both appeals are New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc., Hartford Hospital, the Institute of Living and AdvantageHealth Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\"> The defendants are Central Connecticut Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc., Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, the Mount Sinai Hospital Corporation and the Hartford Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc., and the Commission on Hospitals and Health Care (CHHC).

Furthermore, the chairman stated: \u201cI am not totally convinced that we need additional rehab beds in Connecticut. I think there may be different ways of improving rehab, but not being sure, I\u2019m going to go along with this decision, giving the [certificate of need] to the [Hartford Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of] Continental Medical Systems with St. Francis and Mt. Sinai. But let me lay this out to others that may be looking at this. The amount of convincing that I\u2019m going to have to hear for additional rehab beds at this point in time is going to have to be real good and real convincing because I\u2019m not sure that we really do need any more.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> CHHC indicates the following utilization of existing rehabilitation beds within the applicants\u2019 primary service area:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">\u201cMount Sinai Hospital 24 beds 51% utilization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">Saint Francis Hospital 9 beds 78% utilization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">New Britain Memorial 48 beds 65% utilization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">Newington Children\u2019s 22 beds 38% utilization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">Hartford Hospital 10 beds Not available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">In calculating the total percentage of utilization, I did not include the ten beds operated by Hartford Hospital because the record did not supply information on its utilization. If we were to assume, however, that Hartford Hospital had a utilization rate of 100 percent, the overall utilization rate would be 61 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">The investigatory report by CHHC also indicates that the need for rehabilitative services is met by a variety of sources as follows: \u201cAlthough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>an inventory cannot be issued, the foregoing [report] indicates that inpatient rehabilitative services may be provided in many alternative settings, e.g., acute care hospital exempt units as well as non-exempt units, rehabilitation hospitals (in Connecticut these hospitals are licensed as chronic disease hospitals), and skilled nursing facilities.\u201d Commission on Hospital and Health Care Investigation of Rehabilitative Services, Docket No. 91-10066RES, May 1, 1991, p. 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> \u201cAccordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff in this case would have standing if it is able to prove that it would have submitted a bid on the RFPs [requests for proposals] but for the single source specifications, that its equipment and software is equivalent to that specified in the RFPs and that the restrictions of the single source specifications undermined the object and integrity of the competitive bidding process, or that there was proof of favoritism.\u201d <em>Unisys Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Labor, </em>220 Conn. 689, 695, 600 A.2d 1019 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"> A certificate of need is necessary only to establish a new facility or expand an existing facility; thus, the fact that Hartford Hospital does not have a certificate of need is inconsequential. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-154 and 19a-155. In addition, CHHC acknowledged that there is no category for rehabilitation beds in Connecticut. The CHHC report states the following: \u201cIt must be noted that in Connecticut there is not a licensure category for rehabilitation beds; rather rehabilitation beds exist under several licensure categories. Beds located in the acute care hospitals (Mount Sinai Hospital, Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Hartford Hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>and Newington Children\u2019s Hospital) are licensed as acute care beds, while beds located at New Britain Memorial Hospital and Gaylord Hospital are licensed as chronic disease beds.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 19a-154 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe commission shall make such review of a request made pursuant to subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section as it deems necessary, including, in the case of a proposed transfer of ownership or control prior to initial licensure, such factors as, but not limited to, the financial responsibility and business interests of the transferee and the ability of the institution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>to continue to provide needed services, or in the case of the introduction of an additional function or service, ascertaining the availability of such service or function at other inpatient rehabilitation facilities, health care facilities or institutions or state health care facilities or institutions within the area to be served, the need for such service or function within such area and any other factors which the commission deems relevant to a determination of whether the facility or institution is justified in introducing such additional functions or services into its program or increasing its staff.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b180-13\"> The certificate of need grants sixty rehabilitation beds to the defendants. In turn, it requires Mount Sinai Hospital Corporation to give up twenty-four rehabilitation beds and Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center to give up nine rehabilitation beds, for a total of thirty-three rehabilitation beds. The certificate of need also reduces Mount Sinai Hospital Corporation\u2019s licensed capacity by twenty-seven beds, but these are general beds, not rehabilitation beds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
