The plaintiff, Doreen Morelli, appeals, pursuant to our grant of certification,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court dismissing her appeal from the denial by the trial court of her motion to open the \u00a7 251 dismissal. <em>Morelli </em>v. <em>Manpower, Inc., </em>29 Conn. App. 132, 612 A.2d 818 (1992). We hold that the denial of a motion to open a \u00a7 251 dismissal is an appealable judgment and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>The Appellate Court opinion set forth the following facts. \u201cThe plaintiff brought this negligence action against the defendant on August 23, 1989. The plaintiff claimed that she was injured due to the negligence of a fellow employee while she was employed at Sears, Roebuck and Company. A motion to implead by the defendant, Manpower, Inc., was granted and a third party complaint against Sears, claiming breach of contract and indemnification, was filed. On April 17, 1991, the case appeared on the Superior Court dormancy calendar, with a notice that the action would be dismissed on June 28, 1991, if [the plaintiff] failed to close the pleadings or appear on that date. On June 10, 1991, the plaintiff filed a motion to exempt the action from the dormancy calendar. On June 28, 1991, the action was dismissed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251 for the failure of the plaintiff to prosecute with reasonable diligence. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment of dismissal, which was denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This appeal is from that denial.\u201d <em>Morelli </em>v. <em>Manpower, Inc., </em>supra, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>The Appellate Court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, in justifiable reliance on our decision in <em>Governors Grove Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill Development Corporation, </em>187 Conn. 509, 446 A.2d 1082 (1982) <em>(Governors Grove), </em>in which we held that the denial of a motion to open a \u00a7 251 dismissal is not appealable. We now conclude, however, that for two reasons <em>Governors Grove </em>should be overruled and, therefore, that the denial of a motion to open a \u00a7 251 judgment of dismissal is an appealable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">First, the precedential underpinnings of <em>Governors Grove </em>are no longer sound. In <em>Governors Grove, </em>we held that a motion to open a \u00a7 251 dismissal \u201cis a motion to restore the case to the docket\u201d; id., 511; and that \u201cthe decision on a motion to restore a case to the docket is not itself appealable.\u201d Id., 512. For the proposition that the decision on a motion to restore a case to the docket is not appealable, <em>Governors Grove </em>relied principally on four cases: <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>64 Conn. 526, 535, 30 A. 775 (1894); <em>Glazer </em>v. <em>Rosoff, </em>120 Conn. 120, 122, 179 A. 407 (1935); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>134 Conn. 198, 201, 56 A.2d 171 (1947); and <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Gachim, </em>183 Conn. 413, 416, 439 A.2d 379 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">It is true that, in <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, this court stated, in dictum, that there was no right of appeal from the denial of a motion to restore a case to the docket. <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal </em>did not, however, explain the rationale for that statement. That rationale was not stated until the decision in <em>Glazer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>In <em>Glazer </em>v. <em>Rosoff, </em>supra, 122, we stated that, although a judgment striking a case from the docket was a final, appealable judgment, a \u201cmotion to restore a case struck from the docket <em>is like a motion to reopen a judgment; the decision upon it is not the basis of an appeal </em>but it may postpone the limitation of the time within which an appeal from the judgment striking the case from the docket must be taken.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The rationale, therefore, for considering the denial of a motion to restore a case to the docket as a nonappealable decision was that it was analogous to the denial of a motion to open a judgment, which apparently was nonappealable when <em>Glazer </em>was decided. <em>Nickerson </em>and <em>Miller </em>followed <em>Glazer </em>without examining its rationale, as did <em>Governors Grove.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The rationale of <em>Glazer, </em>however, has not withstood the test of time. The denial of a motion to open a judgment is now appealable. <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>216 Conn. 341, 356, 579 A.2d 1054 (1990); <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>193 Conn. 342, 346 n.4, 477 A.2d 115 (1984); <em>Gryskiewicz </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>147 Conn. 260, 261, 159 A.2d 163 (1960); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fahey, </em>146 Conn. 55, 59, 147 A.2d 476 (1958). Because the original analogy no longer holds true, the rationale based on that analogy must fall as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Indeed, we have not been fully consistent in applying the rationale of <em>Glazer. </em>On at least three occasions we have considered claims of error in the denial of motions to open \u00a7 251 dismissals, without explicitly questioning our jurisdiction to do so. See <em>Grunschlag </em>v. <em>Ethel Walker School, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 679, 685, 462 A.2d 1 (1983); <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>169 Conn. 154, 160, 362 A.2d 831 (1975); <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Revson, </em>159 Conn. 427, 431, 270 A.2d 559 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Second, logic requires that the denial of a motion to open a \u00a7 251 dismissal be appealable because: (1) a \u00a7 251 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>dismissal is appealable; and (2) the denial of such a motion is functionally the same as the denial of a motion to open a disciplinary judgment of nonsuit, which is appealable. As this court in <em>Governors Grove, </em>supra, 510 n.2, recognized, <em>\u201ca </em>dismissal under \u00a7 251 is a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\u201d <em>Milgrim </em>v. <em>Deluca, </em>195 Conn. 191, 194, 487 A.2d 522 (1985). In terms of finality, we can perceive no difference between the judgment of dismissal itself and the denial of a motion to open that judgment. Because, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-592,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the accidental failure of suit stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>ute, both the dismissal and the denial of a motion to open the dismissal may be followed by reinstitution of the underlying claim regardless of whether a motion to open the judgment has been filed; see <em>Lacasse </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>214 Conn. 464, 473, 572 A.2d 357 (1990); <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 28, 34 n.6, 474 A.2d 787 (1984); there is nothing less \u201cfinal\u201d about the denial of a motion to open the judgment of dismissal than there is about the judgment of dismissal itself. Furthermore, consistent with our jurisprudence that a denial of a motion to open a judgment is appealable, we have implicitly held that a denial of a motion to open a judgment of nonsuit for failure to appear for a scheduled trial is an appealable judgment. See <em>Gryskiewicz </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra. We can perceive no functional difference, in terms of appealability, between a denial of a motion to open a judgment of nonsuit in such a circumstance and a denial of a motion to open a judgment of dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 251. Both denials act as disciplinary actions that, in effect, affirm the trial court\u2019s initial decision to preclude a plaintiff from pursuing his or her claim in the course of that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 251 provides: \u201cdismissal for lack of diligence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-9\">\u201cIf a party -shall fail to prosecute an action with reasonable diligence, the court may, after hearing, on motion by any party to the action pursuant to Sec. 196, or on its own motion, render a judgment dismissing the action with costs.

Judgment files shall not be drawn except where an appeal is taken or where any party so requests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-11\">\u201cIf a case is printed on a dormancy calendar pursuant to the dormancy program administered under the direction of the chief court administrator, and a motion for default for failure to plead is filed pursuant to Sec. 128, only those papers which close the pleadings by joining issues, or raise a special defense, may be filed by any party, unless the court otherwise orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b850-12\"> We granted certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder what circumstances, if any, is the denial of a motion to open a judgment of dismissal under Practice Book \u00a7 251 an appealable judgment?\u201d <em>Morelli </em>v. <em>Manpower, Inc., </em>224 Conn. 908, 615 A.2d 1049 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b851-5\"> \u201cThe plaintiff claimed that she did not receive notice of the June 28, 1991 dismissal until November 19, 1991. The plaintiffs counsel claimed that he became aware of the judgment of dismissal during a discussion with the defendant\u2019s counsel regarding a pending motion for summary judgment dated July 2, 1991, which was scheduled for hearing on the short calendar of November 25, 1991. The plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment on November 21, 1991. A hearing on the plaintiff's motion to open was scheduled for December 2, 1991, but it was not acted upon on that date. A computer generated notice, dated December 18, 1991, referring to a judgment dated December 5, 1991, was issued by the Superior Court clerk\u2019s office and stated that the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open the judgment was granted. Thereafter, the motion to open appeared on the December 9, 1991 calendar and the trial court, <em>Aronson, J., </em>denied the motion to open. Notice of this decision was issued on December 9, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\u201cThe denial was based on <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Behar, </em>15 Conn. App. 308, 544 A.2d 250 (1988), which held that a trial court has no jurisdiction to open a judgment beyond the four month period described in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a and Practice Book \u00a7 326. See also <em>Van Mecklenburg </em>v. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 517, 494 A.2d 549 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">\u201cOn January 10, 1992, the trial court issued a notice that stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>\u2018[conflicting notices were sent on this motion.
