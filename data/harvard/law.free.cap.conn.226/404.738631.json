App. 800, 609 A.2d 1034 (1992); discloses the relevant history. The defendant, The Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation, hired the plaintiff, Dominic Fulco, to be its director of finance in 1985 and discharged him in 1989. Id., 802. The plaintiff filed a multicount complaint claiming that he was entitled to recover damages: (1) on contractual and statutory grounds arising out of unused and uncompensated vacation days; and (2) for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of the manner of his discharge. Id. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s rulings in favor of the defendant with regard to issues arising out of the unused vacation days, but reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling that the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act barred the plaintiff\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Id., 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The Appellate Court\u2019s decision was based on its application of the guidelines set forth in <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>176 Conn. 547, 556, 398 A.2d 1161 (1979), for the determination of whether an employee\u2019s injuries are work related. <em>Fulco </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation, </em>supra, 807. The court concluded that emotional distress caused by the manner of an employee\u2019s discharge is not a work related personal injury. Id., 808-809. The court held, therefore, that \u201c[t]he allegations of the plaintiffs complaint, if true, demonstrate that the plaintiff was neither within the period of his employment nor reasonably fulfilling the duties of employment or doing something incidental to it when he sustained his alleged injury.\u201d Id., 808. Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s common law cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress was not barred by \u00a7 31-284 (a), the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Id., 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we have concluded that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. The underlying issues have been fully considered in the opinion of the Appellate Court and it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. See <em>Farmington </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>224 Conn. 592, 593, 619 A.2d 852 (1993); <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>202 Conn. 404, 521 A.2d 565 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-284 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . but an employer shall secure compensation for his employees .... All rights and claims between employer and employees . . . arising out of personal injury . . . sustained in the course of employment as aforesaid are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\"> We granted the defendant permission to appeal the following certified issue: \u201cIn the circumstances of this case, was the plaintiff\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a)?\u201d Fulco v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation, 223 Conn. 917, </em>614 A.2d 821 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
