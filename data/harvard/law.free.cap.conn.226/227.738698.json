App. 435, 611 A.2d 427 (1992), discloses the relevant history. The plaintiffs, William Strong and Isabel Strong, filed an application with the defendant conservation commission of the town of Old Lyme (defendant) to construct a house and septic system within a regulated inland wetlands area. Id., 436. The defendant denied their application. Id. The plaintiffs appealed to the trial court, which concluded that there was no factual basis for the defendant\u2019s denial and ordered it to grant the application. Id., 436-37. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s substantive ruling, but reversed its mandate and ordered a remand of the case to the defendant for further consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 application. Id., 442-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In the course of its opinion, the Appellate Court held that the administrative record failed to \u201cdisclose sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>stantial, reliable evidence to support the [defendant\u2019s] findings and conclusions.\u201d Id., 442. The defendant successfully petitioned this court for certification on the premise that the Appellate Court had improperly imposed upon the defendant the burden of proving compliance with the statutory requirement, contained in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that no permit for the conduct of a regulated activity in a wetland should be issued \u201cunless the commissioner finds that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Our examination of the record on this appeal, and the briefs and arguments of the parties, persuades us that the defendant\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. At oral argument in this court, the parties agreed that the plaintiffs had the burden of proving compliance with the statutory requirements for a wetlands permit. There was, therefore, no controversy about the question on which certification had been granted. Instead, the disagreement between the parties devolved into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>their disparate views on the substantive issue of whether the plaintiffs had met their burden of persuasion. The Appellate Court\u2019s comprehensive opinion thoroughly and properly addresses that issue and resolves it against the defendant. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained. In these circumstances, we conclude that certification was improvidently granted. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Novoa, </em>224 Conn. 322, 324, 618 A.2d 30 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>224 Conn. 163, 168, 617 A.2d 460 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"><em> We </em>granted the named defendant permission to appeal the following certified issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court improperly place the burden on the conservation commission to establish that no feasible and prudent alternative existed to the plaintiffs\u2019 application?\u201d <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>224 Conn. 902, 615 A.2d 1046 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-41 provides: \u201cFACTORS FOR consideration OF COMMISSIONER.
