The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants claiming that each was liable to her for damages for conspiracy to interfere with her custodial relationship with the children, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and aiding and abetting in the children\u2019s abduction. The trial court, <em>Blue, J., </em>rendered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>judgment in favor of the plaintiff against Sylvia and Evelyn Marshak and James Ambadjes on the ground that they were liable to her for conspiracy and aiding and abetting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ambadjes appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred his appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The trial court found the following relevant facts. Prior to the abduction of the children, Sheldon Marshak and the plaintiff were married in Waterbury on March 22,1975, and had lived together as husband and wife with six children in their home in Cheshire. The plaintiff had custody of two children from an earlier marriage. During her marriage to Sheldon, she had given birth to four more children, who are the children involved in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Sheldon operated a paint and building supply business in Waterbury. The defendant lived in Waterbury where he had owned and operated a body shop known as Ambas Auto Works. Sheldon and the defendant frequently had conducted business together. They also appeared to be close friends. Sheldon had occasionally taken his children to the defendant\u2019s house, and the defendant had stored a number of motor vehicles on the Marshak property. In 1985, the defendant and his wife had decided that they would purchase a lot from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the Marshaks and planned to build a house next to the Marshaks\u2019 home in Cheshire. The defendant and his wife met with Sheldon and the plaintiff in June, 1985, to negotiate the purchase of the lot. They reached an agreement whereby a deposit would be placed on the property. There was no documentation of the agreement. The defendant\u2019s wife, however, on June 10,1985, had written a check for $1000 to Sheldon. Thereafter, on July 1, she had written a check for $1000 to the plaintiff and on July 15, had made out three bank checks in the amount of $1000 each to the plaintiff. On August 1, 1985, a check in the amount of $3600 had been issued by Ambas Auto Works to Sheldon Marshak.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Toward the end of July, 1985, the plaintiff had told Sheldon that she wanted a divorce. On August 6,1985, she had consulted a lawyer for the first time. Also on August 6,1985, Sheldon had gone to the Ambas Auto Works and had asked the defendant if he would drive him and his children to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York the next day. The defendant had agreed. Sheldon had then returned home at approximately 7 p.m. on August 6 and had begun an altercation with the plaintiff. Fearing that Sheldon would assault her, she had run to a telephone in the house to call the police.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sheldon had followed her and, before she could reach the phone, he had ripped it from the wall. The plaintiff had then fled to other parts of the house, attempting to reach other phones, only to have her husband rip the phones from the wall before she could use them. Thereafter, Sheldon had gathered the children together and had ordered them into his car. After getting into the car with the children, he informed the plaintiff, who had exited the house in an attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>to prevent his leaving with the children, that if she did not get out of the way he would \u201crun over\u201d her and he then drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Approximately one hour after this incident, the plaintiff called Sylvia Marshak, Sheldon\u2019s mother, at her home in Waterbury and inquired whether Sheldon was there. Sylvia denied knowing where he was. The plaintiffs brother then drove by Sylvia\u2019s house and observed Sheldon\u2019s car parked in her driveway. Sheldon later drove to the defendant\u2019s house with the four children and remained there for forty-five minutes to one hour. At 2:30 the next morning, August 7, Sheldon called the plaintiff. He told her that he was in New York and that he intended to take the children to the Bronx Zoo that day. He also said that he was going to get some counseling from a rabbi and return home the following evening. Instead, at approximately. 7:45 that morning, Sheldon again went to the defendant\u2019s house with his children. Later that morning the defendant drove Sheldon and the children to the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Sheldon\u2019s car. En route to the airport, they stopped at the United States state department office in Stamford in order to obtain passports for the children. There the defendant apparently signed an affidavit identifying Sheldon so that Sheldon was able to obtain the passports. The defendant then drove to New York and dropped Sheldon and the children off at the airport where they boarded a plane for a flight to Tel Aviv, Israel. After leaving Sheldon and the children at the airport, the defendant drove Sheldon\u2019s car back to Waterbury and parked it in front of his own house.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Worried that her husband had not returned with the children, the plaintiff called the defendant at approximately 1:30 a.m. on August 8. The defendant told the plaintiff that he had not seen Sheldon in several days.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>When there was still no sign of the children by August 9, the plaintiff again called the defendant and pleaded with him to tell her where Sheldon and the children had gone. Again, the defendant denied knowing where they were. Also on August 9, still unaware of the whereabouts of her husband and children, the plaintiff filed an ex parte application for a protective order and a dissolution of marriage complaint with the Superior Court in Waterbury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Robert Glass granted an ex parte protective order and awarded the plaintiff temporary custody of the four missing children. Also on August 9, Judge John Ottaviano, Jr., signed a warrant for Sheldon\u2019s arrest for the crimes of disorderly conduct and reckless endangerment based on the incident of August 6 at the Marshak home.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On August 16,1985, the defendant went to the Marshaks\u2019 property and removed some of the vehicles that he had stored there. At that time, the plaintiff again asked the defendant if he had seen Sheldon and he again denied having seen Sheldon or knowing his whereabouts. During the trial, however, he admitted that he had spoken to Sheldon on the telephone on a weekly basis the first four to six weeks after Sheldon had flown to Israel. On August 19, the trial court, <em>Kremski, J., </em>held a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s application for temporary protective and custody orders and granted a continuance of the August 9 ex parte orders for ninety days. On September 23, the defendant returned to the Marshak property and removed more of his vehicles. At that time, he said nothing to the plaintiff regarding Sheldon\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Finally, on October 15, 1985, two months after the children had been removed from their home, the plaintiff received a telephone call from Sheldon. He told her that if she did not withdraw her dissolution action, she would never see the children again. On October 28, 1985, the Superior Court awarded pendente lite custody of the four missing children to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On February 10, 1986, the plaintiff, having learned that Sheldon was in Israel with the children, flew to that country in the first of several costly efforts to find the children and bring them back to Connecticut. The plaintiff located her husband and the children in Israel. She thereafter took up residence in Jerusalem and commenced legal proceedings there to recover custody of the children. Those proceedings resulted in an agreement, on April 22,1986, pursuant to which the parents were to have joint custody of the children and Sheldon was to return the children to the United States by June 28, 1986. The plaintiff returned to Connecticut to await their arrival. Neither Sheldon nor the children, however, returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">This precipitated two more trips to Israel by the plaintiff. On the second trip, the plaintiff participated in court proceedings in Jerusalem that had been initiated by Sheldon to gain custody of the children for himself. On November 19,1987, however, the Israeli court rendered a judgment awarding custody of all four children to the plaintiff. The court stayed execution of its judgment for fifteen days to allow Sheldon to appeal. While the judgment was stayed, Sheldon took the children out of school and disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The plaintiff next located her husband in Brazil. She flew to Brazil in June, 1991, and had Sheldon arrested in Sao Paulo. Before she could gain custody of the children, however, Sheldon was released by the police. He and the children thereafter disappeared and their current whereabouts are unknown to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">To commence this action the plaintiff, on February 7, 1989, filed a complaint against the defendant and her husband\u2019s mother and sisters claiming that they were jointly and severally liable for the damages she had suffered and was suffering as a result of the loss of the children. In three separate counts the plaintiff asserted that the defendant was liable for conspiracy to interfere with her custodial relationship, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and aiding and abetting in the abduction of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">On January 16, 1992, the trial court, <em>Blue, J., </em>after hearing three days of testimony and examining a number of documents, made extensive factual findings and reviewed the claimed theories of liability as they applied to all of the defendants. The court initially decided against using the plaintiff\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress as a basis for the defendants\u2019 liability. It reasoned that an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress exists in the context of behavior directed at a claimant and it is unlikely that abductions ordinarily occur for the specific purpose of tormenting the claimant. The trial court then adverted to the tort of child abduction (or interference with custodial relationship) and considered whether such a tort was, or should be, a legally cognizable cause of action in Connecticut. After reviewing authority from other jurisdictions, and the policy supporting such a cause of action, the trial court concluded that the tort of child abduction should be recognized by the Connecticut judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The court then found that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for having conspired with Sheldon Marshak and having aided and abetted him in committing the tort of child abduction. The trial court found that \u201c[fit is ... a fair inference from the facts already described and about to be described that [the defendant] knew very well that he was participating in a forcible abduction.\u201d The trial court further found that \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] conduct differs from Sylvia\u2019s and Evelyn\u2019s in that it was largely limited to assisting Sheldon in the initial abduction of August 6-7, 1985. [The defendant\u2019s] role was, however, a crucial one, for he took Sheldon and the children to the airport and enabled them to get passports. Without this assistance, none of the remaining events of this sad case would have been possible. The court finds [the defendant\u2019s] assistance to have been both substantial and necessary. The court has already found that he acted with full knowledge of what he was doing in combination with Sheldon. Under the circumstances he became a coabductor and, like Sylvia and Evelyn, a joint tortfeasor in the original sense of the term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The trial court then found that all the defendants were the proximate cause of the damages to the plaintiff for the loss of her children\u2019s companionship, loss of parental rights, emotional distress, and her economic loss. The court concluded, consequently, that the defendants were jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for such damages in the amount of $886,499.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Following the rendering of the trial court\u2019s judgment in a memorandum of decision dated January 16,1992, the defendant filed a motion to set aside the judgment. He argued that because there was no evidence offered at trial as to his alleged complicity in the conspiracy after August, 1985, he should be allowed to amend his pleadings to add the special defense of the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>limitations pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-577.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) refused to open the judgment to allow him to amend his pleadings to allege a special defense of the statute of limitations that would have defeated any liability for his alleged participation in the tort of child abduction; (2) concluded that the defendant was liable for the tort of child abduction when the children\u2019s father had joint legal custody of the children at the time of their removal from the family home; (3) disregarded the effect of the Israeli custody agreement of April 22, 1986, between the plaintiff and her former husband on the defendant\u2019s culpability; and (4) recognized the tort of child abduction when there is no such cause of action in Connecticut and when the complaint did not seek recovery under this common law theory, but rather under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98 of the penal code, which do not provide a basis for civil liability. Because we agree with the defendant on his second claim, that the trial court improperly concluded that he was liable for child abduction under the circumstances of this case, we reverse the judgment of the trial court as to him. Consequently, we are not required to address the defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The defendant claims that because the children\u2019s father had joint legal custody of the children at the time of their removal from the family home, the trial court improperly concluded that he was liable for conspiring with the father and aiding and abetting him in the abduction of the children. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court, after stating that courts in other jurisdictions have recognized the tort of child abduction; see <em>DiRuggiero </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>743 F.2d 1009, 1017-18 (3d Cir. 1984) (applying New Jersey law); <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>682 F.2d 1039, 1044 (D.C.

The court further noted that such a cause of action was sanctioned by the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977), \u00a7 700, which provides: \u201cOne who, with knowledge that the parent does not consent, abducts or otherwise compels or induces a minor child to leave a parent legally entitled to its custody or not to return to the parent after it has been left him, is subject to liability to the parent.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Section 700 of the Restatement (Second), however, does not expressly state that it applies to third parties acting at the direction of, or in complicity with a parent legally entitled to the joint custody of a child. The trial court nevertheless reasoned that because an abducting parent can be held liable for taking a child from a custodial parent, any third person who conspires with an abductor, or aids or abets in the abduction of a child, can also be held liable. See, e.g., <em>Fenslage </em>v. <em>Dawkins, </em>supra, 1109; <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Loeffler, </em>supra; <em>Kajtazi </em>v. <em>Kajtazi, </em>supra; <em>Kipper </em>v. <em>Vokolek, </em>546 S.W. 521, 525-26 (Mo. App. 1977); <em>La Grenade </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 331. In order to extend liability to the defendant, the trial court noted that \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98 of the penal code forbid the abduction of a child from a parent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-98 provides that a person is guilty of custodial interference when: \u201c(1) Being a relative of a child who is less than sixteen years old and intending to hold such child permanently or for a protracted period and knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he takes or entices such child from his lawful custodian ... or (3) knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he holds, keeps or otherwise refuses to return a child who is less than sixteen years old to such child\u2019s lawful custodian after a request by such custodian for the return of such child.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By referencing these statutes, the trial court suggested that third party civil liability can be imposed on any person, including a nonparent, for conspiring with, or aiding or abetting another to violate their provisions. That appears to have been the trial court\u2019s basis for creating a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Lloyd </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Loeffler, </em>supra (liability based on Wisconsin\u2019s criminal statute); <em>Rosefield </em>v. <em>Rosefield, </em>221 Cal. App. 2d 431, 433, 34 Cal. Rptr. 479 (1963) (liability based on California\u2019s criminal statute); <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Terebelo, </em>373 So. 2d 200, 202 (La. App. 1979) (liability based on Louisiana statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The trial court noted that liability could be imposed for child abduction upon a third party who aided another in the removal of a child from its custodial parent under a civil conspiracy theory. The contours of <em>\u201ca </em>civil action for conspiracy are: (1) a combination between two or more persons, (2) to do a criminal or an unlawful act or a lawful act by criminal or unlawful means, (3) an act done by one or more of the conspirators pursuant to the scheme and in furtherance of the object, (4) which act results in damage to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Maislen, </em>116 Conn. 433, 437, 165 A. 455 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">We agree with the trial court that the recognition of the tort of child abduction or custodial interference, as applied to either a parent or a third party, might well play an important role in encouraging the speedy return of abducted children to the custodial parent and in compensating that parent for the harm suffered from the child\u2019s absence. We also agree that such a tort may have a place in our jurisprudence. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion, however, that, under the circumstances of this case, the defendant was liable for such a tort.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In order to impose liability on a third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>for conspiring with or aiding another in the removal of children from the custodial parent, the third party must have conspired with, or aided the other, \u201cto do a criminal or an unlawful act or a lawful act by criminal or unlawful means.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Maislen, </em>supra. In this case, however, civil liability was predicated on acts that were not themselves unlawful when they occurred because on August 7, 1985, the date on which the defendant drove the children and their father to New York, the father still had joint legal custody of the children.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Under existing law, a factual predicate for any tort related to child abduction, however derived, is the unlawful custody of a child. The Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 700, for instance, does not impose liability on a parent who has legal custody of a child. Comment (c) to \u00a7 700 provides: \u201cWhen the parents are by law jointly entitled to the custody and earnings of the child, no action can be brought against one of the parents who abducts or induces the child to leave the other.\u201d Similarly, although a duty to a custodial parent may be inferred from \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98 of the penal code, the breach of such a duty would take place only if the alleged abductor in fact knows that he has no \u201clegal right\u201d to the child\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The trial court did not find that the defendant had knowingly conspired with the plaintiff\u2019s husband, Sheldon, or had aided and abetted his actions at a time other than when Sheldon had joint legal custody of the chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>dren.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court in fact stated in its memorandum of decision that \u201cSheldon had joint custody of the children until August 9, 1985, by which time they were in Israel and [the defendant\u2019s] role (and Sylvia\u2019s and Evelyn\u2019s initial roles) had already been played.\u201d The trial court nonetheless concluded that the fact that Sheldon had joint legal custody of the children during the time the defendant had allegedly conspired with and assisted him did not relieve the defendant of liability. To hold otherwise, according to the trial court, \u201cnot only overlooks the outrageousness of [his] actions prior to August 9, 1985, but it ignores the actual policy of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The trial court noted that \u00a7 700 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts is directed at actions \u201cbrought against one of the parents.\u201d The court determined, however, that \u201c[a]ctions against third parties assisting those parents stand on an altogether different footing.\u201d According to the trial court, the defendant, unlike a parent, is not jointly entitled to the custody of the child and, as a third party, had \u201cno right to decide who should have their custody.\u201d The trial court therefore concluded that the defendant\u2019s actions in assisting the father at a time when the father was jointly entitled to custody of the children provided the requisite basis for imposing liability upon the defendant for the harm the plaintiff had suffered up until the time of the trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The absence of a specific finding by the trial court that the defendant had conspired with or aided the children\u2019s father at a time after the father had been stripped of any legal entitlement to custody of the chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>dren is fatal to the plaintiffs claim. Although the trial court correctly stated that, standing alone, the plaintiffs claim that the defendant had conspired with or aided her husband was insufficient unless based on some underlying cause of action; see <em>Carney </em>v. <em>DeWess, </em>136 Conn. 256, 262, 70 A.2d 142 (1949); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Maislen, </em>supra; the trial court failed to find the facts necessary to satisfy the elements of an independent underlying cause of action. On August 7, 1985, when the defendant drove Sheldon and the children to the airport, Sheldon had not yet violated either \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 or 53a-98. Sheldon violated those provisions only after August 9, 1985, the date on which the court granted the plaintiff temporary custody of the children. The trial court, however, made no finding that the defendant conspired with or assisted Sheldon after August 7, 1985. The trial court found to the contrary that on August 7, the defendant\u2019s role \u201chad already been played.\u201d It would be an overly expansive reading of \u00a7 700 of the Restatement to impose liability for conspiracy on third parties, such as the defendant, who have agreed to assist or have assisted another in doing something that at the time was not unlawful. Moreover, although the legislature, by enacting \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98 of the penal code, may have codified a duty not to interfere with the rights of a custodial parent, the breach of such a duty can occur only if in fact the provisions of those statutes have been violated. A contrary construction would expand the ambit of such provisions \u201cby implication to create a liability which no language of the act purports to create.\u201d <em>Nowak </em>v. <em>Nowak, </em>175 Conn. 112, 125, 394 A.2d 716 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The plaintiff argues, and the trial court concluded, however, that an expansion of the coverage of the tort of child abduction to apply to the present facts was warranted because it was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that his actions on August 7, 1985, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>subsequently deprive the plaintiff of the rightful custody of the children. In the view of the plaintiff and the trial court, the reasonable foreseeability that his actions might ultimately result in the unlawful abduction of the children by their father was sufficient to attach continuing liability to the defendant. To support this argument, the plaintiff reasons that because the basis of the defendant\u2019s liability was an alleged conspiracy, the defendant\u2019s liability continued to attach to the foreseeable consequences of his actions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\u201c[T]here is no such thing as a civil action for conspiracy. The action is for damages caused by acts committed pursuant to a formed conspiracy rather than by the conspiracy itself.\u201d <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Associated Construction Co., </em>141 Conn. 49, 54, 103 A.2d 529 (1954). That the plaintiff has made an \u201callegation as to conspiracy brings no strength to the declaration, for it shows no additional cause of action.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The trial court found that the defendant in assisting Sheldon had acted at a time that predated the award of sole custody of the children to the plaintiff, when Sheldon was entitled to their joint custody. The court, moreover, did not make a specific finding that any alleged conspiracy entered into, or aid furnished to Sheldon by the defendant, continued beyond August 7, 1985.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court found rather that the defendant\u2019s role had already \u201cbeen played\u201d by the time that sole custody of the children was first awarded to the plaintiff on August 9,1985. The defendant\u2019s conduct, therefore, even if in pursuance of an agreement to assist Sheldon to take his children to Israel, was not, when completed, unlawful. Conduct that was not unlawful when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>consummated cannot be the basis for damages or continuing liability in order to accomplish what may appear to be a desirable result. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>189 Conn. 648, 662, 458 A.2d 355 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Without an independent basis for finding illegality in the defendant\u2019s actions in allegedly conspiring with and aiding Sheldon prior to August 9, 1985, the date of the order awarding custody to the plaintiff, and in the absence of a specific finding that the defendant conspired with or aided Sheldon subsequent to that date, the plaintiff cannot prevail on her claim against this defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\"> At the conclusion of the plaintiff's case-in-chief, the trial court granted the defendant Jacquelyn Marshak\u2019s motion for a directed verdict in her favor concerning the claims against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The defendants Sylvia and Evelyn Marshak filed a separate appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment.

The defendant thereafter filed a similar motion to articulate with the Appellate Court, which granted the motion and ordered the trial court to respond to several questions raised in the motion. The questions largely addressed the issues concerning the defendant\u2019s liability, if any, after Sheldon and Karel Marshak had entered into a joint custody agreement on April 22, 1986, in Israel. The trial court responded that such an agreement did not diminish the defendant\u2019s liability because the agreement had been broken by Sheldon; Sheldon\u2019s breaking the agreement was not the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries; and it was foreseeable that Sheldon would breach such an agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> Since 1938, the American Law Institute has recognized as a cause of action conduct \u201cinducing [a] minor child to leave or not to return home.\u201d Restatement (First), Torts (1938) \u00a7 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Comment (g) of \u00a7 700 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977) allows the parent to recover for loss of society, emotional distress, loss of service, and reasonable expenses of regaining the custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b681-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-97. custodial interference in the first degree: class d felony, (a) A person is guilty of custodial interference in the first degree when he commits custodial interference in the second degree as provided in section 53a-98: (1) Under circumstances which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>expose the child or person taken or enticed from lawful custody or the child held after a request by the lawful custodian for his return to a risk that his safety will be endangered or his health materially impaired; or (2) by taking or enticing the child or person out of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">\u201c(b) Custodial interference in the first degree is a class D felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANq\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-98. custodial interference in the second degree: class a misdemeanor, (a) A person is guilty of custodial interference in the second degree when: (1) Being a relative of a child who is less than sixteen years old and intending to hold such child permanently or for a protracted period and knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he takes or entices such child from his lawful custodian; (2) knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he takes or entices from lawful custody any incompetent person or any person entrusted by authority of law to the custody of another person or institution; or (3) knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he holds, keeps or otherwise refuses to return a child who is less than sixteen years old to such child\u2019s lawful custodian after a request by such custodian for the return of such child.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">\u201c(b) Custodial interference in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\"> Subdivision (2) of \u00a7 53a-98 (a) is irrelevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\"> The framework for employing a criminal statute to derive a cause of action in tort was set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S.
