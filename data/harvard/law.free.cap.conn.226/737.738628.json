J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjA\">The dispositive issue in this certified appeal is whether unused underground gasoline storage tanks constitute an \u201cexisting facility\u201d for the purpose of the disclosure requirement of \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (f) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff, James B. Diamond, brought this action for rescission and restitution against the defendants, George Marcinek and Leona Marcinek, grounded on the defendants\u2019 nondisclosure of the presence of unused underground gasoline storage tanks on property that they conveyed to the plaintiff. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and ordered the defendants to accept reconveyance of the property. The defendants appealed from the judgment to the Appellate Court, which subsequently reversed the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>court\u2019s judgment. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The following relevant facts are undisputed. The plaintiff purchased property, located in Clinton, from the defendants. In the course of negotiations prior to the sale, the defendants represented to the plaintiff that the property was fit for residential use, that it contained a farmhouse, a well and a stream, and had been used to grow vegetables. The plaintiff did not inquire regarding any prior nonresidential use of the property. After the plaintiff had taken possession, he learned that the defendants\u2019 family had used the property as an automobile service station in the 1930s and 1940s and that, although the station had been dismantled and removed in the mid-1950s, the property still contained the unused underground gasoline storage tanks (tanks) that had been associated with the service station. Upon subsequent inquiry by the plaintiff, the defendants acknowledged the past operation of the service station and the existence of the tanks, as well as their failure to reveal this information to the plaintiff. They also paid the cost of the removal of the tanks from the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The plaintiff thereafter initiated this action for rescission and restitution, claiming that the defendants should have informed him of the existence of the tanks prior to the property transfer. Specifically, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants: (1) should have provided him with a negative declaration pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-134a (b);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) had violated an implied covenant of warranty because the title was unmarketable; (3) had, by fraudulently concealing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>prior use of the property, caused the plaintiff to make improvements at his own expense; and (4) had fraudulently concealed well water shortages. Prior to trial, the plaintiff moved to amend his complaint to include a nondisclosure claim pursuant to \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l, the department of environmental protection (DEP) regulation in issue here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants objected, and the court subsequently denied the motion. During the course of the trial, the plaintiff nonetheless introduced evidence regarding his claim that the defendants had violated the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the sole basis that, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l, the defendants should have disclosed the existence of the tanks to the plaintiff at least fifteen days before the transfer. Accordingly, the court ordered reconveyance of the property to the defendants and repayment of the purchase price. It did not, however, grant the plaintiff\u2019s claim for restitution because it found too speculative the claimed damages pertaining to certain improvements to the farmhouse that the plaintiff had made.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment in favor of the plaintiff. See <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Marcinek, </em>27 Conn. App. 353, 606 A.2d 1001 (1992). In that court, they claimed that the trial court had improperly relied on \u00a7 22a- 449 (d)-l in deciding for the plaintiff, because the regulation and violation thereof had not been alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. In addition, the defendants claimed that the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>improperly found that the defendants had violated the regulation and that it should not have granted the remedy of rescission for the alleged violation of the regulation. Id., 354-55. The plaintiff cross appealed for compensation for the farmhouse improvements. Id., 355.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court on an alternative basis not presented by either party. It concluded, pursuant to a plain error review, that even if \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l had been properly raised in the trial court, the regulation did not require disclosure to a transferee of the category of unused tanks at issue in this case. Id., 359-64. Specifically, it determined that the tanks, which the regulations defined as \u201ctemporarily out-of-service,\u201d could not also have constituted an \u201cexisting facility\u201d for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of the disclosure requirement in \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (f). Id., 360-61. Having resolved the appeal in favor of the defendants on this ground, the Appellate Court therefore did not reach the issues raised by the parties. We granted the plaintiffs subsequent petition for certification to appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Marcinek, </em>223 Conn. 910, 612 A.2d 55 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">On appeal the plaintiff maintains that we should reinstate the judgment of the trial court because that court properly determined that \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l applied to the tanks and that the regulation\u2019s provisions required disclosure of their existence. The defendants maintain that we should affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court for the reasons set forth in its decision, as well as the reasons presented to but not decided by the Appellate Court. Because we agree with the plaintiff that the tanks constituted an \u201cexisting facility\u201d for the purpose of disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (f), we reverse and remand the case to the Appellate Court for resolution of the remaining issues previously raised in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">We now turn to the principal inquiry underlying this certified appeal. To determine whether the tanks were subject to the disclosure requirement of \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (f), we interpret the regulation, as did the Appellate Court, as promulgated by the DEP in accordance with the definitions included therein. Section 22a-449 (d)-l (a) defines the various categories of \u201cfacility\u201d to which each of the regulation\u2019s require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ments applies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the Appellate Court correctly observed, \u201c[t]he duty of disclosure owed by the defendants to the plaintiff concerning these tanks arises only if this conveyance constituted a\u2018transfer . . . of any new or existing facility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Marcinek, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 361. It concluded that, because the tanks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>fell within the definition of a \u201ctemporarily out-of-service\u201d facility, they could not also be considered an \u201cexisting facility.\u201d The plaintiff argues, to the contrary, that the tanks, although \u201ctemporarily out-of-service,\u201d were nonetheless also \u201cexisting\u201d and therefore subject to the disclosure requirements of subsection (f). We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Our explication of the definitions set forth in the regulation is governed by well established rules of construction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a preliminary matter, we note that the question of whether a regulation applies in a particular case is a question of law; cf. <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992); consequently, our review is de novo. Cf. <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 140-41, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">When interpreting regulations, if the provisions are reasonably clear, we need not engage in further construction to ascertain their meaning. See <em>University of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 322, 328, 585 A.2d 690 (1991). Section 22a-449 (d)-l (a) defines an \u201cexisting facility\u201d as \u201ca facility the construction or installation of which began prior to the effective date of these regulations,\u201d November 1, 1985. A \u201ctemporarily out-of-service\u201d facility is one that is \u201cnot in use, in that no regular filling or drawing is occurring; or not established and maintained in accordance with these regulations; or not regularly attended and secured.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>These definitions are clear, and consequently we need not search further to employ them properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Applying the plain language of the definitions contained in \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (a) to the tanks,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we start with the unchallenged fact that the tanks were constructed prior to the adoption of the 1985 regulation, so that they were clearly an \u201cexisting facility.\u201d It is equally undisputed that at the time of transfer the tanks were no longer in use, at least to the extent that they were not in compliance with the regulation, so that they were \u201ctemporarily out-of-service.\u201d On the face of the regulation, the fact that the tanks satisfied both definitions does not diminish their satisfaction of each definition separately. As a definitional matter, therefore, because the tanks constituted an \u201cexisting facility,\u201d the defendants were required to satisfy the disclosure provision of \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The defendants argue, however, that the tanks could not have been both \u201cexisting\u201d and \u201ctemporarily out-of-service.\u201d Although the language of the regulation provides no support for their interpretation, the defendants emphasize the language of other \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l subsections as indicative of a regulatory intent that the two definitions be mutually exclusive. Although we need not undertake further inquiry if a regulation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>unambiguous; see <em>Chrysler Corporation </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 591-92, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989); we reject the defendants\u2019 contention on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The defendants point to \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (d) to prove their point. That subsection provides in separate sub-parts that \u201c(1) [b]y May 8, 1986, the owner or operator of each existing facility shall notify the commissioner and the office of the local fire marshal of the results of the life expectancy determination required by subsection (h). ... (4) [b]y May 8, 1986, the owner or operator of an abandoned or temporarily out-of-service facility shall notify the commissioner of the location, type and capacity of such facility and the date it was abandoned or removed from service.\u201d See also footnote 7; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l (e), (g), (h), (i), (j). We note, however, that regulatory terminology is presumed to retain the same meaning throughout a regulation in its entirety. See <em>Stamford Ridgeway Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>214 Conn. 407, 432, 572 A.2d 951 (1990). Even if there appears to be a conflict between terms, we will interpret them so that the regulation makes sense as a whole. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Burney, </em>189 Conn. 321, 327, 455 A.2d 1335 (1983); <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Regional School District No. 15, </em>169 Conn. 613, 621-22, 363 A.2d 1038 (1975). The most that the defendants\u2019 argument establishes is that, in subsections that contain references to both definitions, it may be necessary to make a distinction between definitions only in the application of the separate subparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">We hold further that, even if the definitions were not entirely clear, both the purpose and the DEP\u2019s existing interpretation of \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l support our conclusion that, in a case such as this, the regulation requires a transferor to disclose the existence of the tanks to a potential transferee. The purpose of a statutory and regulatory scheme provides important extrin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>sic evidence to aid judicial interpretation. See <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Department of Environmental Protection, </em>218 Conn. 821, 829, 591 A.2d 421 (1991). The purpose of the governing environmental protection statutes and regulations is, manifestly, to safeguard the citizens of the state and to preserve the natural resources. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-422.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In our recent decision in <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 358, 627 A.2d 1296 (1993), we noted that a property owner may be liable for environmental cleanup cost, regardless of whether the owner created the hazard.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In light of the responsibility that the environmental regulations place on landowners, it is essential that a potential owner be given notice of known environmental hazards. The interpretation supported by the defendant would create situations in which a transferee of property would be at risk of liability to the DEP for the cost of necessary environmental cleanup if the transferor could no longer be located. Indeed, in this case, although the defendants have paid to remove the tanks, it is not certain that there exists no residual waste that may in the future impose cleanup costs on the plaintiff. Reading the environmental protection laws as a whole, we conclude that the statutory and regulatory disclosure requirements were designed to minimize such burdens.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Furthermore, we note that the DEP has interpreted<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the disclosure requirement of \u00a7 22a-449 (d)-l to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the tanks. The DEP commissioner has statutory authority to enforce the environmental protection laws and to promulgate relevant regulations. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-2, 22a-5 and 22a-424. An agency\u2019s interpretation of the regulations that are within its jurisdiction is entitled to judicial deference. See <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Department of Environmental Protection, </em>supra; but see <em>University of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 328. We have recently reaffirmed this principle in <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 372. We see no reason to reject the DEP\u2019s interpretation of the regulation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\"> Section 22a-449 (d)-1 (f) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides: \u201ccontrol of the nonresidential underground storage AND HANDLING OF OIL AND PETROLEUM LIQUIDS ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">\u201c(f) TRANSFER OF FACILITIES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\">\u201c(1) No owner or operator shall transfer ownership, possession or control of any new or existing facility without full disclosure to the transferee of the status of the facility with respect to compliance with these regulations at least fifteen (15) days prior to the transfer.
