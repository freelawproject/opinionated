Massey was employed as a welder by Gulf Oil Field Service Company (Gulf), an independent contractor, which had contracted with Rowan Drilling Co. (Rowan) to perform certain manufacturing and oil field equipment repairs for Rowan. Massey was sent by Gulf to perform repair work on a high drum chain guard on the draw work located on Rowan\u2019s Rig No. 32 located in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. In the course of performing the repairs, Massey slipped on a greasy floor and sustained injuries. Massey instituted this tort action against Rowan alleging that his injuries had resulted from the negligence of Rowan and its employees. Massey had previously collected Louisiana workmen\u2019s compensation benefits from Gulf, his employer. Rowan filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that under Louisiana law Massey\u2019s sole remedy was under the Louisiana Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and the district court sustained this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">The decision turns on two Louisiana statutes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as construed by the Louisiana courts. These statutes have been interpreted to provide that when an employee of an independent contractor is injured by the negligence of the principal for whom the independent contractor is performing the service, the employee has no right to recover in tort if the work being performed was a part of the usual trade, business or occupation of the principal. His exclusive remedy, against either his own employer or the principal, is under the Louisiana compensation act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">Massey relies on several decisions to the effect that a principal may be liable in tort for negligent injury to the employee of an independent contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>if the work being performed is \u201cspecial\u201d work not generally done by others engaged in the same line of business as the principal, such as special construction or \u201cunusual repairs as are ordinarily made by specialists not customarily within the direct employ of the principal.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Ball v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp., supra, however, the work being done for the principal involved new plant construction, a factor which was stressed by the court in its decision. Moreover, as noted by this Court in Hall v. Continental Drilling Co., 245 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1957), the language in <em>Horrell, </em>supra, and <em>Dandridge, </em>supra, with regard to unusual repairs has been substantially eroded by later decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Many Louisiana cases have considered repair and maintenance work similar to the type involved in this appeal. In Stansbury v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 91 So.2d 917 (La.Ct.App.1957), the employee of an independent contractor sustained injuries while performing welding repairs on an oil derrick owned by the defendant petroleum company. In ruling that his sole remedy was under the compensation statute, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cWe feel that welding is an essential and integral part of the business of a company engaged in the \u2018exploration, production and disposal of oil, gas and other minerals.\u2019 We know, as a fact, that all the major oil companies of this area engage welders and other workmen of a similar nature as their regular employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">91 So.2d at 919. In Goodwin v. United States Rubber Co., 186 So.2d 356 (La.Ct.App.1966), the employee of an independent contractor was injured while performing \u201cspecial maintenance work\u201d on a tank owned by the defendant rubber company which contained caustic acid. In sustaining a summary judgment for the rubber company that the plaintiff had no cause of action in tort against it, the court at page 358 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-13\">\u201cIt stands to reason that the equipment machinery and tools have to be maintained and repaired as part of the regular business that United States Rubber Company is engaged in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">In Dandridge v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., 192 So. 887 (La.Ct.App.1939), plaintiff\u2019s decedent, a welder, met his death while repairing a leak in a boiler to be used in oil well drilling operations. In ruling that such activity was within the trade, business or occupation of the petroleum company, the court at page 891 reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acj\">\u201cThe setting up of the machinery and equipment with which to drill was necessary in order to drill, and minor repairs by welding of and on the equipment was likewise necessary every time it was set up. It is so closely related to the actual drilling of the well as to become a component part of it * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">The Louisiana court in Shird v. Maricle, 156 So.2d 476, at pp. 478-479 (La.Ct.App.1963), stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-17\">\u201c * * * the repair of equipment is often considered a part of the principal\u2019s business, even though the injury is received by the employee of a subcontractor hired especially to perform the repairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>While several decisions have stressed the fact that the principal who had contracted out certain work could have employed men to perform the same work,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court in Turner v. Oliphant Oil Corp., 200 So. 513, 514 (La.Ct.App.1940), made it clear that \u201cthe method used by the oil company to salvage the casing, whether by its own employee or by contracting to have it done by an independent contractor can make no difference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4C\">We agree with the district court that Massey\u2019s sole remedy was under the Louisiana Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"Ar7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">.
