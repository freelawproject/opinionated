The court further found that, if the proper legal standards were applied, there is no substantial evidence in the record to support the Secretary\u2019s decision denying the claimant benefits under the Act. A judgment was entered reversing the decision of the Secretary and directing him to grant the claimant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-26\">The primary question to be determined on this appeal is whether the Secretary applied the proper legal standards. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>he did, then the only remaining question is whether his findings are supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the correct legal standards were not applied, then the question is whether the district court erred in making its own findings of fact and granting relief, or whether the case should have been remanded for further action by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The claimant was born near Buna, Texas, on September 15, 1911, and lived in that vicinity all of his life. His formal schooling ended with the fourth grade. He worked on his father\u2019s farm until 1947 when, at age 36, he went to work in the Kirby Lumber Company sawmill, and worked steadily for 13 years, or until July 6, 1960. On June 14, 1957, while lifting a board, his foot slipped and he felt a pulling in his side. Five days later he realized that' his back had been hurt. He was taken to a hospital in Beaumont, Texas, where a surgeon removed his appendix. He got no relief to his back and that has bothered him ever since. He missed eight weeks\u2019 work in 1957. He received a notice from the Industrial Accident Board with a form of claim for workmen\u2019s compensation. He filled out the form but, instead of filing it, simply \u201cstuck it down in my drawer,\u201d and held the report for about three years. During this last three-year period he had worked up by seniority to the job of \u201ctop man,\u201d the softest job available at the sawmill. That involved nothing more than walking up and down along the catwalk high in the building and pushing buttons to release lumber when it had accumulated and should be removed. There was a seat from which he could see the lumber accumulating and he was able to alternate sitting, standing and walking. Notwithstanding the ease of this work, on about July 6, 1960, he felt that he could not continue and was away from work until August 23. He returned and worked until September 9, 1960, when he finally gave up and has not worked a day since.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">For several months in 1962, from June 8 to September 2, the claimant was confined in a mental institution, the Rusk State Hospital at Rusk, Texas. A niece, giving a personal interview, stated that she thought the mental illness started five years prior to that date or in 1957. The superintendent of the hospital certified that no electro shock therapy was administered but that tranquilizers and other drugs were used, and \u201cthe patient seemed to make a very nice adjustment.\u201d His psychiatric impairment was variously diagnosed as a depressive psychosis, a manic depressive reaction, a chronic anxiety reaction with marked hypochondriasis and a chronic conversion reaction. The superintendent of the hospital certified that \u201cwork tolerance was not considered during the patient\u2019s hospitalization,\u201d but that, \u201cit was felt that the patient, so long as he was in the remission he was in at the time of his discharge, could handle himself well in the ordinary circumstances of life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The 365-page administrative record contains the varying opinions of five general practitioners, two psychiatry and neurology specialists, a neurological surgeon, two psychiatric specialists and an internist. Numerous other opinions were contained in hospital and clinical records. None of the doctors suggested that the claimant is a malingerer. His family physician who had treated him since 1938 diagnosed his trouble as \u201cpsychoneurosis with schizophrenia with possible multiple sclerosis, lumbosacral arthritis. In my opinion, Luther L. Smith is totally disabled.\u201d On the other hand, the neurological surgeon found that, \u201cThis patient seems to have no neurologic disease of any type.\u201d Opinions of other doctors varied between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>these two extremes. There was less variation in the medical evidence as to the claimant\u2019s physical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">A vocational consultant gave his evaluation of the clamant\u2019s vocational capabilities. He thought that the claimant had the capacity to perform jobs which were primarily sedentary in nature and fairly routine. Specifically, he felt that the claimant could work as a \u201cbander\u201d or baked goods wrapper, an egg inspector or defeatherer of chickens, a gateman, laundry marker, hand labeler, working with coils for small motors, and inspecting types of glass, lenses, and bottles. The district court gave careful consideration to the testimony of this vocational expert, and summarized his testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">\u201c( 1) Obtaining employment involves two things: (a) getting the job, and (b) doing the job or being able to do it. (Tr. 231.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\u201c( 2) Luther Smith is not a fit candidate for large industries for employment, they won\u2019t hire him. (Tr. 233.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201c( 3) He is not fit to work in any building trade. (Tr. 233.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u201c( 4) There is always the job of getting him past the employment office. (Tr. 233.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201c( 5) As a practical matter no company doctor will pass any applicant with a present back condition. (Tr. 234.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201c( 6) A physical examination would be a barrier that would eliminate him. (Tr. 234.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">\u201c( 7) Getting any job requires an interview (Tr. 236.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">\u201c( 8) From the standpoint of employ-ability, if all humanity were placed on a sliding scale, Luther would be close to the bottom. (Tr. 236.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">\u201c( 9) If Luther and one other applied for any of the jobs suggested by the witness, the other fellow would have to be in pretty sorry shape if he is not to be hired over Luther. (Tr. 236-237.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-13\">In terms of getting the job I would say that his chances are very poor. (Tr. 237.) \u201c(10)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-14\">\u201c(11) Luther has really got problems as far as getting hired. (Tr. 237. )</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-16\">\u201c(12) All jobs suggested by the witness involve assembly line or production line jobs. (Tr. 237-238. )</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-18\">\u201c(13) Luther is obviously going to have to take periodic breaks frequently, the chances are he would not be able to maintain production and would not be able to perform the job. (Tr. 238-239.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-19\">\u201c(14) An employer would not deliberately inflict himself with problems of the magnitude to be . anticipated by hiring Luther Smith. (Tr. 241.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-20\">\u201c(15) From the standpoint of age as well as disability Luther Smith is getting toward the end of his productive life from the standpoint of beginning a career. (Tr. 247.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-21\">\u201c(16) Looking at it from the employer\u2019s standpoint in any of the jobs mentioned, Luther is not a desirable candidate for employment. (Tr. 253.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-22\">\u201c(17) If a man cannot stand and cannot sit, then the point is that there is no job for him. (Tr. 256.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-23\">The district court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkB\">\u201cThe Court is of the opinion that there has been no showing that Luther Leemon Smith is looking for \u2018unemployment compensation\u2019 as the Secretary has asserted; that is, from a full reading of the record, the Court is of the opinion that this is not a case where an employable individual cannot find work or is temporarily out of a job. The record shows that Luther Leemon Smith is not employable at any of the jobs <em>in existence </em>(not merely available) in this geographic locality. Simply stated, the record reflects that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>he cannot get a job but, assuming arguendo that he did get a job, his medically determinable condition is such that he could not keep it. He had such a job and for three years, he \u2018toughed it out\u2019 but in July, 1960, he had to give up what was the lightest, easiest job at Kirby Lumber Corporation, and this job was lighter and easier than any of the theoretical jobs suggested by the Hearing Examiner and Appeals Council.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">\u201cThe transcript is long, but it conclusively establishes that since July, 1960, Luther Leemon Smith has been, is, and will be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of medically determinable physical or mental impairments which can be expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The difference in viewpoint as to the proper legal standards to be employed is fairly stated in the decision of the Appeals Council as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201cThe Appeals Council also agrees with the conclusion of Frederick Wiener, the vocational witness, that the claimant had the residual physical and mental capacity to engage in a variety of jobs which are primarily sedentary in nature and which involve eye-hand coordination and the ability to perform hand movements. A fair reading of the vocational consultant\u2019s expert testimony cannot but leave the impression that he was of the opinion that the claimant could function in many jobs as they are commonly found in the national economy. The vocational consultant also testified in some detail as to the marketablity of the claimant\u2019s remaining skills. While it is true that Mr. Wiener\u2019s testimony indicates that the claimant might experience considerable difficulty in obtaining work, particularly in the area where he resides, the hearing examiner carefully distinguished the question of the claimant\u2019s ability to <em>engage </em>in substantial gainful activity from that of his ability to obtain employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201cAt the supplemental hearing claimant\u2019s counsel stated his position with respect to the ultimate issue of \u2018disability\u2019 under the Act as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">\u201c \u2018 * * * it doesn\u2019t much matter to me whether a man can do a job, if he can\u2019t get it, and it doesn\u2019t much matter to me whether a man can get a job, if he can\u2019t do it, he has got to get it and do it, and <em>if he cannot get a job due to physical disability </em>then under my concept of it he is disabled.\u2019 [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUo\">\u201cHowever, it is the Secretary\u2019s belief that inability to obtain employment due to the existence of a physical or a mental impairment must be distinguished from \u2018inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity <em>by reason of </em>such impairment [42 U.S.C. 416(i) (1)] [emphasis supplied]. In short, the test under the Social Security Act is not the ability of the claimant to <em>obtain </em>employment which he could perform, but rather whether he could <em>perform, </em>the work were he able to obtain the employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">\u201cCounsel for the claimant also objects to the hearing examiner\u2019s consideration of the question of whether there were employment opportunities for a person with the claimant\u2019s skills and limitations in the national economy during the effective period of the application. Counsel apparently believes the proper question for consideration is whether opportunities for employment are available in the claimant\u2019s local geographical area. The Appeals Council rejects this view.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">In part pertinent to this case, \u201cdisability\u201d is defined by the Act, 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 423(c) (2), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">\u201c(2) The term \u2018disability\u2019 means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">\u201c(A) inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>At the outset we reject the claimant\u2019s position which would interpret \u201cany substantial gainful activity\u201d as requiring that jobs, which the claimant, but for his impairment, would be able to perform, are actually open and ready to be filled. As we said in Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 989, 992, \u201c * * * the Act is not an unemployment compensation law.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The inquiry is not whether there are vacancies in jobs which the claimant may be able to fill, but whether there are jobs for which the claimant may reasonably be expected to compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In order to fulfill the purpose of the Act, the test of disability must be realistic and practical, rather than merely theoretical. While a job in the sense of \u201cany substantial gainful activity\u201d may exist even though there is no present vacancy, there must be a reasonable expectation that the claimant may be expected to compete for such a job in the future. Thus, if the job is available only to longtime employees, its existence means nothing to outsiders.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The Secretary apparently adopts the nationwide test, asserting that if the claimant can perform a job and that job exists within the national economy, the claimant is not disabled. This Court is firmly committed to the issue of \u201creasonable availability of jobs within the geographical areas which the claimant would normally be expected to consider if regularly in the labor market.\u201d Celebrezze v. Kelly, 5 Cir. 1964, 331 F.2d 981, 982; see also, Tigner v. Gardner, 5 Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 647, 651; Thomas v. Celebrezze, 4 Cir. 1964, 331 F.2d 541, 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The Secretary strongly relies on the holding in Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, supra, 323 F.2d 989, 992, that jobs need not be \u201cavailable for him in Kosciusko, Mississippi,\u201d to support his claim that the national economy must be viewed. <em>O\u2019Brient </em>held that the Act was not an unemployment statute and, therefore, reversed a district court decision that the test for disability concerned the existence of job openings. This Court in <em>O\u2019Brient </em>did not address itself to the issue whether the <em>existing jobs </em>for which a claimant is capable of performing must be found in the claimant\u2019s locale or in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">In this case, however, the vocational witness testified as to employment opportunities within a 150 mile radius of the claimant\u2019s home, and both the Hearing Examiner and the Appeals Council made findings based on such testimony. Therefore, if the only error were the Secretary\u2019s adherence to a nationwide test, we would hold that to be without injury to this claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">In the present case, the Appeals Council forthrightly asserts that \u201c * * the test under the Social Security Act is not the ability of the claimant to <em>obtain </em>employment which he could perform, but rather whether he could <em>perform </em>the work were he able to obtain the employment.\u201d To us that test seems theoretical, unrealistic, and not in conformity with the purpose of the Act. As this Court said in Celebrezze v. Kelly, supra, 331 F. 2d at 982:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">\u201cThe duty of the administrator is to hear the evidence as to the physical capabilities of the claimant, to consider the nature and type of work for which he is still qualified, if any, and to determine whether the claimant\u2019s failure to obtain a job in one of these categories results from his physical condition rather than from any other cause. Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, 5 Cir., 323 F.2d 989. He must determine whether there is a reasonable opportunity for the claimant to compete, in the manner normally pursued by persons genuinely seeking work, for a job within his determined capabilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">There must be a reasonable opportunity to be hired if the job were open and applications for employment were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>being taken. Firth v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d 557; Hodgson v. Celebrezze, 3 Cir. 1963, 312 F.2d 260; Hall v. Flemming, 6 Cir. 1961, 289 F.2d 290; Kerner v. Flemming, 2 Cir. 1960, 283 F.2d 916. If a physical or mental impairment prevents one from obtaining a job, or from even being considered for the job, he is just as unable to engage in that activity as he would be were he unable to perform the work after he had obtained the employment. The ability to perform work existing in the appropriate labor market requires a determination of whether the claimant would be considered for employment if a job vacancy occurred. If, in practice, the claimant could not reasonably expect to be hired, then no job exists for him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Act asks if the claimant is able to engage in substantial gainful work. If no one would hire him, he cannot engage in substantial gainful work. Extended to its broadest reaches, the Secretary\u2019s position would nullify the purpose of the Act, for, unless the claimant is bedridden and incapable of any movement, there most probably is some work he physically could do, though there might be no likelihood that he could successfully compete for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The legislative history of sections 416 (i) and 423 does not support the Secretary\u2019s position. Disability insurance was made part of the Social Security Act in 1956. C. 836, Title I, \u00a7 103(a), 70 Stat. 815 (1956). The insurance benefits provision extended an earlier amendment enacted in 1954 providing for the so-called \u201cdisability freeze.\u201d C. 1206, Title I, \u00a7 106(a)-(d), 68 Stat. 1079 (1954). Under the disability provisions, a claimant is entitled to disability benefits if he is unable to \u201cengage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months * * 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The Senate Finance Committee approving the disability \u201cfreeze\u201d provision of H.R. 9366 [S.Rep. 1987, 83rd Cong., 2nd sess. (1954), at pp. 20-21] stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">\u201cOnly those individuals who are totally disabled by illness, injury, or other physical or mental impairment which can be expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration may qualify for the freeze. The impairment must be medically determinable and preclude the individual from performing any substantial gainful work * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Though there is no indication in the report as to the meaning of the word \u201cperforming,\u201d it seems that the Committee meant the ability to do such tasks or engage in such activity so as to be employable. There is no language requiring that the claimant, to be classified as disabled, be unable to do any tasks whatsoever. It seems to us that the word \u201cpreclude\u201d is broad enough to encompass cases where the impairment makes impossible the obtaining of a job or being hired in order to perform work the claimant is physically able to do. Later on the report (at p. 21) notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">\u201cthere must be a present inability to <em>engage </em>in substantial gainful work by reason of such impairment (recognizing, of course, that efforts toward rehabilitation will not be considered to interrupt a period of disability until the restoration of the individual to gainful activity is an accomplished fact). The physical or mental impairment must be of a nature and degree of severity sufficient to justify its con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>sideration as the cause of failure to <em>obtain </em>any substantial gainful work. [Standards for evaluating the severity of disabling conditions] will reflect the requirement that the individual be disabled not only for his usual work but also for <em>any </em>type of substantial gainful activity.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The Social Security Act requires that the disabled individual be referred to State vocational rehabilitation agencies, so that he may be retrained and restored to gainful work. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 422. This rehabilitation provision indicates that the disabled individual is an individual unable to perform tasks in order to be eligible for gainful work. If he could do work so as to be able to compete for a job, he would not need rehabilitation, but only an employer willing to hire him. The person able to perform so as to be a reasonable candidate for a job if one were vacant, but unable actually to obtain employment, must turn to unemployment compensation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Though the Senate Report is not completely elucidating as to what is meant by the term \u201cdisability,\u201d the intent of those urging the adoption of some form of disability insurance was \u201cto insure that persons would not be reduced to virtual destitution and dependent upon public assistance.\u201d S.Rep. 2133, Minority Views, 84th Cong., 2nd sess. (1956) (accompanying H.R. 7225) at p. 128. Such intention could only be carried out if disability be found to exist when the claimant\u2019s impairment prevents him from being a reasonable candidate for employment. It would be wholly unrealistic to hold that though no employer would hire a person because of his physical or mental impairment, the person is still not disabled because he could do certain tasks or duties connected with jobs existing within the labor market. In such a situation there really exists an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of impairment, when but for the impairment, the person could compete for a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">This view is supported by the Minority Report accompanying the 1956 amendment [c. 836, Title I, \u00a7 103(a), 70 Stat. 815 (Aug. 1, 1956)] to the Social Security Act, providing for disability insurance : <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cUnder a sound social-insurance program, Americans should be protected against the fundamental hazards which would otherwise destroy their earning power and reduce them to beggary.\u201d S.Rep. No. 2133, Minority Views, 84th Cong., 2nd sess. (1956) (accompanying H.R. 7225) at p. 128. If an individual is unemployable because of his physical or mental impairment, he is disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">We conclude that the Secretary failed to employ the proper legal standards in making his determination of the claimant\u2019s disability. There should have been a determination by the Secretary of whether or not the claimant\u2019s physical or mental impairment would prevent him from being hired to fill jobs, if such jobs were open in the area in which the claimant could reasonably be expected to compete. If the hiring practices and policies of employers will not permit the employment of a man, who because of an impairment could not \u201ccarry his load,\u201d then he must be considered disabled. It seems reasonable to conclude that an employer will not hire an applicant when a complete analysis of the facts indicates that the applicant most probably will not be effective because of a physical or mental impairment and must be released because of such ineffectiveness. If there were a reasonable chance that he could be hired to do work which he in fact is capable of doing, then Smith should not be considered to be disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Recognizing the immense amount of time this claimant has spent in presenting his cause to the appropriate administrative bodies and then to the courts, we feel that a final disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>should be made at this point.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On motion by the Secretary, this case has already once been remanded for further administrative proceedings. Clearly, section 423 was enacted to protect the disabled from economic destitution and resorting to charity. If the claimant is indeed disabled, he should not be subject to lengthy delays which obviously postpone his receiving statutory benefits. Case law has usually required that when the Secretary fails to resolve the crucial issues, the Court should not enter or direct the order which shall be entered, but instead should remand for further proceedings. See 2 Am.Jur.2d Administrative Law, \u00a7\u00a7 763 and 765, and the cases cited therein. Frith v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d 557, 561; Tigner v. Gardner, 5 Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 647, 651. However, when the record is as fully developed as the one in this case and there seems little or no likelihood that additional evidence would be presented at a new hearing, a Court can determine whether substantial evidence would support the Secretary if the appropriate test had been applied. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g). A final determination at this time, if warranted by the facts, is desirable. Stancavage v. Celebrezze, 3 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 373; Ber v. Celebrezze, 2 Cir. 1964, 332 F.2d 293; Aaron v.

Considering Luther Smith\u2019s physical and mental impairments and the vocational evidence, the only supportable finding which can be drawn from the record is that he was unable to engage in substantial gainful activity because of his impairments.
