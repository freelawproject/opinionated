Punch\u2019s compensation carrier, Maryland Casualty Company, made compensation payments (under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act) to Musearello and thereafter intervened in the suit, claiming the right to reimbursement for compensation and medical payments totaling $6,195.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-20\">When the time of trial was imminent Travelers compromised Muscarello\u2019s claim for $7,500 to be paid regardless of the outcome of any claim which Maryland might have for reimbursement of its compensation and medical payments and without making provision for the satisfaction of Maryland\u2019s claim. Thereafter, as a result, Maryland was forced to try its case against Travelers before a jury which ended in a mistrial and the court then directed a verdict n. o. v. for Maryland and additionally awarded $1,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal involves the matter of attorney\u2019s fees only, Travelers claiming that Maryland is not entitled to such reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-21\">In a well-reasoned opinion the district judge held that he would allow attorney\u2019s fees as an exception to the general rule, under the equity power of the court where litigation has become necessary because of the arbitrary refusal of parties to rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ognize their plain obligations under the law. The district court cited Brisacher v. Tracy-Collins Trust Company, 10 Cir. 1960, 277 F.2d 519, and Sprague v. Ticonic Nat. Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939). We are in accord with the opinion of the court below, and, accordingly, the judgment is affirmed-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
