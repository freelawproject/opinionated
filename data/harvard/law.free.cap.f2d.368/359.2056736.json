The memorandum findings of fact and opinion of the Tax Court are not official<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ly reported. We affirm the determination of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The issue on this petition is whether the taxpayer, a family corporation, is entitled to an income tax deduction of $18,444 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1959, for payments made to Selma Bernstein, widow of one of the co-founders of the corporation. Petitioner claims that this deduction was proper under Sections 404(a) (5) and 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. These sections provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">\u00a7 404. Deduction for contributions of an employer to an employees\u2019 trust or annuity plan and compensation under a deferred-payment plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">(a) General rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">If contributions are paid by an employer to or under a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or if compensation is paid or accrued on account of any employee under a plan deferring the receipt of such compensation, such contributions or compensation shall not be deductible under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) or section 212 (relating to expenses for the production of income); but, if they satisfy the conditions of either of such sections, they shall be deductible under this section, subject, however, to the following limitations as to the amounts deductible in any year:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">(5) Other plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">In the taxable year when paid, if the plan is not one included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), if the employees\u2019 rights to or derived from such employer\u2019s contribution or such compensation are nonforfeitable at the time the contribution or compensation is paid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">\u00a7 162. Trade or business expenses, (a) In General.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business including\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-16\">(1) a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">The Commissioner relies on the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the payments did not meet the statutory requirements for deductibility because they did not represent deferred compensation and were not a \u201creasonable allowance\u201d for salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-18\">The facts are not in substantial dispute. Petitioner is a New York corporation engaged in the business of promoting, developing and directing shopping systems and services and establishing procedures for detection and elimination of opportunities for dishonest employee practices in such enterprises. Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>founders, principal stockholders and officers were two brothers, William and Mark Bernstein. At all relevant times the stock of the corporation was owned equally by the families of the two brothers. During the year 1941 the officers, directors and shareholders of petitioner were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\n<em>Officer Title Number of Shares</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Mark Bernstein President 3</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">William Bernstein Secretary-Treasurer 3</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Helen Bernstein Assistant Treasurer 1</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Selma Bernstein Assistant Secretary 1</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Helen was the wife of Mark Bernstein and Selma the wife of William.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">On January 27,1941 petitioner entered into a written agreement with its four officers. This document recited that petitioner\u2019s continued prosperity depended upon the services of Mark and William whose salaries were not commensurate with the real value of their efforts. It then provided that Mark and William would serve as long as they were physically able and would at all times be paid equal salaries, to be determined by petitioner\u2019s board of directors. In the event of the death of either Mark or William leaving a wife, child, or children, petitioner agreed to pay weekly to such wife, as long as she lived, and thereafter to such child or children, as long as they lived, an amount equal to 50% of the salary paid to the survivor of Mark and William.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">William died onr February 19, 1953, leaving his widow, Selma, and two children. In May of 1953 the children of Mark and William signed releases, waiving all rights to any payments under the January 27, 1941 agreement. However, the widow received payments equal to one-half of Mark Bernstein\u2019s salary from 1953 until 1959 when the Commissioner disallowed the claimed deduction. At that time she had already been paid $114,000 under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The Tax Court found that the payment in question did not represent deferred compensation. It also held that even if the 1941 agreement provided for deferred compensation, the payments would not qualify as a \u201creasonable allowance\u201d for salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\"> It is settled that in cases involving deferred compensation plans \u201cit is the Tax Court\u2019s function to draw a primary inference from evidentiary facts, which must be sustained on appeal unless it appears wholly unwarranted.\u201d Schner-Block Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 329 F.2d 875, 877 (2d Cir. 1964). In finding that the 1941 agreement did not qualify, the Tax Court rejected the self-serving recital that the salaries of Mark and William were inadequate. Instead the Court noted that the original agreement was not an arms length transaction and would have involved payments during the lives of the surviving wife and children, geared to the future salary of the surviving brother. Its conclusion that this plan was not intended to provide deferred compensation is not \u201cwholly unwarranted,\u201d and must therefore be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">Moreover, petitioner had the burden of proof on this issue as well as on the question of whether the payments constituted a \u201creasonable allowance\u201d for salary. See, e. g., Long Island Drug Co., Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 111 F.2d 593 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 311 U.S. 680, 61 S.Ct. 49, 85 L.Ed. 438 (1940). Yet it made no attempt to establish that the salaries paid Mark and William were inadequate or that the payments to the widow were reasonable. The bare recital in the 1941 contract, unsupported by any showing of what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>usual or proper in this industry, was justifiably given no weight by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\">. See also \u00a7 1.404(a)-12 Treasury Regulations on Income Tax (1954 Code) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnL\">\n<em>Contributions of an employer under a plan that does not meet the requirements of section 401(a) ; appliqation of section 404(a)(5).</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">Section 404(a) (5) covers all cases for which deductions are allowable under section 404(a) but not allowable under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (7) of said section. * * * If unfunded pensions are paid directly to former employees, their rights to such payments are nonforfeitable, and accordingly, such amounts are deductible under section 404(a) (5) when paid.
