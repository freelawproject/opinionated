BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Another of that ever-growing list<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of intramural insurance Donnybrooks which, as local disputes over the local reading of a local contract with no federal overtones, constitutional, statutory or otherwise, could better be left to local courts to resolve,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it seems the better part of judicial wisdom to bring this to an end without postponing the evil day of decision. Guillot v. Cenac Towing Company, Inc., 5 Cir., 1966, 366 F.2d 898. Helpful as is the Florida Supreme Court reference procedure,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> especially in areas which present alternative governmental or social policy choices even though ostensibly garbed in the austere form of an insurance policy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we think the question here is the simple one whether the insurance contract says what it means and means what it says. Jacksonville Terminal Co. v. Florida East Coast Railway Co., 5 Cir., 1966, 363 F. 2d 216, at 220. If it does \u2014 and we hold that it does \u2014 the District Court was clearly correct and should be affirmed. In construing what is euphemistically called the Family Automobile Policy only one real question specifically arises: is a brother-in-law living in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>household as the sister-in-law a relative? Once that is answered the only problem remaining is whether there is any justifiable basis for disregarding the plain words of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The facts neither complex nor conflicting can be severely capsulated. As with another family, this, too, begins in the beginning. Patterson v. Thomas, 5 Cir., 1961, 289 F.2d 108, 117 (dissenting opinion). Margie Frye, the Assured, lived in the same household with McElroy Lawson and Mrs. McElroy Lawson, the sister of Margie Frye. Barbara Jane Lawson, the daughter of the McElroy Lawsons, was obviously Miss Frye\u2019s niece. While driving her father\u2019s automobile, Barbara injured the Damage Claimant, George Hamilton. The Damage Claimant, Hamilton, not unnaturally, pursues the Insurer to secure satisfaction of the judgment he has against Barbara who as co-plaintiff and co-appellant is now aligned with her former adversary, likewise a not uncommon contemporary development dictated by self-interest, morality, or a combination of both. See, Smoot v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 299 F.2d 525; Smoot v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1964, 337 F.2d 223; Seguros Tepeyac S.A., Compan\u00eda Mexicana v. Bostrom, 5 Cir., 1965, 347 F.2d 168. It highlights the significant questions to likewise caps\u00falate the District Court\u2019s action. The District Judge held that McElroy Lawson, a brother-in-law of the Assured, was a relative. This had the effect of denying coverage under the exclusion for a non-owned automobile if owned by a relative residing in the same household with the Assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-17\">This Family Automobile Policy presumably on the 1958 revised form afforded, and was intended to afford, broad and liberal coverage both as to persons known and unknown and vehicles known and unknown.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The changes wrought by the 1963 revision are of no significance here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Of critical importance, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>significant terms of the clauses describing the assureds such as \"relative,\" \"owned automobile,\" and \"non-owned automobile\" were specifically defined.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As to these the 1963 revision <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> also made some changes, none significant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\">Since the accident was caused by an automobile other than the one owned by the Assured, Aunt Margie, both as to coverage<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the persons insured (see note 5, supra, Par. (a) (1) (2)), the re-suit depends on whether Barbara's father's car was a \"non-owned automobile\" (note 5, supra, Par. (b) (1) (2)) as the policy defines it. (Note 7, supra). It simplifies the problem to reconstruct the definition clauses into an amalgam of \"relative\" and \"non-owned automobile.\" It then reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3a_\">\"`Non-owned automobile' means an automobile * * * not owned by * * * either the named insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>or any relative of the named insured who is a resident of the same household * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The possible points of controversy are thus quickly and sharply reduced. The car was not owned by Aunt Margie, the named Assured. But just as positively, it was owned by Barbara\u2019s father. Equally clear, and unlike so many cases where the very vexing factual problem is whether the \u201crelative\u201d is a resident of the household,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Barbara\u2019s father was a part of this household.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">All that is left, therefore, is the question whether a brother-in-law of the named Assured is a \u201crelative.\u201d And on that score we have no doubt that within the context of this broad coverage, he is so. The role of the Court is perhaps fortunately easier since the term is a neutral one in the sense that to be a relative is, on occasions, the status which affords insurance coverage, while in others the status works an exclusion of coverage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The sauce ought therefore to be for insurer and assured alike. In a policy which extends insurance to persons whose age, sex, physical, mental competence and moral responsibility are completely unknown and covers vehicles of unknown age, vintage, operability, mechanical condition or ownership, there is no place for a narrow reading of \u201crelative.\u201d Stated in operational terms, not the legalism of wills, trusts, estates, and conveyancing, any attempt', as urged here, to read into it distinctions betwe\u00e9n affinity and consanguinity would thwart the intended breadth of the coverage as well as the reflext exclusions which are essential to prevent abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">For Florida we make such an <em>Erie </em>alignment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For Florida we reject the notion that \u201crelative\u201d is ambiguous.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>There this case would end without more were it not for the contention alternatively asserted but pressed almost as the main argument that Barbara qualifies under Par. (c) (2) (note 5, supra) as a \u201cperson * * * legally responsible for the use of * * * (2) a non-owned automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">As near as we can discern it, two arguments seem to be made. The first is that unless Par. (c) (2) is given this reading, it is superfluous and serves no need not encompassed by Par. (b) (2). The second is that the proviso clause of Par. (c) (2) \u2014 \u201c * * * if such automobile is not owned * * * by such person\u201d in effect reads out the general definition of a non-owned automobile (note 7, supra) so that the only limitation is that (1) the automobile not be owned by the named assured (here Aunt Margie) and (2) that it not be owned \u201cby such person\u201d (here Barbara). Amplifying this it is urged that \u201cowned automobile\u201d and \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d are mutually exclusive terms and the Insurer ought not to be permitted to distort simple words by the policy\u2019s special definitions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We find none of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">As to the first, there are a number of functions for Par. (c) (2) not encompassed within Par. (b) (2) including a wide range of situations in which liability is imputed to a third person on familiar principles of respondeat superior, or the like,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> because of the operation of a non-owned vehicle by a relative living in the same household. In practically none of these situations could \u201csuch person\u201d qualify under either (a) or (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">As to the second, rather than detracting from the general definition the proviso clause adds a further limitation. The automobile must not only meet the general definition of one not owned by, or regularly furnished for the use of, a relative residing in the same household. Additionally it must not either be owned or hired by \u201csuch person or organization.\u201d This purpose seems clear from the fact that Par. (c) (2) expressly requires that the party for whom such \u201cother person or organization\u201d has a legal liability must have the status of an assured under Par. (a) or (b). And with respect to Par. (b) this brings into play the composite definition of \u201crelative\u201d and \u201cnon-owned automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">None of the other contentions warrant any comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-6\">. One discerning authority and indefatigable writer describes it thus. \u201cThe romance, such as it is, of good, bad, and indifferent, decisions on automobile coverage decisions proceeds with ever increasing acceleration. In the 21-year period from 1936 through 1956, the courts of this country reported 1,443 decisions on automobile coverage questions, averaging about 70 each year. In 8%-year period from 1957 through the first six months of 1965 they decided some 2,100 such cases, averaging about 247 each year. The present rate is over 300 each year.\u201d Risjord, 1964-1965 Highlights of Automobile Liability Insurance Law, 16 Fed.Ins.Counsel Quarterly, Winter 1965-66, p. 6 [hereinafter referred to as \u201cHighlights\u201d with appropriate year],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\">. Judge Sobeloff recently sounds the tone of wonderment. \u201cThis controversy between two insurers is here because of the singular fascination the federal diversity forum holds for insurance companies, even when the controlling state law question has not been clearly settled and only a state court can give an authoritative answer.\u201d Travelers Ins. Co. v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp., Ltd., 4 Cir., 1966, 367 F.2d 205.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b825-8\">. Hopkins v.

Nowhere is this more spectacularly evident than in the diametrically conflicting readings of a uniform, simple, common standard policy clause by states separated only by imaginary political boundaries. Consider, for example, \u201c * * * the running, ceaseless controversy over \u2018Who Is The Insured?\u2019 on which courts have differed and continued to divide so sharply.\u201d Great Am. Ins. Co. v. General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp., 5 Cir., 1963, 321 F.2d 948, 951. Judges, too, can be mesmerized by the easy catch phrases in the quest for the intention of the parties, only to recognize that what counts is not what the parties really intended, but what the local law spoken through its judiciary declares the parties to have meant. See American Agricultural Chem. Co. v. Tampa Armature Works, Inc., 5 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 856, 861 &amp; n. 4 (concurring opinion). In construing the \u201cemployee exclusion\u201d of nearly all standard liability policies, it may be an ironic man-bites-dog-reversal of form that courts, long accustomed to a liberal reading of coverage and a restrictive reading of exclusions where any doubt exists, continue to deny coverage which the underwriters intended to extend, or at least those close to the heart and voice of underwriters say they intended to extend. See Risjord &amp; Austin, Who Is \u201cThe Insured\u201d Revisited, 28 Ins. Counsel J. 100 (Jan.1961); Risjord, 1961 Highlights, 12 Fed.Ins.Counsel Quarterly, Spring 1962, pp. 55-56; 1962-1963 Highlights, 14 Fed.Ins.Counsel Quarterly, Spring 1964, pp. 41-44; 1964-1965 Highlights, 16 Fed-Ins.Counsel Quarterly, Winter 1965-66, pp. 33-35; Brown &amp; Risjord, Loading and Unloading: The Conflict Between Fortuitous Adversaries, 29 Ins. Counsel J. 197, 207-11, 216. Presumably despairing that the severability clause would ultimately produce a favorable countdown, a substantial segment of the underwriting industry has solved it in the Family Automobile Policy by words which defy much judicial tinkering: \u201c \u2018Insured\u2019 means the person against whom claim is made or suit is brought.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b826-5\">.
