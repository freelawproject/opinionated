Obermaier, New York City (Robert M. Morgenthau, U. S. Atty., for the Southern District of New York, Michael W. Mitchell, Asst. U. S. Atty., on the brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b622-17\">Maurice Edelbaum, New York City, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b622-18\">Before WATERMAN, HAYS and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b622-19\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">Appellant was convicted by jury verdict on two counts of bribing employees of the Internal Revenue Service and on two counts of aiding and abetting these employees in violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-21\">Appellant contends that the federal rule permitting conviction on the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices is not one of invariable application, but that it is the \u201cbetter practice\u201d to require corroboration and that the circumstances of the present case call for the use of this \u201cbetter practice.\u201d An identical contention was advanced in United States v. Armone, 363 F.2d 385, 402 (2d Cir. 1966) and was rejected by this court in an opinion which cited United States v. Kelly, 349 F.2d 720 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 947, 86 S.Ct. 1467, 16 L.Ed.2d 544 (1966). In the present case the trial judge instructed the jury that the government\u2019s witnesses were accomplices and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-22\">\u201cYou must, therefore, scrutinize their testimony with special care and act upon it with caution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-23\">Appellant also argues that his trial was unfair because the court pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>vented the defense from cross-examining accomplice witnesses as to other occasions on which they had accepted bribes. Defendant was permitted to bring out that the government\u2019s witnesses had been convicted for accepting bribes, that they had not yet been sentenced and that they were testifying in the hope of avoiding jail sentences. It was well within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to limit further cross-examination on the issue of credibility. United States v. Irwin, 354 F.2d 192 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 967, 86 S.Ct. 1272, 16 L.Ed.2d 308 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
