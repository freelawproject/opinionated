The victim was an unmarried twenty-six year old registered' nurse, who was married at the time of the trial. The case was tried before the jury on the theory of mistaken identity\u2014 that while the appellant had driven past the scene of the crime within the park, he had not participated in it. Because of the appellant\u2019s previous record involving sex crimes against minors, appellant\u2019s counsel thought it best, as a matter of trial strategy, not to have appellant take the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">In argument to the jury, appellant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cThere is no question of the sufficiency of the evidence as to rape. The question is by whom?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-19\">During the trial, when certain articles of the victim\u2019s clothing were offered in evidence, appellant\u2019s counsel objected, saying there was no contest as to the fact that rape had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-20\">On appeal, appellant\u2019s counsel (not counsel below) urges there was no proof of the essential elements of rape, i. e., (1) no proof that penetration occurred, and (2) no proof that the rape was by force or against the victim\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-21\">The victim testified there had occurred an act of sexual intercourse; that after the occurrence she took a douche (C.T. 74). She also testified the raper had struck her from the rear, twisted her arm behind her, taken her to some bushes, forced her to the ground, put his weight upon her so as to pin her to the ground, and three times (C.T. 73)- \u2014 each with an increasingly menacing tone \u2014 had said \u201cTake your clothes off, and I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-22\">Just as there cannot be rape without penetration, there cannot be sexual intercourse without penetration. A lack of medical testimony, in view of the manner in which this case was tried, and the facts <em>proved, </em>is of slight consequence. It is but one factor to be weighed by the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-23\">It is no longer the law that a person attacked and threatened with rape must fight \u201cin this [to the] last ditch stage. Threats * * * of bodily harm * * * with some degree of physical force\u201d is sufficient. Ewing v. United States, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 135 F.2d 633 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Here the victim testified she was very-frightened, and that she thought her life was in danger. (C.T. 65) The point that there was a lack of force used was not urged as an issue in the trial below \u2014 all counsel agreed, and the court so instructed the jury (R.T. 254), without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">We are forced to the conclusion that there existed substantial evidence that rape, with all its essential elements, had been committed by a person identified as this appellant, and that such evidence, with the lawful inferences arising therefrom, supports the finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We note, but only in passing, that no motion for judgment of acquittal was made by competent and vigorous counsel for defendant, either at the conclusion of the government\u2019s case, or after all evidence was in.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-24\">.
