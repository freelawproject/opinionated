Stavely, deceased, brought this suit to recover estate taxes claimed to have been erroneously collected. The district court decided all issues adversely to their contentions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Most of the basic facts are not in dispute. Mr. and Mrs. James A. Stavely were married in 1931. They had no children of their own but Mrs. Stavely had two children by a prior marriage, and through these children she had three grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Mr. and Mrs. Stavely executed substantially identical wills in 1949. After certain specific bequests, each will contained a provision leaving essentially the entire estate to the survivor. On the survivor\u2019s death the remaining estate was to go to Mrs. Stavely\u2019s two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">On April 29, 1954, Mrs. Stavely wrote out and signed a holographic instrument leaving the bulk of her estate in five (5) equal shares to her two children and three grandchildren. However, on May 15, 1954, Mr. and Mrs. Stavely both formally executed substantially similar codicils to their 1949 wills. These codicils made only very minor changes in the 1949 wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">Mrs. Stavely died July 19, 1955. After the holographic instrument was discovered, a conference was held between Mr. Stavely and Mrs. Stavely\u2019s two children at which the family attorney, Morris I. Jaffe, Esq., was present. Appellants contend that an oral agreement was reached at that time between Mr. Stavely and Mrs. Stavely\u2019s two children, whereby Mr. Stavely was to receive the use of Mrs. Stavely\u2019s property for life with the remainder in his and Mrs. Stavely\u2019s estate going to the two children in return for their not attempting to probate the holographic will. It is the tax effect of that oral agreement on <em>Mr. </em>Stavely\u2019s estate that is one of the main questions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">Subsequent to the meeting, Mr. Jaffe prepared a memorandum which it is now claimed reflected only part of the alleged oral agreement. Although it was presented to him several times, Mr. Stavely never signed it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The memorandum, like the holographic will, would have required Mr. Stavely to leave his estate in five equal shares to Mrs. Stavely\u2019s two children and three grandchildren. Mr. Stavely died in 1959 and his estate passed under his 1949 will and 1954 codicil to Mrs. Stavely\u2019s two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">In the district court appellants contended that because of the oral agreement Mr. Stavely received only a life estate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Mrs. Stavely\u2019s property with a remainder passing to her two children. Two arguments were predicated on this contention. The first was that since Mr. Stavely received only a life estate, Mrs. Stavely\u2019s property never entered his estate and, therefore, no estate tax on Mrs. Stavely\u2019s property should have been paid by Mr. Stavely\u2019s estate. Second, it was argued that Mr. Stavely\u2019s estate should not be taxed because under the oral agreement Mr. Stavely sold the remainder interest and thus nothing remained for estate tax purposes. Also involved here is the question of the alleged oral agreement\u2019s effect on insurance policies covering Mr. Stavely\u2019s life and paid to Mr. Stavely\u2019s executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In addition to the question presented by the alleged oral agreement, there is a question of construing Mrs. Stavely\u2019s will. If she gave Mr. Stavely only a life estate in her interest in their home, then that interest would not be includable in Mr. Stavely\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The Alleged Oral Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The determining issue must be: Was there an actual dispute as to the validity of the 1949 will out of which a good faith, valid and bona fide settlement arose ? If there was no such dispute and settlement, then the district court is correct and the government should prevail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Vease\u2019s Estate (9 Cir. 1963), 314 F.2d 79 at 86-87; Bailey v. Ratterre (N.D.N.Y. 1956), 144 F.Supp. 449 at 452-453, aff\u2019d, 243 F.2d 454 (2 Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We must look to Texas law to determine whether the holographic instrument, executed prior to Mrs. Stavely\u2019s republication of her will by the May 15, 1954 codicil, could create a genuine dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">In Wade v. Sherrod, 342 S.W.2d 17 (Tex.Civ.App.1961) error refused, n. r. e., the Court of Civil Appeals had before it the following (342 S.W.2d at 21):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">\u201c[T]he main question in this controversy is whether or not the codicil of July 31, 1951 effectively republished and reaffirmed the 1948 will, thereby revoking the July 10th holographic will, which the jury found to be in testatrix\u2019s own handwriting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">The Court thought that under Texas law the answer was clear. A codicil republishes the former will to which it refers as of the date of the codicil and voids all intervening wills, including holographic wills. In Hinson v. Hinson, 154 Tex. 561, 280 S.W.2d 731 at 735 (1955) the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">\u201cIt is well settled, however, that a properly executed and valid codicil which contains a sufficient reference to a prior will, operates as a republication of the will in so far as it is not altered or revoked by the codicil; the will and codicil are then to be regarded as one instrument speaking from the date of the codicil.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">Accord, Newsome v. Carpenter, 382 S.W.2d 350 (Tex.Civ.App.1964).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">Implicit in the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the district court is the belief that no valid dispute existed between the parties. Texas law is well settled on the invalidity of the holographic will involved in the instant case. In spite of testimony to the contrary, it stretches credibility to ask this Court to believe that anyone really thought that the holographic will could have prevented the later codicil and the written 1949 will from being probated as Mrs. Stavely\u2019s only will.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">Even if some slight question was created as to the effect of the holographic instrument, the district court\u2019s finding that no real settlement was ever made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>would have to be affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no convincing evidence that a good faith, valid and bona fide agreement was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">If there was a real dispute, it is most unlikely that the potential heirs would trust to divine providence to protect their interests. Once the codicil and the 1949 will were admitted to probate, all leverage would be lost. Experience teaches that under these conditions potential' heirs will exact a bihding written agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In the instant case Mr. Stavely never changed his will to conform to the holographic will or in any other way altered his position. This inaction negatives any contention that he intended to alter his estate disposition originally adopted in 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The memorandum which Mr. Stavely did not sign, like the holograph, would have given Mr. Stavely\u2019s estate in five equal parts to Mrs. Stavely\u2019s children and grandchildren and not just to her children. If Mr. Stavely promised in the alleged oral agreement to leave his estate only to Mrs. Stavely\u2019s children, then he would have promised no more than his will already provided. The vagueness of the alleged agreement, the fact that it was not reduced to writing, the fact that Mr. Stavely never altered his position\u2014 all lead us to conclude that there was no actual dispute or valid, bona fide settlement. At best the parties may have believed that the holographic will represented Mrs. Stavely\u2019s latest possible desires and decided to effectuate those desires by having the children on Mr. Stavely\u2019s death reallocate the proceeds they received from his estate. \u201cThe resulting agreement was nothing more than a voluntary rearrangement of property interests acquired under an admittedly valid will, concluded without duress of unsatisfied claims.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Vease\u2019s Estate (9 Cir. 1963), 314 F.2d 79 at 87. Both Mr. and Mrs. Stavely\u2019s wills remained valid and such voluntary rearrangements within the family unit are not sufficient to prevent the proper imposition of estate tax.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court therefore reach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ed the correct result as to both the tax on Mr. and Mrs. Stavely\u2019s estates and the tax on the insurance proceeds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Mrs. Stavely\u2019s Interest in Their Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In her 1949 will Mrs. Stavely included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">\u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my beloved husband, JAMES A. STAVELY, all my right, title and interest in and to our home at 6630 Robin Road, Dallas, Texas, including all the fixtures and appurtenances thereto, as well as all furnishings and effects therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Article III, Paragraph (k) of the will provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">\u201c(k) Upon the death of my husband, should he survive me, I direct that our homestead and all of the furniture and fixtures therein shall be sold by my executor, hereinafter named, and that the money received therefrom shall be equally divided between my daughter, Laverne Gross-man, and my son, Samuel King.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuF\">Appellants contend that if the two above-quoted paragraphs are construed together, Mr. Stavely received only a life interest in Mrs. Stavely\u2019s interest in their home. Whether federal estate tax applies depends on the powers that Mr. Stavely received from his wife. To determine what powers he received, we must look to state law. In this regard it is important to emphasize that the federal estate tax does not depend on the label that a state places on a transfer but on the powers that the deceased actually had.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">If he had the power to sell or give away the property and treat it as his own, squandering it as he wished, then for estate tax purposes, whatever label the state gives such powers,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there is a tax imposed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But if he did not receive the power to convey or sell the property, that is to say an unrestricted power of disposition, then no estate tax attaches. Phinney v. Kay, 275 F.2d 776 (5 Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">Unfortunately there are no Texas cases directly in point. The case most strongly in favor of the government\u2019s contention that Mr. Stavely received an unrestricted power of disposition over his wife\u2019s interest in their home is Harrell v. Hickman, 147 Tex. 396, 215 S.W.2d 876 (1949). In that case property was left by a wife under a joint and mutual will to her husband for his \u201csole use and benefit.\u201d The will went on to dispose of all the property of which the survivor, husband, died \u201cseized and possessed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">The husband remarried and then conveyed the property to his second wife, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>taining only a life estate. The heirs attacked the transfer as not bona fide and being solely to avoid the joint and mutual will. The Supreme Court of Texas held that under the joint and mutual will the husband was empowered to do with the property as he pleased during his life, including giving away a remainder or selling it. The cornerstone of the Court\u2019s rationale was the fact that the joint and mutual will applied only to the property of which the husband died \u201cseized and possessed,\u201d and thus did not apply to property when a gift or sale had ended his possession.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">This Court followed the <em>Harrell </em>case in Phinney v. Kay, 275 F.2d 776 (5 Cir. 1960). <em>Phinney </em>involved a will that gave an estate \u201cto be used, occupied, enjoyed, <em>conveyed </em>and <em>expended </em>by, and during the life of such survivor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This Court held that under Texas law the survivor received an unrestricted power to dispose of the property and that this was sufficient power to come under the purview of section 2041 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">But the present case does not quite fit the pattern. If we read the first paragraph alone, Mr. Stavely would have received a fee simple title with the absolute right to sell the home because Mrs. Stavely gave him \u201call my right, title and interest in and to our home.\u201d But the later paragraph directs that on Mr. Stavely\u2019s death the \u201chomestead and all the furniture and fixtures therein\u201d be sold and the money go to certain named beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The rule for construing such contradictory clauses was succinctly stated in McMurray v. Stanley (1887), 69 Tex. 227, 6 S.W. 412 at 413, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">\u201cIn construing the will, all its provisions should be looked to, for the purpose of ascertaining what the real intention of the testatrix was; and, if this can be ascertained from the language of the instrument, then any particular paragraph of the will which, considered alone, would indicate a contrary intent, must yield to the intention manifested by the whole instrument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Accord, First National Bank of Corsicana v. DeFoe (Tex.Civ.App.1964), 384 S.W.2d 926 at 928; Ellis v. Bruce (Tex.Civ. App.1956) 286 S.W.2d 645 at 649. What Mr. Stavely took under the first paragraph, he took subject to the second paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Several factors convince us that this case is not like <em>Harrell. </em>In <em>Harrell </em>and all the cases that have followed it, the persons who took on the death of the first survivor took only whatever property remained. The residuary clauses of the two essentially identical wills of Mr. and Mrs. Stavely, when taken together, have this effect. The property is left to whoever survives and on that person\u2019s death whatever property the survivor dies \u201cseized or possessed\u201d of then passes to Mrs. Stavely\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">Clause (k) dealing with the \u201chomestead\u201d is restricted to a specific piece of property. Clause (k) does not say \u201cif my husband dies seized or possessed of a homestead then the same shall be sold with the proceeds going to my children.\u201d Instead, it contemplates that the homestead shall be in existence \u201cupon the death of my husband,\u201d and directs in absolute terms \u201cthat our homestead and all of the furniture and fixtures therein shall be sold.\u201d Since Mrs. Stavely\u2019s will contemplated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>homestead would be intact at Mr. Stavely\u2019s death, we hold that he received only the use and control of Mrs. Stavely\u2019s interest in their home but not the unrestricted power to dispose of it. It follows then that as to Mrs. Stavely\u2019s interest in their homestead, Mr. Stavely did not receive sufficient powers to bring this grant within the purview of section 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">A word of caution may be noted. It is obvious that one of the reasons the government has so steadfastly objected to any construction of Mrs. Stavely\u2019s will which would prevent the application of section 2041 is the fear that this bequest will escape all estate taxes. The fear is that a bequest of this nature will be allowed to qualify under the marital deduction <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and at the same time escape taxation in the survivor\u2019s estate under the rule we announce today. But the very rationale of our decision will prevent that incorrect result. If a bequest involves only limited powers, as here, no matter what name the state law ascribes to those powers, it does not qualify for the marital deduction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Where the spouse does receive the unrestricted right to dispose of the property during his life, no matter what name the state law ascribes to those powers, the bequest qualifies for the marital deduction but is included in the survivor\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The judgment of the district court is, therefore, affirmed in part and reversed in part and the case remanded for a proper determination of the refund due in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Affirmed in part and in part reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-11\">. The opinion of the district court is not reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\">. The memorandum completely restricts Mr. Stavely\u2019s use of his property as well as that received from Mrs. Stavely. It is easy to understand why he never signed such an agreement. Of course, anything short of such an agreement would make the alleged settlement virtually meaningless. There is no evidence that Mr. Stavely ever indicated how the memorandum could be altered to properly reflect the alleged oral agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b265-18\">. If there was a good faith, bona fide settlement of a valid dispute, then under the doctrine of Lyeth v. Hoey, 305 U.S. 188, 59 S.Ct. 155, 83 L.Ed. 119 (1938) the appellants should prevail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AGuN\">. In the present case there is no dispute over the fact that the 1954 codicil was properly executed, valid and contained a sufficient reference to the 1949 will,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\">. When referring to the settlement, the district court used such terms as \u201cthe alleged oral agreement\u201d or \u201cassuming that the alleged oral agreement was valid.\u201d There was no finding that a settlement was over made, nor can appellants erect the language of the district court, above quoted, into a finding of a valid, good faith or bona fide settlement. The district court did find that if there was an agreement, \u201cthe alleged oral agreement\u201d was not \u201cbona fide\u201d or \u201carm\u2019s length.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">. See Lyeth v. Hoey, 305 U.S. 188, 59 S.Ct. 155 (1938) and its progeny. Reed v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 36 F.2d 867 (5 Cir. 1930) is not apposite. In the <em>Reed </em>case there was no will contest and settlement. The children received a vested interest in their mother\u2019s property. Pursuant to a family agreement, they deeded property to their father. To show his good faith in carrying out an oral trust agreement, he then executed a formal will which carried into effect the terms of the oral trust agreement. [As to the possible tax effect of such an arrangement under present law, see Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Vease\u2019s Estate, 314 F.2d 79 (9 Cir. 1963).]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b266-12\">. In Bailey v. Ratterre (N.D.N.Y.1956), 144 F.Supp. 449 at 453, Chief Judge Brennan, speaking for the Court, said: \u201c * * \u00ae the compromise of a will contest must be based upon something more than a naked threat. Some evidence beyond the mere retention of an attorney and some recognition of the existence and disposal of the threat to an estate must be shown. A desire to avoid family friction may well prompt a settlement but to recognize such desire as the basis for a contest compromise leaves an open door to tax evasion.\u201d In Reed\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 171 F.2d 685 (8 Cir. 1948), the Eighth Circuit said that to qualify as a proper settlement a \u201ccontroversy\u201d must be \u201cclearly defined,\u201d \u201creal and substantial.\u201d In <em>Reed\u2019s Estate </em>the surviving spouse claimed that a new state statute gave her a right to a fee simple in one third of her husband\u2019s estate. With the exception of dower, the children claimed the full fee in all property under their father\u2019s will, contending the statute was unconstitutional. The parties did not litigate but settled. By the time the federal estate tax case reached the Eighth Circuit, the Supreme Court of Nebraska had in fact declared unconstitutional the statute under which the surviving spouse claimed a fee simple.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b267-11\">.

C. I. R., 5 Cir. 1962, 307 F.2d 688. Our opinion on original hearing does not cover that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">The pertinent rule of construction has been well stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-15\">\u201cWhere a testator was only part owner of property disposed of by will, the question as to whether the other part owner, having accepted the provisions of the will, is to be deemed to have elected to renounce his rights as co-owner depends on the showing as to whether the testator intended to dispose of the entire property. The court will presume primarily that the testator intended to confine the devise or bequest to his part of the property, and where the language of the will is ambiguous in this respect the instrument should be considered as referring only to the interest that the testator might lawfully dispose of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-16\">\u201cSince the law will deprive no person of his property by conjecture, a testator will be deemed to have intended to dispose of both his and his co-owner\u2019s share of property only where the intention is expressed in the will in clear and unequivocal language that is open to no other reasonable construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">61 Tex.Jur.2d \u00a7 276, Wills.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">Article II of Mrs. Stavely\u2019s will was expressly limited to \u201call my right, title and interest\u201d in their home, the fixtures, appurtenances, furnishings and effects. It seems clear that Article III (k) should be similarly construed. Mrs. Stavely did not undertake to dispose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Mr. Stavely\u2019s property by her will, and he was not put to any election. With the opinion so clarified, the petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"A5E\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-21\">. See also Avery v.
