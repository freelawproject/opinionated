But at most they contain some surplusage and, in a few instances, inapt words. Imprecision of statement and inexactness of language in instructions is not reversible error, unless the jury is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>misled. Here no such conclusion is indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">We agree with appellant that the remaining instruction, concerning the matter of punishment, was over-broad. The crimes were such that the jury was in no way concerned with the penalty that attached [Andres v. United States, 333 U.S. 740, 68 S.Ct. 880, 92 L.Ed. 1055 (1948)] and the part of the Court\u2019s instruction to that effect was proper; the further statement concerning the Court\u2019s broad powers over the defendant in the event of his guilt was not. See Pope v. United States, 298 F.2d 507 (5th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The court, in an instruction which immediately followed the erroneous comment, remarked that the matter was one exclusively for the court to decide and admonished the jury to disregard \u201cpossible punishment\u201d in arriving at its decision. The appellant does not contend that the evidence was insufficient to support conviction, and we conclude, under the circumstances, that the erroneous instruction was neutralized.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
