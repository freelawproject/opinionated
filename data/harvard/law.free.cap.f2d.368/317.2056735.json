Asserting that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and inadequate the plaintiff moved for a new trial on the question of damages alone. The district court denied the motion and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-27\"> We have examined the record in the light of the plaintiff\u2019s contentions. The trial errors which the plaintiff alleges are so lacking in merit as to border on the frivolous. So far as concerns the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the amount of the verdict is inadequate and against the weight of the evidence it is sufficient to say that the district court in the exercise of the discretion which the law commits to it in this regard overruled this contention and was certainly not guilty of an abuse of discretion in doing so. Beyond determining this question our reviewing authority does not extend. Lebeck v. William A. Jarvis, Inc., 3 Cir. 1957, 250 F.2d 285, 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-28\">The judgment and order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
