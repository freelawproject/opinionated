Appellant, a certified public accountant, then entered into arrangements with auditing employees of the Internal Revenue Service by which appellant made surreptitious cash payments to the employees and, upon audit, the employees disallowed a lesser portion of the deductions than should have been disallowed. Appellant was named a defendant in 24 counts of a 27 count indictment. In nine of these counts he was charged with aiding and abetting codefendants, Internal Revenue Service agents, in receiving illegal fees, compensations and rewards for the performance of their duties, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a) (2) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; in three with giving money to various codefendant Internal Revenue Service agents during the year 1963, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f); in nine other counts with giving money to the various agents with intent to influence their official acts during the years 1961 and 1962, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201; and in three other counts, which set forth the same acts that allegedly violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f), with corruptly giving money to various agents of the Internal Revenue Service with intent to influence their official acts during the year 1963, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b). After a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Murphy, J., he was convicted on all 24 counts and sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-18\">Eight issues have been presented for appellate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-19\">First, appellant maintains that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it did not instruct the jury that in order to convict appellant on the nine counts charging the aiding and abetting of violations of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a) (2) one of the elements of the crimes necessary to be proved was criminal intent. It is not entirely clear whether appellant is maintaining that the charge was deficient as to appellant\u2019s intent to aid and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>abet or that it was deficient relative to the Internal Revenue Service agents\u2019 intent to commit the crime. But we note that no objection as to either was made to the charge as given, and- no request for a further charge as to anyone\u2019s intent was made to the trial court before the jury retired. Therefore, unless there was a charge so deficient that we must consider it to be \u201cplain error\u201d no objection to the charge will be here countenanced. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">With reference to Umans\u2019s intent to aid and abet the commission of the nine crimes, the charge given was proper. It followed the standard laid down in Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 619, 69 S.Ct. 766, 770, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949) quoting L. Hand, J., in United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2 Cir. 1938) that the defendant \u201cin some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as something he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed.\u201d Further, the jury convicted Umans on other counts that involved the same incidents, and as to those counts the jury was instructed that to find him guilty he must have made the payments with \u201can intent on the part of the defendant to corruptly influence the employee as to the audit then pending before him.\u201d Under these circumstances, we find no inadequacy in the charge as to the need of proof of Umans\u2019s intent to aid and abet.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The trial court\u2019s charge did not include any instructions that proof of the criminal intent of Internal Revenue Service agents to commit the crimes they committed in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a) (2) was necessary in order to convict Umans of having committed the crimes he was charged with having committed in aid thereof. This was error, as one\u2019s criminal intent is a necessary element of the proof required to convict under that statute. In United States v. Byrd, 352 F.2d 570, 572 (2 Cir. 1965) such an omission in a charge was held by this court to be plain error requiring reversal of a conviction despite the absence of an objection at trial. It is also a necessary element of the proof needed to convict one who aids and abets a violation. See United States v. Jones, 308 F.2d 26, 32 (2 Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">We do not consider the omission here, however, sufficiently prejudicial, in the absence of an objection at trial, to require reversal of Umans\u2019s convictions on these counts. The agents whose criminal acts Umans was charged with aiding and abetting were prosecuted together with him in the same indictment with him, prior to Umans\u2019s trial had pleaded guilty to having committed the crimes, had testified for the Government at Umans\u2019s trial, and had admitted their guilt on the stand in the jury\u2019s presence. The jury knew the agents had the required criminal intent from the agents\u2019 own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Appellant next claims that, as he had been convicted for committing the same criminal acts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 (b) on the one hand, and, on the other, under \u00a7 201(f), and had also been convicted for the same criminal acts on the one hand under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a) (2), and, on the other, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, he had been, in both instances, convicted of having committed mutually inconsistent crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">It appears that in both claimed inconsistent instances one of the two statutes requires proof of an extra element to convict, a specific intent to influence official action, while the other statute only requires proof that payment was made to an agent in a situation where no payment was necessary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There are no con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>tradictory elements of required proof between the two statutes; only additional elements of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Moreover, there is no merit to appellant\u2019s contention that counts under \u00a7 201(f) charge appellant with paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the agents \u201cproperly\u201d to perform their duties; the section makes it criminal to pay an official a sum which he is not entitled to receive regardless of the intent of either payor or payee with respect to the payment. United States v. Irwin, 354 F.2d 192, 198 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 967, 86 S.Ct. 1272, 16 L.Ed.2d 308 (1966). Therefore, the correct relationship between \u00a7 201(b) and \u00a7 201(f) is that \u00a7 201(f) is a lesser included offense of \u00a7 201(b). There is no reason to believe that Congress intended that there should be concurrent convictions and sentences under both sections, and we should not allow multiple convictions based on the same transactions even where the sentences are concurrent. The sentences on the lesser \u00a7 201 (f) counts therefore are vacated. This will have no effect upon appellant\u2019s term of imprisonment because the vacated sentences are concurrent with those remaining in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Appellant also claims prejudicial \u25a0error because the trial court rejected his requested charge to the jury that he must be acquitted if the jury found that he was coerced by the revenue agents into making the payments he paid them. The trial court rejected this instruction because he found \u201cnot one scintilla of evidence in the case with regard to a shakedown.\u201d Our examination of the record confirms this conclusion, and we approve the forthright action of the court below in refusing to give the requested immaterial charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In three instances Umans did not pay the Internal Revenue agents until after they had completed their audits on the tax returns in issue, and, as to these payments, Umans claims there is no evidence in the record that the payments were made with intent to influence the agents, as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 and \u00a7 201(b). This claim is without merit. Not only may Umans\u2019s similar acts involved in the other counts be considered with reference to his intent in making these three payments, United States v. Baneth, 155 F.2d 978, 980 (2 Cir. 1946), but there is evidence in the record that indicates that in each of the three instances an arrangement or understanding with the agent had been arrived at, with payment to follow audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Appellant requested the trial judge to inspect the grand jury minutes. The request was refused. Because none of the government witnesses at the trial were witnesses before the grand jury, appellant claims that the trial judge should have inspected the minutes of the grand jury proceedings in order to determine whether there was testimony to support the indictment and whether there were inconsistencies between the testimony before the grand jury and that at trial. Appellant claims that the judge\u2019s failure to comply with his request was an abuse of discretion. There is no merit to this claim. The Government reveals that the indictment was based upon testimony of an Internal Revenue agent who summarized for the grand jury the contents of various affidavits of the witnesses who later testified at appellant\u2019s trial. While the grand jury testimony was not made available to appellant, these affidavits were furnished to him, and, even if the grand jury minutes had been turned over, the material therein would have added nothing to appellant\u2019s arsenal of information. Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 76 S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956), allows the Government to obtain indictments based on hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">While we are not condemning the procedure used here before the grand jury, we think it not amiss for us to state that excessive use of hearsay in the presentation of government cases to grand juries tends to destroy the historical function of grand juries in assessing the likelihood of prosecutorial success and tends to destroy the protection from unwarranted prosecutions that grand juries are supposed to afford to the innocent. Hearsay evidence should only be used when direct testimony is unavailable or when it is demonstrably inconvenient to summon witnesses able to testify to facts\u2018from personal knowledge. Appellant\u2019s claim of inconsisten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>cies between grand jury and trial testimony is based on United States v. Borelli, 336 F.2d 376 (2 Cir. 1964), cert. denied sub nom. Mogavero v. United States, 379 U.S. 960, 85 S.Ct. 647, 13 L.Ed.2d 555 (1956), which holds that the defendant is entitled for impeachment purposes to know about inconsistencies between the grand jury and trial testimony of trial witnesses. However, this claim was not raised by appellant at trial, and, even if it were, the claim has no merit, for appellant had the affidavits upon which the grand jury testimony was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Appellant maintains that he was prejudiced because statements of government witnesses were not turned over to him pursuant to his request under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. These statements were sealed by the court. We have examined these sealed statements and find that they relate to payments received by the government witnesses from persons other than appellant, and the material not furnished to appellant in no way related to him. During the trial appellant cross-examined the government witnesses extensively as to their dealings with other persons. In each instance the witness admitted accepting money from other taxpayers\u2019 representatives. Since questions on cross-examination calling for details of other instances of bribery for which the witness had been indicted might properly have been excluded at trial, United States v. Irwin, 354 F.2d 192, 198 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 967, 86 S.Ct. 1272, 16 L.Ed.2d 308 (1966), appellant was not prejudiced by the unavailability of the statements for impeachment purposes. None of the government witnesses were asked on direct examination about payments to them by persons other than appellant, and the withheld material did not directly relate to the subject matter of the witnesses\u2019 direct testimony. Under these circumstances, production was not required by the Jencks Act and the court\u2019s order sealing the statements was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Appellant raises the question of the propriety of his being charged with aiding and abetting a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a) (2) so as to preserve that question for the consideration of the United States Supreme Court in the event of an appeal. He does not urge it before this court, conceding that our opinion in United States v. Kenner, 354 F.2d 780 (2 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 958, 86 S.Ct. 1223, 16 L.Ed.2d 301 (1966), resolves the issue against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Appellant\u2019s final point that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f) is void for vagueness need not be considered by us for we have vacated his convictions under that section on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">The judgment below should be affirmed except for the judgment of conviction upon the three counts charging violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f), which is ordered vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">.
