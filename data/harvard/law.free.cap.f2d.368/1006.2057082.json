However, the special inquiry officer then granted Tovar\u2019s application for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) (2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a) (2) (1964). In granting this application, the officer first determined that Tovar was eligible for such relief and then exercised administrative discretion in granting it. On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board), held that the special inquiry officer erred in determining that Tovar was eligible for suspension of deportation, and on that ground denied the application for suspension of deportation. Tovar petitions this court to review the Board order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">Tovar was not eligible for such relief unless he was a person of good moral character within the meaning of section 244(a) (2). The special inquiry officer determined that Tovar was a person of good moral character notwithstanding the fact that he is a registered sex offender under section 647, subd. 5 of the Penal Code of the State of California, and was three times (1955, 1957, 1962), arrested by police officers patrolling public restrooms, and each time convicted for \u201cvagrancy, lewd,\u201d in violation of section 647, subd. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\"> On this review, Tovar argues that the Board is without authority to review the special inquiry officer\u2019s determination that Tovar is a person of good moral character and that, if the Board does have such authority, it reached an erroneous conclusion as to that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">We find no merit in either of these contentions, and therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">Affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
