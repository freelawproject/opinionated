Roth, 283 F.2d 765 (2 Cir. 1960), vacated 286 F.2d 635 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 961, 81 S.Ct. 1922, 6 L.Ed.2d 1254 (1961). However sympathetic we may be to the desire to be rid of the stigma of even a one-month\u2019s sen-' tence for a misdemeanor, Article III of the Constitution wisely prohibits courts of the United States from diverting their energies to matters without legal effect. And we are not required to decide whether added allegations made in Greene\u2019s motion for reargument in the District Court, if proved, would have sufficed to create a case or controversy even though the initial petition did not. For we are convinced that, as demonstrated in Judge Tenney\u2019s careful opinion on re-argument, Greene was in no way deprived of his right to counsel during his 1954 trial for criminal contempt. Thus, even if there had been error in denying him leave to appeal from his conviction <em>in forma pauperis </em>on the basis of the alleged denial, which we strongly doubt, this was <em>damnum absque injuria.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
