They are very pertinent to the basic issue here before us and not distinguishable in principle. However, for reasons not stated, the majority does not seem to follow those cases. The cases to which I refer are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-20\">In re Faustmann, 155 F.2d 388, 33 CCPA 1065. (typewriter keyboard)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azm_\">In re Jennings, 182 F.2d 207, 37 CCPA 1023. (vacuum condenser)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-21\">In re Bartlett, 300 F.2d 942, 49 CCPA 969. (plastic floor tile)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-22\">In re McKay, 316 F.2d 952, 50 CCPA 1257. (lint remover)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-23\">In re Laverne, 356 F.2d 1003, 53 CCPA 1158. (molded chair)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-24\">These cases have properly recognized that the test of obviousness of a design under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 requires a different analysis than that usually employed in mechanical cases. Thus, in the <em>Faustmivan </em>case, while the court was considering the concept of \u201cinvention\u201d rather than \u201cobviousness,\u201d it stated that the problem in designs required that it \u201cmust necessarily be approached from a different angle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-25\">A unanimous four-judge court in <em>Laverne </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-26\">* * * The test must be obviousness, for that is the dictate of section 103, but it must be applied in a way which will implement the legislative intent to promote progress in the field of industrial design by means of the patent incentive. This will not be done by denying patents to everything competent designers produce by the skill of their calling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-27\">Here, appellant\u2019s type font design is new. The differences which make it new are dismissed by the majority as \u201cobvious.\u201d In arriving at that conclusion I find no evidence in the majority opinion that the design was ever considered as a whole as is specifically required by section 103. The design of a font of type is the design of an entity. To support the majority opinion, this concept must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>be disregarded and the totality of the design ignored in favor of picking apart of the design bit by bit and then finding these \u201cbits\u201d to be obvious. Applying the same tests to any design, the majority would move to the legal conclusion that such creations would be \u201cobvious\u201d because they are composed of linear surfaces which per se are old and it would be obvious to provide an old contour here and another old contour there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">The result is to consider a design as the blind men of the fable considered the elephant. One gets no concept of an elephant as a whole by an examination of its various components. Yet if we adopt the test here applied by the majority we are required to look to the separate details of the designer\u2019s concept without once lifting our eyes to see and consider the entirety of the design concept. A judgment as to obviousness on such an analysis is not what is intended by the conditions imposed upon us in section 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Here, the design which the designer provided is of an entire font of type or the like which, <em>as a whole, </em>is characterized by what is here termed its \u201cboldness.\u201d This boldness of the totality of the design is apparent from the reproductions which are included in the majority opinion. The font of type designed by appellant and that of the Smith reference must be compared as wholes before the test of section 103 is met. What appellant did was not to \u201cmodify\u201d the Smith type font. Rather, what appellant did was to design a new font of type having a characteristic lacking from the Smith concept, i. e., a font of type in which blockier, more solid letter and numeral designs were employed to achieve the over-all new design. The changes in any individual letter or numeral admittedly are not pronounce but the results of these individual changes become cumulative as one progresses through the entire font of type so that when the complete font is viewed as a whole appellant\u2019s concept of \u201cboldness\u201d in the entire type font is seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">There is nothing of record here from which we should conclude as a fact that the novel boldness of appellant\u2019s design is but an obvious variant on the design of the Smith font. I would, therefore, adhere to our prior decisions in design cases and for the reasons spelled out therein, I would reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
