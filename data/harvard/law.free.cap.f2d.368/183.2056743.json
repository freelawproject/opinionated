As grounds for relief, defendant asserts (1) that the indeterminate sentence imposed upon him is illegal, and (2) that he was convicted by the knowing use of perjured testimony by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The trial court in its opinion correctly points out that the petition on its face shows petitioner has not sought relief under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 in the sentencing court upon the grounds here asserted and that he has neither alleged nor demonstrated that his \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Section 2255 clearly requires a prisoner to exhaust his remedies under such section in the sentencing court before seeking relief by habeas corpus. United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232; Haynes v. Harris, 8 Cir., 344 F.2d 463, 466; Smith v. Settle, 8 Cir., 302 F.2d 142, 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> While \u00a7 2255 contains the exception that habeas corpus may lie without previously invoking relief under \u00a7 2255 where it is shown that the \u00a7 2255 relief is inadequate or ineffective, the burden is upon the petitioner to allege or demonstrate inadequacy or ineffectiveness. Smith v. Settle, supra. Such burden has not here been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The trial court upon the basis of a full consideration of the record before it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">\u201cBecause petitioner has not sought relief in the committing court under Section 2255 of Title 28, U.S.C.A. on the grounds here relied on, and because he has not demonstrated that his remedy under that Section is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, this petition should be dismissed without prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Our examination of the record convinces us that the trial court properly dismissed the petition for writ of habeas corpus without prejudice for the reasons which it states.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">The judgment dismissing the petition is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
