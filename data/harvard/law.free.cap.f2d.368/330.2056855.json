He came to the United States from Korea at age 18, after completing high school. He attended college here, studying political science, and received a degree. He has attended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>law school and is employed by a patent law firm. His family, consisting of his mother, three brothers, and a sister live in Korea. Although he believes the only employment he could secure in Korea would be in his brother\u2019s fishing business, one brother is a newspaper editor and the other a publisher. He testified that he would be unable to read intellectual writing in Korean because Chinese characters are used. These forms are taught at college level, and petitioner had his college work in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Petitioner testified: \u201cI am to'o much Americanized at this moment to return to Korea and struggle for my living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The inquiry officer was convinced that petitioner\u2019s life in Korea would be different from that in the United States, and that he would not be able to obtain employment comparable to that in the United States, but concluded that \u201cthese facts alone do not constitute extreme hardship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">We cannot conclude that the hearing officer applied an improper standard, nor that the finding was arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The order is</p>\n<p id=\"AMg\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
