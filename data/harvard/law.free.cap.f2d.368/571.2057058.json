B &amp; L Farms Co. v. United States, 238 F.Supp. 407. The conclusions reached by the district court are correct and its judgment is free from error. That judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b627-18\">JOHN B. BROWN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ale\">(dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b627-19\">I concur fully in the Court\u2019s affirmance of the District Court\u2019s disallowance of the claimed deductions under Sections 165 and 167, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 165, 167. But I disagree as to \u00a7 162, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-20\">The Taxpayer entity is the corporate bankrupt. On the date of adjudication the Bankrupt owed large sums for costs incurred in the growing of produce. These were admittedly \u201cordinary and necessary expenses\u201d for \u201ccarrying on [the] trade or business,\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 162. On adjudication the Bankrupt lost irrevocably control over the use or disposition of corporate assets. From that moment on such assets were held irrevocably for (a) general creditors and (b) administration expenses \u2014 each and both items which may have been of an unknown amount at the time, but each of which was ascertainable in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-22\">By virtue of our ruling we now hold that the Taxpayer had not \u201cpaid\u201d these debts in the year of adjudication and that they were not \u201cpaid\u201d until the year in which creditors received dividends. The effect of this is to give the Government a super priority for taxes \u2014 taxes not really due and, conversely, to deprive general creditors of $162,000 of assets for further distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-23\">By every realistic standard the creditors were \u201cpaid\u201d at the moment the Trustee came into possession and control of the Bankrupt\u2019s assets under the inescapable obligation to hold and distribute them (or their proceeds) to creditors. Bankruptcy law and tax law ought to coalesce to produce a realistic result.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-24\">Prior to bankruptcy the Bankrupt had kept its books and reported its income on a cash basis, on a fiscal year beginning August 1 and ending July 31. During fiscal year 1958 (ending July 31, 1958) the company incurred debts in excess of $2,500,000 for fertilizer, insecticides, and other deductible business expenses, but as the result of a freeze made no crop. On August 1,1958, the first day of fiscal 1959, it filed a petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, and failing an arrangement, was adjudicated on June 26, 1959, within the same fiscal 1959 year. The Trustees in bankruptcy have applied for recovery of $162,538.73 in income taxes paid for the year ending July 31, 1956, under an asserted carry-back under Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. This the Government opposes because, though the property of the Bankrupt did pass to the Trus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>tees within fiscal year 1959, the Trustees did not actually <em>pay </em>dividends to the creditors until a later year, beyond the permissible carry-back three-year period. From an adverse ruling of the District Court, the Trustees in bankruptcy have prosecuted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The District Court and now this Court misconstrues the character and function of the Trustee in bankruptcy. He is far more than a mere \u201ccollection agent\u201d for the creditors. Under Section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110a, the Trustee is vested by operation of law as of the date of bankruptcy with title to all of the non-exempt property of a bankrupt. Since the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 the Congress has recognized that insolvent estates are trusts, of which the creditors are the beneficiaries,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and this Court has been on record since 1900 as recognizing that these estates belong to the creditors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That the Trustee\u2019s obligation, first, foremost, and always, is to the creditors is the consistent theme running throughout the Act. His duties to the bankrupt (as, setting aside the bankrupt\u2019s exemptions <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) are merely incidental to the proper administration and liquidation of the estate which passes to him by operation of law for the creditors\u2019 benefit. His receipts from liquidation of the estate are taxed with the costs of liquidation and with the costs of court (called administrative costs by the District Court), it is true, but this is because the Congress has determined that the creditors, for whom the estate is administered, and not the public at large, must pay the costs directly involved, and not because the Trustee is any the less the creditors\u2019 trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Section 63 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103, which matures all of the debts of the bankrupt on the date of bankruptcy (even those which, under the agreement of the parties, do not fall due until after the bankruptcy petition is filed), is the natural corollary of \u00a7 70. At the instant of bankruptcy the title to the assets vest in the Trustee, in trust for the creditors, pro rata according to the debts held by them as of that same instant. True, at that instant no creditor is entitled to receive, or to demand, from the Trustee any sum certain. The exact amount each creditor will receive must await the converting of the property to cash and the payment of the costs. But mere postponement of enjoyment has never been held to disqualify an interest as \u201cproperty.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">As the District Court has observed, payment in cash <em>or its equivalent </em>has long been recognized. The transfer by operation of law of the assets of the bankrupt to the trustee amounted to exactly that.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">I would reverse the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\">.
