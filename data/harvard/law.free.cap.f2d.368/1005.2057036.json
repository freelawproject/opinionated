National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. Secs. 158(a) (1) and (a) (3). We have carefully reviewed the record and find that although the evidence concerning the alleged violations is in sharp conflict, the trial examiner exercised a valid credibility choice. The examiner\u2019s conclusions that respondent coercively interrogated its employees and that it was unlawfully motivated in the discharge of two of its employees, which conclusions were adopted by the Board, are amply supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. The petition is granted and the Board\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
