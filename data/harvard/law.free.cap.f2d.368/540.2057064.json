The Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-19\">Appellant seeks to distinguish that case, asserting that there the employer, holding a bareboat charter from the shipowner, was obligated under the charter agreement to make the owner whole for damages resulting from an unseaworthy condition caused by the charterer. Appellant thus likens that case to Ryan Stevedoring Company v. Pan-Atlantic S.S. Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956). In <em>Ryan </em>the imposition on the employer of the economic burden of its employee\u2019s recovery for unseaworthiness was allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 905. This result, however, was justified upon the ground that by its warranty to the shipowner the employer took upon itself not only its own limited obligations to its employee under the Act, but the obligations of the shipowner as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In this case, appellant asserts, we do not have the three-party situation which existed in <em>Ryan </em>and in <em>The Yaka, </em>where the employer\u2019s unseaworthiness responsibility was based upon a duty to indemnify the owner. Here it is asserted if there is such responsibility it runs directly to the employee \u2014 a result which \u00a7 905 expressly forbids.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Appellant misreads <em>The Yaka. </em>Its construction of the holding is in accord with the views of the District Court in <em>The Yaka </em>but is clearly contrary to the reasoning of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court did not hold the shipowner liable for unseaworthiness. It expressly stated: \u201cWe do not reach that question here\u201d (373 U.S. at 411, footnote 1, 83 S.Ct. at 1351). It held the charterer, as owner <em>pro hac vice, </em>to a warranty of seaworthiness running to its employee. The error on which the Court of Appeals was reversed was \u201cin holding Pan-Atlantic [the employer and charterer] could not be held personally liable for the unseaworthiness of the ship which caused petitioner\u2019s injury.\u201d (373 U.S. at 412, 83 S.Ct. at 1351). \u201cThe only question,\u201d the Court stated (at page 412, 83 S.Ct. at page 1352) \u201cis whether the Longshoremen\u2019s Act prevents recovery by petitioner for Pan-Atlantic\u2019s breach of its warranty of seaworthiness.\u201d It rejected the contention (at page 414, 83 S.Ct. at page 1352) \u201cthat petitioner must be completely denied the traditional and basic protection of the warranty of seaworthiness simply because Pan-Atlantic was not only the owner, <em>pro hac vice, </em>of the ship but was also petitioner\u2019s employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Section 905 was, in clearest terms, held not to bar recovery by an employee for a breach of his employer\u2019s warranty of seaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The District Court did not err in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Also assigned as error are holdings of the District Court rejecting appellant\u2019s contentions that the vessel on which injury was sustained was at the time a \u201cdead ship\u201d; that appellee was not at the time of injury engaged in seamen\u2019s work; that <em>The Yaka </em>is distinguishable upon the ground that it dealt with a longshoreman, while appellee was a marine electrician. In none of these do we find merit. The first contention we view essentially as one of fact upon which the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. On the last two contentions we regard Pope &amp; Talbot v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953) as controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-12\">. This was a libel in personam, grounded on the admiralty jurisdiction of the District Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">Libelant first brought an action at law, alleging both unseaworthiness and negligence, grounded upon diversity jurisdiction. Upon Pacific\u2019s motion the negligence (Jones Act) claim was dismissed; later the unseaworthiness claim was transferred to admiralty by stipulation. Libelant has cross-appealed the dismissal of his negligence count, on the ground that even if a Jones Act claim will not lie, he can maintain a negligence action on the admiralty side under traditional maritime law, see Pope &amp; Talbot v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 413, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953). Apparently the District Court did not rule on this contention. However, in view of our affirmance of libelant\u2019s unseaworthiness claim, we decline to rule either on the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the Jones Act claim, or on libelant\u2019s argument for a negligence claim in admiralty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-21\">. 44 Stat. 1424 (1927), as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-22\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-23\">\u201cThe liability of an employer prescribed in Section 904 of this title shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, * * * otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death * * *.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b598-10\">MATHES, Senior District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AYe\">(concurring specially).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">I concur in the result; but do so only because Reed v.
