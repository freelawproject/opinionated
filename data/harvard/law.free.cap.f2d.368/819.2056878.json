His confinement results from a judgment and commitment order entered on November 25, 1960. The judgment followed his conviction, in a jury trial, of offenses proscribed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495. On each of nine counts he was sentenced to a term of ten years, the terms to commence and run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">On July 19, 1965, the appellant filed a motion based upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied the motion without a hearing, the order of denial reciting that all pertinent files and records \u201cconclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">In the motion filed in the court below, the appellant alleged, in effect, that the indictment under which he was convicted was \u201cdefective,\u201d that it did not \u201cstate a charge,\u201d that it did not \u201cspecify what Statue [sic] was violated,\u201d and that it was so insufficient that the appellant was unable, intelligently, to enter his plea of not guilty. The allegations in the motion continue with the assertion that the plea was void and that, hence, the conviction was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">The contentions were clearly without merit, and the action of the District Court was proper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An indictment\u2019s irregularities or defects, such as are alleged, must be attacked on direct appeal. They are not subject to attack in proceedings instituted under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. \u201cIt is the general rule that an indictment, not questioned at trial or on direct appeal, will not be held insufficient on a motion to vacate the judgment entered thereon unless it is so obviously defective that by no reasonable construction can it be said to charge the offense for which conviction was had.\u201d Palomino v. United States, 318 F.2d 613, 616 (9th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 932, 84 S.Ct. 335, 11 L.Ed.2d 264 (1963), rehearing denied, 375 U.S. 989, 84 S.Ct. 520, 11 L.Ed.2d 476 (1964). \u201cThe indictment is not open to collateral attack after conviction. Such an issue must be raised on direct appeal, unless the indictment is so fatally defective as to deprive the court of jurisdiction.\u201d Fiano v. United States, 291 F.2d 113, 114 (9th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 943, 82 S.Ct. 380, 7 L.Ed.2d 340 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">In our court, the appellant presents a new contention. He correctly recites that the indictment charges him, in nine counts, with nine violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495 and that his sentences were fixed under that statute. He then argues that the treasury check, the endorsement of which he was charged to have forged in Count One, was a \u201cpension check issued to a pensioner\u201d and that for the forgery of such a check, he should have been indicted and sentenced under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 128, which prescribed a maximum imprisonment term of five years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Appellant has overlooked the fact that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 128 has been repealed and that the effective date of the repeal was January 1, 1958. Veterans\u2019 Benefit Act of 1957, Pub.L. 85-56, \u00a7 2203(88), 71 Stat. 162. The nine offenses were committed in 1960.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0I\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-12\">. We have examined the indictment. In its heading appears \u201c[18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495\u2014 Forgery of Writing, Uttering Forged Writing].\u201d Each of the nine counts mentions \u201c18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495,\u201d and each specifies treasury checks by number, date, amount, and the names of the payees whose signatures appellant was accused of forging.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-17\">. A somewhat similar contention was made in Conerly v. United <em>States </em>of America, 850 F.2d 679 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b877-15\">. Even if appellant\u2019s conviction under Count One of the indictment had been improper, such determination would not invalidate the judgments entered pursuant to this conviction on the other eight counts. This being so, a decision favoring appellant in his latest contention would not alter the correctness of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that he is not entitled to relief. See United States v. Romano, 382 U.S. 136, 138, 86 S.Ct. 279, 15 L.Ed.2d 210 (1965); United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. 63, 65, 85 S.Ct. 754, 13 L.Ed.2d 658 (1965); Banzer v. United States, 367 F.2d 865 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
