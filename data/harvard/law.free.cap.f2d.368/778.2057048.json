Greyhound\u2019s own employees formerly performed the janitorial and loading services at each of Greyhound\u2019s terminals, and were represented by the Union. In 1954, Greyhound and Floors entered into an agreement by which Greyhound subcontracted to Floors the performance of janitorial and loading services at Greyhound\u2019s Jacksonville, Florida, terminal. When the Union contested the right of Greyhound to subcontract the janitorial and loading work, Greyhound brought an action against the Union for a declaratory judgment which finally resulted in a decision by this Court upholding Greyhound\u2019s right to subcontract this part of its operations. Amalgamated Association etc. v. The Greyhound Corporation, 5 Cir., 1956, 231 F.2d 585, 57 A.L.R.2d 1394. In 1951 and 1958 the same agreement, as amended and revised, was put into effect at Greyhound\u2019s terminals in St. Peters-burg, Tampa and Miami.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">In 1961 the Union filed an amended representation petition with the Board naming Greyhound and' Floors as co-employers of the employees involved. In 1962 the Board issued a decision and direction of election finding Floors and Greyhound to be co-employers of the employees and directing an election in the unit petitioned for by the Union. Greyhound then filed suit in the federal district court seeking to enjoin the election ordered by the Board. The district court held that the Board had acted in excess of its statutory authority in finding Greyhound to be co-employer with Floors and permanently enjoined the holding of the election. The Greyhound Corporation v. Boire, Regional Director, S.D.Fla.1962, 205 F.Supp. 686. The district court held that the findings of the Board \u201cestablish as a matter of law that Floors, Inc. is an independent contractor and, for the purposes of collective bargaining, its employees are not the employees of the plaintiff [Greyhound].\u201d (205 F.Supp. at 689). On appeal, in a per curiam opinion, this Court expressed itself as in agreement with the principles stated and the decision reached by the district court and affirmed. Boire, Regional Director v. The Greyhound Corporation, 5 Cir. 1962, 309 F.2d 397. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and subsequently ruled that the district court did not have jurisdiction to issue the injunction. Boire v. The Greyhound Corporation, 1964, 376 U.S. 473, 84 S.Ct. 894, 11 L.Ed. 2d 849. In the course of its opinion, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-15\">\u201cIt is said that the Board\u2019s finding that Greyhound is an employer of employees who are hired, paid, transfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>red and promoted by an independent contractor is, * * *, plainly in excess of the statutory powers delegated to it by Congress. This argument, we think, misconceives both the import of the substantive federal law and the painstakingly delineated procedural boundaries of Kyne [Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d <em>210.]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\">\u201cWhether Greyhound, as the Board held, possessed sufficient control over the work of the employees to qualify as a joint employer with Floors is a question which is unaffected by any possible determination as to Floors\u2019 status as an independent contractor, since Greyhound has never suggested that the employees themselves occupy an independent contractor status. And whether Greyhound possessed sufficient indicia of control to be an \u2018employer\u2019 is essentially a factual issue, unlike the question in Kyne, which depended solely upon construction of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">(376 U.S. at 481, 84 S.Ct. at 899.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, an election was held by the Board and the Union was certified as bargaining representative. Floors and Greyhound then refused to bargain with the Union and the Board issued a complaint alleging a violation of Section 8 (a) (1) and (5) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Act on the part of Floors and Greyhound. The parties <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> entered into a stipulation waiving a hearing before a Trial Examiner and submitting the case directly to the Board for findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order. The Board made full and elaborate findings of fact which it summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">\u201cUpon our consideration of the record in its entirety, we are satisfied that the evidence cogently demonstrates that Greyhound and Floors share, or co-determine, those matters governing essential terms and conditions of employment of the porters, janitors, and maids herein in such a manner as to support our finding that their status is that of joint employers. It is clear from the circumstances of this case that, whatever Floors\u2019 status as an independent contractor with Greyhound, Greyhound has reserved to itself, both as a matter of express contractual agreement and in actual practice, rights over these employees which are consistent with its status as their employer along with Floors.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>We rely, in sum, particularly upon the following circumstances: The Board\u2019s findings and conclusions in its decision in the related representation case; the fact that these employees constitute a homogeneous, readily identifiable and stable unit by virtue of their previous bargaining history and their lack of contact and interchange with Floors\u2019 other employees; the nature of the service agreements which bestow upon Greyhound the right to (1) establish work schedules, and assign employees to perform the work: (2) specify the exact manner and means through which the work will be accomplished and issue orders or instructions to that effect, especially when Floors\u2019 supervisors are absent from Greyhound premises; and (3) control straight time wage rates and overtime hours and pay rates in accord with the fixed costs, percentages, and total amounts due to Floors for weeldy and annual periods, as set forth in the agreements; the role of the porters (who comprise by far the largest group in the unit) as integral parts of Greyhound\u2019s transportation enterprise, and their use of Greyhound\u2019s equipment and supplies in their work performance; and, finally, the fact that in the course of their duties, the porters are given detailed supervision by other Greyhound personnel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">As we have seen, the Supreme Court in Boire v. Greyhound Corporation supra, held the question of \u201c * * * whether Greyhound possessed sufficient indicia of control to be an \u2018employer\u2019 is essentially a factual issue * * 376 U.S. at 481, 84 S.Ct. at 899. A careful study of the record and joint appendix in connection with the briefs and oral argument leads us to conclude that substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order does not prevent Floors and Greyhound from continuing their contractual arrangement. As well stated in the Board\u2019s reply brief, they \u201cmay retain their present relationship in every respect except one \u2014 they may not finally establish the wages, hours, and other conditions of employment of unit employees by contract <em>inter se, </em>although they may take a common position and, in good faith, bargain to impasse with the Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">Essentially this case presents factual issues to be determined in accordance with the record and the circumstances of this particular case. To further discuss the many decisions brought forward by the diligence of counsel would not help us to dispose of the questions of fact and would unnecessarily prolong this opinion. The Board\u2019s order will be</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-11\">.

This contention has been disposed of by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the ancillary proceeding, supra [376 U.S. 473, 481, 84 S.Ct. 894], where the Court held, \u2018that the question of whether Greyhound possessed sufficient control over the work of these employees to qualify as a joint employer with Floors is a question which is unaffected by any possible determination as to Floors\u2019 status as an independent contractor.\u2019 (sic) Further, we reject Floors\u2019 contention concerning the inclusion in the unit of its other employees in the cities where Greyhound terminals are located in the light of our findings herein. In this connection, we note, in addition, that the Union is unwilling to represent Floors\u2019 employees who are not based at the Greyhound terminals and that no labor organization seeks to represent Floors\u2019 employees upon a broader basis. Finally, the record conclusively demonstrates that there is at most only minimal interchange between the subject employees and Floors\u2019 other employees in these communities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b836-16\">.
