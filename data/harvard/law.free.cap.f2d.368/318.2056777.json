We find no error. It was not improper for the Government, which presented several witnesses who identified the appellant as the robber, to produce evidence that the appellant, shortly before the robbery, gave his landlady a check for a month\u2019s rent, which cheek was rejected by the bank on which it was drawn because of insufficient funds, and that after the robbery the appellant paid two months\u2019 rent in cash. See Hass v. United States, 344 F.2d 56, 63 (CA 8); Gill v. United States, 285 F.2d 711, 713 (CA 5). A vague reference by a Government witness to the appellant\u2019s former \u201ctroubles\u201d was of no significance, particularly since the appellant\u2019s counsel in his opening statement had advised the jury of the appellant\u2019s prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
