In a well-reasoned opinion, published as United States v. 1,453.49 Acres of Land, etc., S.D.Iowa, 1965, 245 F.Supp. 582, Judge Hanson held the provisions of such mutual will to be binding. His holding is a permissible interpretation of the law of Iowa with which we are in complete accord. On the basis of his opinion as published, this case is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
