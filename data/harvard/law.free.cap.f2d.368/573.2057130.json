The trial was to the Court. The latter found as a fact that at all times relevant to the case, plaintiff had been \u201c * * '* an employee of Continental Interiors\u201d and that \u201cAt no time was he employed or under the direction of Vitraco.\u201d There were the further findings that negligently piled Vitraco, Inc., crates fell and struck plaintiff \u201ccausing the back injury from which he now complains.\u201d The Court also held as Conclusions of Law that \u201cThe plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence\u201d and that the negligent piling of the crates was the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The trial record substantially supports those findings and conclusions of the Court. We hold that the other contentions argued on behalf of appellant are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
