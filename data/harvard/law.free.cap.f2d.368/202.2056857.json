He was sentenced to five years in prison on each count; the sentences are to run concurrently. We reverse for the reasons hereinafter stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">On May 27, 1963, a Mr. James Bishop was contacted in the Brass Rail bar in Tampa, Florida, and invited to engage in a poker game. After the Brass Rail closed, the bartender and Bishop proceeded to a private residence where appellant was present and engaged in a poker game for money. Bishop testified that during the course of the game he issued two checks, one for $92.00 and the other for $300.00, drawn on a California bank. The checks were made payable to cash and were given to South, who was acting as banker, in payment for chips with which to continue the game. Bishop had been drinking for a good part of the evening and he was uncertain whether the appellant won or lost, but he was positive that the bartender won and that he lost. The checks were endorsed by one Lillian Kolsky, and deposited in her account at the International Bank of Tampa the following day. In the normal course of collection, the checks were sent through the mails to the drawee California bank. There was no evidence directly connecting Lillian Kolsky with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The appellant argues that the district court committed error in admitting, over timely and appropriate objection, his income tax returns for the years 1962 and 1963. Both returns showed a reported income of $1,800.00 and three dependents were claimed, the appellant and his two sons. On his 1963 income tax return South stated that he was an outside salesman. On his 1962 return he declared that he was the owner of the Echo Lounge in Tampa. The government introduced the returns for the purpose of showing that South was engaged in a continuous business enterprise of gambling in violation of Florida law. The government\u2019s evidence showed that the gambling games were played with cards and were usually various types of poker. Persons so engaged are sometimes referred to as professional gamblers. It is argued that the amount of income reported on the returns was manifestly too small for the appellant and his two sons to live on, and therefore, he must have had income from illegal gambling sources.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appellant contends that the returns in no way reflect on the question of whether he was a professional gambler, and that if anything they tend to establish that he was guilty of tax evasion in that he failed to report all of his taxable income for the two years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Entirely aside from anything disclosed or proved by South\u2019s income tax returns, the other evidence clearly established ample facts from which the jury could find that South was a professional gambler in violation of Florida law, which is an essential element necessary to support the government\u2019s charges against him. Prior to the introduction of the tax returns the government produced six witnesses who testified to having lost varying sums of money from several hundred to several thousand dollars in card games in which the appellant was an active participant. They also testified to ruthless tactics used by the appellant to insure that they lost in the games. An associate of the appellant who was then serving a prison sentence testified that he and others had been working with the appellant in the gambling business in a sort of \u201cloose confederation\u201d and that the winnings taken from those who were induced to participate in the gambling games were split among the confederates. The victims were referred to as \u201cmarks,\u201d \u201csubjects\u201d or \u201csuckers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We conclude that in the circumstances and under the facts here present a highly likely inference which the jury could certainly have drawn from the disclosures made by \u25a0 the income tax returns was that South had wilfully and unlawfully failed to report all of his income and was an income tax evader.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"> Although evidence which tends to prove an unrelated offense is admissible when relevant to an issue in the case, Fernandez v. United States, 329 F. 2d 899 (9 Cir. 1964) ; Cantrell v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 311, 323 F.2d 613 (1963); Weiss v. United States, 122 F.2d 675 (5 Cir. 1941), such evidence is inadmissible when it has no bearing on the offense of which the defendant is accused. Marko v. United States, 314 F.2d 595 (5 Cir. 1963); Fairbanks v. United States, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 345, 226 F.2d 251 (1955); Hartman v. United States, 215 F.2d 386 (8th Cir. 1954); 1 Wharton, Criminal Evidence \u00a7 232 (1955). Construing these returns in a manner most favorable to the government, we are unable to find that they constituted even the slightest evidence of any probative value tending to show that South was a professional gambler in violation of Florida law. The most favorable inference that can be drawn is that South must have had some other income during the two years in question. They disclose nothing which connects South with gambling. In the context in which they were admitted, the returns clearly indicated that the appellant had failed to report all of his income, and was guilty of income tax evasion. The government\u2019s purpose in introducing the returns to show that South had non-reported income strengthens the inference of tax evasion. An intimation of such an offense could only have inflamed the jury and prejudiced the defendant in their eyes. The government\u2019s insinuations when arguing before the jury that the returns were not truthful further drew the jury\u2019s attention to an irrelevant and extremely prejudicial accusation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Marko v. United States, supra. We conclude that the returns failed to prove or tend to prove any essential element of the charges embraced within the indictment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Moreover, we are completely convinced that they tended to prove that South was guilty of another crime involving his failure to report his true income in violation of a totally unrelated statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such evidence was highly prejudicial, and requires us to reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Nor do we feel that the Court\u2019s limiting instructions cured the defect and eliminated the prejudice. The limitation included in the Court\u2019s charge to the effect that certain evidence was to be considered only for the purpose of establishing that South was a professional gambler was general and made no reference to the tax returns. Since the returns did not tend to prove that South was a professional gambler, and since the instructions were vague and nonspecific as far as the returns were concerned, we cannot say with appreciable certainty that the error did not substantially sway the jury in assessing South\u2019s guilt. The highly prejudicial effect of intimation of tax evasion was not sufficiently eliminated to remove the error. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946); United States v. Clarke, 343 F.2d 90 (3 Cir. 1965); Mora v. United States, 190 F.2d 749 (5 Cir. 1951). We therefore conclude that the conviction must be reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In view of our conclusion as to the admissibility of the tax returns, it is not necessary for us to pass on, and we do not pass on, the sufficiency of the evidence. The appellant makes a very strong argument that there is insufficient evidence to submit to the jury the issue of the appellant\u2019s use of interstate commerce. On re-trial the government may present more substantial evidence connecting the appellant with the use of a facility in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-13\">.
