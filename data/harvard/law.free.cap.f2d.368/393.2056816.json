Upon the trial, the government introduced substantial evidence as to appellant\u2019s guilt and appellant raises no question here as to its sufficiency. Instead, appellant urges three assignments of error: (1) the six-year statute of limitations had run prior to the return of the indictment; (2) the jury\u2019s deliberations were infected-by the physical and emotional strain imposed on its members by an electric power failure causing a city-wide blackout of substantial duration; and (3) the trial court erred in failing to compel the prosecution to turn over to the defense certain \u201cwitness sheets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Appellant filed his income tax return on February 5, 1957. The six-year period of limitations for the wilful evasion of tax, established by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6531(2), commenced to run from the last date upon which the 1956 return was due, to wit, April 15, 1957.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The indictment was returned on August 8, 1963, some 115 days after the expiration of six years. Section 6531 of 26 U.S.C., however, provides for a tolling of the limitations statute whenever a person committing an offense under the internal revenue laws \u201cis outside the United States or is a fugitive from justice\u201d. It was established at trial that appellant had been \u201coutside the United States\u201d in excess of 115 days during the relevant period. Appellant argues that the section was not intended to apply to periods spent \u201coutside the United States\u201d unless the circumstances indicated flight, a substantial impediment to the investigation and enforcement of the internal revenue laws, an evasion of legal process or, at least, a change of residence. We disagree. The statute is unambiguous on its face and clearly covers appellant\u2019s absences. There is nothing unreasonable or arbitrary about the tolling of the statute of limitations during an offender\u2019s absence from the country. Appellant\u2019s claim that the statute, if applied to ordinary business or pleasure trips, is unconstitutional is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">We also reject appellant\u2019s contention that the jury was unable to deliberate fairly or intelligently due to the physical and mental discomfort caused, by the fact that shortly after the jury retired the lights went out as a result of the general Northeast blackout of November 9, 1965. The record discloses, that the jury was adequately provided for in that its members were permitted to make one phone call each in the presence of a marshal, were offered hotel accommodations (which were turned down on account of the substantial descending and climbing of stairs that would have been involved), and were provided with sandwiches and hot coffee. Moreover, appellant\u2019s attorney both consented during the trial to the jury\u2019s continued deliberations in spite of the blackout and failed to object at the end of the trial even though the trial judge invited comment when he read a summary of the night\u2019s events into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">Appellant\u2019s last point is that he was entitled to possession of certain \u201cwitness sheets.\u201d At the trial, a government witness testified on cross-examination that prior to taking the stand he had looked at some twenty pages of \u201cwitness sheets\u201d- \u2014 papers prepared by the government containing the witness\u2019s anticipated testimony. Appellant contends that these witness sheets embodied a \u201cstatement\u201d by the witness within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 and thus should have been turned over to appellant\u2019s attorney on demand. We hold that the contested witness sheets are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u00a7 3500 material as they are neither a \u201cstatement made by * * * and signed or otherwise adopted or approved\u201d by the witness, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e) (1), nor a \u201csubstantial verbatim recital of an oral statement\u201d made by the witness. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\">. Appellant argued below, but does not argue, here, that the statute of limitations should begin to run from the day he actually filed his return (i. e., February 5, 1957) rather than from the last due day for 1956 returns. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the choice of the last due date is compelled by the statute. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6531, 6513.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
