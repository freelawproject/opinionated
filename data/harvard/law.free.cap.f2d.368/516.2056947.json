Oppenheim, as the testamentary trustee of the Isaac Solomon Testamentary Trust and the Hinda Solomon Living Trust and as beneficiary, and his two sisters, Frances Oppenheim and Estelle Oppenheim as beneficiaries brought suit for damages and other relief in the United States District Court, claiming conspiratorial maladministration by defendants of the trusts which had been and were then being administered in courts of the State of Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-18\">Named as defendants were state trial and appellate judges,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> former trustees of the trusts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> certain other beneficiaries of the trusts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an attorney who represented some of the parties in the state proceedings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an individual bearing the same name as plaintiff Frances Oppenheim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and her attorney.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-19\">The defendants Frances Oppenheim of the State of New York, Harold Bresler, Sadelle Willis, Minnie Marks and Jerome Bresler were not served with process and did not appear. Norman Miller was served in the State of New Jersey and moved to dismiss for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction and on the ground that the amended complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The other served defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure of the amended complaint to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>claim on which relief could be granted, among other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The lower court upon argument concluded <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action and that the amended complaint as amended did not state a claim on which relief could be granted. The \u201cmotions to dismiss\u201d were granted and the action was dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiffs as appellants here contend that diversity and federal question jurisdiction appeared from the amended complaint as amended and that claims were stated therein upon which the federal court could have granted relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">To vest a United States District Court with jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship, diversity must affirmatively appear and must be complete as between the plaintiffs on the one hand and the defendants upon the other.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The amended complaint as amended shows that plaintiffs individually were citizens of the State of New York and that the defendants Frances Oppenheim (either an impostor or other person of the same name as that of one of the plaintiffs) and Harold Bresler were also citizens of the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Appellants now say that these were unnecessary parties, that they were not served and therefore that their presence should have been disregarded in ruling upon the question of jurisdiction. It may be granted that they were not indispensable parties. It appears, however, that under the theory on which plaintiffs would have the amended complaint as amended sustained, they were parties at least as proper as any others, it being asserted that all were \u201cco-conspirators\u201d. Parties of course may be dropped in order to achieve the requisite diversity of citizenship if their presence is not essential to a just and meaningful adjudication.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But, in the absence of such dismissals, jurisdiction must be determined from the face of the pleading and not from returns of service of process or lack thereof. There was no motion to drop any party. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the amended complaint was limited in purpose to clearly allege the citizenship rather than the mere residence of the various parties, including that of said two defendants. The intent of the pleader to present a non-diversity case was thus confirmed. We cannot say that the trial court erred in determining that diversity jurisdiction did not exist. Cf. Knoll v. Knoll, 350 F.2d 407 (10th Cir. 1965), supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">Nor did federal question jurisdiction appear. The amended complaint asserted that in addition to claimed diversity jurisdiction the action was founded upon a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1342, relating to mail frauds. There is no legislative history nor is there any case which has been cited to us or which we can find which supports the view that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>a violation of these penal statutes as such affords the court federal question jurisdiction in a civil case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There are no other facts or theories presented in the amended complaint which would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">While, for the purpose of a motion to dismiss, facts well pleaded must be taken as true, unsupported conclusions of the pleader may be disregarded, especially when limited or negated by the substance of facts pleaded.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The amended complaint consists of more than 26 pages and refers to six separate \u201cclaims\u201d. Factual allegations therein are masked or buried by subjective descriptions and are difficult to follow. Many allegations have no possible relevancy or materiality. A conclusionary plethora<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> permeates the pleading. The meaningful tissue of the amended complaint seems limited essentially to these circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Over a period of several years, and at least until one of their number became trustee, appellants have been suspicious of the motives of other beneficiaries, various disputes among them were litigated before the state courts, and plaintiffs became dissatisfied with the manner in which the state courts administered and adjudicated problems in relation to the two trusts. Apparently a development which confirmed in plaintiffs\u2019 minds their worst fears was that on or about December 26, 1962, it was discovered that a party known as \u201cFrances Oppenheim\u201d, residing in New York City, had represented herself as or had been assumed to be plaintiff Frances Oppenheim and had received and cashed a check dated July 15, 1960, for $91.66, issued by the Hinda Solomon Living Trust, a check dated October 24, 1962, for $44.77, issued by the Living Trust, and a check dated November 1, 1962, for $81.00, issued by the Testamentary Trust. It is alleged that \u201cThe instant checks were sent with due deliberation and full intent and knowledge as to identity of addressee to the fraudulent and impostor Frances Oppenheim,\u201d but except for elsewhere concluding that this was the result of a conspiracy among all the defendants, it is not indicated who had the alleged knowledge or intent. The plaintiffs apparently reasoned that because the trustee and the courts knew that they could be reached in care of a designated attorney, sending the checks to the address of the New York party was a deliberate diversion. The defendant Miller, about the time distribution checks were being thus misdirected, wrote to the clerk of court on behalf of the New York recipient stating that his client had received notice of a hearing and asking for a copy of letters testamentary (with will annexed) and other documents. From this inquiry plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>conclude that\u2019the attorney was a member of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d with reference to the misdirected payments and other matters. There is nothing in the amended complaint to indicate that the error was not corrected by the trustees and the court, it having been discovered by plaintiffs and reported to the court by the end of 1962. Thereafter, the principal complaint seemed to be that the court refused to permit plaintiffs to withdraw from its records those checks or to otherwise arrange for their formal re-presentment and recognition as forged endorsements by the banks, and for this purpose the plaintiffs seek, among other relief, an order in the nature of mandamus against the state judges requiring the checks to be released from the records of the court. The plaintiffs continued to be recognized as beneficiaries of the respective trusts for all the pleading shows, although there are intimations that the funds or investments have been mismanaged.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiffs conclude that \u201cA conspiracy, either with the aid or knowledge and consent of the courts was developed to deliberately deprive plaintiffs of their rights and property without allowing access to due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">No basis is asserted for any contention that the state courts did not, and do not now, have jurisdiction over the trusts and all problems relating thereto, except for the suggestion that in connection with the cheeks sent to the alleged \u201cimpostor\u201d various notices were not received by the plaintiffs. Since the time involved was years after the state courts assumed jurisdiction, it is clear that the latter factor would not affect their continuing jurisdiction and related only to the corrective action they were authorized or required to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">We have examined the amended complaint to determine whether, aside from plaintiffs\u2019 untenable reliance upon the mail fraud statute, there is any theory on which it could be thought to state a claim under the Constitution or laws of the United States and have concluded that there is not.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\"> This action obviously failed below by reason of lack of jurisdiction of the lower court to entertain it, despite the reference in the purported findings to the failure also to state a claim on which relief could be granted. We do not ascribe to that court\u2019s \u201cwith prejudice\u201d order of dismissal anything beyond this.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> So interpreting the judgment appealed from, the dismissal of the action with prejudice, that is, without granting an opportunity of further amendment, was not improper. Plaintiffs made no request for the purpose of permitting any more proper statement of a federal claim. Indeed, from the substance of the allegations relied upon, it did appear rather clear that there existed neither a diversity nor federal claim upon which relief could be granted by the trial court even though further opportunity to amend had been granted, in view of the doctrine of judicial immunity <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the jurisdiction which al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ready had attached and was being exercised in the state courts,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and for other reasons before mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"AKC\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\">.

Appellants substantially concede that the motion of the defendant Miller to dismiss on the ground that the New Jersey service did not afford the court jurisdiction over his person was meritorious. Whether the lower court intended to include this motion among the \u201cmotions\u201d granted is not clear from the record but is not material in view of disposition of the other motions. It is apparent that the amended complaint is not based on the theory of an in rem proceeding, nor was there any order to authorize constructive service. Compare Shuford v.
