The order was entered upon the Board\u2019s finding that the Lumber Company had coercively interrogated employees and discharged one of them in the presence of the others because of his union activities, in violation of section 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, and had discharged six other employees because of their union activities, in violation of that section and of section 8(a) (3) of the Act. The Lumber Company attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to support these findings. Our examination of the record, however, satisfies us that substantial evidence which the Board was entitled to, and did, credit supports the fiiidings. We may not, therefore, set them aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The Lumber Company also raises the procedural objections that the Board refused to grant its motion for a more definite statement of the complaint, that the Board refused to grant its request for oral argument before the Board, and that the Board denied its motion for reconsideration, rehearing and reopening of the record based on a letter subsequently received from one of the complaining witnesses. We find each of these objections to be without merit as is the Lumber Company\u2019s motion in this court for an order permitting it to introduce before the Board the additional evidence of the witness in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The motion for leave to introduce additional evidence before the Board will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">A decree enforcing the order of the Board will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
