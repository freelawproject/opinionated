Appellants contend that they were not required to disclose payments of the type which they admittedly received and made and that, therefore, their failure to do so does not constitute a violation of Section 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The AID forms called for \u201cinformation as to agents\u2019 commissions, domestic and foreign * * * paid or to be paid,\u201d to which appellants replied \u201cNone,\u201d and contained the following statement which was signed by appellants without entering anything on the reverse of the form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmZ\">\u201cThe supplier has not given or received and will not give or receive by way of side payment, \u2018kickbacks,\u2019 or otherwise, any benefit in connection with said contract except as is disclosed on the reverse of this form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9V\">Appellants paid 10% of invoice prices to importers of the pharmaceutical products for what they called \u201cpromotion allowances.\u201d Besides these regular payments appellants also paid from time to time various personal expenses of the importers including, for example, airplane tickets, hospital expenses, and transportation of an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Appellants also made regular payments of 2% of invoice price to one of the officials of its supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Moreover, appellants received a 20% commission for acting as agent for their supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">It is obvious that appellants gave and received \u201cbenefits\u201d some of which are also properly to be classified as \u201ccommissions,\u201d \u201cside payments\u201d and \u201ckickbacks.\u201d Their failure to disclose these payments on the AID form clearly constituted a violation of Section 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
