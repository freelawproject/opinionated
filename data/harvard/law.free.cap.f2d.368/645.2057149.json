The District Judge then imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of five years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-24\">The present appeal arises from the District Court\u2019s denial, without hearing, of a motion to vacate the sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It raises for the first time a claim that appellant entered his guilty plea in reliance on the statement of his counsel in the presence of his sister that if he would plead guilty to one count of the indictment he would receive a sentence of but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>one year, whereas the Court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Since April of 1964 the appellant has, without success, filed numerous papers in the District Court seeking release by way of habeas corpus, alleging violations of his constitutional rights and has pursued the litigation in this court. Taking into consideration petitioner\u2019s statement professing unawareness of \u201ctechnical insights\u201d we prefer to proceed directly to the merits of his appeal without deciding the question raised by the appellee that appellant\u2019s claim is barred because he has abused the habeas corpus procedure by failing to allege in earlier petitions facts available to him of known legal significance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Appellant contends that the District \u2022Judge failed to comply with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in determining the voluntariness of his plea of guilty. Indeed, he charges that the exchange between his counsel and the trial judge at the time of sentence lulled him into the belief that the alleged representation of his counsel that his sentence would be but one year would be implemented by the court in a resentence to the reduced term within 60 days. At the time of sentencing the appellant was represented not by court-appointed counsel, but by one of his own choice, regarded by the District Judge as \u201cone of the leaders of the criminal bar.\u201d No claim is made that any assurances were given to the appellant by Government officers or the Court, nor that counsel indicated that such assurance was the basis of his statement that appellant would receive only a one year sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-23\">The substance of the colloquy at the time of the plea and the imposition of sentence is set forth in the margin below.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>It is clear therefrom that the District Judge substantially complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as to the voluntariness of the plea. The District Judge and appellant\u2019s counsel made it emphatically plain to appellant that the minimum sentence that could be imposed upon him was five years. Appellant\u2019s theory that the statements of the District Judge and of counsel justified his conclusion that his resentence to one year would follow within 60 days simply.fails in the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The requirement of a hearing generally necessary for the disposition of factual issues in motions under Section 2255 is subject to the statutory qualification that the record of the case may be sufficient to dispose of the motion where it \u201cconclusively show[s] that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record here leaves no doubt that the appellant was well-informed and understood that the offense to which he had pleaded guilty carried a mandatory minimum sentence of five years. It also shows that the appellant has received fact-finding on the voluntariness of his plea under Rule 11. Under all the circumstances, there is no reason to duplicate that effort here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hence the order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania denying his motion to vacate sentence will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-15\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-16\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b701-25\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">.

Cain v. United States, 271 F.2d 337 (8 Cir. 1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b703-36\">. See Lynott v. United States, 360 F.2d 586 (3 Cir. 1966); United States v. Lester, 328 F.2d 971 (2 Cir. 1964); United States v. Davis, 319 F.2d 482 (6 Cir. 1963). Petitioner\u2019s reliance on Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962) is misplaced. In that case there was a failure by the District Judge to inquire into the voluntariness of the guilty plea in accordance with Rule 11 standards. Also, the petitioner there set forth detailed factual allegations in an affidavit supporting his motion charging that he was instructed by the Assistant District Attorney to withhold knowledge of the alleged plea bargain from both his own counsel and the Court. Moreover, <em>Machibroda </em>in terms states that a hearing is not automatically required, and the conditions supporting its denial are clearly present here. See also United States v. Davis, supra; Olive v. United States, supra note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
