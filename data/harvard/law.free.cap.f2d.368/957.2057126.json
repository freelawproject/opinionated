We reversed and remanded for another trial. Banks v. United States, 348 F.2d 231 (8th Cir. 1965). On remand appellant alone was tried and again found guilty on six counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the jury returned its verdict the United States Attorney filed an information pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237 (1954), as amended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237 (Supp.1956), alleging that appellant had previously been convicted of violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704(a) and 4705(a) (1954). Appellant admitted the prior conviction and thereupon the court imposed the minimum sentence for a second offender, to-wit, ten years on each of the six counts, the sentences to run concurrently. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The alleged offenses, transferring of marihuana without a written order (\u00a7 4742(a), supra) and obtaining marihuana without payment of the tax thereon (\u00a7 4744(a), supra) were proved by undisputed evidence. The investigatory methods employed by the Bureau of Narcotics in Kansas City, Missouri were typical of the procedures that the government has relied upon in its constant and laudable attempt to suppress and abolish illegal traffic in all types of narcotics, including, of course, marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The informer or undercover agent in this case was John McCullough. He had worked with federal and state narcotic bureaus in different parts of the United States for approximately sixteen years. He was living in New York City when he was contacted by the Kansas City Bureau of Narcotics and requested to assist in the investigation of unlawful activities in the Kansas City area. On August 28, 1963 McCullough, working under the supervision of the chief of the Kansas City office, went to the apartment of appellant in Kansas City, Missouri and informed him, in substance, that \u201ca girl had sent me over here, [and said] that you could take care of me * * * and I started to tell him what I wanted; I told him I wanted some marihuana * * * or heroin * * Appellant informed McCullough that he was not in the business of selling marihuana. There was no purchase or transfer on that date. McCullough\u2019s statement about the girl was false and concededly used for the purpose of gaining appellant\u2019s confidence. McCullough saw appellant several times between August 28 and September 2, 1963. On the latter date appellant sold McCullough a quantity of marihuana for $65.00. On September 9th appellant sold two pounds of marihuana to McCullough for $150.00. The third sale was consummated on December 18, 1963. On that date appellant had agreed to sell McCullough four pounds of marihuana for $80.00 a pound but delivered only two pounds for which he was paid $170.00. The money used by McCullough on each of these three occasions had been furnished by narcotic agents. The testimony of McCullough was corroborated by narcotic agents who had kept him under surveillance during each of the three purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">Further discussion of the factual features of the case is unnecessary at this juncture. Appellant did not testify, did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, did not deny possessing and transferring the marihuana on the three occasions mentioned, and did not claim that the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>dence established the defense of entrapment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">The defenses interposed by appellant were typical of the defenses urged in like cases, namely, entrapment and the fact that the informer\u2019s character and past record was such that he was unworthy of belief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cf. Roth v. United States, 270 F.2d 655 (8th Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 931, 80 S.Ct. 368, 4 L.Ed.2d 352 (1960); Warren v. United States, 268 F.2d 691 (8th Cir. 1959); Accardi v. United States, 257 F.2d 168 (5th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 883, 79 S.Ct. 124, 3 L.Ed.2d 112 (1958). In the first trial of Banks, Johnson, and appellant the trial court refused to submit the defense of entrapment because in the court\u2019s opinion there was no factual basis for the submission of that defense. This became and was an issue on the first appeal. We were not required to and did not decide that question. In regard thereto we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-6\">\u201cRealizing that in another trial additional evidence may be forthcoming which could have a pertinent bearing on this issue, we pretermit determining whether on this record the entrapment defense should have been submitted. It is appropriate, however, to observe that ordinarily this defense raises a question of fact which should be submitted to the jury under proper instructions. Sorrells v. United States, supra; Cross v. United States, supra. However, submission is not required when evidence of entrapment is entirely lacking. United States v. Markham, 191 F.2d 936, 937 (7th Cir. 1951).\u201d 348 F.2d at 236.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">The evidence in the second trial was substantially the same as in the first trial. There was no additional evidence relating to the defense of entrapment. For this reason Judge Duncan was reluctant to submit the defense of entrapment, but \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d he submitted the issue to the jury. What ensued during the giving of the instructions is the source of appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-15\">In delivering the charge the court first informed the jury of its fact-finding responsibility and emphasized that it should not be influenced by any comment the court might make in connection with the instructions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">Later the court carefully delineated the constitutive elements of the defense of entrapment as enunciated by the Supreme Court in Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932); Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958), and by this court in Cross v. United States, 347 F.2d 327 (8th Cir. 1965). Thereafter the court directed the jury\u2019s attention to the defense of entrapment and made the following statements which are the bone of contention here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-17\">\n<em>No. 1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-18\">\u201cNow, members of the jury, let\u2019s look at this matter for just a moment. We find that this agent was brought in here, this undercover agent as he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>referred to, brought in here from New York, he was a stranger. You are entitled to take into [account] your common experiences in the affairs of life and wonder why he went out there, why would an undercover agent just walk into the city and go out to a particular address, to a particular individual, at that particular time unless there was some reason or justification for going. He fixed up a story about a girl, he never offered this -man anything, he simply offered to buy marihuana.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-5\">\n<em>No. 2</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-6\">\u201cIt is my opinion, members of the jury, as a legal matter, legal question, that if this Goverment informer went out there and simply said to this defendant that \u2018A girl sent me here,\u2019 nothing about girls, \u2018Some girl sent me here and told me that you could supply me with marijuana,\u2019 that\u2019s not entrapment, and that thereafter he sold it to him, then he is guilty, but it would not be entrapment to simply go out and afford him the opportunity and say, \u2018Well, the girl sent me here,\u2019 that does not constitute entrapment under the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">At the outset we have grave doubt whether the exceptions of appellant to the instructions were sufficient to preserve the question of the propriety of the court\u2019s comments for review. The extent of the objection was: \u201calso we take exception to the Court\u2019s comment on the evidence on the issues of the fact of entrapment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-9\">\u201cNo party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">In Armstrong v. United States, 228 F.2d 764, 768 (8th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 351 U.S. 918, 76 S.Ct. 710, 100 L.Ed. 1450 (1956), we stated in effect that a party objecting to instructions must state specifically to what he objects and why. This rule has been followed in many cases. See, e. g. Boeing Airplane Company v. O\u2019Malley, 329 F.2d 585, 597-598 (8th Cir. 1964); Johnson v. United States, 291 F.2d 150, 156 (8th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 880, 82 S.Ct. 130, 7 L.Ed.2d 80 (1961); Apperwhite v. Illinois Central Railroad Company, 239 F.2d 306, 310 (8th Cir. 1957).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">We have resolved the doubt in favor of appellant and go to the merits of his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">It is, of course, fundamental that in considering the correctness of the instructions we must examine and consider them as a whole. Whether the jury has been properly instructed cannot be determined from consideration of a single paragraph or phrase removed from context. Cf. Anderson v. United States, 262 F.2d 764 (8th Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 929, 79 S.Ct. 1446, 3 L.Ed.2d 1543 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">The precise question before us, i. e., the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s comments has, in one form or another, been the subject of consideration by reviewing courts in many criminal cases. As a result guidelines have been laid down, but there are no iron clad rules which may systematically be applied to each and every situation. Each case must stand on its own bottom and be decided in light of all pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-16\">The Supreme Court, speaking through Chief Justice Hughes, in Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933) made the following pronouncements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-17\">\u201cIn a trial by jury in a federal court, the judge is not \u00e1 mere moderator, but is the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct and of determining questions of law. Herron v. Southern Pacific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Co., 283 U.S. 91, 95, 51 S.Ct. 383, 75 L.Ed. 857. In charging the jury, the trial judge is not limited to instructions of an abstract sort. It is within his province, whenever he thinks it necessary, to assist the jury in arriving at a just conclusion by explaining and commenting upon the evidence, by drawing their attention to the parts of it which he thinks important and he may express his opinion upon the facts, provided he makes it clear to the jury that all matters of fact are submitted to their determination.\u201d 289 U.S. at 469, 53 S.Ct. at 698.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">In United States v. Murdoch, 290 U.S. 389, 394, 54 S.Ct. 223, 225, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1933), the Supreme Court went further in holding that not only may a judge \u201canalyze the evidence, comment upon it, and express his views with regard to the testimony of witnesses,\u201d but also he has the power to \u201cexpress an opinion as to the guilt of the defendant,\u201d a power which \u201cshould be exercised cautiously and only in exceptional cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">This same question has also been before this court in numerous cases. See Franano v. United States, 310 F.2d 533, 537 (8th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 940, 83 S.Ct. 1545, 10 L.Ed.2d 694 (1962); Garner v. United States, 277 F.2d 242, 245-246 (8th Cir. 1960); Kansas City Star Company v. United States, 240 F.2d 643, 664-665 (8th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 923, 77 S.Ct. 1381, 1 L.Ed.2d 1438 (1957); Batsell v. United States, 217 F.2d 257, 262 (8th Cir. 1954); Buchanan v. United States, 15 F.2d 496, 497-498 (8th Cir. 1926). In the <em>Franano </em>case we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-7\">\u201cA survey of cases indicates that reviewing courts are hesitant to reverse a judgment due to an allegedly unfair comment within the charge to the jury unless the trial judge clearly became argumentative and assumed the role of an advocate. We emphatically agree that a judge must never identify his high office with the prosecution so as to appear partial and so determined to have a defendant convicted that he would go to the extreme of invading the fact-resolving province of the jury.\u201d 310 F.2d at 537-538.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">The remarks under consideration may be placed in two categories. Those, which for convenience, have been identified as \u201cNo. 1\u201d were comments on the evidence and the deductions or inferences that Judge Duncan drew from the evidence. The remarks designated as \u201cNo. 2\u201d may properly be interpreted as an opinion of the court as to the legal effect of McCullough\u2019s testimony concerning the girl as it related to the defense of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">We view comment No. 1 as an effort on the part of the judge to assist the jury in arriving at a just conclusion \u2014 a practice that has been countenanced by the Supreme Court. Quercia v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">Clearly, comment No. 2 cannot be regarded as an expression of opinion as to the guilt of appellant, sanctioned by <em>Murdoch, </em>supra, \u201cin exceptional cases.\u201d By those remarks the judge informed the jury that the evidence in regard to the girl incident was insufficient to constitute entrapment. Inasmuch as there was scant, if any, evidence to warrant submission of entrapment and no evidence that appellant was incited, prompted, or lured into committing the offenses on the strength of McCullough\u2019s misrepresentations about the girl, we are unable to visualize any error in the court's expressed opinion. Certainly, at best, it was harmless error which did not affect the substantial rights of appellant. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">In summary, it affirmatively appears from our canvass of the whole record that the questioned comments were not prejudicial and did not affect the substantial rights of appellant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>Appellant also contends that the court committed plain error in failing to instruct the jury to view the testimony of the informer with caution. The court was not requested to give such an instruction, nor was exception taken to the failure to so instruct. Thus posited, this question is not before us on review. Fed.R.Crim.P. 30. Moreover, since the court fully instructed on the credibility of witnesses, plain error did not result from the failure of the court to give the precautionary instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Appellant also argues that plain error was committed \u201cin repeatedly instructing the jury that appellant was charged with a narcotic violation, when appellant was only charged with marihuana violations.\u201d This too must be an afterthought on the part of appellant\u2019s counsel. He failed to take any exception to the use of the word \u201cnarcotic.\u201d Furthermore the record fails to support appellant\u2019s assertion. It is abundantly clear that the instructions informed the jury that appellant was charged with possessing and transferring marihuana. We regard this contention as wholly lacking in substance and therefore reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Finally, the contention is advanced that appellant did not receive a fair trial because there were no Negroes on the jury. The composition of the jury was not challenged at any time prior to or during the trial. The question was first interjected after the verdict had been returned. During a colloquy between the court and counsel for appellant, appellant himself informed the court that he felt his trial was unfair because there were \u201cno colored and no women on the jury.\u201d Later in the discussion, all relating to the time when judgment should be pronounced, counsel for appellant stated with candor: \u201cI did want to protect the appellant in connection with this panel but I don\u2019t think we have a legal leg to stand on in that respect.\u201d Counsel also stated, in substance, that Negroes are not excluded from jury panels in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. We believe it is self evident from what has been said that this belated assignment of error is patently lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">As pertinently observed by the Supreme Court in Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-8\">\u201cIf, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand, except perhaps where the departure is from a constitutional norm or a specific command of Congress.\u201d 328 U.S. at 764-765, 66 S.Ct. at 1248.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">.
