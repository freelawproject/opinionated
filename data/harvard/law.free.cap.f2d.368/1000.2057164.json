Respondent, Savoy Laundry, Inc., filed a Response to the Board\u2019s petition wherein it alleged that a dispute existed between the Board and the Respondent as to back pay and therein consented to proceedings by the Board under 29 CFR 102.52 et seq. The Board thereafter moved to strike Respondent\u2019s Response as not constituting a defense to the Board\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">In the Board\u2019s Supplemental Decision various factors which may enter into any back pay determination are set forth. In the absence of a disclosure of the relevant facts relating both to the employees\u2019 situations and to any economic justification in terminating Respondent\u2019s wholesale shirt division, a determination cannot be made at this stage as to the limiting effect, if any, on any back pay liability. We agree with the Board that \u201cuntil these problems are explored in a compliance proceeding, * . * * it is premature to assume that this remedy provides unlimited back pay accrual\u201d (Supp.Dec.). See N. L. R. B. v. Dazzo Products, Inc., 358 F.2d 136, 138 (2 Cir., 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">The Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of its Amended Order is granted. The Board\u2019s motion to strike Respondent\u2019s Response is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
