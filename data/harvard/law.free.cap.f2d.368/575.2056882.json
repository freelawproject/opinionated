The said judgment was reversed and the action was remanded to the court below with directions that a new trial be had. The second trial resulted in a judgment in favor of the defendants and the present appeal followed. We have carefully considered the record of the second trial and find that the grounds urged in support of reversal are clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
