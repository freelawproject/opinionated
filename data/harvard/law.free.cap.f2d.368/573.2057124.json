The question here seems to be the same as that which was presented by Marvel v. United States, 380 U.S. 262, 85 S.Ct. 953, 13 L.Ed.2d 960. Following the precedent of that decision, the judgment of the district court is vacated and the cause remanded for a hearing as to whether the appellant was misled by the trial judge as to the maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-27\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
