Two separate actions were commenced by plaintiff-appellant, one in warranty and one in tort, alleging that the swivel was defective and was the cause of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s injury. In each case plaintiff-appellant attempted to obtain jurisdiction over the defendantappellee by virtue of provisions of Ark. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 27-2502:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-30\">\n<em>\u201cBases of personal jurisdiction ovei persons outside this state.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-32\">In interpreting the Arkansas statute, Judge Young found it inapplicable and accordingly quashed the service in both cases. Judge Young\u2019s opinion is published in D.C., 259 F.Supp. 609. Because he has arrived at a permissible conclusion with reference to Arkansas law and a conclusion with which we are in complete accord, we affirm on the basis of his opinion as published.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
