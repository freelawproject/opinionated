Senior District Judge H. Church Ford affirmed, ruling that there was substantial evidence to support the findings of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">The record contains the testimony of a number of doctors, six of whom expressed the opinion that appellant is not totally and permanently disabled and is physically able to return to his work in the coal mines. Other doctors testified to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">It is not the function of this court to weigh the evidence. The findings of fact of the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); King v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 108 (C.A.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">There being substantial evidence in the record to support the findings of the Secretary, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
