In doing so he expressly found that the assertions challenged as false had not \u201caffected * * * [his] judgment as to the sentence which should be imposed\u201d and that, upon present reconsideration of all relevant and proper information and circumstances, the sentence was appropriate and should stand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-31\">These findings are unimpeached. Since the challenged matter played no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>part in the judge's original determination of an appropriate sentence or in his subsequent reaffirmation of it, the prisoner\u2019s complaint is groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The order appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-17\">.
