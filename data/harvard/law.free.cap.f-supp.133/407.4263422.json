We have so held in the case of Logronio v. United States, Ct.Cl., 133 F.Supp. 395. On the authority of that opinion, plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied; and defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, and plaintiff\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">JONES, Chief Judge, and LARA-MORE and LITTLETON, Judges, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b454-13\">MADDEN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AJK\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">I dissent for the reasons stated in my concurring opinion in Logronio v.
