Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, Respondent.</parties>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Axs\">Employer and carrier appeal from a disability award contending only that claimant suffered no accident within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. In reversing the Referee who found no accident, the board determined that a quarrel between claimant, who had a pre-existing condition, and his shop foreman over the distribution of work constituted an accident. Claimant was a sewing machine operator working as a piece worker. On the morning in question while claimant was working at his machine the foreman brought him a bundle of work for the day. Claimant considered it too small and unequal to the work given to some other employees, and a quarrel ensued which involved no physical violence \u25a0 but was entirely oral. Thereafter claimant suffered a cerebral vascular episode which disabled him. The shop foreman testified the argument lasted <em>\u201c </em>A few minutes \u201d, perhaps \u201c ten minutes \u201d. The president of the employer company testified that such arguments were a daily occurrence where the work is piece work. Under such circumstances a finding of accident cannot be sustained. <em>(Matter of Santacroce </em>v. <em>40 W. 20th St., </em>9 A D 2d 985, affd. 10 N Y 2d 855; <em>Matter of Cramer </em>v. <em>Barney\u2019s Clothing Store, </em>15 A D 2d 329, affd. 13 N Y 2d 711.) The fact that the cited cases involved heart attacks and this case involved a vascular incident is of no moment. In both situations an injury followed an argument or alleged emotional strain without physical exertion. (Cf. <em>Matter of Tillander </em>v. <em>Latin Quarter Cafe, </em>9 A D 2d 590.) Award reversed and the claim dismissed, with costs to appellants against the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. Coon, J. P., Gibson, Herlihy, Reynolds and Taylor, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
