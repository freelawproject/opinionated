All concur except Bastow and Halpern, JJ., who dissent in the following memorandum: As to the first child born to the complainant, we believe that the Erie County Commissioner of Social Welfare had the right to institute this proceeding under section 122 of the Domestic Relations Law. The child was born in Erie County and was not only \u201c likely to become a public charge \u201d but did in fact become a public charge. The Erie County Welfare Department paid the hospital expenses for the birth of the child. The complaining witness was then a resident of Erie -County. The alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>subsequent removal of the complaining witness to another county did not deprive the Commissioner of Social Welfare of the right to institute the proceeding in Erie County. We would therefore reverse the order appealed from and remand the case to the Family Court for further proceedings. (Appeal from order of Erie County Children\u2019s Court discharging the defendant, in a filiation proceeding.) Present- \u2014 Williams, P. J., Bastow, Goldman, Halpern and Henry, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
