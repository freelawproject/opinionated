Although a verdict for the defendant would be consistent with the record, the court\u2019s -instructions to the jury were so inadequate as to preclude a fair consideration of the factual problem. <em>(Molnar </em>v. <em>Slattery Contr. Co., </em>8 A D 2d 95, 100; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Hindus, </em>268 App. Div. 916.) At four-separate points in the charge the court instructed the jury that plaintiff administratrix was required to show absence of contributory negligence of the infant decedent; and in the one point at which the court placed with the defendant the burden on this issue, the instruction v\u00edas coupled with the proviso that \u201c on the whole ease \u201d plaintiff has the burden of- proof <em>\u201c </em>in the manner in which I hare outlined it \u201d to establish \u201c all of the matters which I have already mentioned.\u201d Concur \u2014 Botein, P.
