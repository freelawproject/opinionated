Plaintiff, claiming to hold a mortgage upon certain real property, seeks forclosure. Defendant has pleaded the Statute of Limitations, among other defenses. Plaintiff has conceded that payments claimed by her to toll the statute are not reflected in her bank deposits. Special Term deemed this sufficient. We conclude that the modification ordered will not force the revelation of any private or confidential matter and will provide information to which defendant would be entitled.
