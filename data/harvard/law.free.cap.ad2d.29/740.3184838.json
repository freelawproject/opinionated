Motion denied and appeal dismissed on the ground that the adjudication is not appealable (Code Grim. Pro., \u00a7 517; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gregory L. </em>[Anonymous], 28 A D 2d 68). Rabin, Benjamin and Munder, JJ., concur; Brennan, Acting P. J., and Hopkins, J., concur, although they adhere to the views expressed in their dissent in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gregory L. </em>[Anonymous] (28 A D 2d 68) and would vote to grant the motion and to entertain the appeal were it not for the holding in the cited ease.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
