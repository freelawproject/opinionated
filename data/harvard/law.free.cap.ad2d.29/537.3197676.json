In this negligence action to recover damages arising out of injuries suffered in March, 1962 by the infant plaintiff during a gymnastic exercise, plaintiffs moved <em>inter alla </em>to dismiss, for patent legal insufficiency (OPLR 3211, subd. [b]), a defense in each of the respective answers of the two defendants alleging plaintiffs\u2019 failure to serve a notice of claim in accordance with section 3813 of the Education Law and section 50-e of the General Municipal Law. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion, insofar as it was addressed to the above defense, was properly denied, though not upon the grounds assigned by Special Term. In our opinion, plaintiffs may not recover if they do not prove that their notice of claim, served by ordinary mail upon the defendant School District\u2019s Superintendent of Schools, was actually received by a member or trustee of the School District\u2019s Board of Education or by the board\u2019s clerk <em>(Salner </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>12 A D 2d 771; Education Law, \u00a7 3813; General Municipal Law, \u00a7 50-e, subd. 3; former Civ. Prae. Act, \u00a7 228, subd. 6; see, also, <em>Munroie </em>v. <em>Booth, 305 </em>N. Y. 426; <em>Ghesney </em>v. <em>Board of Edue., </em>2 A D 2d 761, affd. 5 N Y 2d 1007). Beldoek, P.
