The essential facts on which plaintiff relies as constituting waiver are undisputed, and in our opinion they bring the case within the compass of such decisions as <em>Gleet </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Exch. Bank </em>(285 App. Div. 411) and <em>Lumber Ind. </em>v. <em>Woodlawn Furniture Corp. </em>(26 A D 2d 924). The order of this court entered on December 14, 1967 [29 A D 2d 523] is vacated.
