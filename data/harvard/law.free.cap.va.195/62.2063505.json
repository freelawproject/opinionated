Cross, on an indictment charging him with raping Patricia Nelson, a six-year-old girl. This Court, on review of the first trial, reversed the judgment, set aside the verdict fixing defendant\u2019s punishment at fife imprisonment, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction, and remanded the case for a new trial \u201cif the Commonwealth be so advised.\u201d 192 Va. 249, 64 S. E. (2d) 727. The Commonwealth elected to pursue the prosecution, and put defendant upon a second trial that resulted in a judgment of conviction, with his punishment fixed at twenty years confinement in the State penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">On the first trial the judge held that inasmuch as his examination of Patricia Nelson disclosed that she did not know right from wrong, she was an incompetent witness. On the second trial, the same judge held her to be competent, and her testimony was admitted over the objection of the accused. This testimony is the only substantial additional evidence offered on the second trial. In view of this fact, the evidence will not be re-stated in this opinion, as it was fully and fairly stated in the former opinion, to which reference is hereby made.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">After the case was remanded defendant filed a plea of former jeopardy, based on the judgment of this Court setting aside the first judgment of conviction. The court\u2019s ruling, .rejecting this plea, is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">There is no merit in this assignment. When an accused is convicted of an offense and applies for and obtains a new trial, he thereby waives his former jeopardy and subjects himself to further prosecution for the same offense. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Com., </em>91 Va. 782, 21 S. E. 495; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Com., </em>190 Va. 58, 55 S. E. (2d) 450; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>44 W. Va. 315, 29 S. E. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Defendant\u2019s main contention is that inasmuch as the trial court, on April 27, 1950, held that Patricia Nelson was incompetent to testify concerning events which occurred on January 21, 1950, she was incompetent on April 25, 1952 (the date of the second trial), to testify concerning the same events.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The general rule, with which we are in accord, is that the competency or incompetency of a child must be determined as of the date the child is offered as a witness and not at the time the incidents testified to occurred. The fact that a child was held to be incompetent at the time of the first trial is not of itself an adjudication of its continued incompetency to testify concerning events that occurred prior to its becoming competent. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Keough, </em>145 Minn. 26, 175 N. W. 891; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>State, </em>75 Ala. 21, 51 Am. Rep. 422; <em>Rueger </em>v. <em>Hawks, </em>150 Neb. 834, 36 N. W. (2d) 236; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watrous, 7 </em>Cal. App. (2d) 7, 45 P. (2d) 380; <em>State </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>135 Iowa 507, 113 N. W. 322, 124 Am. St. Rep. 291; <em>Burnam </em>v. <em>Chicago G. W. Railroad Co., </em>340 Mo. 25, 100 S. W.

Jur., Witnesses, sec. 129, pp. 97, 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">There is no specific age at which a child must have arrived in order to be competent as a witness. A child is competent to testify if it possesses the capacity to observe events, to recollect and communicate them, and has the ability to understand questions and to frame and make intelligent answers, with a consciousness of the duty to speak the truth. Wigmore on Evidence, 3d ed., Infancy, sec. 506, p. 596; 5 Jones Commentaries on Evidence, 2d Ed., Competency of Witnesses, sec. 2106, p. 3953; 70 C. J., Witnesses, secs. 121, 122, pp. 91-94. The question of the competency of a child as a witness, to a great extent, rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, whose decision will not be disturbed unless the error is manifest. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Com., </em>186 Va. 851, 44 S.

Do you know the difference between right and wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">Upon this testimony the trial court held that Patricia was not a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">On the second trial Patricia was again examined in chambers, and after answering numerous questions intelligently, stated that she knew the difference between right and wrong, but that it had been so long since the alleged assault that she did not remember much about it. Her cross-examination, in part, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-19\">\u201cQ.

And a lot of times before today, too, didn\u2019t she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-26\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, I talked to her the same night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-27\">\u201cQ. You practically memorized what you are saying today, you memorized it so as to be able to tell it straight, the last two years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-28\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-29\">\u201cQ. For the last two years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-30\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-31\">A careful consideration of the entire testimony of Patricia Nelson leads to the conclusion that her testimony is a recital of what her mother had repeatedly told her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>say rather than her own independent recollection of what is alleged to have occurred on January 21, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">This conclusion is strengthened by other evidence in the record. The Commonwealth proceeded on the theory that the crime was committed sometim\u00e9 between 2:30 and 4:30 p. m. During this entire time Patricia and Barbara Ann, her eight-year old sister, were playing either in the Nelson back yard, defendant\u2019s back yard, or on the concrete driveway leading from Roger Avenue to a garage on the back of E. C. Stang\u2019s lot, which was to the north of and adjacent to defendant\u2019s lot. The children were in and out of their home. During the interval Patricia Nelson was in sight of or in hearing distance of at least three people besides defendant\u2014Barbara Ann, her mother, and E. C. Stang.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Stang testified that during this period (with the exception of about twenty minutes) he was sitting at a table in his dining room, near a large seven foot window through which he could see defendant\u2019s back yard; that he could not see the children while on his driveway because it was too close to the house for him to see through the window, but that he could hear them playing there. Between 3:00 and 3:20 p. m. he left his house to take his dog for a walk, and on the way back stopped and talked to defendant, who was in his own yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Barbara Ann did not know anything about the alleged assault upon Patricia. She testified that on the occasion in question she was playing with Patricia, and a part of the time, was \u201crolling\u201d Terry, the two-year old son of defendant, \u201cup and down\u201d the Stang driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Mrs. Nelson testified that at approximately 4:30 p. m. she went into her back yard, and not seeing the children therein, she returned to her home and telephoned defendant to know if they were in his house. On being informed that they were, she requested him to send them home, which he did immediately. The children came home, played with their toys in the house, ate supper, and between 7:30 and 8:00 p. m. went upstairs to take a bath and prepare for bed. It was approximately three and a half hours after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>children returned home before Mrs. Nelson\u2019s attention was called to the physical condition of Patricia. When she asked Patricia \u201cDid Robert [meaning defendant] bother you today,\u201d she answered in the negative. The mother stated that it took her two to two and a half hours to obtain from Patricia sufficient information and details to satisfy her that defendant had committed an assault upon her. Her exact language is: \u201cIt took me from that time [7:30 or 8:00]</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">until 10:00 o\u2019clock to get all of the details and satisfy my own mind that we had the right person and that something definitely had happened. I just wanted to be sure and it took that length of time to draw all the information [from Patricia] I needed to believe such a thing had happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">It will be noted that Patricia Nelson did not voluntarily connect defendant with the crime. It was only after a long, searching examination by, and on the suggestion of, her mother that she finally said defendant was the party who had made the assault upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">There is no evidence tending to show that Patricia screamed, cried or complained of any discomfort during the interval between 2:30 and 8:00 p. m. On the contrary, the evidence is that she appeared normal, continued to play in the yard, in defendant\u2019s house, went back and forth in her own home, played with her toys after 4:30, ate supper and said nothing about the alleged assault until she went upstairs to take a bath preparatory to going to bed. Had she screamed or cried she could have been heard, or observed, by her mother, Barbara Ann and Stang. While the children were playing outdoors, the mother was not more than 100 feet from defendant\u2019s garage and back yard. Her \u2022statement on this point is: \u201cI was ironing in the living</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">room and I could see out through my back living room window, and from time to time I would look out there and I saw them playing in front of his garage, what would be the front of his garage, and they were raking in some leaves and brush there, and he had a fire and they were helping him clean up and playing around out there with the baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Her cross-examination, in part, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u201cQ. During that period were you able to see where they [the children] were all the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201cA. Not every minute, but I could see them from time to time, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">\u201cQ. Occasionally you would see them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201cA. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">\u201cQ. As a matter of fact, they were not in Cross\u2019 yard the entire time as they came into your house at various times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">\u201cA. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">\u201cQ. They went out back and forth maybe three or four times during the whole time; is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">\u201cA. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">\u201cQ. When they came in they maybe stayed five or ten minutes and then would go back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">\u201cA. Sometimes they would come in together and sometimes separately. As children play they don\u2019t always come in together or go out together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-15\">\u201cQ. You were not keeping your eyes on them every minute of the time, and you didn\u2019t know exactly where they were going around the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-16\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t go out and stay with them and watch every movement, no, but I knew where they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-17\">\u201cQ. You knew by the fact that you would occasionally glance out and see them at various points?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-18\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-19\">When the competency of a child of tender years as a witness is challenged, its examination on its <em>voir dire </em>must show not only that the child knows the difference between right and wrong, but that it has sufficient mental capacity to receive reasonably accurate impressions of the facts to which its testimony relates and to relate truly the impressions received. The testimony in this case discloses that Patricia Nelson was not testifying from her independent knowledge of what occurred, or from the impressions she received, but was merely reciting the story that her mother had told her to tell.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>This question was discussed in <em>People </em>v. Delaney, 52 Cal. App. 765, 199 P. 896, where it appeared that Delaney was charged with lewd and lascivious conduct involving a boy under ten years of age. The court, in declaring the boy to be incompetent to testify, said: \u201cMeanwhile the boy undoubtedly had heard his parents talk about the case and its distressing facts. The force of suggestion, always strong, is particularly potent with the impressionable and plastic mind of childhood. We have no reason to believe that either parent consciously and willfully intended to influence the child\u2019s testimony. But without intending any such result, the repetition of supposed facts in the presence of a child often creates a mental impression or concept that has no objective reality in any actually existing fact. # # #</p>\n<p id=\"AUX\">###**#*</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u201c # * Lacking the ability accurately to recollect past occurrences, the child, though he may have received, at the time of their occurrence, just impressions of the facts respecting which he is called to testify, is not capable of \u2018relating them truly.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">^ ^ ^ ^</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">\u201cThe second test prescribed by the statute must contemplate that a child\u2019s ability truly \u2018to relate\u2019 is to depend upon his <em>natural </em>power of narration, exercised through his unprompted relation of facts as to which he has previously acquired a \u2018just impression,\u2019 and not upon a factitious ability to recite what he may have heard, with frequent repetition, from others, whether their utterances were spoken with design or in complete innocence * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">It is said in <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>100 Conn. 560, 124 A. 226, that under the most liberal tests, the obligation of the oath and an intelligent comprehension of the facts sought to be developed remain a necessary part of the qualifications of a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">In <em>Hollaris </em>v. <em>Jankowski, </em>315 Ill. App. 154, 42 N. E. (2d) 859, it was held that a child eight years of age was not a competent witness to testify to an accident which hap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>pened to him when he was between four and five years of age. The testimony showed that he was not a precocious child and that he had little, if any, independent recollection of the facts concerning the accident. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">* * # Moreover, it affirmatively appears that he had been talked to so much about the accident by members of his family and lawyers that the child had little, if any, independent recollection of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident. In any future trial he should not be allowed to testify * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The Commonwealth offered no evidence to contradict the testimony of Patricia Nelson to the effect that she had been consistently and repeatedly instructed by her mother as to the testimony she should give in court. Its contention is that the fact that Patricia had been coached did not make her incompetent or her testimony inadmissible, but that it was a mere circumstance to be considered by the jury in passing upon her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In support of this contention, the Commonwealth relies upon <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Com., </em>132 Va. 771, 111 S. E. 231. The opinion in the <em>Rogers Case </em>does not disclose the extent of the coaching, but it does contain the greater part of the child\u2019s examination. This examination showed intelligent answers to many questions propounded. In holding that the child was a competent witness, the court said: \u201c * * * an examination of the testimony of this little child discloses an amount of intelligence which seems to be quite above the average.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The facts in the case now under consideration are distinguishable from those.in the <em>Rogers Case. </em>The examination of Patricia Nelson disclosed (1) that she was below the average in intelligence; she had failed one grade in school, but she did not remember the year when, or the grade which, she failed; (2) while she stated that she knew the difference between right and wrong, she had little, if any, independent recollection of the events which were alleged to have taken place on January 21, 1950; (3) ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>cording to her own testimony, she told the story on the witness stand that her mother had made her memorize.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The opinion in the <em>Rogers Case </em>shows clearly that the child offered as a witness in that case met the test of competency stated in the following excerpt, quoted with approval, from <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>United States, </em>159 U. S. 523, 40 L. ed. 244, 16 S. Ct. 93: \u201cOf course, care must be taken by the trial judge, especially where, as in this case, the question is one of life or death. On the other hand, to exclude from the witness stand one who shows himself capable of understanding the difference between truth and falsehood, and <em>who does not appear to have been simply taught to tell a story, </em>would sometimes result in staying the hand of justice.\u201d (Italics supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">While Patricia Nelson stated that she understood \u201cthe difference between truth and falsehood,\u201d she also stated that her testimony was the story that her mother had taught her to tell. It was not her independent recollection of the alleged attack upon her,\u2014that is, she was incompetent as a witness because she did not have the capacity to recollect and communicate the impressions made upon her on January 21, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The admissibility of the testimony of any witness, adult or child, concerning the existence or nonexistence of certain events, with certain exceptions, depends upon whether such \u2022testimony is within the personal knowledge of the witness. The record discloses that the greater part, if not all, of the pertinent testimony of Patricia is within that class of testimony defined as hearsay in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (De Luxe Edition), p. 882, as follows: \u201cA term applied to that species of testimony given by a witness who relates, not what he knows personally, but what others have told him, or what he has heard said by others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Since Patricia Nelson\u2019s testimony is the only direct evidence offered to - prove that defendant was the criminal agent, and without which the evidence is insufficient to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The crime, as we characterized it in the former opinion, was \u201ca dastardly one, calctdated to excite abhorrence and resentment on the part of all right-minded people. Only a depraved person could commit such an act.\u201d However, the burden was upon the Commonwealth to establish, beyond all reasonable doubt, that defendant was the criminal agent. Since the Commonwealth has failed in two. attempts to carry this burden, and it does not appear that it is in position to produce any additional evidence, we think the prosecution should be ended. We, therefore, set aside the verdict, reverse the judgment and remand the case with direction to the trial court to dismiss the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
