Wolford and Robert C. Orndoff instituted this suit in September 1949, to enforce the claim of each for salary due from and money advanced to Frank R. Williams in his lumber business, and to set aside a deed from Frank R. Williams to Robert C. Williams, his son, which conveyed a tract of timber land containing about 7,300 acres in Frederick county, on the ground that it was a voluntary conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">Frank R. Williams answered admitting that the conveyance mentioned was voluntary except to the extent of $5,000, but denied that he owed either Wolford or Om-doff any amount. Robert C. Williams, the grantee in the challenged deed, likewise answered claiming payment of $5,000 to his father for the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">Prior to April 1946, the large tract of timber involved, known as \u201cThe Big Survey\u201d, was owned by Robert C. Williams and others who had been conducting thereon a lumber operation. At that time the business was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>profitable and Frank R. Williams, a resident of Amherst, Virginia, and 79 years of age, acquired the business and the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Wolford, foreman for the former business, was continued in that position, and for his general manager, Williams employed Omdoff, an experienced lumberman.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The elder Williams contends, and in his answer asserted, that he is not indebted to appellants because he sold the business to Orndoff under a contract by whose terms all of his debts to Orndoff were cancelled and Orndoff agreed to pay all debts of the business then outstanding. The alleged contract of sale reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201cApril 12 \u201947</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201cFor value Received I . Frank R. Williams owner of \u201cFrank R. Williams\u201d Lumber Dealer located at Gore, Va do here by sell all of My Interest in said Firm To Robert C. Omdoff of Waynesburg Pa. Who hereby agrees to pay all the debts owed by Me to any one entitled to same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">\u201cHe to collect all accounts due Me. and carry on the business as he sees fit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">F. R. Williams Robt. C. Orndoff\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">The paper was prepared by Williams and copied by Omdoff, both signing each copy and each retaining the copy the other had written. In the trial court there was conflict as to the date the writing was signed, but aE parties now agree that it was signed in March 1948 and antedated to AprE 12, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Although Omdoff filed an amended bill subsequent to Williams\u2019 answer, nowhere in his pleadings was the writing mentioned; however, in his testimony he did deny that he purchased the business or that he agreed to pay any of Williams\u2019 debts and claimed that neither party to the writing intended a sale, but that WEliams asked him to sign the paper as an accommodation and to prevent Williams\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>personal property from being included as security for a contemplated loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The evidence was taken by depositions and the trial court in a written opinion held that: (1) the conveyance from Williams to his son was without valuable consideration and was therefore voidable as to existing creditors, (2) the signed paper was a valid and enforceable contract and constituted a sale to Orndoff of the lumber business operated under the name of Frank R. Williams together with all the property and assets of the business and settled all claims by Orndoff against Williams, (3) Wolford was entitled to recover of Williams the sum of $2,058.52 (which on petition for rehearing was increased to $2,559.78) with interest thereon from the date of judgment, (4) under the terms of the sale Orndoff assumed all of the debts of the business including Wolford\u2019s claims against Williams and if Williams were required to pay Wolford\u2019s claims he should have recourse against Orndoff. By its decree dated June 28, 1952, the court put into effect these holdings but refused to award Williams judgment against Orndoff for such sums as he might be required to pay to Wolford. To which decree errors and cross errors were assigned, and an appeal was awarded appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The first question presented by the assignments of error and the most vital issue in the cas\u00e9 is whether the paper dated April 12, 1947, is a valid, binding contract. If it is, Williams owes Orndoff nothing and Orndoff is responsible for the debts of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">On December 27, 1949, when Williams\u2019 answer was filed, this issue was raised in language clear and direct, \u201c * # * that the said business was on that date, and as of the 12th day of April, 1947, sold and assigned to the said Robert C. Orndoff, and that the business was carried on by the said Robert C. Orndoff after the said--day of May, 1947, as his own.\u201d And the indebtedness for salaries and advances was alleged to have been duly settled and satisfied by the said agreement entered into between the parties. This con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tendon was reiterated in this language: \u201cYour respondent does again allege that all liabilities to the said Robert C. Orndoff for the operation of said business in Frederick County were settled and satisfied by the said agreement of May, 1947, and that your respondent did not operate the said business after that date, and that said Robert C. Orndoff did agree to pay for your respondent any and all unpaid accounts existing prior to May,- 1947.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Orndoff was aware of Williams\u2019 intention to rely on the writing purporting to discharge his debt and obligate Orndoff to pay the outstanding debts of the business, not only because of Williams\u2019 answer filed in the case but because Wolford had informed him prior to suit that Williams contended that he had' sold him the business and that Orndoff owed its obligations. It was, therefore, incumbent on Orndoff to explain promptly, frankly, and straightforwardly why the writing did not mean what it stated. This he did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In his direct testimony Orndoff ignored the contract, and only when pressed on cross examination did he set up his explanation of its meaning. In order to understand his contention, it is necessary to quote at length from his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\u201cQ. Actually, Mr. Orndoff, didn\u2019t you write, yourself, in your own handwriting and sign an agreement which was dated back to the date given on this note, by which you purchased from Mr. Williams this business, which included the tangible personal property, the right to saw on the set that your saw was in at that time and the logs and accounts receivable, in which agreement you promised to pay all the debts then existing in the business?</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">\u201cA. There is' a lot between this and where you are starting that. I will say no to that as it is, because there is a lot of\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">\u201cMr. Whiting [Orndoff\u2019s counsel]: All right, just answer the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">\u201cThe Witness: I will say no there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Upon being confronted with the agreement he acknowledged his signature and after stating where and when he had signed it he said: \u201cAnd not willfully did I sign it, but by two to three hours discussion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">When he was asked if by the contract he agreed to pay Williams\u2019 debts this discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201cA. He agreed to pay me, too, but he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">\u201cQ. You agreed to pay those, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201cA. You read it, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">\u201cQ. I am asking you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">\u201cA. I said I had paid part of those debts, what I positively had to pay. I didn\u2019t know that I had to pay any of them, but I did. Those debts didn\u2019t belong to me, as was stated to me, at all. It was absolutely misstated to me, positively, 100 per cent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">With reference to taxes Orndoff testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-12\">\u201cQ. You paid the taxes, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-13\">\u201cA. I did not, I paid part of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">\u201cQ. Paid part of the taxes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-15\">\u201cA. I did, because I thought that they were going to go ahead, and there was to be no change whatsoever in the business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">Further, with reference to the signing of the contract, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-17\">\u201cQ. And did your sickness have anything to do with your signing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-18\">\u201cA. I said it didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-19\">\u201cQ. Why did you sign it, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-20\">\u201cA. I said I just didn\u2019t know any better, I was just ignorant to the fact. You don\u2019t think that I was dumb enough, do you? I am dumb, I know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-21\">After extended questioning in search for an explanation of why the witness signed the agreement he was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u201cQ. Tell me, Mr. Orndoif, why did you sign this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201cA. I am going to tell the whole tale, I am going to tell it just exactly as it happened. He called and wanted us to come to the Afton Inn, meet them there and have dinner with them at 12 o\u2019clock. We didn\u2019t get started until late, because it was snowing bad, and we wasn\u2019t figuring on going, and we was trying to call through. And we got through to them and told them we wasn\u2019t coming on account of snow and slush. And he said it was nice and clear down there and they were ready to start, and then we got ready to leave Gore and went down there. We didn\u2019t get down there until one o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201cQ. Just answer the question why you signed it, not how you got there, and where you travelled and what kind of car you went in, but why did you sign this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">\u201cA. All right, I am going to explain the thing regardless. Mr. Williams laid the law down to me, as he had before, and I can prove what I am telling you, that some men had his hands tied, that he had to give a mortgage on this place or collateral, because Mr. Burdick, he said, of the bank at Cleveland had died, and he said he couldn\u2019t do a thing with this new man that was in there. And he said he was asking for a bigger loan on this place than he had on it, and he was going to have to give a mortgage on this real estate and the personal property likewise to cover it. And he pleaded with me between two and three hours, if I wouldn\u2019t sign that contract, and as ignorant as I am\u2014and believe me, I am \u2014he wanted me to sign this contract to show this man when he came down. He said it would be just a short spell, to show this man that the personal property belonged to me so that he wouldn\u2019t ask for this in, to be included in the loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201cNow, that\u2019s as true as there is a God, and let God speak his word, and I will tell you that I am telling the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">In May of 1948 Wolford went to Williams\u2019 home in Amherst and requested payment on his account and at that time Williams showed him the contract and indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>he intended to use it against Orndoff, which statement Wolford communicated to Orndoff soon thereafter. Orndoff was then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201cQ. Why was it after you found out that Mr. Williams was going to use this contract against you you didn\u2019t remonstrate with him as soon as you could? Why did you wait all that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201cA. Well, I didn\u2019t even think of the contract as a contract. That was just as sort of an accessory of his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cQ. But Mr. Wolford told you the attitude Mr. Williams was taking. Why didn\u2019t you then do something after you had gotten out of the hospital, not while you were sick, but later why didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t think much about it. I didn\u2019t think too much about it. I didn\u2019t. think anything like this was coming up at all, never dreamt of such a thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">\u201cQ. If Mr. Williams should tell Mr. Wolford that his hands were tied because of the contract, why wouldn\u2019t it bring it to your attention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">\u201cA. He told me that he was going through with a deal that might change the whole situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">\u201cQ. I am not talking about Mr. Williams, I am talking about Mr. Wolford telling you after Mr. Wolford\u2019s trip down there in May when Mr. Williams showed him the contract and said his hands were tied, that he couldn\u2019t pay any of his debts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">\u201cA. This was just to be good for 30 days only. That was just temporary. He said this would just be good for 30 days only, and I didn\u2019t think of it as a contract or agreement, I just simply ignored that as practically nothing, for that is what he pledged with me to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\">\u201cQ. He said it would only be good for 30 days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-14\">\u201cA. Something like that. \u201c Sure, he did so. He told me then that his hands wer\u00e9 tied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">\u201cQ. What did he say he was going to do, buy it back afterwards, or tear it up afterwards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201cA. I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201cQ. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201cA. That\u2019s the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201cQ. What did he tell you at the end of the 30 days was to happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201cA. Well, he said we\u2019d go ahead and\u2018\u2019make some other arrangements of some kind, but he told me that this would just be good for approximately 30 days, when they got this proposition straightened out about his hands being tied.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">\u201cQ. What sort of a new arrangement was to take place after the 30 days? What sort of a new contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">\u201cA. We had no new contract. There was no meaning to this contract, as I understood, of any kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-12\">\u201cQ. Was the contract just to last for 30 days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-13\">\u201cA. Does it say on that that it is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-14\">\u201cQ. No. You said 30 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-15\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, he said about 30 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-16\">\u201cQ. It was to be a contract of sale for 30 days, is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-17\">\u201cA. Contract of sale, something like that. He said about 30 days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-18\">In addition to his own testimony Orndoff relies on the acts and statements of Williams subsequent to the execution of the contract to prove his case. He points out that the business was continued in Williams\u2019 name; the titles to trucks were not transferred; the style of the bank account was not changed; Williams requested an audit of the business and in a letter to a prospective purchaser offered to sell the \u201ccomplete outfit.\u201d In explanation of this evidence, Williams replies that he continued to be interested in the business, notwithstanding the fact that Orndoff had assumed the debts, because he remained liable for the obligations created while he owned the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-19\">Next it is contended that \u201cThe obvious unfairness and inadequacy of the contract is itself convincing evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the fraud Williams is attempting to perpetrate on Orndoff.\u201d Assuming the accuracy of appellants\u2019 statement that the assets amounted to approximately $9,000 while the debts owed appellants alone totaled approximately $10,755, this does not show that there was no sale. Even though the contract may have been unwise it is not sufficient to shock one\u2019s conscience. <em>Planters Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>E. G. Heflin Co., </em>166 Va. 166, 184 S. E. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Although some of Williams\u2019 acts and statements after the execution of the contract do lend countenance to the claim that a sale of the business was not intended, Orndoff has not complied with the firmly established rule that fraud, when relied upon must be alleged and proved by evidence that is clear, cogent and convincing, <em>e.g., McClintock </em>v. <em>Royall, </em>173 Va. 408, 4 S. E. (2d) 369; <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>Red Jacket Coal Corp., </em>185 Va. 202, 38 S. E. (2d) 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In his pleadings Orndoff makes no allegation of fraud but in his testimony he charges Williams with deception and imposition. Yet his own explanations of the exact contractual relationship between them are more contradictory and inconsistent than those advanced by Williams, leaving the mind doubtful and suspicious- as to the true state of facts. Moreover, when first confronted with the contract, Orndoff denied that he signed it, but then admitted that he had done so reluctantly, and \u201cnot willfully\u201d but that he was deceived and taken advantage of because of his ignorance. Upon being pressed, he promised to \u201cexplain regardless\u201d and tell \u201cthe whole tale\u201d which turned out to be a plan to enable Williams to impose on a creditor. Then at the conclusion of the case he restated in detail an earlier contention that the contract was to continue for a 30 day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The trial court on conflicting evidence found that. Orndoff had failed to sustain the burden of proving that the contract dated April 12, 1947, was invalid. While a decree based upon evidence taken by depositions is not entitled to the same weight as one based upon evidence heard <em>ore tenus, </em>it is, however, \u201chighly persuasive\u201d, \u201cpresumptively correct\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>and entitled to \u201cgreat weight\u201d in this court. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>183 Va. 589, 32 S. E. (2d) 678; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>183 Va. 549, 32 S. E. (2d) 687; <em>McClintock </em>v. Royall, 173 Va. 408, 4 S. E. (2d) 369. See also, 1 M. J., Appeal and Error, \u00a7 279, page 710. We have examined the evidence and the exhibits with care and are satisfied that this conclusion, entitled as it is to great weight, is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Our view of the contract disposes of Wolford\u2019s contention that judgment should be awarded him against Williams for his claims arising after he received notice of the contract, and brings us to his assignment of error that the trial court should have allowed interest on his claims from the alleged due date of each claim instead of merely from the date of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The allowance of interest is in the sound discretion of the trial court. Code, \u00a7 8-223; <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>183 Va. 519, 32 S. E. (2d) 696; 10 M. J., Interest, \u00a7 4, page 586. In this case there were claims, counter claims, and questions of both primary and secondary liability for the trial court\u2019s determination. Under all the circumstances we are of the opinion that Wolford\u2019s claims remained unliquidated in nature and disputed in amount until the actual date of judgment. The trail court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in awarding interest only from the date of its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The remaining question for our consideration developed after the holding of the court that, \u201cClaims arising after notice of the contract [to Wolford] would be solely against Orndoff. Those arising prior to notice would be against Williams with Orndoff only secondarily responsible therefor, there being no evidence that Wolford ever accepted Orndoff as solely responsible. Of course, if Williams were required to pay Wolford\u2019s claims he should have recourse against Orndoff on the contract.\u201d Appellees first moved the court to include in its decree this provision: \u201cThe complainant, Robert C. Orndoff, is primarily liable to pay said obligation of Frank R. Williams, and that, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>upon the payment of said sum by the defendant, Frank R. Williams, to William A. Wolford, the said Frank R. Williams is entitled to recover of the said Robert C. Orndoff the amount paid by Frank R. Williams to William A. Wolford.\u201d The court, however, refused because the \u201cpleadings contained no prayer for the same.\u201d Appellees then moved for permission to amend the pleadings to include such prayer, which motion the court ruled came too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The answer alleges that, \u201c# <em>* * </em>even if it be found that William Wolford is entitled to receive any sums for services rendered during the said period (March 1, 1946 to May--, 1947), your respondent alleges that the said Robert C. Orndoff agreed to pay the same; * * * \u201d and further that, \u201cWherefore your respondent prays * * * that thereafter this case may be dismissed from the docket and your respondent released from the claims of complainants, with his reasonable costs by him in his behalf expended.\u201d Technically this language does not amount to a cross bill or prayer for a judgment against Orndoff for amounts that might be due Wolford. While this question was not properly raised by an appropriate pleading, yet the issue of whether Orndoff was liable for all debts of the business was fully litigated and properly adjudicated. This litigation has been pending for more than four years and should be terminated as speedily as possible without added costs incident to a new proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">A court of equity regards substance rather than mere form and having all the parties before it, may very properly mold the pleadings so as to ascertain the rights of the parties and thus end the litigation by securing and enforcing those rights by proper decrees. <em>Adkins </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>83 Va. 3.00, 2 S. E. 435; Lile\u2019s Equity Pleading and Practice \u00a7 156 (Meade, 3rd ed. 1952). Therefore in accordance with Code, \u00a7 8-119 and Rule 2:12 that, \u201cLeave to amend shall be liberally granted in furtherance of the ends of justice\u201d, the case will be remanded with directions to the trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>permit an amendment and to enter such decree as is proper thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The decree appealed from is affirmed, except to the extent that it denies the appellees permission to amend their pleadings. For the purpose of permitting such amendment the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to the trial court to allow an amendment and to enter an appropriate decree. The appellees having substantially prevailed, shall recover their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
