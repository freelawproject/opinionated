Defonseca cross-claimed against Mt. Ivy Press, L.P. (Mt. Ivy), and Jane Daniel. Palmer &amp; Dodge LLP and Publishers Group West, Inc. (literary agents retained by Mt. Ivy), were named as defendants in order to reach and apply any monies they received on behalf of Mt. Ivy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b569-11\">Kantrowitz, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFci\">Shortly after the Nazis seized her parents, seven year old Misha Levy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> fled alone to the forests and villages of Europe, where she wandered for four years. Along the way, she witnessed atrocities, found herself trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto, and killed a Nazi soldier in self-defense. Miraculously, she survived her ordeal, thanks to her strong will and guile as well as, incredibly, the aid of a pack of wolves, who \u201cadopted\u201d and protected her, providing food, companionship, and affection.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Needless to say, her story was compelling. Fifty years later, she would sell it to Mt. Ivy Press, L.P. (Mt. Ivy), and its sole employee, Jane Daniel, who also convinced soon-to-be former friend Vera Lee to help write the book (or \u201cWork\u201d). Turning to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the final chapter of this sad legal tale, the actions of Daniel, her company, and her agent, Palmer &amp; Dodge LLP, ultimately resulted in a judgment of $32.4 million against Daniel and Mt. Ivy, which forms the basis of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><em>Facts. </em>Four decades after her ordeal, Defonseca immigrated to the United States, settling in a small town outside of Boston. Only occasionally did she speak about her wartime experiences. By chance, defendant Jane Daniel heard Defonseca speak at an event in New York in 1994 and immediately recognized the enormous earning potential of her story. Daniel was the founder of Mt. Ivy,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a small publishing company that was run out of the basement of her home. By misrepresenting to Defonseca that she possessed the experience and expertise to market the book, and by promising a first printing of over 50,000 copies, Daniel convinced Defonseca to write her life story. In fact, as Defonseca would painfully discover, Daniel\u2019s experience, expertise, and financing ability were all lacking.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Because Defonseca was not a professional writer and English was not her first language, Daniel enlisted the help of her neighbor and friend of twenty years, Vera Lee, to work as a coauthor with Defonseca. Lee was a former professor at Boston College and an experienced author.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Perhaps most importantly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Lee was fluent in French \u2014 Defonseca\u2019s native language. Despite her friendship with Daniel, Lee was reluctant to involve herself in the project, being aware of Daniel\u2019s prodigious history of litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But Daniel overcame Lee\u2019s hesitation by touting the potential of the book to be a best seller and by promising that her name would be on the cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Mt. Ivy, through Daniel, signed separate publishing agreements with Lee and Defonseca in August, 1995. The agreements \u2014 virtually identical \u2014 granted Mt. Ivy exclusive rights to publish, distribute, reproduce, sell, and use the Work in exchange for royalty payments to Lee and Defonseca. Both agreements also required that Mt. Ivy would \u201ctake out and register copyright in the text in the name of the Author and her collaborator [i.e., Defonseca and Lee] in compliance with the United States copyright laws.\u201d If the Work was not delivered, or was \u201cnot accepted by the Publisher as being satisfactory for publication,\u201d the agreements provided that Mt. Ivy\u2019s sole remedy would be the option to terminate the agreements. Finally, the French translation rights in the Work were expressly reserved to Defonseca and Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Lee and Defonseca, with Daniel\u2019s knowledge, separately executed a \u201cCollaboration Agreement\u201d providing that they would work together to complete the book, and that both would be given authorship credit on the final product. Lee and Defonseca worked diligently on the book for the next nine months, turning over several drafts to Daniel ahead of schedule, and submitting a third draft on May 15, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Daniel was becoming more sure of the book\u2019s enormous potential to become a best seller. The \u201cbuzz\u201d concerning the book was generating a significant amount of interest from foreign publishers. In fact, in July, 1996, well ahead of the book\u2019s publication in English, Mt. Ivy sold the German rights, receiving a $135,000 advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Daniel began plotting to remove Lee from the project,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> falsely complaining to Lee about the quality of the book and Lee\u2019s writing ability. Daniel had also begun rewriting the book even before she had received a final draft from Lee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To facilitate her fraudulent efforts to obtain a personal interest in the book, Daniel executed a work-for-hire agreement with Mt. Ivy in October, 1996.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither Lee nor Defonseca knew about this agreement. The trial judge found that the work-for-hire agreement \u2014 essentially a contract between Daniel and herself \u2014 \u201cwas a scam orchestrated by Daniel solely to withhold monies lawfully owed by Mt. Ivy to Lee and Defonseca.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Daniel also drove a wedge between Lee and Defonseca so that, in the words of the trial judge, \u201cit would be easier to defraud them.\u201d Daniel threatened to remove Lee\u2019s name from the book cover to coerce her into ending contact with Defonseca. Simultaneously, Daniel led Defonseca to believe that Lee was jeopardizing the project with her poor writing and by making herself unavailable to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Ultimately, in April, 1997, Mt. Ivy published Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years, without Lee\u2019s name on the cover and in a form substantially different from what had been submitted to Daniel by Lee and Defonseca. In clear breach of the publishing agreements, as the jury found, Mt. Ivy also included its own name on the certificate of registration for the copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Despite the personal friction that had developed, Daniel undertook her marketing obligations under the publishing agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ment and maintained responsibility for domestic marketing of the book.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Her efforts produced minimal results, however, and the book\u2019s sales in the United States were poor. In any event, Daniel eventually ceased her promotional efforts in 1997 in accordance with her over-all scheme to obtain all of the rights to Defonseca\u2019s story.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Daniel hired the Palmer &amp; Dodge Agency (Palmer &amp; Dodge),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which assigned attorneys Elaine Rogers and Sandra Missakian to handle the foreign marketing and marketing of the dramatic rights. Palmer &amp; Dodge\u2019s efforts were more fruitful than Daniel\u2019s; the book became a best seller in several European nations, and Palmer &amp; Dodge \u201cpitched\u201d the story to some one dozen movie companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">However, in its zeal to market the book, Palmer &amp; Dodge overstepped the bounds of its authority. Despite knowledge of the limitation in the publishing agreements reserving all French rights to Defonseca and Lee, Rogers and Missakian marketed the book to French publishers without Defonseca\u2019s or Lee\u2019s knowledge or consent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Defonseca discovered the efforts when she was contacted independently by a French publisher, \u00c9di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tians Robert Laffont, whereupon she promptly notified Rogers and Missakian of her rights under the publishing agreement with Mt. Ivy. After some discussion, Defonseca permitted the French contract to proceed, resulting in a publishing agreement between Defonseca, Lee, and Laffont on November 13, 1996 (First French Agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Daniel was not personally involved in the First French Agreement, but quickly found out about it. Once she did, she informed Missakian of Mt. Ivy\u2019s alleged copyright interest in the Work, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>and insisted that Mt. Ivy be included in the contract. Missakian redrafted the contract (Second French Agreement) to include Mt. Ivy as a party, and, in February, 1997, resubmitted it to Defonseca for her signature, intentionally failing to inform her that Mt. Ivy had been added as a signatory, and thus would be entitled to a portion of the French rights, in violation of the original publishing agreement signed by Defonseca and Mt. Ivy. Instead, Missakian falsely represented to Defonseca that \u201cthe originals . . . were somehow lost en route to France,\u201d and that Defonseca had to sign the French agreement again.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After falsely obtaining Defonseca\u2019s signature on the Second French Agreement, Daniel then intimidated and threatened Lee, obtaining her signature also.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In May, 1997, frustrated with the loss of authorship credit on the cover of the book as well as the escalating situation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Daniel, Lee sent demand letters threatening legal action to both Defonseca and Daniel. Defonseca urged Daniel to resolve the problem by putting Lee\u2019s name on all reprints. After Daniel refused, Defonseca notified Daniel that, should Lee sue her, Defonseca would seek indemnification from Mt. Ivy for any associated costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In August, 1997, shortly after receiving Defonseca\u2019s demand for indemnification, Daniel created an offshore subsidiary corporation called Mt. Ivy Press International, Ltd. (Mt. Ivy International). Concurrently, for consideration of one dollar, she executed an assignment to Mt. Ivy International of all Mt. Ivy Press, L.P.\u2019s \u201cright, title, and interest to publication of the [Work] outside the United States and Canada.\u201d The trial judge found that the actual purpose of creating Mt. Ivy International was to transfer all foreign rights to the book to the offshore company, and to avoid paying Defonseca and Lee royalties on the foreign publication of the book.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> She further found that all of the money paid to Mt. Ivy International was eventually tunneled to Daniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In May, 1998, Lee filed suit in Superior Court against Mt. Ivy, Daniel, and Defonseca, alleging breach of contract, interference with contractual relations, fraud, violation of G. L. c. 93A, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment, and seeking to pierce the corporate veil and to hold Jane Daniel personally responsible as a general partner of Mt. Ivy. Palmer &amp; Dodge and Publishers Group West, Inc., were also sued, as reach and apply defendants. Defonseca cross-claimed against Daniel and Mt. Ivy with similar claims, as well as conversion and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mt. Ivy and Daniel counterclaimed against Lee and cross-claimed against Defonseca for breach of contract, defamation, and trade disparagement. Additionally, interference with contractual relations and violation of G. L. c. 93A were alleged against Lee only.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In special verdicts, the jury pierced the corporate veil, found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that Daniel had acted as a general partner of Mt. Ivy, and found against Daniel and Mt. Ivy on all of Lee\u2019s claims and Defonseca\u2019s cross claims. The jury rendered an advisory verdict in favor of Lee and Defonseca on their c. 93A claims against Mt. Ivy. A rule 54(b) judgment entered for Lee in the amount of $3.3 million and for Defonseca in the amount of $7.5 million against Mt. Ivy and Daniel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974). The judge also ordered restoration of the copyright on the book to Defonseca and Lee, as well as the dramatic, movie, television, and radio rights. On the c. 93A claims, the judge found for Lee and Defonseca, and trebled the damages. Mt. Ivy and Daniel were held jointly and severally liable for $9.9 million to Lee and $22.5 million to Defonseca.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The issues presented in this case are complex and convoluted. We begin by deciding whether Federal copyright law preempts the claims brought here, thus robbing us of subject matter jurisdiction. If we, in fact, have jurisdiction, we must then rule on (1) a motion filed by Daniel and Mt. Ivy (collectively, \u201cthe defendants\u201d) to substitute Palmer &amp; Dodge for Defonseca as the real party in interest in relation to the appeal from Defonseca\u2019s judgment against Mt. Ivy; (2) the scope of our review, as it is evident that the defendants erred procedurally in filing some of their notices of appeal; and, finally, (3) the merits of the substantive issues preserved on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\"><em>Preemption. </em>The mainstay of the defendants\u2019 appeal is their contention that the State law claims \u201cor parts thereof\u201d asserted by Lee and Defonseca (collectively, \u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d) were preempted by \u00a7 301(a) of the Federal Copyright Act (Act), 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. (1996). If the State claims were preempted, the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>to hear them, and any judgment rendered with respect to them would be void. See <em>ROPT Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Katin, </em>431 Mass. 601, 605 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Before turning to the merits of these contentions, however, we pause to express our concern with the defendants\u2019 position. During the pretrial proceedings, Daniel and Mt. Ivy filed a motion in limine to preclude the introduction of any evidence of copyright infringement. The judge allowed the motion, and the trial proceeded without any objection from the parties as to the evidence admitted or the claims presented. Daniel and Mt. Ivy thus took the position that this was not a copyright infringement case. Only after losing at trial do they now protest, arguing that the trial court never had jurisdiction. As we have stated previously, \u201cIt defies logic and fundamental principles of fairness to allow a represented party who has sought justice in a forum to contradict and undermine an agreement it reached and acknowledged in that same forum, especially when the judge and other litigants appear to have relied on that acknowledgement.\u201d <em>Correia </em>v. <em>DeSimone, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 604 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Although one might wish to analyze this issue under the lens of judicial estoppel,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we are constrained not to, given the claim the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 188 (2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Compare <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Boston Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>175 F.3d 6, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Federal law grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal courts over all copyright infringement claims, as well as those that are deemed \u201cequivalent\u201d to copyright infringement claims. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) (1993). See also <em>Firoozye </em>v. <em>Earthlink Network, </em>153 F. Supp. 2d 1115, 1122 (N.D. Cal. 2001). Such \u201cequivalent\u201d claims are deemed preempted under \u00a7 301 of the Act, thus eliminating jurisdiction of the State courts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The courts have developed a two-pronged test to establish whether a particular State claim is preempted. See <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., </em>836 F. Supp. 909, 922-923 (D. Mass. 1993). First, the work in which rights are claimed must come within the subject matter of copyright as defined by the Act. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102, 301(a). In the instant matter, there is no dispute that the first prong of the test is satisfied.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The second prong requires that, in order for a claim to be preempted, the legal or equitable right asserted under State law must be equivalent to one or more of the \u201cexclusive rights\u201d provided by \u00a7 106 of the Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a); <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., </em>836 F. Supp. at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Although the language of \u00a7 301(a) (see note 21, supra) may seem clear, many courts have struggled with the meaning of the equivalency requirement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> To assess the equivalency of State and Federal claims, the Federal courts have developed what is known as the \u201cextra element\u201d test. See <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., supra </em>at 923. Simply stated, \u201c[W]hen a right defined by state law may be abridged by an action which, in and of itself, would infringe one of the exclusive rights . . . , the state law in question must be deemed preempted. Conversely, when a state law violation is predicated upon an act incorporating elements beyond mere reproduction or the like, the rights involved are not equivalent and preemption will not occur.\u201d <em>Ibid.., </em>quoting from <em>Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nation Enterprises, </em>723 F.2d 195, 200 (2d Cir. 1983), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 471 U.S. 539 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The extra element inquiry is not accomplished merely by counting the elements of a claim. The fact that a State claim has more elements than a Federal claim will not necessarily save it from preemption. See <em>Data Gen. Corp. </em>v. <em>Grumman Sys. Support Corp., </em>36 F.3d 1147, 1164-1165 (1st Cir. 1994). Rather, the dispositive factor is the nature of the claim asserted. Where the extra element renders the claim \u201cqualitatively different\u201d from a Federal copyright claim, the State cause of action will survive a preemption challenge. See <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., </em>836 F. Supp. at 923; <em>Henry </em>v. <em>National Geographic Soc., </em>147 F. Supp. 2d 16, 20 (D. Mass. 2001). In determining whether a State law claim is qualitatively different from a copyright claim, courts look beyond the label and evaluate what right the plaintiff was seeking to protect or enforce and the theories on which the claim was brought. See <em>Patricia Kennedy &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Zam-Cul Enterprises, Inc., </em>830 F. Supp. 53, 56 (D. Mass. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Applying these principles, we conclude that the State claims of Lee and Defonseca were not preempted by the Act.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">a. <em>Breach of contract. </em>We turn first to the breach of contract claims. In general, private contract disputes belong in State court. See H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 132 (1976) (\u201c[n]othing in the bill derogates from the rights of parties to contract with each other and to sue for breaches of contract\u201d); <em>T.B. Harms Co. </em>v. <em>Eliscu, </em>339 F.2d 823, 826 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 915 (1965) (\u201cthe federal grant of a patent or copyright has not been thought to infuse with any national interest a dispute as to ownership or contractual enforcement turning on the facts or on ordinary principles of contract law\u201d); <em>Royal </em>v. <em>Leading Edge Prods., Inc., </em>833 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987) (\u201caction does not \u2018arise under\u2019 the federal copyright laws merely because it relates to a [work] that is the subject of a copyright\u201d); <em>Baptiste </em>v. <em>Khoury, </em>910 F. Supp. 277, 279 (W.D. La. 1996) (noting that \u201cFederal courts have jurisdiction of suits for infringement of a copyright outside of the contractual context\u201d; concluding that claim that defendant surreptitiously added himself to publishing agreement without author\u2019s knowledge belonged in State court). See also <em>LaChapelle </em>v. <em>United Shoe Mach. Corp., </em>272 Mass. 465, 471-472 (1930) (State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>courts may try questions of title and construe and enforce contracts relating to intellectual property).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In the majority of cases we have examined, courts have found that, because claims of breach of contract involved breach of a promise, an extra element not required to prove a copyright infringement claim, they were not preempted by Federal copyright law. See 1 Nimmer, Copyright \u00a7 1.01[B][1][a], at 1-15 (2004); <em>A. Brod, Inc. </em>v. <em>SK&amp;I Co., </em>998 F. Supp. 314, 323 (S.D.N.Y. 1998); <em>Torah Soft Ltd. </em>v. <em>Drosnin, </em>224 F. Supp. 2d 704, 716-717 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Nonetheless, a breach of contract claim based solely upon a promise to refrain from taking one of the actions reserved exclusively to the copyright owner should be struck on preemption grounds. See 1 Nimmer, Copyright \u00a7 1.01[B][1][a], at 1-22; <em>Wrench LLC </em>v. <em>Taco Bell Corp., </em>256 F.3d 446, 457-458 (6th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1114 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In this case, the rights Lee and Defonseca sought to enforce \u2014 contractual obligations freely negotiated and agreed to by the parties \u2014 were qualitatively different from the exclusive rights provided by \u00a7 106 of the Act. See <em>Asunto </em>v. <em>Shoup, </em>132 F. Supp. 2d 445, 452 (E.D. La. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Lee alleged that Mt. Ivy breached the parties\u2019 publishing agreement by (1) exceeding the editorial authority granted to Mt. Ivy by materially altering the meaning of the text over Lee\u2019s objection; (2) violating the sole remedy provision (which limited Mt. Ivy\u2019s remedy to termination of the agreement in the event Lee\u2019s work was delivered in an untimely fashion or in a condition not satisfactory for publication); (3) failing to indemnify Lee; (4) failing to give Lee the right to approve the title and cover design; (5) failing to provide Lee with a galley proof of the work for approval prior to publication; (6) failing to give Lee the appropriate authorship credit; and (7) failing to pay royalties and to provide accountings.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Defonseca alleged that Mt. Ivy materially breached the publishing agreement with her by (1) failing to provide reasonably prompt feedback on the manuscript; (2) fraudulently obtaining copyright registration in the name of Mt. Ivy; (3) failing to adequately market, publicize, and promote the book; (4) fraudulently pursuing the sale of the French translation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>rights, which were specifically excluded from the contract; (5) failing to pay royalties; (6) failing to provide timely and accurate accountings; and (7) refusing to give Lee proper authorship credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">None of these alleged breaches involved the unauthorized publication or distribution of the Work (or other exclusive rights of copyright). See \u00a7 106 of the Act (note 23, <em>supra). </em>Indeed, a theory of breach grounded in \u00a7 106 would make little sense because Lee and Defonseca had granted these exclusive rights to Mt. Ivy as part of their publishing agreements.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, because Lee and Defonseca sought to enforce their contractual rights rather than assert any rights equivalent to the exclusive rights provided by \u00a7 106 of the Act, their breach of contract claims were not preempted.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See <em>Henry </em>v. <em>National Geographic Soc., </em>147 F.

See <em>Patricia Kennedy &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Zam-Cul Enterprises, Inc., </em>830 F. Supp. at 57 (G. L. c. 93A claim based on false assertion of authorship was not preempted); <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., </em>836 F. Supp. at 923-925 (G. L. c. 93A claims predicated upon acts of misrepresentation and deception were not preempted).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">d. <em>Conversion. </em>The jury found for Defonseca on two separate conversion claims. The first claim sought damages for the conversion of royalties owed to Defonseca under the publishing agreement. This claim clearly was not preempted by the Act. See <em>Dead Kennedys </em>v. <em>Biafra, </em>37 F. Supp. 2d 1151, 1154 (N.D. Cal. 1999) (action alleging conversion of royalties was not preempted); <em>Asunto </em>v. <em>Shoup, </em>132 F.

Ivy\u2019s name to the copyright registration in violation of the publishing agreement, and that Mt. Ivy and Daniel then wrongfully exercised dominion and control over the copyright by, e.g., withholding approval for a French sublicense to translate and publish the book, when the French rights had been explicitly reserved to Defonseca and Lee in the publishing agreement. These actions fall short of the element of \u201ccopying\u201d necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the Federal courts under the Act. See <em>G.S. Rasmussen &amp; Assocs. </em>v. <em>Kalitta Flying Serv., Inc., </em>958 F.2d 896, 904 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 959 (1993) (\u201cFederal copyright law governs only copying\u201d); <em>Rokus </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>American Bdcst.

Ivy, citing the settlement agreement and Mass.R.A.P. 30(b), 365 Mass. 878 (1974), filed a motion to substitute Palmer &amp; Dodge for Defonseca as to her judgments against Mt. Ivy. The issue presented is whether substitution is necessary within the meaning of rule 30(b) based upon Defonseca\u2019s assignment of her claims and judgments against Mt. Ivy to Palmer &amp; Dodge.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Rule 30 of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>governs the substitution of parties at the appellate level.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> No Massachusetts appellate court has interpreted the language of this rule. \u201c[A]bsent compelling reasons to the contrary or significant differences in content,\u201d the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure should be construed in conformity with their Federal counterparts. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>429 Mass. 654, 655-656 (1999), quoting from <em>Vyskocil </em>v. <em>Vyskocil, 376 </em>Mass. 137, 139 (1978). See Reporter\u2019s Notes to Mass. R.A.P. 30, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Appellate Procedure, at 114 (LexisNexis 2004) (noting that Mass.R.A.P. 30 is based upon F.R.A.P. 43).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">A ruling on a motion to substitute brought under F.R.A.P. 43(b) rests in the sound discretion of the appellate court. See <em>Fred Harvey, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>526 F.2d 608, 611 (7th Cir. 1975), citing <em>McComb </em>v. <em>Row River Lumber Co., </em>177 F.2d 129, 130 (9th Cir. 1949). Compare <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. 467, 478 (1996) (review of ruling on motion brought under Mass.R.Civ.P. 25[c] is for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In exercising their discretion, the Federal courts have interpreted F.R.A.P. 43(b) narrowly, permitting substitution only in limited situations. See <em>Alabama Power Co. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Commn., </em>852 F.2d 1361, 1366 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Substitution is considered necessary under F.R.A.P. 43(b) if the party to be removed from the case is \u201cincapable of continuing with the litigation,\u201d <em>Maier </em>v. <em>Lucent Technologies, Inc., </em>120 F.3d 730, 732 n.1 (7th Cir. 1997), \u201cas where a party becomes incompetent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>or a transfer of interest in the company or property involved in the suit has occurred.\u201d <em>Alabama Power Co. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Commn., </em>852 F.2d at 1366. See, e.g., <em>Fred Harvey, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>526 F.2d at 610-611 (landlord substituted for tenant on appeal where lease had ended and property rights had reverted to owner); <em>Beghin-Say Intl.

Cir. 1984) (subsidiary substituted for parent company as appellant where parent company assigned patents at issue to subsidiary); <em>Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins.

There is no suggestion that Defonseca is not fully capable of continuing with this appeal. Moreover, as Defonseca made no assignment of her judgments against Daniel individually, and Daniel was held jointly and severally liable with Mt. Ivy on all of Defonseca\u2019s claims, Defonseca has not lost interest in the case. Compare <em>Alabama Power Co. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Commn., </em>852 F.2d at 1366 (denying nonparty\u2019s motion to substitute where original appellants were fully capable of proceeding, but had voluntarily dropped their appeal). We note also that, although technically Defonseca no longer holds any interest in her claims and judgments against Mt. Ivy, Palmer &amp; Dodge (the assignee of those interests) objects to the proposed substitution.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, we think it unnecessary to replace Defonseca in any aspect of the case at this late stage of the proceedings. Moreover, substitution would serve no useful purpose. As the assignee of Defonseca\u2019s judgments against Mt. Ivy, Palmer &amp; Dodge will be bound by the result of this appeal without any further action being taken. See 7C Wright, Miller, &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1958, at 555 (2d ed. 1986); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. at 478. Even if we were to substitute Palmer &amp; Dodge for Defonseca, and Palmer &amp; Dodge declined to defend the judgments, see note 37, <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Mt. Ivy would not thereby be entitled to the automatic vacation of the judgments, as Daniel and Mt. Ivy contend. See Mass. R.A.P. 19(c), 365 Mass. 868 (1974); <em>Citibank </em>v. <em>Grupo Cupey, Inc., </em>382 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2004), quoting from 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice par. 25.32 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201c[r]ule 25[c] is merely a procedural device designed to facilitate the conduct of the case, and does not alter the substantive rights of the parties or the transferee\u201d). Regardless, Daniel and Mt. Ivy will ultimately suffer no prejudice from the denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"Az3\">Because we conclude that substitution is not necessary as contemplated by Mass.R.A.P. 30(b), in the exercise of our discretion, the motion to substitute is denied.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIx\"><em>Scope of review. </em>Given the nature of this case, it comes as no surprise that the simple act of filing a notice of appeal has become irreparably compromised. Postjudgment, Daniel and Mt. Ivy filed a multitude of notices of appeal, many of which appear to be defective, thus requiring that we determine what appellate issues are appropriately before us. Cutting to the chase, the only substantive issues we will consider are those preserved in Daniel\u2019s appeal from the denial of her motions for a new trial and to amend the judgment and those'in Daniel\u2019s and Mt. Ivy\u2019s appeals from the c. 93A judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AoI\">We begin with a short recitation of the procedural history of this case. Judgment on the jury verdict was entered on August 23, 2001. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b). On August 31, 2001, counsel for Mt. Ivy and Daniel timely filed a joint motion for a new trial, see Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(b), 365 Mass. 827 (1974), thus suspending the time for taking an appeal from the judgment until the entry of an order on that motion. See Mass.R.A.P. 4(a), as amended, 393 Mass. 1239 (1985); <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>v. <em>East Cambridge Sav. Bank, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 742-743 &amp; n.7 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"APi\">On October 11, 2001, while the motion for new trial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>pending, Daniel, now without counsel,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> filed a joint motion to amend the judgment on the jury verdict on behalf of herself and Mt. Ivy. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(e), 365 Mass. 828 (1974). On October 22, 2001, the judge entered orders denying the joint motion for a new trial and the joint motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">On November 7, 2001, Daniel, proceeding pro se, filed a timely notice of appeal from the orders denying the two motions. On November 16, 2001, still proceeding without counsel, Daniel also filed a timely notice of appeal from the same orders on behalf of Mt. Ivy. Defonseca moved to strike Mt. Ivy\u2019s appeal from the orders; her motion was allowed on January 4, 2002, on the ground that Mt. Ivy, a limited partnership, could not be represented by Daniel, who is not an attorney. See note 39, <em>supra. </em>On February 4, 2002, now represented by counsel, Daniel and Mt. Ivy timely docketed notices of appeal from the order allowing Defonseca\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Successor counsel for Daniel and Mt. Ivy did not file notices of appeal from the judgment on the jury verdict until January 7, 2002 \u2014 nearly two and one-half months after entry of the October 22, 2001, orders denying the motions for a new trial and to amend the judgment. On April 17, 2002, a judgment on the c. 93A claims entered, from which Mt. Ivy and Daniel, now both represented by counsel, entered timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Daniel and Mt. Ivy argue that the scope of our review should include their substantive appellate arguments as to the alleged errors in the jury instructions as well as the denial of their motions for directed verdicts. There is no question that the January 7, 2002, notices of appeal from the underlying judgment, which would have brought these matters before us, were untimely.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Daniel and Mt. Ivy do not argue otherwise. Instead, they contend that appellate review of these issues may be predicated upon the timely November 7 and 16, 2001, notices of appeal from the denial of their postjudgment motions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>a. <em>Daniel\u2019s representation of Mt. Ivy. </em>As noted above, Mt. Ivy\u2019s November 16, 2001, notice of appeal was struck because Daniel, a nonattomey, was not competent to file it on behalf of Mt. Ivy. See, e.g., <em>Varney Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>WMF, Inc., </em>402 Mass. 79, 81-82 (1988). On appeal, Mt. Ivy devotes one paragraph of its sixty-five page brief, with no citation to authority, to its assertion that the trial judge erred in striking the November 16 notice of appeal. Such an argument does not meet the standards of Mass.R.A.R. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See <em>McCone </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>393 Mass. 231, 236 (1984), and cases cited.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Given these considerations, and in light of the result we reach regarding the similar appellate arguments made by Daniel as to the conduct of the jury trial and the jury\u2019s verdict, see discussion, <em>infra, </em>we decline to consider Mt. Ivy\u2019s arguments concerning the judge\u2019s decision to strike the November 16 notice of appeal. As such, we confine our consideration of Mt. Ivy\u2019s substantive appellate arguments to the G. L. c. 93A issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">b. <em>Daniel\u2019s appeal from the judgment on the jury verdict. </em>Returning to Daniel, her notice of appeal from the denials of her motion for a new trial and motion to amend the judgment, although timely filed, failed to raise as an issue on appeal the underlying judgment on the jury verdict. As a general rule, appeals from the denial of postjudgment motions do not bring the original judgment before the appellate court. See <em>West Springfield </em>v. <em>Olympic Lounge, Inc., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 923-924 (1998); <em>Mariani-Giron </em>v. <em>Acevedo-Ruiz, </em>945 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991). Even if we were to deem these issues properly before us, Daniel would fare no better. To the extent that she objects to the inclusion of erroneous instructions in the jury charge (and the failure to give certain instructions), she failed to bring these specific objections to the attention of the judge either before the jury began deliberations, as required by Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974), or after the supplemental instructions. These objections, therefore, were waived. See <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Pezrow New England, Inc., </em>437 Mass. 302, 311 (2002); <em>Jarry </em>v. <em>Corsaro, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 606-607 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>As for the denial of her motions for directed verdicts, Daniel failed to raise the specific grounds either orally or in writing that she now says support reversal of the judgment. Having failed to bring these alleged deficiencies to the attention of the judge or opposing counsel at trial, Daniel cannot raise these issues here. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(a), 365 Mass. 814 (1974) (\u201cA motion for a directed verdict shall state the specific grounds therefor\u201d). Contrast <em>Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Varadian, </em>419 Mass. 841, 846-848 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><em>Issues preserved on appeal. </em>We now address the only issues preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">a. <em>Daniel\u2019s postjudgment motions. </em>The only argument Daniel presses on appeal<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> is essentially a reconfiguration of her earlier preemption argument. Specifically, Daniel maintains that a new trial should have been granted because the trial judge improperly admitted evidence of violations of the Federal copyright laws by Daniel and Mt. Ivy, and the jury improperly considered copyright infringement claims in finding liability and in awarding damages. We have already addressed this issue. Suffice it to say that the mention of a copyright interest did not cause the trial to stray into forbidden subject matter. Ownership of the copyright interest was a relevant and essential issue at trial, as it bore on questions related to, e.g., breach of contract, conversion, and the G. L. c. 93A claims. As we have already determined (see discussion of preemption, <em>supra), </em>these were legitimate State law claims that were not equivalent to copyright infringement claims. Daniel has not directed us to examples in the record where the evidence she complains of was introduced in support of a copyright infringement claim. Nor has she demonstrated prejudice from the allegedly improper admission of such evidence. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 119; <em>G.E.B. </em>v. <em>S.R.W., </em>422 Mass. 158, 169 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">b. <em>Judgment on the c. 93A claims. </em>A judge\u2019s findings of fact with respect to G. L. c. 93A claims will only be reversed if they are clearly erroneous. See <em>Kitner </em>v. CTW <em>Transp., Inc., </em>53 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>App. Ct. 741, 747-748 (2002); <em>Diamond Crystal Brands, Inc. </em>v. <em>Backleaf, LLC, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 502, 507-508 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Here, Mt. Ivy\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s first argument is yet another reiteration of. their preemption arguments, which we have already addressed. Contrary to the defendants\u2019 argument, the findings and rulings forming the basis of their c. 93A liability arose from the many fraudulent, deceptive, coercive, and intimidating acts perpetrated upon Lee and Defonseca. None of these acts concerned violations of exclusive rights protected by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Mt. Ivy and Daniel next assert that a number of the factual findings were clearly erroneous. Even if we were to conclude that any one of these findings was clearly erroneous, the other evidence of unfair or deceptive business practices committed by Mt. Ivy and Daniel was legion. Indeed, while most c. 93A cases involve relatively few unfair or deceptive acts or practices, this case stands out for the sheer number of independent acts that would support liability under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Lastly, to the extent that Mt. Ivy and Daniel challenge the amount of damages awarded for their failure to use their best efforts in marketing and promoting the Work, there was ample testimony provided by Daniel herself to support the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the judgments, the orders denying Daniel\u2019s motions for a new trial and to amend the judgment, and the order allowing the motion to strike Mt. Ivy\u2019s notice of appeal from the denial of its motions for a new trial and to amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Later known by her married name, Defonseca.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Daniel and her daughter, Liza Daniel Butler, formed Mt.

Ivy Press, L.P. The partnership agreement also listed Daniel, her father James, and an entity called \u201cMBK Partners\u201d as limited partners. Although Butler, as sole officer and shareholder of Mt. Ivy Press, Inc., was named as a general partner of Mt. Ivy Press, L.P., the trial judge concluded, supported by Butler\u2019s own testimony, that she had little to do with the partnership\u2019s business decisions or management.

This work for hire agreement notwithstanding, compensation to Jane [Daniel] shall be equal to that earned by Misha Defonseca except for the French rights, in which compensation will be equal to that earned by Vera Lee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Daniel\u2019s marketing efforts included, among other things, hiring a publicist who arranged speaking engagements for Defonseca, and holding a press party in March, 1997, attracting attention from the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Providence Journal, the Seattle Times, People Magazine, WBZ News, Chronicle, New England Cable News, and Fox News. Mt. Ivy also made arrangements for Defonseca to appear on the Oprah Winfrey show, which actually filmed a segment. The piece never aired, however, because Daniel herself canceled it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The Palmer &amp; Dodge Agency was a service of the law firm of Palmer &amp; Dodge LLP, which was named as a reach and apply defendant in Lee\u2019s complaint (see note 1, <em>supra). </em>While Palmer &amp; Dodge did not defend the action, its attorneys testified on behalf of the firm throughout this litigation. In any event, the Palmer &amp; Dodge Agency no longer exists, as the law firm Hill &amp; Barlow purchased it in 2002, and several of the attorneys involved in this case (including Elaine Rogers, see text, <em>infra) </em>joined the now defunct Hill &amp; Barlow. We shall refer to Palmer &amp; Dodge LLP and the Palmer &amp; Dodge Agency interchangeably as \u201cPalmer &amp; Dodge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Rogers testified that, although she knew that Palmer &amp; Dodge was not authorized to represent the French rights, there was, in her view, an unresolved ambiguity in the publishing agreements about ownership of any French translation. Missakian also testified that she felt the clause dealing with the French rights was unclear. The judge found, however, that \u201c[i]t was the practice and obligation of. . . Rogers . . . and . . . Missakian ... to review underlying contracts to determine that the rights they were marketing actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>belonged to the client they were then representing.\u201d The judge therefore concluded that \u201cRogers and Missakian both knew, or at the very least should have known, that the French rights were excluded from the Publishing Agreement. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The judge found that \u201cMissakian intentionally failed to inform Defonseca of this material change to the French Publishing Agreement which, if Defonseca had known of, she would not have signed. Missakian\u2019s intent was to deceive and she did, in fact, deceive Misha Defonseca into signing this second French agreement.\u201d The evidence supports this conclusion, and Missakian\u2019s own testimony does not contradict it. We leave the propriety of this conduct, as well as the other actions by those involved, to the Board of Bar Overseers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Daniel had already pressured Lee into assigning Mt. Ivy one-half of Lee\u2019s share of the proceeds from any French translation. Although Daniel offered no consideration, upon demanding the assignment, she commented that \u201c[i]t would be a shame if we sued each other.\u201d Lee gave in to the pressure. At the time, Lee had no legal representation, and, as the judge found, was fully aware that \u201c[a]ll of Daniel\u2019s previous collaborative efforts [had] resulted in litigation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">It appears that Brett Kates, chief counsel for Mt. Ivy, and instrumental in the establishment of Mt. Ivy and the other organizations associated with it, was primarily responsible for assisting Daniel in setting up Mt. Ivy International. It is unclear from the record what involvement, if any, Palmer &amp; Dodge had in setting up the offshore account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The jury also awarded Lee damages in the amount of one dollar on her breach of contract claim against Defonseca. Mt. Ivy and Daniel were not successful in any of their claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">To avoid awarding duplicative damages, the judge limited recovery to the c. 93A claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b576-9\">In April, 1999, Defonseca filed a copyright infringement action against Mt. Ivy in the Federal District Court. That action was stayed pending the outcome of the instant matter and was subsequently dismissed without prejudice in 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Judicial estoppel, an equitable principle recognized in Massachusetts, see <em>Paixao </em>v. <em>Paixao, </em>429 Mass. 307, 309-311 (1999); <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut.

Equitable defenses such as waiver and estoppel typically are not available when subject matter jurisdiction is at issue. See <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 188 (2001). Although there is some authority supporting the general proposition that the affirmative defense of preemption may be waived if the Federal statute at issue controls only the substantive law that applies rather than the forum in which the matter must be adjudicated, see <em>Central Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Package Printing Co., </em>429 Mass. 189, 191-193 (1999), waiver is inappropriate in the matter before us. Here, Congress has given the Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide copyright infringement cases. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) (1993). Since Federal law controls both choice of law, see \u00a7 301 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the Act (the preemption provision), and choice of forum, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a), State courts have no jurisdiction to decide copyright infringement claims. The issue of preemption, therefore, cannot be waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Section 301 of the Act provides that \u201call legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright... are governed exclusively by this title.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Section 102(a) of the Act provides: \u201cCopyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.

On appeal, there is confusion concerning the scope of the defendants\u2019 preemption claims. Daniel and Mt. Ivy broadly assert in their joint brief that all claims were either preempted by the Act, or, even if not preempted, were sufficiently compromised by the improper presence of copyright infringement claims. A preemption challenge, however, calls for a claim-by-claim analysis and an examination of the theories underpinning each claim. See <em>Firoozye </em>v. <em>Earthlink Network, </em>153 F. Supp. 2d at 1126. Here, at most, the defendants have offered a conflated analysis of only four claims (breach of contract, fraud in the inducement, conversion, and G. L. c. 93A). We limit our discussion to those claims. See <em>Quincy Cablesys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Sully\u2019s Bar, Inc., </em>650 F. Supp. 838, 850 n.6 (D. Mass. 1986) (court refused to reach particular preemption claim because parties failed to adequately address it). Cf. <em>Hearn </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>389 Mass. 404, 405-406 n.3 (1983) (passing reference to issue in brief is not argument contemplated by Mass.R.A.P. 16[a][4], as amended, 367 Mass. 921 [1975]); <em>Budish </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>417 Mass. 574, 577 n.5 (1994) (argument waived because not raised below and not briefed on appeal). Nonetheless, in reviewing the other, sparsely-alluded-to claims, we conclude that none of them were preempted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In exchange for the payment of royalties, both Lee and Defonseca in the publishing agreements granted to Mt. Ivy and its licensees a number of \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d rights in the Work. The primary rights in the Work included the \u201cexclusive right to publish, distribute, reproduce, sell, and use... the Work.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Defonseca\u2019s claim concerning the fraudulent marketing of the French translation rights was not a veiled copyright infringement claim. Rather, the gravamen of the claim was that Mt. Ivy\u2019s agent fraudulently held itself out as having authority to market the French translation rights, when in fact such authority was explicitly excluded in the publishing agreements. Such a claim has the \u201cextra element\u201d required to survive a preemption challenge. See, e.g., our discussion of fraud in the inducement and G. L. c. 93A, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The jury found that Daniel had fraudulently induced Defonseca into signing the publishing agreement by making false statements regarding Mt. Ivy\u2019s experience, achievements, and credibility in the publishing industry. On Lee\u2019s complaint, the jury found that Mt. Ivy and Daniel had fraudulently induced Lee into assigning half of her French rights to Mt. Ivy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\">We do not reach the argument alluded to in the defendants\u2019 brief that conversion claims may only be brought in connection with tangible property. The sole issue properly preserved for appeal regarding conversion of the copyright is the defendants\u2019 argument that the claim is preempted by the Act, not that the claim itself lacks validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The other parties included former Palmer &amp; Dodge attorney Sandra Missakian, and attorneys John Taylor Williams and Elaine Rogers, still with Palmer &amp; Dodge at the time suit was filed. Also named as defendants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>American Program Bureau, Inc., the agency hired by Daniel to arrange speaking engagements for Defonseca, and Shirley Sandler, a publicist hired by Daniel to create promotional opportunities for Defonseca.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">At various times during the course of dealings among Lee, Defonseca, and Mt. Ivy, Palmer &amp; Dodge served as the literary agent for one or more of the parties. Shortly after the commencement of Lee\u2019s suit in May, 1998, Palmer &amp; Dodge terminated its agency agreement with all three parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The remaining parties, American Program Bureau, Inc., and Shirley Sandler, did not settle. That litigation appears to have been dismissed on January 19, 2005, for failure to prosecute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Palmer &amp; Dodge thus holds the judgment Defonseca won against Mt. Ivy. The propriety of assuming a huge judgment against Mt. Ivy, its former client, awarded in part because of the eyebrow-raising actions of Palmer &amp; Dodge while representing Mt. Ivy, is not before us. We were informed at oral argument that Palmer &amp; Dodge does not plan to move on the judgment, but would use it defensively, if sued, a happenstance which has come to fruition. Daniel and Mt. Ivy brought suit against Palmer &amp; Dodge and its attorneys, Rogers and Williams, on June 10, 2004, in Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Rule 30(b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure provides: \u201cIf substitution of a party in the appellate court is necessary for any reason other than death, substitution shall be effected in accordance with the procedure prescribed in subdivision (a).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Rule 30 provides for substitution in the event of death, \u201cother causes,\u201d and separation from public office.

Rule 25(c) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 771 (1974), governs substitution where a transfer of interest occurs \u201cduring the pendency of an action.\u201d Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 25.4, at 188 (1975); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. 467, 478 (1996). More specific than Mass.R.A.P. 30, Mass.R.Civ.P. 25 permits substitution upon four events: death, incompetency, a transfer of interest, and the separation of a party from public office. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 25(a)-(d). Given their identity of subject matter and similarity in language, rule 25 and Mass.R.A.P. 30 should be read in concert.

Therefore, that motion is also denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">On October 5, 2001, the trial judge allowed Mt. Ivy\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s attorneys to withdraw.
