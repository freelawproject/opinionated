(2000). Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(b)(1), the plaintiff, Global NAPs, Inc. (Global), brought two arbitration actions against the defendant, Verizon New England (Verizon), which were resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>in Verizon\u2019s favor in 2002. Subsequent to those decisions, one of which had already been appealed, Jack Conroy, Verizon\u2019s regulatory affairs chief, gave an interview to a Boston Globe business reporter, who quoted Conroy as having said that the arbitrator\u2019s decision essentially shut down a \u201cscam\u201d that Global very cleverly had developed in the late 1990\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">As a result, Global brought the instant action against Verizon for defamation and trade disparagement. Verizon\u2019s special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (the anti-SLAPP<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> statute), was denied by a Superior Court judge, and Verizon appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AR1\">1. <em>Background. </em>At issue is whether G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, protects Verizon from liability for the disparaging statement Conroy made during the course of his interview with the Boston Globe reporter. In particular, Verizon contends that Conroy\u2019s comment satisfies the statutory definition of petitioning activity. It contends that Conroy\u2019s statement was made in connection with Global\u2019s pending appeal of the arbitrator\u2019s decision. We conclude that the statement does not fall within the ambit of the statute\u2019s protection because it was merely an oblique reference to Verizon\u2019s petitioning activity and was not a protected instance of \u201cfull participation . . . and robust discussion of issues before [a governmental body].\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prod. Corp. </em>427 Mass. 156, 161 (1998), quoting from the preamble to 1994 House Doc. No. 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">To place the issue in context, we summarize the undisputed facts from the pleadings and affidavits contained in the record that both parties compiled for this appeal. The statement upon which Global bases its defamation claim was made within the context of a larger business dispute. Global and Verizon provide telecommunications services in Massachusetts. The two companies are competitors regulated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act). Verizon, among other things, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>an \u201cincumbent local exchange carrier\u201d (ILEC), which means that it provided telephone exchange service in Massachusetts prior to the passage of the 1996 Act. Global is a \u201ccompetitive local exchange carrier\u201d (CLEC), meaning that it began providing service after the 1996 Act required ILECs to allow CLECs to connect to their telecommunications networks and to enter into \u201cinterconnection agreements\u201d that specify the terms of use and payments for service between companies. Global\u2019s business is routing \u201cdial up\u201d telephone calls from end users\u2019 computers to Internet service providers (ISPs). As competitors in a regulated industry, the two companies are frequently, if not constantly, involved in proceedings before courts and other governmental entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">One feature of the 1996 Act is a provision for binding arbitration by State commissions when ILECs and CLECs cannot agree on the terms of an interconnection agreement. In Massachusetts, such arbitration is before the Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE). 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(b)(1). The two arbitration actions against Verizon were decided by the DTE in Verizon\u2019s favor on December 12, 2002, and December 20, 2002. Both arbitrations were related to Global\u2019s provision of virtual exchanges to ISPs. A virtual exchange allows dial-up Internet users to dial what appears to be a local telephone number to connect to ISPs whose physical equipment is at Global\u2019s Quincy premises, regardless of whether the dial-up customer ordinarily can make \u201clocal\u201d calls to Quincy. Global and Verizon disagreed whether such calls should be treated as \u201clocal\u201d in their interconnection agreement. If deemed \u201clocal\u201d under the 1996 Act, Verizon would be responsible for toll-free transmission of its customers\u2019 \u201clocal\u201d calls all the way to Quincy, and Verizon would also have to pay Global for each call by one of its customers to Global\u2019s virtual \u201clocal\u201d exchange. If the calls were not treated as \u201clocal,\u201d Global would pay the cost of transmission to Quincy and would not be entitled to payment for receiving calls from Verizon customers. In the first ruling, the DTE determined that the companies should not treat Global\u2019s use of \u201cvirtual exchanges\u201d as \u201clocal\u201d calls. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the second ruling, the DTE determined that the interconnection agreement between the companies did not require reciprocal payments to Global for ISP-bound calls from Verizon customers. Global appealed the December 12, 2002, ruling before the comments that gave rise to its defamation claim were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">On January 3, 2003, the Boston Globe printed an article about the arbitration rulings. Howe, Firms Come Up Empty vs. Verizon in Rulings, Boston Globe, January 3, 2003, at E3. The article stated that \u201c[i]n a pair of rulings\u201d the DTE determined that \u201c[Internet] traffic originated by Verizon customers does not consist of local calls that require Verizon to make so-called reciprocal compensation payments to carriers such as . . . Quincy-based Global NAPs.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It said that the rulings \u201cclosed what Verizon called \u2018a loophole\u2019 forcing it to pick up the cost of carrying [Internet] traffic from throughout Eastern Massachusetts to Global NAPs\u2019 data center in Quincy.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The article then summarized and quoted a conversation between the reporter and Conroy, which became the focus of Global\u2019s defamation claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u201cJack Conroy, Verizon\u2019s Massachusetts regulatory affairs chief, said the DTE ruling shut down \u2018a scam\u2019 he said Global NAPs very cleverly developed in the late 1990s. Using so-called virtual phone numbers throughout the state that did not require Global to install any switching equipment, Conroy said, Global got Verizon to pay for most of the cost of handling calls to its Internet service provider customers while claiming Verizon owed it additional reciprocal compensation payments as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\"><em>2. Analysis. </em>The burden is on Verizon as the moving party to make a threshold showing that the activity at issue is petitioning activity within the purview of the anti-SLAPP statute. <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 522 (2002). In support of its motion, Verizon furnished affidavits and pleadings to the motion judge indicating that Conroy\u2019s comment was made \u201cin connection with a matter under review by the DTE and the courts\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>thus, \u201cconstituted . . . petitioning activity\u201d as defined by the anti-SLAPP statute. The judge rejected this contention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Relying on a broad reading of the statutory definition of a \u201cparty\u2019s exercise of its right to petition,\u201d Verizon argues that the motion judge\u2019s determination was incorrect. The statute states that \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition\u201d shall mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201c[1] any written or oral statement made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; [2] any written or oral statement made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; [3] any statement reasonably likely to encourage consideration or review of an issue by a legislative, executive, or judicial body or any other governmental proceeding; [4] any statement reasonably likely to enlist public participation in an effort to effect such consideration; or [5] any other statement falling within constitutional protection of the right to petition government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, sixth par., inserted by St. 1994, c. 283, \u00a7 1. Verizon focuses on the second phrase in the definition, arguing that Conroy\u2019s statement was made \u201cin connection with\u201d the appealed DTE ruling and was therefore protected by the statute. Under this view, any statement about an issue under some form of government consideration, whether defamatory or not, would be protected by the statute. We read the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d more narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">The statute enumerates no fewer than five types of statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>that comprise petitioning. Verizon focuses exclusively on the second category and asks us to read it broadly and in isolation. Paying attention to the context compels the conclusion that the sweep of \u201cin connection with\u201d is limited because the phrase pertains to statements made to influence, inform, or at the very least, reach governmental bodies \u2014 either directly or indirectly. Specifically, the first, third, and fourth phrases support reading \u201cin connection with\u201d as embodying, to some extent, similar purposive elements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, Verizon fails to acknowledge that the first sentence of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, refers to a \u201cparty\u2019s exercise of its right of petition under the constitution of the United States or of the Commonwealth.\u201d See <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, ante </em>151, 156 n.6 (2005). That a statement concerns a topic that has attracted governmental attention, in itself, does not give that statement the character contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Our conclusion in this case is supported by three recent decisions, <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327 (2005)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>supra,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, ante </em>246 (2005). All three of these decisions emphasize the language set forth in the first sentence of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, i.e., that claims sought to be dismissed pursuant to a special motion must be \u201cbased on said party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition under the constitution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the United States or of the Commonwealth. \u201d As the Supreme Judicial Court stated in <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, supra </em>at 333, \u201cThe right of petition contemplated by the Legislature is thus one in which a party seeks some redress from the government.\u201d In the instant case, the tangential comment is not one that is related to the petitioning process.</p>\n<p id=\"AD2\">The recent case bearing most directly on the issues here is <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, supra. </em>In <em>Wynne, </em>a former firefighter brought suit against the widow of a deceased firefighter on the basis that she had defamed the plaintiff in the course of a fire department investigation. The plaintiff alleged that both a written statement to the Greenfield fire department and articles in the Greenfield newspaper contained defamatory statements by the defendant about the plaintiff. Sometime after her husband\u2019s death, which was a suicide and which the defendant maintained was precipitated by the plaintiff\u2019s harassment of her husband, the defendant pursued legislative benefits as the widow of a deceased firefighter. See <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, supra </em>at 248 &amp; n.3. At oral argument the plaintiff apparently conceded that the written statement to the Greenfield fire department made during the course of an investigation came within the ambit of the antiSLAPP statute. <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, supra </em>at 253. Therefore, this court only had for its consideration the question whether the statements to the newspaper reporter were entitled to antiSLAPP protection.</p>\n<p id=\"ACfN\">The court reasoned that the statements to the Greenfield newspaper \u201cwere essentially mirror images of those she made during and \u2018in connection with\u2019 the departmental investigation of the plaintiff. Taken in context, her mere repetition of those statements to the media was also possessed of the characteristics of petitioning activity.\u201d <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, supra </em>at 254. Additionally, the court concluded that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s statements were sufficiently tied to and in advancement of her petition for benefits as the widow of a firefighter . . . [to] fall within the ambit of statements made \u2018in connection with\u2019 legislative proceedings within the meaning of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, and constitute protected petitioning activity on that basis as well.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Atb\">An examination of the materials supporting Verizon\u2019s motion does not indicate that Conroy\u2019s disparaging comment concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ing Global\u2019s position before the DTE had the potential or intent to redress a grievance, or directly or indirectly to influence, inform, or bring about governmental consideration of the issue. Because it lacks that crucial characteristic, the case law suggests it should not be deemed petitioning protected by the statute. Unlike the statements to the reporter that were found to be protected in <em>Wynne, </em>the statements here were not \u201cmirror images\u201d of what was said in a governmental forum, nor were they made in conjunction with any legislative petitioning. <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, supra </em>at 254. Instead, the comments were incidental observations that were not tied to the petitioning activity in a direct way. See <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 348 n.7 (2000) (special motion to dismiss should not be allowed \u201cmerely because there is ongoing litigation between the parties in a different forum\u201d); <em>Ayasli </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 740, 749 (2002). Contrast <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 122-123 (2002) (communications with officials from the Federal Deposit Insurance Coiporation and efforts to spur others to contact elected officials, by unit owners of a condominium opposing plaintiff\u2019s purchase of units, fall within the definition of petitioning activity protected by the statute); <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Paton, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 295 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">From the language of \u00a7 59H, its context that we have described, and its treatment in other Massachusetts decisions, it appears that the insulation with which the statute covers statements made before a public body, statements made to further a citizen\u2019s efforts to gain governmental relief, or statements made to enlist public participation to effect favorable consideration of an issue by a public body, does not protect tangential statements intended, at most, to influence public opinion in a general way unrelated to governmental involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\n<em>Order denying special motion to dismiss affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The acronym \u201cSLAPP\u201d stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Interlocutory review is appropriate in this case because the claims against the defendant would be entirely eliminated had the Superior Court judge granted its special motion to dismiss. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 522 (2002); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 659, 662-663 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Although we agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that Conroy\u2019s comments did not constitute \u201cpetitioning activity\u201d as contemplated by the statute, we reach our conclusion for different reasons. The judge based her decision, in part, on the view that \u201c[t]he only party that exercised the right of petition to seek protection of its rights in this matter was [Global],\u201d as it was the party that initiated arbitration proceedings and appealed the results of arbitration. We question this portion of the Superior Court\u2019s decision limiting the protection of the anti-SLAPP statute to those parties who first bring a dispute to the attention of governmental officials or seek to have some adjudicatory body resolve a claim. See <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 338 (2005) (\u201cthere is no statutory requirement that petitioning parties directly commence or initiate proceedings\u201d). See also <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Creigle, ante </em>246, 253 n.9 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The last, or fifth, phrase in the list, \u201cany other statement falling within constitutional protection of the right to petition government,\u201d is different in nature from the first four. The list nonetheless suggests a more limited reading than Verizon advocates. This final phrase serves as a catchall provision at the end of the enumeration, and we read it to indicate that the four specific items listed in the sixth paragraph of c. 231, \u00a7 59H, are meant to be illustrative, not exhaustive. Such a catchall provision does not change or expand the nature of the other listed statements or activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, supra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court determined that the statute did not protect a defendant whose relationship to the petitioning activity under analysis was in the capacity of a paid expert. Specifically, the Supreme Judicial Court stated, \u201cIn other words, the statute is designed to protect overtures to the government by parties petitioning in their status as citizens. It is not intended to apply to those performing services for the government as contractors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">In <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, supra, </em>this court reversed the denial of a special motion to dismiss filed by the defendant, an attorney who was representing a party unarguably involved in petitioning activity. This court held that such legal representation was on a \u201cvery different footing\u201d from that of the paid expert. <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Wylie, supra </em>at 156. Essentially, the court held that the attorney\u2019s status was coextensive with that of his clients.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
