The association\u2019s position is that the order runs afoul of G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 3(A)(1), which, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 138, \u00a7 161, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-14\">\u201cIf a police officer observes ... a civil motor vehicle infraction, the officer may issue a written warning or may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>cite the violator for a civil motor vehicle infraction .... If the officer issues a citation solely for one or more civil motor vehicle infractions without any associated criminal violations, the officer shall indicate on the citation the scheduled assessment for each civil motor vehicle infraction alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The police chief argues, to the contrary, that the word \u201cmay\u201d in G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 3(A)(1), is intended merely to provide authority to police officers to issue either citations or written warnings, and that in the exercise of these grants of authority, the officers are subject to the direction of the police chief. The police chief is vested with inherent authority to direct the operations of the police department, as \u201c[i]t would be practically impossible to organize and efficiently maintain a police department if control of the department were not conferred upon some one with authority to direct the members of the police force as to their respective rights and duties in different sections of the city.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>264 Mass. 221, 223 (1928). The police chief cites numerous statutes that confer authority on police officers, by use of the word \u201cmay,\u201d without suggesting that the officers can exercise their discretionary powers free from direction and control by superior officers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The police chiefs argument accurately reflects what is probably a general principle, that statutes so worded presumptively use the word \u201cmay\u201d in the sense of \u201cis permitted,\u201d or \u201cis allowed,\u201d or \u201cis authorized or empowered,\u201d to contrast the designated action with one that officers are <em>not </em>permitted to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The history of G. L. c. 90C, however, convinces us that the word \u201cmay,\u201d as used in \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 3 of that chapter, was meant to confer independence on officers assigned to traffic enforcement duty. Chapter 90C was inserted in the General Laws by St. 1962, c. 789, \u00a7 2. Section 2 of c. 90C continued the earlier practice (under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 27, as appearing in St. 1961, c. 592) that the police officer who witnessed a traffic offense would record the violation on a citation form and submit it to police headquarters. Within three days from receipt of the citation, the police chief or a designated officer of at least sergeant grade would decide whether to proceed by way of a written warning, a court complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reference to the Registry of Motor Vehicles, or voiding the citation. In 1965, concerned by the \u201copportunity for subsequent maneuvering or pressure\u201d afforded by the three-day period, then-Governor John A. Volpe, by special message to the Legislature, proposed a \u201cno-fix\u201d traffic ticket bill. 1965 Senate Doc. No. 839. The object of the bill was to require, as a general rule, that the decision to issue a citation (in effect an application for a District Court complaint) be made by the police officer at the time and place of the violation. The crux of the Governor\u2019s draft legislation lay in this sentence: \u201cA failure to give the original of the citation to the offender at the time and place of the violation shall constitute a bar to prosecution for such offense, except where the violator could not have been stopped, or where some other circumstance, not inconsistent with the purpose of this section, namely, to cause violators of automobile law to be brought uniformly to justice, justifies the failure.\u201d 1965 Senate Doc. No. 839, Appendix A. That sentence, as slightly amended in committee,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> remains the crux <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>of G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2, in its present form.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">General Laws c. 90C, \u00a7 3, upon which the association relies, sets out the detailed procedures for the noncriminal disposition of lesser automobile law violations (\u201ccivil motor vehicle infractions\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Read in isolation from \u00a7 2, the words of \u00a7 3(A)(1) (\u201cthe officer may issue a written warning or may cite the violator for a civil motor vehicle infraction\u201d) could reasonably be read as merely providing authority for the officer to do one or the other. The words of \u00a7 3, however, echo and must be read together with \u00a7 2. The history of \u00a7 2 makes it clear that the Legislature\u2019s purpose was to divest police headquarters of control over a decision that, under the statute, must be made by the officer at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">It could be argued for the city (although in fact it is not) that permitting the police chief to restrict the officer\u2019s discretion would not compromise the purpose of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 2 \u2014 the \u201cprevention of corrupt manipulation,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 281, 283 (1983) \u2014 because the treatment accorded offenders would be uniform. The argument is not insubstantial \u2014 it respects the spirit if not the letter of \u00a7 2 \u2014 but we decline to trench in that manner on the statute\u2019s literal meaning. The Legislature in 1965, at Governor Volpe\u2019s urging, very deliberately transferred this discretionary decision from the police chief to the officer on traffic control duty. General Laws c. 90C, \u00a7 2, was the vehicle they chose for dealing with the evil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>they perceived, and the judge did not err in declining to amend the Legislature\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Accordingly, the judge correctly entered a judgment declaring the police chiefs order invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\">A \u201ccivil motor vehicle infraction,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 1, is, subject to certain exceptions, an automobile law violation, the maximum penalty for which does not include imprisonment. The \u201cscheduled assessment\u201d is the amount predetermined for listed violations as jointly promulgated by the Chief Justice of the District Court Department and the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">See, e.g., G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98 (officers \u201cmay examine all persons abroad whom they have reason to suspect of unlawful design, and <em>may </em>demand of them their business .... <em>may </em>disperse any assembly .... <em>may </em>enter any building to suppress a riot, etc. . . . <em>may </em>search . . . for a dangerous weapon\u201d [emphasis added]); G.

No. 1121 and 1965 House Doc. No. 4200, which was enacted as St. 1965, c. 692. The sentence, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 692, \u00a7 3, read: \u201cA failure to give the original of the citation to the offender at the time and place of the violation shall constitute a defence in any trial for such offense, except where the violator could not have been stopped, or where the court finds that some other circumstance, not inconsistent with the purpose of this section, namely, to cause violators of automobile law to be brought uniformly to justice, justifies the failure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The sentence now reads: \u201cA failure to give a copy of the citation to the violator at the time and place of the violation shall constitute a defense in any court proceeding for such violation, except where the violator could not have been stopped or where additional time was reasonably necessary to determine the nature of the violation or the identity of the violator, or where the court finds that a circumstance, not inconsistent with the purpose of this section to create a uniform, simplified and non-criminal method for disposing of automobile law violations, justifies the failure.\u201d G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 794, \u00a7 3. The sentence took its present form in St. 1982, c. 586, \u00a7 2, which introduced the distinction between lesser infractions, which could be disposed of by mailing in the designated fine (now termed \u201cscheduled assessment\u201d), and which would result in no criminal record, and more serious automobile law violations, which would be processed by criminal complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">As recounted in note 3, <em>supra, </em>the provision for noncriminal disposition began with St. 1982, c. 586, \u00a7 2, and was refined by St. 1985, c. 794, \u00a7 3, and again by St. 1991, c. 138, \u00a7 161. General Laws c. 90C, \u00a7 3, was rewritten by each act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
