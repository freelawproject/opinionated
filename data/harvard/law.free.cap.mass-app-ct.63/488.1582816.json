L. c. 265, \u00a7 23 (three counts), indecent assault and battery of a child under the age of fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B (four counts), and open and gross lewdness, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16. Further, in subsequent jury-waived proceedings, the defendant pleaded guilty to indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen as a second or subsequent offense, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B (four counts). On appeal, the defendant alleges that (1) the judge erred in preventing the defendant from using the victim\u2019s medical records for impeachment purposes; and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper in multiple respects. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">We begin by drawing a detailed sketch of the evidence presented at trial. The victim is the defendant\u2019s daughter, the product of his former marriage to Darlene Faquoseh. The couple separated in 1990 when the victim was about a year old, at which time Faquoseh moved to Florida, taking the victim with her. The defendant had little or no contact with the victim from the time he and Faquoseh separated until the events that gave rise to the charges at issue here some eight years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In the summer of 1998, Faquoseh contacted the defendant and informed him that she could no longer care for the victim, who was then nine years old. The victim, according to Faquoseh, had developed severe emotional problems that caused her to become violent toward members of her family. The defendant testified that Faquoseh informed him that unless he was willing to care for the victim in his home in Massachusetts, Faquoseh planned to have the victim placed in a residential care facility. The defendant consented to take custody of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">When the victim first arrived in Massachusetts, she lived with her paternal grandmother. Within a few weeks, however, she and her grandmother moved into the defendant\u2019s apartment. The victim had difficulty making friends in Massachusetts, and frequently spoke to her mother about feeling homesick. She was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>not permitted to return to Florida for Christmas as she had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Sometime during March, 1999, a telephone call was placed to Faquoseh, possibly by the victim\u2019s grandmother, to discuss the victim\u2019s increasingly disruptive behavior. According to Faquoseh, the victim again asked during this call if the victim could visit Florida. Faquoseh told the victim that she would not consider allowing a visit until the end of the school year. Immediately thereafter, the victim made her first accusations of sexual abuse against her father.</p>\n<p id=\"Apm\">After making the disclosures of abuse, the victim was taken from the defendant\u2019s home to stay with other relatives who lived nearby. There was evidence that the victim telephoned her mother in Florida the next morning and admitted that she had falsely accused her father of abuse. Nonetheless, the victim was sent home to Florida. Her mental state apparently declined upon her return, and the victim was ultimately institutionalized for about one week. Other relevant facts are included in our analysis as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">1. <em>Use of victim\u2019s medical records for cross-examination. </em>Before trial, the defendant filed a motion, in accordance with the procedures set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993), to admit \u201cinformation contained within [medical] records made available to his counsel after in camera review by the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the motion hearing, the defendant indicated that the medical records at issue would be essential to rebut anticipated inculpatory evidence that the victim\u2019s behavior was markedly different before and after her stay in Massachusetts. On the basis of the government\u2019s approach before the grand jury, the defendant anticipated that the Commonwealth would seek to prove that the victim showed signs of mental illness after her return to Florida, not present before she left, and inferentially attributable to the defendant\u2019s abuse. However, according to the defendant (and not disputed by the government), the victim\u2019s medical records disclosed that she suffered from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>mental illness sufficiently severe to warrant hospitalization just a few months before she went to stay with her father. As defense counsel argued at the motion hearing, \u201c[b]oth the records of what her behavior was prior to leaving [for] Massachusetts and upon her return[,] the facts show in essence very similar behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">For its part, the government did not argue at the motion hearing that the contested medical records evidence should be categorically excluded. Rather, the Commonwealth conceded that if witnesses \u201ctestif[y] opposite of what the [medical] records said, [the defendant] has the right to criticize any inconsistencies.\u201d With regard to any specific fact contained in the privileged records, the government quite reasonably took the view that admissibility \u201cis going to depend on the testimony as it comes out in trial.\u201d The motion judge, who was also the trial judge, apparently agreed, forgoing any pretrial ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">At trial, the issue of the victim\u2019s mental health status took shape more or less as predicted by the defendant during the motion hearing. During cross-examination, Faquoseh resisted defense counsel\u2019s efforts to elicit evidence that the victim had evinced signs of serious mental illness in the period immediately before she went to live with the defendant. In particular, defense counsel struggled to establish that the victim had been violently assaultive toward her siblings before moving to Massachusetts. The defendant now contends that the judge prevented him from mounting an effective defense by placing unreasonable limits on his use of the <em>Bishop </em>materials during the trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the judge, in fact, permitted the defendant to make ample use of the <em>Bishop </em>records for the purpose of impeaching Faquoseh or in order to refresh her recollection of her prior statements. Admittedly, the judge restricted defense counsel to the use of records pertaining to events \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time\u201d before and after the victim\u2019s stay with the defendant. This limitation, however, was reasonably tailored to ensure that only relevant material, probative of issues actually in dispute, were admitted. Further, defense counsel did not lodge an objection to the judge\u2019s ruling. Finally, and perhaps most important, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the documents to which the judge granted defense counsel access were, in fact, sufficient to accomplish defense counsel\u2019s stated aims \u2014 i.e., to compel Faquoseh to admit that the victim had been assaultive to her siblings right up to the time she left for Massachusetts to live with the defendant, and otherwise paint a picture of the serious mental health problems that afflicted the victim <em>before </em>the assaults by the defendant occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We note as an aside that the victim\u2019s troubled mental state \u2014 including incidents of violence toward her siblings \u2014 before leaving Florida was well-established by the testimony of other witnesses apart from Faquoseh, including the victim herself. Indeed, on direct examination the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">The prosecutor: \u201cDo you know why you came to Massachusetts?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">The victim: \u201cYes I do. Because I was very violent with my family. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cWhen you say you were violent with your family, who in your family were you violent with?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">The victim: \u201cI was violent with my mom and my sisters. I used to hit them . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">The prosecutor: \u201cWas it only your mom and your sisters that you were violent toward?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">The victim: \u201cAfter my mom\u2019s fianc\u00e9 moved in, I started being violent to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">The victim also conceded, inter alla, that she had received mental health counseling in Massachusetts before any abuse by the defendant had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">In the end, we are unpersuaded that any of the reasonable limitations placed by the judge on the defendant\u2019s use of the <em>Bishop </em>records deprived him of the opportunity to adduce important exculpatory evidence. During trial, the defendant made multiple requests to use the <em>Bishop </em>materials; in each instance the judge either granted the defendant\u2019s request, albeit with limitations, or indicated that she would revisit the issue if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>defense counsel were unable to adduce the evidence he sought by other means. Defense counsel never objected to the judge\u2019s various rulings, a strong indication that the limits imposed did not, in fact, prejudice the defendant\u2019s cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">To a great extent, the defendant\u2019s arguments on this point reflect efforts by appellate counsel, with the benefit of hindsight and far removed from the pressures of trial, to ferret out missed opportunities for impeachment in the <em>Bishop </em>materials. There is no question that alternate approaches were open to trial counsel. However, the tactics he pursued, while ultimately unavailing, were indisputably sound. Moreover, he was by no means hamstrung in his efforts by any stinginess on the part of the judge with respect to the <em>Bishop </em>records. Indeed, quite the opposite. There was no error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">2. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant has identified two discrete defects in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. Specifically, he faults the prosecutor for (a) suggesting to the jury that the victim possessed age-inappropriate sexual knowledge that could have been derived only from the acts of abuse alleged in the indictments, despite the fact that the claim was contradicted by facts known to the prosecutor (although not in evidence); and (b) mischaracterizing the law relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>standards for assessing the credibility of witnesses. We consider each of these arguments in turn.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">a. <em>Sexual innocence. </em>During her closing, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201cThe other thing I asked you to consider was how would a 9-year-old child know about these numerous and very sexual acts that she testified to? Does the average 9-year-old child know about a man licking a female\u2019s vagina? Does the average 9-year-old little girl know about a man putting his penis in someone\u2019s mouth? ... If a child has not experienced these things, how do they have all that sexual knowledge? [The victim] told you nothing like this had ever happened to her before. And not only did she tell you what her father did, she gave you details. . . . That is something a 9-year-old makes up? If a child doesn\u2019t experience sexual things, how do they make up that kind of detail?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">At the close of the argument, the defendant objected as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\u201cI also think that the argument that no 9-year-old child would know this, again, I think that\u2019s inappropriate argument, that there\u2019s no evidence before the jury what a 9-year-old might or might not know, and asking the jury to speculate regarding that is improper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In response, the judge charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">\u201cYou\u2019re not to speculate about matters which were not presented in evidence . . . . So in short, you are to confine your deliberations to the evidence and on that alone decide the facts of this case. . . . Opening statements, closing arguments, objections of counsel, side-bar conferences, are all not evidence. And if, as I\u2019ve said, if an attorney stated the evidence differently in closing argument than you remember it to be, you must rely upon your memory of the evidence, not what the attorney said that the evidence was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aku\">This was a forceful charge that exceeded, to some degree, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>instruction typically provided on the evidentiary value of argument. However, whether this charge was sufficient in the unusual circumstances presented here is a close question.</p>\n<p id=\"A8l\">In Massachusetts, as in most jurisdictions, evidence of a victim\u2019s age-inappropriate sexual knowledge may be admitted for the purpose of supporting an inference of sexual abuse. As we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 654 (1994), \u201c[w]e agree that evidence demonstrating a child\u2019s inappropriate sexual knowledge may be relevant in a sexual abuse case.\u201d Where such evidence is introduced, a defendant is entitled (provided an appropriate foundation for inquiry has been established, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 504 [2001]) to demonstrate the existence of alternative sources of such knowledge, including especially prior instances of abuse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, </em>399 Mass. 811, 815 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 399 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"AVm\">However, a defendant\u2019s right, in appropriate circumstances, to plumb the background of a child victim for alternative sources of age-inappropriate sexual knowledge cannot be transformed into an obligation so to do. Such an approach would shift the traditional burden of persuasion, and thereby violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights. For this reason, Massachusetts does not impute any conclusive presumption of sexual innocence to child victims \u2014 a presumption that potentially would impose an unlawful burden of rebuttal on the defendant. Rather, a jury is merely entitled to consider evidence of precocious sexual knowledge as one factor potentially supporting an inference of abuse. While the defendant concedes that nothing in the judge\u2019s charge here suggested the existence of a legal presumption of sexual innocence, he asserts instead that the prosecutor\u2019s argument held the potential to suggest, at least implicitly, the existence of such a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"A8v\">We agree with the defendant that, as a general matter, a prosecutor may not rely in her closing on any implied or express presumption of sexual innocence for the purpose of urging the specific inference that age-inappropriate sexual knowledge evinced by a child victim <em>necessarily </em>was derived from the sexual acts that form the basis of the charges against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>defendant. Sadly, sexual abuse of children has become sufficiently endemic to render any such inference far too speculative to be deemed fair argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, where a prosecutor wishes <em>expressly </em>to urge such an inference, there must be a firm evidentiary basis for the argument; that is to say, there must be some record evidence indicating that a child victim\u2019s knowledge of sexual matters was, in fact, derived from the abuse charged, and not from some other source.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The burden we impose is by no means onerous, particularly in view of the potentially strong inculpatory force of such argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 400-401 (\u201cjuror might well find the defendant guilty\u201d on basis of evidence that sexual knowledge must have been derived from acts of abuse charged). In order to offer the type of closing at issue here, a prosecutor need only inquire whether a child victim had either suffered abuse on other occasions or had otherwise been exposed to sexually explicit materials. Indeed, that is more or less what occurred in this case. During direct examination on the subject of the defendant\u2019s repeated assaults, the prosecutor specifically asked the victim, \u201c[h]ad anything like that ever happened to you before,\u201d to which the victim replied, \u201c[n]o.\u201d Ideally, the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry should have been somewhat more extensive (i.e., should have included other potential sources of sexual knowledge besides the abuse alleged) to establish a proper foundation for her subsequent argument \u2014 and we will hold prosecutors to a higher standard in future cases \u2014 but, in the instant circumstances, we deem this minimally sufficient to support the contested argument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Our conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s contested comments did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>not amount to reversible error is bolstered by other factors, as well. In the first place, as noted, the judge gave a forceful charge on the proper use of closing argument, which charge we must presume the jury obeyed. Further, we note that the sexual precocity argument was not likely to have weighed heavily in the jurors\u2019 deliberations in this particular case. The victim was twelve years old at the time of trial (nine years old at the time of the sexual assaults). Jurors likely would have expected the victim to possess some knowledge of sexual matters. Had the witness been much younger, the impact of the prosecutor\u2019s argument would have been far greater. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rathburn, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 699, 708 (1988) (jurors would have assumed some degree of sexual sophistication on part of thirteen year old witness). In any event, we believe that a marginally adequate foundation existed here for the prosecutor\u2019s argument vis-a-vis age-inappropriate sexual knowledge and, in any event, any error was insufficiently serious to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"AS2\">One further point on this topic: it is important to note that nothing in our holding today should be construed to limit the use of evidence of age-inappropriate sexual knowledge as a factor supporting an inference of sexual abuse, particularly where such evidence is offered in the form of expert testimony concerning the clinical symptoms of sexual assault \u2014 the most common form in which such evidence is admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 627-630 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frangipane, </em>433 Mass. 527, 534 (2001), and cases cited therein (admission of expert testimony regarding symptoms of child sexual abuse). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 253, 263-264 (2002). Rather, we simply have determined that where a prosecutor <em>expressly </em>urges in her closing that a child victim\u2019s sexual knowledge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>derived from <em>identified </em>acts of abuse, there must be an adequate and specific basis in the record for such a claim that excludes other possible sources of such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">While we have concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s argument concerning the victim\u2019s sexual knowledge was, on the face of the record, permissible, there remains another matter to consider. As the Commonwealth concedes, the government was aware that the victim had been informed of at least some of the details of a prior sexual assault committed by the defendant against the victim\u2019s older sister (which evidence had been excluded by pretrial order on a motion in limine). The prosecutor also knew that the prior assault involved conduct that was \u201calmost exactly alike\u201d the conduct that gave rise to the charges at issue here. In these circumstances, there is a serious question whether the prosecutor knowingly purveyed false or misleading information to the jury when she argued, in essence, that the victim could not have acquired knowledge of sexual matters from any source other than as a result of being abused by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct strictly forbid presenting false evidence to a tribunal. Specifically, Mass.R.Prof.C. 3.3(a)(4), 426 Mass. 1383 (1998), provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not knowingly . . . offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false.\u201d The relevance of rule 3.3(a)(4) to the present situation is plain: a lawyer is charged with applying her <em>actual </em>knowledge of facts in assessing whether or not she may adduce particular evidence, not merely record evidence or potential record evidence. Thus, were it clear that the prosecutor in this case had actual knowledge of an alternative source for the age-inappropriate sexual knowledge contained in the victim\u2019s testimony, it is likely that her argument vis-a-vis the inculpatory value of the victim\u2019s knowledge would amount to professional misconduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, where prosecutorial misconduct \u201cis egregious, deliberate, and intentional ... the \u2018drastic remedy\u2019 of dismissal of charges may become an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>remedy.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>405 Mass. 566, 579 (1989), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194, 198-199 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Dismissal of a criminal complaint, however, is a severe sanction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. at 201; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 773, 778-779 (1989). It may be imposed only where a defendant suffers substantial prejudice or the Commonwealth\u2019s malfeasance is particularly egregious. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>416 Mass. 707, 716-717 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willie, </em>400 Mass. 427, 432-433 (1987). After a careful examination of the record here, we conclude that there is not a sufficient basis for any remedial action in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">While the prosecutor was on notice that the victim had been informed of the prior abuse, it is at least plausible that she believed that the victim had been informed only of general details, insufficient to account for her graphic sexual knowledge. During the grand jury proceedings (the primary source of the prosecutor\u2019s knowledge of these matters, according to the defendant), a police officer testified that the victim\u2019s older sister, in describing the prior abuse, \u201cdid not get very specific, other than that some improper things and touching had occurred between her father and herself.\u201d The older sister \u201csaid that she thought [the victim] was too young to hear a lot of the details.\u201d The older sister \u201cnever provided the details of her abuse to [the victim].\u201d This testimony was sufficient, if barely so, to justify the prosecutor\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Our conclusion that no misconduct occurred here should by no means be read as an endorsement of the prosecutor\u2019s actions. As the Rules of Professional Conduct make plain, a prosecutor is a purveyor of justice first, an advocate for conviction second. See Mass.R.Prof.C. 3.8, 426 Mass. 1397 (1998), &amp; comment [1]. While the government here managed to skate a fine line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>between proper argument and reversible error (or even bar sanctions), there was no justification for cutting things so fine. Were the facts changed but slightly, the outcome here easily could be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">b. <em>Credibility of witnesses. </em>The defendant also complains that the prosecutor erred by suggesting that the victim was inherently credible merely because she testified at the trial while, at the same time, the defendant was inherently unreliable because of his stake in the outcome of the proceedings. The prosecutor stated, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u201c[The victim] has no motive to lie about what her father did. . . . [She] has nothing to gain by coming in this courtroom and telling you something that wasn\u2019t true. She has nothing to gain and she has no stake in the outcome of this case. But somebody else does. And let\u2019s talk about the defendant for a moment. . . . The defendant has a stake in the outcome of this case. The defendant has a motive to lie. [The victim] does not. . . Think about who has a motive in this case, who has a motive to not tell you the truth, who has a stake in the outcome of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The defendant promptly objected to these portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, and the judge agreed that the statements were problematic, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">\u201cthe area that jumps out at me is the victim, alleged victim, coming into court and, by doing so, being imbued with some greater credibility. I feel I must instruct the jury . . . I think I need to instruct the jury that they are not to draw any inference favorable to the witness simply because the witness appears in court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Thereafter, the judge charged the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">\u201cYou are also not to be influenced by the impact that your verdict may have on anyone. . . . [T]he indictment against [the defendant] is not evidence. It is merely an accusation and a vehicle to bring this matter into court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Later, the judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">\u201cI want to caution you . . . that the fact that a complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ing witness has come into court and testified before you does not entitle that witness to any greater credibility. And in fact, the mere fact that somebody has come into court to testify does not mean that their testimony is entitled to be believed by you because of the mere fact that they showed up in court and testified. <em>If you have been invited in the argument of counsel to make such an evaluation of a witness\u2019s testimony, I instruct you that you are to disregard that\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">At the conclusion of the charge, defense counsel indicated that he was content with the curative instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">As an initial matter, there is no question that a prosecutor may use closing argument for the general purpose of marshaling the evidence in her favor, part and parcel of which is urging the jury to credit the testimony of the government\u2019s witnesses and to reject exculpatory evidence offered by the defendant. The court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>401 Mass. 731, 738-739 (1988), approved argument by the prosecutor \u201cthat only the defendant possessed a motive to lie.\u201d We note that, as in <em>Shea, </em>this was not a case in which the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to consider the consequences of their verdict during deliberations. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>373 Mass. 569, 576 n.3 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 117 (1987). Accordingly, we find no fault with the government\u2019s statements along these lines \u2014 particularly in view of the fact that the chief theme of defense counsel\u2019s closing was that the victim had deliberately fabricated the charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">However, as the judge recognized, a prosecutor generally may not suggest that a victim \u2014 indeed any government witness \u2014 is inherently reliable merely because she subjected herself to the rigors of appearing in court. As we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riberio, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 7, 10 (2000), \u201c[t]elling the jury that the victims have no reason to lie is over the line of permissible advocacy.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moreno, </em>991 F.2d 943, 947-948 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 971 (1993). Fortunately, this misstep on the part of the prosecutor, as noted above, was the subject matter of a cogent curative charge. Not only did the judge set out the correct standard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>assessing the credibility of witnesses, but she also expressly admonished jurors to ignore any suggestion by counsel that a witness\u2019s \u201ctestimony is entitled to be believed by you because of the mere fact that they showed up in court and testified.\u201d We conclude that the judge\u2019s emphatic instruction was sufficient to cure any error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\">To be specific, the principal documents in question include Wing Memorial Hospital/Griswald Center records; a Family Service Center evaluation; Medfield Hospital records; Morton Plant Hospital records; and a Florida Protective Services report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\">We note that the defendant spends considerable time in his brief discussing the limits the judge placed on defense counsel\u2019s access to medical records pertaining to the victim\u2019s history of hallucinations, an issue that does not seem to have been a matter of much contention at trial. The defendant\u2019s appellate arguments notwithstanding, the judge permitted defense counsel, upon request, to use the victim\u2019s medical records to probe her history of hallucinations, at least during times relevant to the events at issue here. Defense counsel made no objection to the judge\u2019s ruling and thereafter questioned the victim about hallucinations without incident. The issue arose again after the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, when defense counsel complained that the prosecutor had capitalized on the defendant\u2019s limited access to the <em>Bishop </em>materials by suggesting that the victim had never suffered from hallucinations when, in fact, the records arguably suggest otherwise (but from a period deemed too remote to be relevant by the judge). Fairly read, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument merely indicated that the victim\u2019s description of the sexual assaults were not hallucinations. In any event, the judge erased all possibility for prejudice by forcefully instructing the jury that \u201c[t]he matter of any hallucinations [the victim] is alleged to have suffered was admitted solely on the issue of her mental state at the time of the allegations being made. And that evidence was admitted solely for that purpose and should be used solely for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-12\">As we consider the challenges to the prosecutor\u2019s closing speech, we are obliged once again to reiterate that lack of preparation and careless comments too often cause \u201cdefeat to be snatched from the jaws of victory.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In addition, as a result of the advent of the Internet, and ubiquitous access to same, children may be exposed to a wide variety of sexually explicit materials not previously available to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">We do not create any new rule of law here; rather, our holding merely represents a specific application of the familiar principle that a prosecutor, during her closing, may argue facts in evidence and \u201cinferences that may be reasonably drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coren, </em>437 Mass. 723, 730 (2002) (reversal required where prosecutor\u2019s closing involved unsupported speculation about conversations between defendant and victim). It is our view that, absent any specific foundation in the evidence, it is simply not reasonable to infer that a child victim\u2019s precocious sexual knowledge was necessarily derived from any particular identified act of abuse; there are too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>many other possibilities. It is also worth noting that arguments relating to a child victim\u2019s source of sexual knowledge almost never relate to collateral matters but rather, as a rule, run to the key issue in dispute; viz., whether a defendant committed the abuse alleged. As a result, courts cannot be too careful in ensuring that such argument has a proper foundation in the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pavao, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 577, 581-583 (1993) (unsupported arguments must receive special scrutiny where they relate to key issues in dispute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\">If called upon to address the question, it is likely that we would include attorney argument under the rubric of \u201cevidence\u201d for the purposes of rule 3.3, despite the fact that argument does not constitute evidence strictly speaking. Cf. Mass.R.Prof.C. 3.3(e), 426 Mass. 1383 (1998) (barring defense counsel from making closing argument premised upon false evidence). The underlying purpose of rule 3.3 is to encourage general candor toward the tribunal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\">At the same time, we note that there is at least some indication in the record of the grand jury testimony that the victim\u2019s older sister might have described the particulars of the abuse. At one point, the older sister indicated that the victim \u201casked her to describe what it felt like,\u201d possibly referring to an act of sexual intimacy, perhaps intercourse. On balance, however, as we have indicated, the record supports the view that the victim did not receive a detailed description of the prior abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Commendably, in the course of delivering her curative instructions, the judge correctly made specific references to the prosecutor\u2019s questionable statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
