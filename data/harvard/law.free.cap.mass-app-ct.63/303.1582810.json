Miller, a medical doctor, established a personal service corporation entitled Barry R. Miller, M.D., Inc. (PSC). In April and October, 1996, respectively, Miller engaged the defendant, a certified public accountant, to prepare his 1995 individual and 1996 PSC tax returns. The PSC had a tax year ending July 31, 1996; the return was due October 31, 1996. In 1999, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited the PSC\u2019s 1996 return and assessed a deficiency of $23,335 plus $7,609 in interest. A Superior Court judge entered a judgment in those amounts against the defendant for negligent tax preparation. She entered separate judgments against Miller for his claims of breach of warranty and unfair and deceptive acts (G. L. c. 93A), and denied him monies for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>any potential liability for a State tax deficiency for the PSC\u2019s 1996 tax year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The problem arose from the defendant\u2019s failure to make a \u00a7 280H calculation, referring to a provision of the tax code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that limits the ability of a professional to use a PSC as a vehicle for deferring personal income to a succeeding tax year. In the first five months of the PSC\u2019s 1996 tax year (i.e., August 1 through December 31, 1995), Miller paid himself $34,248, which, under \u00a7 280H (according to the IRS auditor), would limit the annual deduction the PSC could claim for Miller\u2019s compensation to $82,195. Miller paid himself $114,617 in the remaining seven months of the PSC\u2019s 1996 tax year (January 1 through July 31, 1996), for a total of $148,865. The PSC deducted the entire $148,865 from its 1996 tax return; this amount (again, according to the IRS auditor) exceeded the allowed deduction by $66,670, which, at the PSC flat thirty-five percent rate, amounted to the asserted deficiency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Whether Miller\u2019s PSC was required to apply the \u00a7 280H deduction limitation depended on how it obtained its noncalendar tax year. PSCs may elect a noncalendar tax year under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 444 (1994) or under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 441 (1994). Section 280H only applies to PSCs electing under \u00a7 444.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It seemed dubious to Miller\u2019s expert that the PSC had elected under \u00a7 441, which requires the PSC to demonstrate a business purpose other than tax deferral to justify use of a noncalendar tax year. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 441(i). It was also dubious, however, that it had elected under \u00a7 444, which prohibits a tax deferral period longer than three months; that is, a PSC subject to \u00a7 444 must elect a tax year ending September 30, October 31, or November 30. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 444(b). The election of a noncalendar tax year requires the submission of forms to the IRS, different for \u00a7 444 PSCs and \u00a7 441 PSCs. See IRS Form 1128 (\u00a7 441); IRS Form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>8716 (\u00a7 444). There was nothing in evidence indicating whether the PSC established its August 1 to July 31 tax year under \u00a7 441 or \u00a7 444.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is to say, there was a failure of proof whether the PSC was required by law to apply the \u00a7 280H deduction limitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s negligence in failing to explore the applicability of \u00a7 280H was of no consequence if \u00a7 280H was inapplicable. The burden was on the plaintiffs to prove that the return prepared by the defendant was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">There is a second reason the plaintiffs have not proved actionable negligence. Even if the PSC tax return prepared by the defendant was in error for having deducted more than was allowable, the additional tax required to be paid (i.e., the deficiency component) was not the consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence but of the fact that Miller\u2019s withdrawals of income from the PSC triggered the antideferral provision of \u00a7 280H. Miller\u2019s PSC would only have been made to pay the tax it should have paid in the first instance. The general rule is that the amount of a tax deficiency is not necessarily the measure of damages imputable to a negligent tax preparer. See <em>Gantt </em>v. <em>Boone, Wellford, Clark, Langschmidt &amp; Pemberton, </em>559 F. Supp. 1219, 1229-1230 (M.D. La. 1983), aff\u2019d, 742 F.2d 1451 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>Jobe </em>v. <em>International Ins. Co., </em>933 F. Supp. 844, 860 (D. Ariz. 1995); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>768 P.2d 1090, 1091 n.5 (Alaska 1989); <em>Dail </em>v. <em>Adamson, </em>212 Ill. App. 3d 66, 68 (1991); <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Staehle, </em>70 Ohio App. 2d 93, 99-100 (1980); <em>Lien </em>v. <em>McGladrey &amp; Pullen, </em>509 N.W.2d 421, 426 (S.D. 1993). No penalty was assessed, and no proof was offered that the interest paid to the IRS on the deficiency exceeded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>value to the plaintiffs of having use of the money in the meantime. There was, in other words, no proof of actionable damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">It is true that Miller could have avoided the application of \u00a7 280H by paying himself more of his annual earnings during the tax deferral period, but that mistake was not attributable to the defendant. As the judge found, \u201cdespite Miller\u2019s requests,. . . [the defendant] never offered tax planning advice to Miller, nor did he ever assume any responsibility for [the PSC\u2019s] payroll.\u201d When Miller approached the defendant in October, 1996, asking him to prepare the PSC\u2019s 1996 tax return, the liability of the PSC for taxes already had been fixed by the PSC\u2019s earnings and payroll disbursement in the August, 1995, through July, 1996, period. Those were the PSC\u2019s, not the defendant\u2019s, responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">As to the negligent Federal tax preparation claim, the judgment in favor of the plaintiff must be vacated. A new judgment is to enter in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The asserted State tax deficiency was $6,334 plus $3,412 in interest. The Commonwealth had not, at the time of trial, made such a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\"> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 280H (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Interest considerations set aside, in some circumstances the unused deduction could be washed out because the deduction can be carried to offset income in the next tax year. In 1997, however, Miller created a new PSC to which the unused deduction could not be carried forward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b334-10\">See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 280H(a)(1), 444(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In the trial judge\u2019s words: \u201cHow [the PSC] managed to acquire a July 31 fiscal year-end, in light of \u00a7 444, remains a mystery to all parties involved in this litigation. In addition, no one involved in this litigation knows whether [the PSC] ever filed a \u00a7 444 election.\u201d The trial judge concluded that whether or not the PSC made a \u00a7 444 election, it was appropriate to apply \u00a7 280H because \u201cthe corporation was in essence the type of creature \u00a7 444 and \u00a7 280H were enacted to control.\u201d Section 280H does not apply, however, unless the PSC makes a \u00a7 444 election. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 280H(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">When the issue in dispute is whether the IRS auditor improperly assessed a deficiency in a tax return, the assessment itself cannot be regarded as probative that the tax paid was deficient. See <em>Zwack </em>v. <em>Kraus Bros. &amp; Co., </em>133 F. Supp. 929, 936 (S.D.N.Y. 1955), aff\u2019d, 237 F.2d 255 (2d Cir. 1956). At most the assessment has the evidentiary status of an inadmissible out-of-court expert opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
