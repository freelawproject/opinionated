The summary judgment record suggests no basis that would warrant such reliance, and judgment entered for the attorney on the buyer\u2019s claims. The buyer appeals, claiming that it was foreseeable that she would rely on the attorney who, in the circumstances, had a duty to her as a nonclient. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">The pertinent undisputed facts are these. The plaintiff buyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>signed an agreement to purchase a mixed-use residential and commercial building at 1435-37-39 Main Street in Brockton, together with six deeded parking spaces at the rear of a lot located up the street at 1449 Main Street. Despite having been expressly informed by her lending bank well before the closing that she could obtain her own counsel, she did not do so. At the closing, the buyer questioned the seller\u2019s real estate broker as to whether the parking spaces were included. The broker assured her that they were, while the lender\u2019s attorney, the defendant Favaloro, said nothing. The attorney evidently failed to discover that the deed did not in fact convey the parking spaces. When the buyer subsequently discovered the discrepancy, she sued, among others, the attorney, upon whom she claimed to have relied in accepting the deed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The buyer plainly understood that the bank\u2019s attorney represented the bank and did not represent her; she knew in advance of the closing that she was free to retain counsel to represent her interests in the transaction. While not asserting the existence of an attorney-client relationship between herself and the bank\u2019s attorney, she maintains that the attorney is nonetheless liable to her as a nonclient, particularly given the arguable congruity of the bank\u2019s and buyer\u2019s interests with respect to the inclusion of the six parking spaces in the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The case is governed in all material respects by <em>Page </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>388 Mass. 55 (1983). Here, as there, the buyer made the \u201cconscious decision, after disclosure, to elect the riskier path\u201d of not obtaining her own counsel to represent her interests. <em>Id. </em>at 66. Notwithstanding some putative overlap in the bank\u2019s and buyer\u2019s interests in the parking spots that were not conveyed, the bank\u2019s attorney at all times had an \u201cindependent and potentially conflicting duty\u201d to his client, the lending bank. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>at 63.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWhere, as here, a nonclient takes the chance that the client\u2019s interests are in harmony with [her] own, and does so in the face of an express warning that the interests may differ, [her] claim of foreseeable reliance cannot be rescued simply because, in retrospect, the interests are shown not to have differed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The buyer also sued the seller, broker, and, on a theory of vicarious liability, the attorney\u2019s law partner. The seller and broker have settled with the buyer. The judge entered summary judgment for the attorneys, dismissing all of the buyer\u2019s claims against them. The buyer presses only the legal malpractice claim in her brief on appeal. The remaining claims sounding in intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress and violation of G. L. c. 93A are deemed waived under Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-5\">As in <em>Page </em>v. <em>Frazier, supra </em>at 60-61, there is no suggestion here that the premises conveyed were to be occupied by the buyer or otherwise fell within the protection afforded a borrower by G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 70.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
