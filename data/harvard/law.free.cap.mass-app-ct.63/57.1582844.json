L. c. 151B and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102, and the health care whistleblower statute, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187. She brought her action against the owner and licensee of the nursing home, Omega, Inc. (Omega), and Genesis Health Ventures, Inc. (Genesis), an independent company selected to provide health care services at the facility. The trial court judge granted Commodore\u2019s motion to dismiss Genesis from her action because Genesis was involved in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Thereafter, Omega filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 365 Mass. 765 (1974), on the ground that Omega was not the employer of Commodore or the other employees at COC-Winthrop. Omega based its motion primarily on the management agreement between Omega and Genesis, which Omega had attached to its answer. Commodore opposed the motion, and requested that, if the judge converted the motion into a motion for summary judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), he allow her to engage in further discovery to establish that Omega was her employer. At a hearing held five months later, Omega urged the judge to convert the motion for judgment on the pleadings to one for summary judgment. The judge allowed the summary judgment motion four months after that hearing. Commodore then filed a motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(e), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), to alter or amend the judgment, claiming that she had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>given notice of the conversion or a reasonable opportunity to present evidence. The judge denied that motion. Commodore contends on appeal that (1) the conversion of the rule 12(c) motion into a rule 56(b) motion was improper; and (2) even if it were proper, she had raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Omega was her joint employer. We reverse the judge\u2019s decision allowing the motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><em>Background. </em>Omega owned and was licensed to operate nursing homes in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Omega entered into an agreement with Genesis, a Pennsylvania-based health care management corporation, to manage COC-Winthrop and other health care facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">According to the management agreement, the \u201cManager,\u201d Genesis, would \u201cselect, employ and compensate as an operating expense ... a licensed Facility Administrator and a Director of Nursing for the Facilities.\u201d The administrator and director of nursing would be employees of Genesis, but provide services exclusively to COC-Winthrop and other facilities owned and licensed by Omega and managed by Genesis. The agreement also provided that Genesis would \u201c[hjire, as employees of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>[Genesis], and discharge, maintain, supervise, and reheve from its employ (as may be necessary in [Genesis\u2019s] discretion) an adequate staff of nurses.\u201d The agreement further provided that Genesis would establish employee benefits and \u201call personnel policies and procedures,\u201d including \u201crates of compensation,\u201d \u201chours of employment,\u201d and \u201cjob classifications.\u201d Genesis would also \u201ccause compliance with ah apphcable governmental laws and regulations, specifically including the regulations pertaining to . . . non-discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The management agreement required the \u201cOwner,\u201d Omega, to provide money to pay for capital and operating expenses, including funding the payroll account. Omega was to be consulted by Genesis on a monthly basis about operational decisions affecting the facility. Omega also had the right to inspect the facihty on twenty-four hours\u2019 notice. The agreement further stated that \u201c[Omega] shall perform those obligations and responsibilities which must be performed by the party hcensed to operate the [facilities.\u201d As the hcensee of the nursing home, Omega was required by the agreement and Department of Pubhc Health regulations to \u201cbe responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations of legally authorized agencies.\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 150.002(A)(2) (1994). In addition, the regulations provide that the licensee \u201cshall be responsible for procurement of competent personnel, and the hcensee and the administrator shall be jointly and severally responsible for the direction of such personnel and for establishing and maintaining current written personnel policies, and personnel practices and procedures that encourage good patient or resident care.\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 150.002(D) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Commodore began working at COC-Winthrop in August, 1999, as the director of nursing. She alleged in her amended complaint that, despite her superior performance, she and \u201cother black, African and West Indian employees of COC-Winthrop/ Genesis [were] treated differently on account of [their] race, color, and national origin.\u201d She alleged that white employees at COC-Winthrop were paid at a higher rate than their black colleagues and disciplined less harshly than black employees for similar conduct. She alleged that she complained to the \u201cCOC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Winthrop/Genesis\u201d administrator about the discrimination in July, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In May, 2000, another Omega-owned and Genesis-managed facility closed, and its patients were transferred to COC-Winthrop. Commodore alleged that her complaints to COC-Winthrop/Genesis administrators and Genesis managers about understaffing and patient overcrowding resulting from the transfer \u2014 in addition to unlawful discrimination \u2014 eventually led to the termination of her employment in August, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>\u201c[A] party moving for summary judgment in a case in which the opposing party [has] the burden of proof at trial is entitled to summary judgment if he demonstrates, by reference to material described in Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), unmet by countervailing materials, that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">1. <em>Joint employer status under G. L. c. 151B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">a. It is unlawful for an \u201cemployer\u201d or his or her agent to discriminate against an individual because of race or national origin or to retaliate against an individual for objecting to such discrimination. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(1) &amp; (4). It is also unlawful for any person \u201cto aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce\u201d such discrimination. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(5), as amended by St. 1989, c. 272, \u00a7 14. Commodore alleges (1) that there was enough evidence to create a triable issue of fact on her claim that Omega \u2014 together with Genesis \u2014 was her joint employer; and (2) that, if she established a genuine issue of material fact regarding Omega\u2019s status as a joint employer, then the judge improperly allowed summary judgment on her G. L. c. 151B claim, as well as on her G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102, and G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187, claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The seminal decision on joint employment is <em>Boire </em>v. <em>Greyhound Corp., </em>376 U.S. 473, 481 (1964), a case involving a bus company that had contracted with a maintenance company to service its terminals. The Supreme Court defined the concept of a \u201cjoint-employer\u201d as a company possessing \u201csufficient control over the work of the employees\u201d of another company. The Court described the joint employer determination as \u201cessentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>a factual issue.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe basis of [a joint employer] finding is simply that one employer while contracting in good faith with an otherwise independent company, has retained for itself sufficient control of the terms and conditions of employment of the employees who are employed by the other employer.\u201d <em>Swallows </em>v. <em>Barnes &amp; Noble Book Stores, Inc., </em>128 F.3d 990, 993 n.4 (6th Cir. 1997), quoting from <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus. of Pa., Inc., </em>691 F.2d 1117, 1123 (3rd Cir. 1982). See Schlei &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1312 (3d ed. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Since <em>Boire, </em>Federal courts have applied joint employer principles to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000 et seq., and to the Age Discrimination Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 et seq.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Swallows, supra. </em>The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Commonwealth\u2019s trial courts have also applied joint employer analysis in G. L. c. 151B cases. Here, we do the same.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">b. Commodore argues that the requirements imposed on the licensee by 105 Code Mass. Regs. 150.002 (A)(2) and (D) were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding Omega\u2019s status as a joint employer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In heavily regulated environments, issues of joint employment are particularly complicated. As we noted earlier, the Department of Public Health regulation, 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 150.002(D), states, in relevant part, that the licensee \u201cshall be responsible for procurement of competent personnel, and the licensee and the administrator shall be jointly and severally responsible for the direction of such personnel and for establishing and maintaining current written personnel policies, and personnel practices and procedures <em>that encourage good patient or resident care\" </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The purpose of this regulation, however, is to protect patients, not to define the employment relationships at the nursing home. The regulation does not expressly require that the licensee be the employer of the employees providing the health care. Nor does it preclude the licensee from contracting with an independent company to provide such services, as was done here. Cf. <em>Reida </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Hosp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 554 (1994) (no error in allowance of summary judgment for hospital as emergency room physician being sued for institutionalizing patient was \u201cpart of an incorporated emergency room physicians\u2019 group which provided service to hospital as an independent contractor\u201d). The licensee\u2019s responsibility, as defined by the regulation, is to \u201cprocure,\u201d not employ, competent personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Nevertheless, even if it exercises its right to contract out health care services, the licensee retains certain residual responsibilities regarding the selection and direction of health care personnel to satisfy its licensing obligation to the Department of Public Health. It also cannot contract away responsibility for the development of policies, practices, and procedures that encourage \u201cquality\u201d patient care.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Despite these nondelegable responsibilities, however, we do not interpret this regulation as dictating, as a matter of law, that all licensees are joint employers for the purposes of G. L. c. 151B. It is c. 151B, not the Department of Public Health\u2019s regulation, that provides the \u201cdetailed framework . . . [for] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>employment discrimination\u201d claims. <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 583 (1994). The regulatory requirements do not displace the multi-factor analysis of joint employer status under current antidiscrimination statutes and case law. Rather, the regulatory requirements must be integrated into that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Consideration of the regulation, the management agreement, and the other evidence contained in the record leads us to conclude that the allowance of Omega\u2019s summary judgment motion was error. Omega negotiated for the creation of the director of nursing position in the agreement. It provided the money to pay Commodore\u2019s and all other employees\u2019 salaries. Also, the extent to which Omega contracted away the employment function while still being able to fulfil its obligations as a licensee is unclear from the record. The contract language obscures the issue both by broadly delegating responsibility for the employment relationship to Genesis and leaving Omega the responsibilities required by law and regulation. Those requirements, however, preclude the contracting away of responsibility over personnel issues related to quality patient care. In this regard, the agreement is ambiguous. See <em>Seaco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>435 Mass. 772, 779 (2002) (\u201cIf a contract ... is unambiguous, its interpretation is a question of law that is appropriate for a judge to decide on summary judgment .... Where, however, the contract . . . has terms that are ambiguous, uncertain, or equivocal in meaning,\u201d the parties\u2019 intentions may depend on disputed material facts). See also <em>Affiliated FM Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Constitution Reinsurance Corp., </em>416 Mass. 839, 845-846 (1994) (summary judgment inappropriate where contract language ambiguous, and evidence of trade usage was necessary to interpret contract); <em>Cardone </em>v. <em>Boston Regional Med. Center, Inc., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 179, 186-187 (2003). Neither party has submitted evidence regarding the parties\u2019 actual application of the agreement. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202 comment g, at 90 (1981) (\u201cThe parties to an agreement know best what they meant, and their action under it is often the strongest evidence of their meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Moreover, Omega, as owner-licensee, retained in the agreement substantial financial control, as well as the right to inspection and the right to monthly consultation regarding operational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>decisions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, the record reveals next to nothing about how those rights were exercised under this agreement and what their impact was on Commodore, whose high-level position as director of nursing would have involved her in decisions that would have concerned the owner-licensee of the facility as well as the manager. In sum, given Omega\u2019s contract rights, the ambiguities in the contract, the nondelegable responsibilities set by the Department of Public Health regulation, the gaps in the record, and the fact-sensitive nature of the joint employer determination, it is not correct to conclude that Commodore has no reasonable expectation of proving that Omega was a joint employer. <em>Kourouvacilis, </em>410 Mass. at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">2. <em>General Laws c. 93, \u00a7 102, claim. </em>The motion judge also allowed summary judgment on the claim arising under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102 (also known as the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act), on the sole ground that Omega could not be liable as a joint employer. In so doing, he declined to consider whether that claim was barred by the G. L. c. 151B claim. As we have concluded that (1) summary judgment should not have been allowed at this stage on the joint employer question, and (2) neither party has briefed the issue of the interrelationship between G. L. c. 151B and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102, we also reverse the allowance of summary judgment on the equal rights claim. The issue whether the G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102, claim is barred by the c. 151B claim is better considered on a fuller record after briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">3. <em>General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 187, claim. </em>The plaintiff also claims that Omega violated G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187(b), the health care whistleblower statute, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">\u201c[A] health care facility shall not refuse to hire, terminate ... or take any retaliatory action against a health care provider because the health care provider . . . disclose[s] to a manager ... an activity ... of the health care facility .. . that the health care provider reasonably believes is in violation of a law or rule or regulation ... or [in] violation of professional standards of practice which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>health care provider reasonably believes poses a risk to public health.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">There is no question that Commodore is a health care provider. At issue is whether Omega is liable in these circumstances as a health care facility. Omega successfully argued to the motion judge that it was not a health care facility because it did not \u201cemploy health care providers.\u201d We conclude that this statute does not call for an analysis precisely parallel to G. L. c. 151B. The focus of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187, is broader than the determination of employer status, and Omega, as owner-licensee of the health care facility, may be held responsible for G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187, violations, even if it is not a joint employer pursuant to G. L. c. 151B.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">As provided in c. 149, \u00a7 187(a), a \u201c[h]ealth care facility\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">\u201c[A]n individual, partnership, association, corporation or trust or any person or group of persons that employs health care providers, including any hospital clinic, convalescent or nursing home ... or other provider of health care services licensed, or subject to licensing by . . . the department of public health; any facility as defined in section 3 of chapter 111B;[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] any private county or municipal facility .. . which is licensed or subject to licensing by the department of mental health ... or the department of mental retardation; any facility as defined in section 1 of chapter 123[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]....\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The statute is specific to the health care industry and is designed to safeguard patient care by protecting the rights of health care providers who expose deficiencies in care that violate laws or regulations or professional standards that endanger public health. The term \u201chealth care facility\u201d in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187, is directed at the facility providing the care, i.e., the hospital, clinic, nursing home, or other health care center. The term is broadly defined. To insure its inclusiveness, and therefore its applicability outside the institutional setting, the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>encompasses any \u201cindividual, partnership, association, corporation, or any person or group of persons that employs health care providers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">As a nursing home, COC-Winthrop appears to be expressly covered.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The parties themselves, reflecting common parlance and understanding, referred to it as a health care facility in the management agreement. Omega argues, however, for limiting the definition of health care facility to the entity that employs the health care providers, even though the statutory definition (1) uses this formulation as a means of expanding, not narrowing the definition of health care facility, and (2) does not require the facilities referenced after the first semicolon \u201cto employ health care providers\u201d to be health care facilities, and there is no reason to distinguish these facilities from those referenced earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We interpret the definition of health care facility set out in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187(a), to encompass the licensee of the health care facility. We conclude that the statutory language read as a whole supports this interpretation. It also reflects the statute\u2019s larger concerns about the quality of patient care at health care facilities and not just the employment relationships of the health care providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">We further conclude that the requirement that the licensee be jointly and severally responsible for the direction of personnel and the establishment of policies, practices, and procedures that encourage good patient or resident care, 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 150.002(D), includes oversight responsibility for G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187, violations at the facility. That responsibility cannot be contracted away to the entity allegedly engaged in the prohibited conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Protection of whistleblowers is necessary to ensure quality care at the facility. This is part of the licensee\u2019s core, nondelegable patient and resident care responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We reverse the grant of summary judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>favor of Omega on the discrimination claims brought pursuant to G. L. c. 151B and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102, and the whistleblowing claim brought pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 187, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">We need not resolve the propriety of the judge\u2019s conversion of the rule 12(c) motion into a motion for summary judgment without providing the parties actual notice of the conversion. Regardless of the appropriateness of that conversion, there has been no prejudice to Commodore, the party opposing the conversion, because we have concluded that summary judgment should not have been allowed. We note further that the Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that actual notice of the conversion of the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment is not always required, provided the nonmovant has constructive notice of the potential conversion and an adequate time to submit factual submissions. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Peabody Constr. Co., Inc., </em>386 Mass. 121, 127 (1983). Nine months passed between the time Commodore filed her opposition to the motion for judgment on the pleadings, in which she argued against conversion, and the judge\u2019s decision allowing summary judgment. This provided her ample time to make factual submissions. Nevertheless, the judge could have avoided the problem by simply notifying the parties of his intentions and providing them a deadline for additional filings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Although Commodore named Omega as the owner of the COC-Winthrop facility, it was actually owned by Omega\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ohima, Inc. The parties have, however, essentially glossed over the distinction and considered it irrelevant to the questions presented in this appeal. The defendant is, therefore, referred to as Omega, as it was in the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\">See, e.g., <em>Rivas </em>v. <em>Federacion de Asociaciones Pecunarias de Puerto Rico, </em>929 F.2d 814, 820 (1st Cir. 1991) (summary judgment granted mill operator in age discrimination case because mill operator was not a joint employer even though it, \u201cretained control over setting the time that its ships were to be unloaded, [and] may have had some work-site disciplinary authority over the [workers\u2019] foremen\u201d); <em>Sibley Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.
