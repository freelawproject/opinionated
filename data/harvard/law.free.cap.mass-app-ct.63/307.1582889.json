The complaint pleaded a cause of action predicated upon G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That particular law preserves the right of a \u201cperson\u201d to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\u201cfree from sexual harassment,\u201d and confers jurisdiction on the Superior Court to enforce that right in instances where other employment-related statutes, e.g., G. L. c. 151B, may not be applicable. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 557 (1996). The complaint was dismissed on the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The issue presented is whether G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, provides a private statutory right of action to a volunteer worker who is sexually harassed. In our opinion, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, does so provide, and accordingly, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>Applying the governing summary judgment standard, which focuses on review of the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the evidence may be summarized as follows. On a daily basis, the plaintiff, Lowery, worked as a volunteer at the Pick of the Litter, a swap shop operated by the town of Falmouth (town) waste management facility (landfill). For three years, defendant Klemm, who was the gatekeeper and land supervisor at the landfill, made it a point of entering the swap shop and approaching Lowery. During these encounters, Klemm, it is alleged, made sexual advances and subjected Lowery to \u201cverbal and physical conduct of a sexual nature.\u201d Klemm persisted in this course of misconduct notwithstanding Lowery\u2019s plea that he leave her alone. For reasons not clear in the record, on June 21, 2001, the director of the public works department issued a no trespass order barring Lowery from the landfill and ending her volunteer services. Lowery complained in writing to the town about Klemm\u2019s sexual harassment. The town\u2019s affirmative action officer rejected Lowery\u2019s claim. Thereafter, Lowery brought a one-count complaint under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, alleging sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>Whether a volunteer in the workplace may bring an action under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, involves consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the interplay between that statute and G. L. c. 15IB, the latter being the more comprehensive and general statute which covers discriminatory acts by an employer. The interplay between the two laws must be considered in light of major statutory changes in 1986, which affected both laws. See St. 1986, c. 588. In this sweeping 1986 reform law, entitled \u201cAn act directed to prohibiting sexual harassment\u201d (the Act), the Legislature both enacted G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, declaring the right of \u201cpersons\u201d to be \u201cfree from sexual harassment,\u201d and amended G. L. c. 15IB to add sections defining sexual harassment as a form of prohibited practice by any employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The simultaneous creation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C (to establish in the Superior Court a right of action for sexual harassment), and the amendments to G. L. c. 151B (to include sexual harassment as a prohibited employment practice) gave rise to the potential for overlap and duplication of sexual harassment litigation under the two statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The potential for such duplication was laid to rest in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., supra. </em>In <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>the Supreme Judicial Court held that where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>G. L. c. 151B applies to discriminatory conduct, including sexual harassment, the administrative procedure specified in c. 151B may not be bypassed; in such cases, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, does not have independent force and does not confer a private right of action. \u201cWhere . . . c. 151B applies, its comprehensive remedial scheme is exclusive, in the absence of an explicit legislative command to the contrary.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. at 557-558. Conversely, in instances where c. 151B does not apply, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, \u201cprovides exclusive jurisdiction in the Superior Court for any sexual harassment claim that is brought in the courts ... [if] either (a) the employer is not covered by c. 151B; or (b) the claimant has satisfied the procedural prerequisites for a c. 151B claim and has chosen to pursue the case in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Applying these principles, the issue whether G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, provides a private right of action to a volunteer worker proceeds along two separate, but interrelated, lines of inquiry: first, does the procedure required under G. L. c. 151B cover and exclusively occupy the field; second, if c. 151B does not so cover, does the claim fit within the jurisdictional mandate of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, so as to afford private statutory litigation rights \u2014 in this case to a volunteer worker to redress sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Turning to the first line of inquiry, in order for G. L. c. 151B to apply, the person or entity engaging the worker must be an \u201cemployer,\u201d and the worker an \u201cemployee,\u201d within the definitional meanings set forth in the statute. The Supreme Judicial Court has construed these definitions as tracking the traditional common-law standards for an employment relationship.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u201cAlthough the Commonwealth\u2019s employment discrimination law, G. L. c. 151B, affects a \u2018broad array of employment practices\u2019 and extensively prohibits discrimination against certain protected classes, we do not read the statute as intending to broaden the definition of employee. . . . In the absence of any indication to the contrary, we will not assume that the Legislature intended to cover relationships outside the traditional common law employer-employee relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><em>Comey </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Mass. 11, 15 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Thus, in <em>Hill, </em>the court held that G. L. c. 151B did not apply to a person working as an independent contractor. In the same vein, a volunteer is not an employee under traditional common-law standards and, thus, would fall outside the protection for employees as codified in G. L. c. 151B. For a volunteer, the badges and incidents of a traditional employment relationship \u2014 including, in particular, the quid pro quo of compensation for work \u2014 are missing. There is no monetary component, no fringe benefits, and no retirement package; the state unemployment compensation system, G. L. c. 151A, does not apply. Simply put, the work of a volunteer turns on the willingness of the person to provide services, in effect, on a pro bona basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">That a volunteer does not fall within the G. L. c. 151B employee/employer common-law definitional structure does not end the analysis, but rather brings to the fore the second part of the inquiry, i.e., whether G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, provides a remedy for a volunteer worker\u2019s sexual harassment claim. We begin with the overarching principle that \u201cG. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, ensures that <em>all </em>employees are protected against sexual harassment in the workplace, whether or not their employers fit within the definition in c. 151B.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. at 557 (emphasis original). For the reasons hereinafter stated, we determine that \u00a7 1C covers a volunteer worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">We first turn to the judicial analysis of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, that has been developed in similar employment-based contexts. We do so because it is appropriate to look to the statutory analysis of \u00a7 1C utilized in other employment-related cases in which G. L. c. 151B was held not to apply, and in which \u00a7 1C was held by the court to fill in the gap to guard against sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>harassment in the workplace. One such instance is where the employing entity has fewer than six employees. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(5). In this situation, the Supreme Judicial Court has determined that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, fills the field. \u201cJust as G. L. c. 151B provides an exclusive remedy for sexual harassment claims against employers with six or more employees, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, provides the exclusive remedy for such claims against employers of fewer than six employees.\u201d <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Lowinger, </em>422 Mass. 570, 572 (1996). \u201c[E]mpIoyees who cannot file claims with the MCAD because of limited size of the workforce, see G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(5) (employers of fewer than six employees not included) are protected under \u00a7 1C.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Second, we consider the legislative history. In determining the reach of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, the Supreme Judicial Court has observed that \u00a7 1C is not \u201cplain and unambiguous on its face\u201d and that, therefore, the court may \u201cgo beyond its express language to construe it. While the statute gives the Superior Court jurisdiction over sexual harassment claims, it is not clear [the extent to which and] when that jurisdiction attaches. Furthermore, we have on occasion looked at the history and purpose of an apparently unambiguous statute to determine the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554 n.4. See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In the instant case, the legislative history supports the application of \u00a7 1C to a volunteer worker. The comprehensive, deliberate legislative actions in the 1986 law \u201cprohibiting sexual harassment\u201d \u2014 which effectuated the enactment of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, simultaneously with the amendments of c. 151B to add sexual harassment in employment to the list of unfair employment practices \u2014 bespeak a legislative intent comprehensively and broadly to reach sexual harassment wherever occurring, including in nontraditional employment structures. In this regard, it is \u201cnoteworthy that these sections [amendments to G. L. c. 151B and the insertion of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, to cover sexual harassment] were added at a time when it was unclear whether <em>any </em>existing statute or constitutional provision provided a remedy for victims of sexual harassment\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. at 556. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>temporally conjunctive amendments to c. 151B and c. 214, \u00a7 1C, expanded the protection and remedies available to victims of sexual harassment as well as the potential class of claimants who could seek relief for unlawful discriminatory acts. <em>Ibid. </em>As such, the legislative history map has lines drawn wide enough to encompass myriad working environments and to prohibit sexual harassment in virtually all such working environments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this respect, it is to be noted that neither compensation for work, traditional employee benefits nor the common-law employment relationship extend so far as these broadly drawn map lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In addition, in construing the scope of \u00a7 1C we are guided by general principles of statutory construction, which focus on the language of the statute, the reason for its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished. \u201cWhen the language [of a statute] is less clear, we must interpret the statute according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>434 Mass. 331, 333 (2001), quoting from <em>Adoption of Derrick, </em>415 Mass. 439, 444 (1993) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">With these general admonitions in mind, we give weight to the fact that, in enacting G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, the Legislature did not limit the reach of \u00a7 1C to the defined term \u201cemployee\u201d but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>instead, explicitly granted to all \u201cpersons\u201d the right to be free from sexual harassment. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>This broad grant is consistent with coverage extending to nontraditional employment environments \u2014 such as that within which a volunteer works.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">We also consider significant the Legislature\u2019s decision separately to codify the prohibition against sexual harassment in \u00a7 1C <em>not </em>in an employment-related statute, but rather within c. 214 of the General Laws (conferring equity jurisdiction). This equity-based codification suggests a more encompassing statutory reach than traditional employer/employee configurations. See <em>Melnychenko </em>v. <em>84 Lumber Co., </em>424 Mass. 285, 289 (1997); <em>Ruffino </em>v. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>908 F. Supp. 1019, 1043 (D. Mass. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Lastly, we consider sound public policy. In construing a statute in which the language does not provide a hard and fast meaning, we may take notice of whether the construction advocated accomplishes the statutory object and \u201cis supported by sound public policy.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>434 Mass. at 334. In these times of budget restrictions, volunteers have come forward to provide help in our schools, provide companionship and assistance in our hospitals, feed the homeless in shelters and staff local libraries. Given the statutory protection in G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, that \u201c[a] person shall have the right to be free from sexual harassment\u201d \u2014 a law created as a central provision in a sweeping Act directed at prohibiting sexual harassment \u2014 and given the overarching principle that \u201cG. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, ensures that <em>all </em>employees are protected against sexual harassment in the workplace, whether or not their employers fit within the definition in c. 151B\u201d (emphasis original), <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. at 557, we determine as a matter of statutory application and construction that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, was intended to protect a volunteer worker from acts of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Indeed, to construe the statute as inapplicable to a volunteer toiling in a workplace would give rise to unfair and absurd results: unpaid volunteer workers, serving the community, could be subjected to sexual harassment but would not be covered by the panoply of statutorily based rights of action (which provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>greater protections and grant a broader array of remedies and tools for enforcement than are available at common law).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Courts will not construe statutes in a manner such that \u201cthe consequences ... are absurd or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The following illustration underscores the unfair and absurd results that would flow from a construction of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, that would exclude a volunteer worker: both a volunteer assisting an elderly person in a hospital and a compensated employed nurse working in tandem with the volunteer could be subjected to sexual harassment. The volunteer would have no statutory protection to bring an action under \u00a7 1C, while the nurse could proceed to assert her rights immediately under G. L. c. 151B. Similar examples abound, e.g., the unpaid volunteer law school intern, working and sitting next to the compensated employed law clerk; the elementary school unpaid volunteer teacher\u2019s assistant, helping a student in joint sessions with a compensated employed special reading teacher; the unpaid volunteer in the town library, shelving books next to a compensated employed shelving assistant. From all that appears, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, was legislatively designed to, and we see no public policy reason why it would not be deemed to apply to, preserve and protect for volunteers the same discrimination-free environment \u2014 not dusted by sexual harassment \u2014 statutorily fostered for the volunteer\u2019s paid counterpart. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>365 Mass. 357, 366 (1974). Cf. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, </em>400 Mass. 686, 694 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In sum, the legislative purpose and history of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, its construction in the settled case law, its broad reach coupled with a jurisdictional base grounded in the Superior Court\u2019s equity power<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and sound policy analysis leads in our view to the conclusion that G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1C, was intended to, and does, extend protection against sexual harassment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>volunteers performing services in a workplace. As a remedial statute, \u00a7 1C warrants a reading vindicating the Act\u2019s stated goal of prohibiting such sexual harassment for all persons \u2014 including volunteer workers. See <em>Sanitoy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ilco Unican Corp., </em>413 Mass. 627, 632 (1992); <em>Buster </em>v. <em>George W. Moore, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 635, 645 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-16\">General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 1C, as amended, St. 2002, c. 223, \u00a7 3, in full, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">\u201cA person shall have the right to be free from sexual harassment, as defined in chapter one hundred and fifty-one B and one hundred and fifty-one C.

L. c. 151B as \u00a7 1(18):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018sexual harassment\u2019 shall mean sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when (a) submission to or rejection of such advances, requests or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment or as a basis for employment decisions; (b) such advances, requests or conduct have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual[\u2019]s work performance by creating [an] intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive work environment. Discrimination on the basis of sex shall include, but not be limited to, sexual harassment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The Act\u2019s \u00a7 3 amended G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, to add a new subsection, 16A, which states that \u201c[i]t shall be an unlawful practice . . . [f]or an employer, personally or through its agents, to sexually harass any employee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\">At the time the Act was passed, December 9, 1986, the question whether G. L. c. 151B, which generally covered employment discrimination, encompassed sexual harassment had not been judicially determined. The case of <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156, 162 (1987), pending at the time of passage of the Act, raised precisely that issue. After the statutory amendments become effective, the Supreme Judicial Court decided <em>College-Town, </em>holding that sexual harassment was a form of discrimination and that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was cognizable under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We note, in passing, that a similar rule of statutory exclusion applies to claims under the Massachusetts equal rights act, see G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 102-103 (ERA). Thus, if a claim exists under G. L. c. 151B, the plaintiff\u2019s claims under the ERA are precluded. See <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 586 (1994). But if G. L. c. 151B does not apply, any claims based on the ERA have independent vitality. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, </em>400 Mass. 686, 693 &amp; n.9 (1987) (where G. L. c. 151B, is inapplicable, a plaintiff may pursue a sexual harassment claim against her employer under the civil rights act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">General Laws c. 151C, the Fair Educational Practices Act, has no applicability to Lowery\u2019s claims, which arose in a work setting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Beyond the two statutes most directly implicated in this appeal, the Act amended other Massachusetts laws, e.g., it amended G.

The Act also added a definition of sexual harassment to G. L. c. 151C, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (the Fair Educational Practices Act, or FEPA), making it an unlawful practice in the educational environment for an employer, personally, or through its agents subject to FEPA, to sexually harass students in any program or course of study in any educational institution.
