L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(a). The current offense charged in the first portion of the indictment is unlawfully possessing a firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a); the earlier conviction of a violent crime, called for by \u00a7 10G(a), was an adjudication of delinquency by reason of armed robbery, an offense the defendant concedes could qualify for sentence enhancement under \u00a7 10G if it had been an adult conviction. A Superior Court judge ruled that the earlier adjudication did not qualify as a \u201cconvict[ion] of a violent crime\u201d under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(a), inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 71, because, under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53, \u201c[proceedings against children . . . shall not be deemed criminal\u201d; hence, the \u201cadjudication\u201d was not a \u201cconviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>This case is controlled by our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 155, 157-159 (2003), which the judge did not attempt to distinguish. There, as here, the defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and he was charged as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 10G based on a prior adjudication of delinquency (in Juvenile Court, as a youthful offender) by reason of armed robbery and other offenses. The majority reasoned that because \u00a7 10G incorporates the definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d set out in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the definition of violent crime in \u00a7 121 includes both adult convictions and juvenile adjudications of the specified offenses, therefore the Legislature intended both adult convictions and juvenile adjudications of the specified offenses to qualify as prior \u201cconvictions\u201d of a violent crime as used in \u00a7 10G. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 157-158. We follow our decision in <em>Furr, </em>i.e., we conclude that the explicit incorporation in \u00a7 10G of the definition of violent crime detailed in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, thereby expressly including certain acts of juvenile delinquency, was intended by the Legislature to encompass such acts within the term \u201cconviction\u201d in \u00a7 10G.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The judge reasoned that adjudications of delinquency should only serve as predicate convictions for purposes of \u00a7 10G where the child reoffends while still a juvenile. (In this case, of course, Foreman is now an adult.) That interpretation has no textual basis within the linked statutes (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G, and G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121) that drove our decision in <em>Furr, </em>and it would have the perverse effect of exposing a juvenile, charged as a youthful offender, to harsher punishment when he reoffends than an identically situated adult. The judge\u2019s ruling is not reconcilable with <em>Furr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Foreman also argues that the evidence before the grand jury did not warrant the \u00a7 10G portion of the indictment because his prior conviction of armed robbery involved use of a knife, not a gun. The definition of \u201cweapon\u201d in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, he points out, is \u201cany rifle, shotgun or firearm.\u201d St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 8. By the explicit terms of \u00a7 121, however, its definitions apply only to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 122-13IP, and not to other definitions within the section itself. The definition of violent crime in \u00a7 121 uses \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d in the general, common-law sense, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 825, 828 n.5 (2003), in which a knife is commonly thought of as a deadly weapon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prater, </em>431 Mass. 86, 96 (2000) (\u201cour cases treat those felonies involving the use of a deadly weapon, such as a knife or a loaded gun, as inherently dangerous\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Claudio, </em>418 Mass. 103, 108 (1994). Moreover, if \u201cweapon\u201d as used in the definition of violent crime were restricted to \u201crifles, shotguns, and firearms,\u201d the term \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d in that same definition would require us to differentiate between deadly shotguns and nondeadly shotguns and between deadly firearms and nondeadly firearms \u2014 a result we doubt the Legislature intended. In the context of the incorporating statute, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G, the common-law definition of deadly weapon best comports with the statute\u2019s purpose of enhancing penalties for those who violate gun laws having previously been convicted of violent crimes or serious drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Analogous reasoning disposes of Foreman\u2019s contention that the restrictive definition of conviction in \u00a7 121 should control use of that word in \u00a7 10G.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Legislature chose to incorporate in \u00a7 10G only \u00a7 121\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent crime,\u201d not its definition of \u201cconviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We recognize that certain licensing statutes \u2014 see, e.g., G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 129B(1)(i), 131(d)(i), 131F(i) \u2014 use the phrase \u201cconvicted or adjudicated a youthful offender or delinquent child,\u201d and \u00a7 10G does not. The reason, however, is that the licensing statutes are expressly subject to the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>conviction in \u00a7 121. There is no similar constraint on use of the word in \u00a7 10G, where, as held in <em>Furr, </em>it is explicit in the section\u2019s use of the term \u201cviolent crime\u201d that it reaches juvenile adjudications as well as adult convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The order dismissing the armed career criminal portion of the indictment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The definition of violent crime in \u00a7 121 is: \u201c[A]ny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or possession of a deadly weapon that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult, that: (i) has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force or a deadly weapon against the person of another; (ii) is burglary, extortion, arson or kidnapping; (iii) involves the use of explosives; or (iv) otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d G.
