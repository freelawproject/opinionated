L. c. 258. We hold that the exemption in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(4), precludes recovery against the Commonwealth and affirm the ruling of a judge of the Superior Court dismissing the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number><em>Background. </em>On or about September 16, 1998, the plaintiff was arrested and taken into custody by an officer of the Somerville police department. At the booking, an inventory was taken of the plaintiff\u2019s personal property, which included two rings and a watch.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff was subsequently taken to Somerville District Court, where, according to a Somerville police department personal property inventory report, his personal property was transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">After his trial, acquittal, and release from custody, the plaintiff sought the return of his property. All of his property was returned except for the rings and the watch, which were never located. On September 12, 2000, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the city of Somerville, John Doe, and the Commonwealth, alleging that officers of the Commonwealth seized his property with an intent to exercise temporary control over it, but either lost or converted the property while he was in custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">A judge in the Superior Court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action against the Commonwealth on the ground that the Commonwealth had not waived its sovereign immunity under the Act\u2019s \u201cdetention of goods\u201d exception, \u00a7 10(d). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>General Laws, c. 258, \u00a7 10(d), exception. </em>The Commonwealth may not be sued unless its sovereign immunity has been waived. See <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dept. of Youth Servs., </em>388 Mass. 810, 812 (1983). The Act is such a waiver and grants subject matter jurisdiction to courts of the Commonwealth for claims against governmental entities, which historically have enjoyed sovereign immunity from such claims. General Laws c. 258, \u00a7 2, inserted by St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[pjublic employers shall be liable for . . . loss of property . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any public employee... in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>under like circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Act does not create any new theories of liability, but simply provides that tort actions brought against governmental entities are governed by the same theories of liability that apply to actions involving private parties. <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801, 804 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The two major purposes of the Act are \u201cto allow plaintiffs with valid causes of action to recover for harm suffered from public entities,\u201d and \u201cto preserve the stability and effectiveness of government by providing a mechanism which will result in payment of only those claims against government entities which are valid.\u201d <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>397 Mass. 775, 778 (1986). The Legislature has made clear that the Act \u201cshall be construed liberally.\u201d St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The Act\u2019s broad waiver of sovereign immunity is, however, subject to certain exceptions, including G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(d), as amended by St. 1993, c. 495, \u00a7 57, which bars <em>\u201cany claim </em>arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax, or the <em>lawful detention of any goods </em>or merchandise by any law enforcement officer\u201d (emphasis added). Neither the Supreme Judicial Court nor this court has determined whether \u201cany law enforcement officer\u201d under \u00a7 10(d) includes court officers. The plaintiff urges us to construe the foregoing language to cover only claims involving \u201cthe lawful seizure of money or goods connected to litigation initiated by the Commissioner of the Department of Revenue where a Court or statute has authorized the taking of property.\u201d The Commonwealth asks us to read the exception as a broad immunity from any and all claims originating from the lawful detention of property by any law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The starting point of our analysis of these competing interpretations must, of course, be the language of the statute. We assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used. Courts \u201c \u2018are constrained to follow\u2019 the plain language of a statute when its \u2018language is plain and unambiguous,\u2019 and its application would not lead to an \u2018absurd result,\u2019 or contravene the Legislature\u2019s clear intent.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>quoting from <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 253 (1998). See <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 584, 586 (2002) (when \u201cstatute is clear and unambiguous, [courts] construe the language in accordance with its plain and ordinary meaning\u201d). \u201cWhere a statute is ambiguous, we may look to extrinsic circumstances to determine the intent of the Legislature as to its meaning. Accordingly, \u2018[statutes are to be interpreted... in connection with their development, their progression through the legislative body, the history of the times, prior legislation, contemporary customs and conditions and the system of positive law of which they are part....\u2019\u201d <em>EMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>433 Mass. 568, 570 (2001), quoting from <em>Pacific Wool Growers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>305 Mass. 197, 199 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We find the interpretation urged by the Commonwealth to be persuasive. The language of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 <em>10(d), </em>is clear and unambiguous. Section 10(d)\u2019s broad language exempts from recovery <em>\u201cany </em>claim\u201d arising from the named conduct. \u201cAny\u201d in this context indicates \u201call\u201d or \u201cevery.\u201d See Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary 80 (3d ed. 1969). Accordingly, a public employer is not hable for \u201cany claim\u201d that falls into the delineated conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Further, when \u00a7 10(d)\u2019s phrase \u201carising in respect of\u201d is accorded its plain and ordinary meaning, it indicates that the claim \u201coriginates\u201d or \u201cstems\u201d from a certain type of conduct. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 115 (8th ed. 2004). Consequently, if the crux of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint refers to an incident or occurrence that originated from the type of conduct delineated in \u00a7 10(d), the action is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">We have long recognized that G. L. c. 258 is modeled closely on the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671 et seq. (2000). See <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 408, 414 (1987); <em>Harry Stoller &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>412 Mass. 139, 142-143 (1992). As such, Federal court decisions construing provisions of the FTCA are helpful in construing the Act. See <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>supra; <em>Sena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>417 Mass. 250, 255 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Section 2680(c) of the FTCA provides, in relevant part, that its general waiver of governmental immunity shall not apply to \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). The Federal government, therefore, is not liable for \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of. . . the detention of any goods ... by ... [a] law enforcement officer.\u201d In <em>Kosak </em>v. <em>United States, </em>465 U.S. 848, 854 (1984), the United States Supreme Court interpreted the phrase \u201carising in respect of\u201d broadly, stating that \u201c \u2018any claim arising in respect of\u2019 the detention of goods means any claim \u2018arising out of\u2019 the detention of goods, and includes a claim resulting from negligent handling or storage of detained property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The Court in <em>Kosak </em>v. <em>United States, </em>however, did not address whether the \u00a7 2680(c) exception applies to \u201claw enforcement officer[s]\u201d other than customs officials. <em>Ibid. </em>While the Federal courts do not provide clear guidance on this issue, the majority of Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals have read \u201c\u00a7 2680(c) expansively to include federal law enforcement officers beyond those who assess taxes or collect customs duties. See e.g., <em>Chapa </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice, </em>339 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir. 2003) ([Bureau of Prisons] officers); <em>Hatten </em>v. <em>White, </em>275 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir. 2002) ([Bureau of Prisons] officers); <em>Halverson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>972 F.2d 654, 656 (5th Cir. 1992) (Border Patrol officers); <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>972 F.2d 247, 248 (8th Cir. 1992) (drug task force agents); <em>Schrob </em>v. <em>Catterson, </em>948 F. 2d 1402, 1420 n. 16 (3d Cir. 1991) ([Drug Enforcement Administration] agents); <em>Schlaebitz </em>v. <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>924 F.2d 193, 195 (11th Cir. 1991) (U.S. Marshals); <em>Ysasi </em>v. <em>Rivkind, </em>856 F.2d 1520, 1525 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Border Patrol officers); <em>United States </em>v. <em>2,116 Boxes of Boned Beef, </em>726 F.2d 1481, 1491 (10th Cir. 1984) (USDA inspection agents).\u201d <em>Bramwell </em>v. <em>U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>348 F.3d 804, 806 (9th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 45 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Similar to the majority of the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals which interpret \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d in the FTCA expansively, we conclude that G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(if), should not be construed narrowly, as the plaintiff urges, to include only law enforcement officials engaged in tax or customs duties or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>who are authorized by court order to take custody of property or restrain the transfer of funds in civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">General Laws c. 258, \u00a7 <em>10(d), </em>operates as a broad grant of immunity from claims originating from the \u201clawful detention of any goods or merchandise by any law enforcement officer.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s suit is such a claim. Where property is lost as a result of negligence of court officers, the Commonwealth is immune because any such loss arose in relation to or out of the lawful detention of property by law enforcement officers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">2. <em>General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 3, claim. </em>The plaintiff also argues that the judge erred in concluding that G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was inapplicable to the facts of this case. He argues that there is no support in the record for the claim that the loss of his merchandise was attributable to court officers and not the officials of the facilities at which he was held. The record, he says, simply reflects the fact that his property was retained when the Commonwealth took custody of his items and not returned to him upon his release; therefore, the Commonwealth, through its correctional system, is responsible for his loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The judge properly ruled that G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 3, had no application to this case because the record does not support a claim that the plaintiff\u2019s property was missing as a result of actions by officials of a \u201ccorrectional institution.\u201d See G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Moreover, the Legislature has made clear that the Act supersedes any contradictory law. See St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>(\u201cAny other provision of law inconsistent with any other provisions of [the Act] shall not apply\u201d). General Laws c. 258, \u00a7 10(d), therefore, supersedes any contradictory statutory provisions. The Act provides the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy in tort against the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">3. <em>Waiver. </em>Finally, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of the immunity accorded by G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(d), has been waived because it was untimely. As the statutory exceptions contained in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10, define the scope of the jurisdiction granted by the Act, the applicability of \u00a7 10(d) relates to subject matter jurisdiction. Consequently, a \u00a7 10 defense is jurisdictional.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>J.A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 789, 793 (1986) (Commonwealth\u2019s abrogation of sovereign immunity is treated as consent to jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Although no Massachusetts case directly addresses the issue whether a defense under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10, can be waived, it is well established that a defense of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by the parties and may be raised for the first time on appeal or may even be raised by a court sua sponte. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>440 Mass. 147, 151 (2003). Compare <em>Chapa </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice, supra </em>at 389 (defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680[c] was not waivable and could be raised at any stage of proceedings). Consequently, the judge correctly ruled that the \u00a7 10(d) defense can be raised at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The plaintiff alleges that the total value of the property is approximately $230,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">On January 26, 2001, the complaint against John Doe was dismissed, and on June 3, 2003, summary judgment was allowed on behalf of the city of Somerville.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The Commonwealth is a \u201cpublic employer\u201d as defined in G.

L. c. 125, \u00a7 1, inserted by St 1972, c. 777, \u00a7 8, defines \u201ccorrectional institution\u201d as a \u201ccorrectional facility\u201d and \u201ccorrectional facility\u201d as \u201cany building, enclosure, space or structure used for the custody, control and rehabilitation of committed offenders and of such other persons as may be placed in custody therein in accordance with law.\u201d Here, however, the plaintiff was an arrestee, not a committed offender, and was not placed in the custody of a correctional facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Similarly, to the extent the plaintiff alleges a claim of bailment sounding in tort, his sole remedy against the Commonwealth is under the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Unlike, for example, a defense of improper presentment under G.
