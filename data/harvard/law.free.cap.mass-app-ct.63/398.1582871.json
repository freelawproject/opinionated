L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, and from the denial of their postjudgment motions for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">In her appeal, the mother chiefly challenges the ultimate finding of her unfitness as unsupported by the requisite quantum of clear and convincing evidence. The father\u2019s argument on appeal is primarily that termination of his and the mother\u2019s parental rights are not in the best interests of the children. They both contend that entry of a permanent guardianship with respect to Gillian rendered the care and protection issues, as to her, moot. The parents also allege that the judge committed error by (1) admitting in evidence certain hearsay statements of Stephen accusing the father of sexual molestation; (2) failing to provide for posttermination visitation; and (3) failing to provide them with an evidentiary hearing relative to their motion for relief from judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\"><em>Procedural and factual background. </em>We recount the relevant facts, reserving certain details for our discussion. The Department of Social Services (department) filed a care and protection petition on September 28, 2000, alleging neglect of Gillian, who was bom on August 18, 1992, and Stephen, who was bom on April 1, 1995, as well as another sibling, Jake, who was bom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>in 1990. At that point, the department already had a long history of involvement with the parents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The mother, who was bom in 1967, was abused physically and emotionally by alcoholic parents and had been in therapy for eleven years with the same therapist. As a child, she had learning disabilities and was placed in special education classes. She currently receives Social Security disability benefits for depression, anxiety, epilepsy, and posttraumatic stress disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The mother exposed the children to a lengthy period of domestic violence, demonstrating an inability to protect the children from the father\u2019s abuse. She also physically abused the children. Although the mother participated in parenting classes provided by the department, and was assisted by a parenting aide, she was unable to internalize the lessons she learned.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The father, who was bom in 1968, currently receives Social Security disability benefits for depression. He developed behavioral problems at age five after his father died in an industrial accident, and attended a residential school for children with behavioral problems, where he lived in a group home between 1977 and 1981. The father had been physically and emotionally abusive to the mother and the children before they were taken into custody by the department. The record discloses several acts of domestic violence by the father against the mother and the children, including incidents in which he left bruises on them by kicking and hitting them in the legs and head. These actions led to several G. L. c. 209A orders being issued against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Despite her abusive treatment, Gillian is a bright child with mostly minor behavioral issues. At the time of the trial, Gillian had been living with her aunt since the spring of 2001 and expressed a desire to remain there. Stephen suffers from attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and, as a result of his abusive treatment, is emotionally fragile. In the summer of 2001, Stephen was placed at the Franciscans Children\u2019s Hospital for psychological evaluation and treatment. At the time of trial, he had been placed in a highly structured foster home where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>was doing well. He requires extensive special education services due to his behavioral problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">During the spring of 2001, the children\u2019s teachers complained about their behavior at school. When the children were picked up to visit the parents, they often yelled at each other, kicked the seats of the car, and threw objects. At other times they engaged in name calling, screaming, and swearing. The children were generally out of control during their visits with the mother, but well behaved during their visits with the father and well behaved for their paternal grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On the date the petition was filed, the judge awarded temporary custody of all three children<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the department. The parents waived their rights to a seventy-two hour hearing on October 2, 2000. On August 21, 2001, the children\u2019s paternal aunt filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 1, seeking appointment as Gillian\u2019s guardian. Temporary custody of Gillian was awarded to her under the supervision of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">A joint trial on the guardianship care and protection petitions ended on February 14, 2002, and on May 3, 2002, the judge allowed the aunt\u2019s petition for permanent guardianship of Gillian. She also stated the following: \u201cI have enough evidence that\u2019s credible and clear and convincing to terminate parental rights with regard to both Gillian and Stephen. I am not going to enter that decree today. However, I am going to note on the record that there is sufficient evidence.\u201d She made it clear that, while she had considered terminating parental rights in regard to Gillian, she had decided not to do so at that point. The judge noted that, although her usual practice was to dismiss the care and protection petition after the appointment of a permanent guardian, she chose not to do so in this matter \u201cbecause there was an ongoing issue of law that was not resolved by the guardianship, to wit, the termination of parental rights.\u201d It is unclear whether there was a final judgment as to custody in the care and protection case at that point. See note 4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>On December 20, 2002, the judge issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law. She found the parents unfit, committed Gillian and Stephen to the custody of the department, and terminated the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights with respect to Gillian. The judge further determined that there was sufficient evidence to terminate parental rights as to Stephen. She declined to do so, however, because the department\u2019s permanent plan for Stephen needed additional work. The decrees as to Gillian were appealed by the mother on January 2, 2003, and by the father on January 11, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">On May 22, 2003, the judge, satisfied with the department\u2019s permanent plan for Stephen, terminated the parental rights of both parents with respect to Stephen. The parents filed notices of appeal that same day. Thereafter, on diverse dates, the parents filed the following motions: a motion to dismiss the care and protection petition relative to Gillian; a motion to reopen the evidence; a motion for posttermination visitation; a motion for stay of judgment; and a motion for relief from judgment. These motions were all denied by the judge in her January 26, 2004, decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Termination of parental rights. </em>In termination proceedings, judges must decide whether a parent is capable of assuming the duties and responsibilities expected of a parent and if the termination of parental rights would be in the child\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 710 (1993). The judge is required to \u201carticulate specific and detailed findings in support of a conclusion that termination is appropriate, demonstrating that [the judge] has given the evidence close attention.\u201d <em>Adoption of Nancy, </em>443 Mass. 512, 514-515 (2005). <em>See Adoption of Frederick, </em>405 Mass. 1, 5 (1989). Such detailed findings are required because the termination of parental rights is an \u201cextreme step.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Petition of Dept. of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>391 Mass. 113, 119 (1984). Subsidiary findings must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>Care &amp; Protection of Laura, </em>414 Mass. 788, 793 (1993), and unless those findings are clearly erroneous, they will not be disturbed. <em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>414 Mass. 795, 799 (1993). \u201cWe review the judge\u2019s findings with substantial deference, recognizing her discretion to evaluate a witness\u2019s credibility and to weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Adoption of Nancy, supra </em>at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The standard for termination of parental rights involves a two-step analysis: first, a determination that a parent is unfit, and second, a determination that termination of the parental rights is in the best interests of the child. <em>Adoption of Ramona, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>61 Mass. App. Ct. 260, 265 (2004). The analysis is similar, but \u201creflect[s] different degrees of emphasis on the same factors.\u201d <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. 631, 641 (1975). The \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d is the finding of parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Adoption of Frederick, supra </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Once the judge determines that a parent is unfit, she must then ascertain \u201cwhether the parent\u2019s unfitness is such that it would be in the child\u2019s best interests to end all legal relations between parent and child.\u201d <em>Adoption of Nancy, </em>443 Mass. at 515. In deciding whether the best interests of the child will be served by issuing a decree terminating parental rights, a judge \u201cshall consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the child\u2019s parents . . . and shall also consider the plan proposed by the department or other agency initiating the petition.\u201d G. L. 210, \u00a7 3(c). Both parents argue that there is no evidence in the record that termination of their parental rights is in the best interests of either Gillian or Stephen, especially since Gillian has been placed with a family member. The parents have challenged a mere handful of the trial judge\u2019s ninety-three subsidiary findings as being unsupported by the record. Moreover, some of the challenges relate to matters that are inconsequential. For example, the parents challenge finding fifteen, which states that the mother secured five G. L. c. 209A orders against the father when in fact she obtained only three; the other two were obtained by the grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We need not review all of the parents\u2019 shortcomings and misdeeds set forth in detail in the judge\u2019s findings. The trial evidence focused on the severe abuse and neglect suffered by the children before they were placed in the care of the department.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The father\u2019s hostile and intimidating conduct toward the mother and the children, his acts of violence, and his other shortcomings have resulted in an inability to acknowledge and address the physical, emotional, and behavioral problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and the anxiety of the children. The mother lacks the parenting skills necessary to protect the children from abuse and also lacks the basic skills needed to provide the children with a home environment conducive to appropriate child rearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The judge concluded that neither parent had ever been able to meet the children\u2019s needs and, because that was unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, the best interests of the children would be served by terminating the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights. The record amply supports the judge\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">2. <em>Termination of parental rights and permanent guardianship. </em>The parents argue that the entry of a permanent guardianship on May 3, 2002, for Gillian brought the care and protection petition to conclusion. They contend that entry of the permanent guardianship rendered the care and protection issues moot and that, for jurisdiction over the same child to be regained, the department must file a new petition for care and protection. We do not agree that the judge\u2019s appointment of a permanent guardianship under a separate petition was, in effect, a resolution of the care and protection petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The appointment of the aunt on May 3, 2002, as Gillian\u2019s permanent guardian was the final judgment relative to the guardianship petition. However, that action did not dictate that the care and protection case be dismissed. As the judge noted, <em>supra </em>at 401, the care and protection petition had not been finally resolved. \u201c[T]ermination need not be a prerequisite to a permanency plan.\u201d <em>Adoption of Nancy, </em>443 Mass. at 518. The language of the care and protection statute permits the judge to issue more than one dispositional order, in addition to or instead of granting custody to the department, including allowing the child to remain in the custody of the guardian and terminating parental rights. Under the statute, the judge may make</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201cany . . . appropriate order with reference to the care and custody of the child as may be in his best interest including, but not limited to, <em>any one or more </em>[emphasis supplied] of the following: (1) It may permit the child to remain with his parents, guardian, or other custodian. . . . (4) It may enter an order to dispense with the need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>consent of any person named in section 2 of chapter 210, to the adoption, custody, guardianship or other disposition of the child named therein... [in accordance with] the standards set forth in section 3 of . . . chapter 210.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, as amended by St. 1999, c. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9. The judge here made \u201cappropriate order[s]\u201d with respect to Gillian.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Earlier amendments made by the Legislature to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, inserted by St. 1998, c. 14, \u00a7 1, and G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, inserted by St. 1998, c. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, had extended a judge\u2019s authority to enter an order dispensing with the need for a parent\u2019s consent not only to a child\u2019s adoption, but \u201cto any legal proceeding affecting a child\u2019s custody, guardianship or other disposition.\u201d <em>Adoption of Willow, </em>433 Mass. 636, 645 (2001). Prior to the amendments, a decree allowing a petition of the department to terminate the parental rights to consent to the adoption of the child named in the petition terminated a parent\u2019s right of consent only with respect to the adoption of the child. <em>Ibid. </em>If, however, the department\u2019s plan for a child changed from adoption during the course of or after the trial, the department was required to file a separate petition. <em>Id. </em>at 645-646. See <em>Adoption of Reid, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 343 (1995). The current statute provides for a greater range of placement options and for multiple \u201corders,\u201d and the department is no longer required to retry a parent\u2019s unfitness multiple times. See <em>Adoption of Nancy, </em>443 Mass. at 517; <em>Adoption of Willow, supra </em>at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The Legislature surely did not contemplate that, when a permanent guardian is appointed after a joint trial on the guardianship and the termination of parental rights, the department would be required to begin the process anew. Compare <em>Adoption of Willow, </em>433 Mass. at 647-648. The best interests of the children would not be served by requiring the department to \u201cinitiate multiple, repetitious litigation,\u201d which would delay the eventual adoption or other disposition of the children into a proper environment. <em>Adoption of Helen, </em>429 Mass. 856, 862 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">3. <em>Evidentiary matters. </em>The father contends that the judge failed to comply with the statutory requirements of G. L. c. 233, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u00a7 82,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> before admitting in evidence Stephen\u2019s out-of-court statements that he was sexually molested by the father. He alleges that the evidence failed to establish that Stephen was unavailable and that his statements of sexual abuse were reliable. However, prior to the admission of Stephen\u2019s allegation of sexual contact by the father, the judge held a separate hearing. She heard the testimony of Dr. Roberta Conant,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a psychologist with expertise in the treatment of psychological trauma and sexual abuse, that Stephen would suffer psychological harm if forced to testify at the trial and was, therefore, unavailable. She also heard testimony regarding sexualized behavior that Stephen exhibited. In court after trial, the judge adopted the reasons set forth in the department\u2019s memorandum for finding Stephen unavailable and for allowing in evidence the statements made to three department witnesses. She stated in court, and noted in her decision, that a separate appendix attached to her decision would address her findings. There is no such appendix in the record. In her decision after trial, she included the statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>and found that they were reliable based on the consistent repetition of them by Stephen.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">However, even if the admission of Stephen\u2019s statements was erroneous, it was not prejudicial. The judge included the statements in her findings but specifically noted that \u201cit [the allegation of sexual abuse by the father] would not have to be believed for parental rights to be terminated.\u201d Thus, there is no need to address the inadequacies in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">4. <em>Other issues. </em>We next address the remaining four issues raised by the parents in their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">a. <em>Parents\u2019 visitation. </em>The parents claim that the judge erred in failing to provide for posttermination visitation between themselves and the children and visitation between the siblings. The judge was correct in denying the parents\u2019 requests for post-termination visits made after the decrees had entered. The parents had the opportunity to raise and preserve the issue prior to the termination of their parental rights, but failed to do so. The issue is, therefore, waived. See <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 712 (1993).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They lacked standing once their parental rights were terminated. <em>Adoption of Helen, supra </em>at 856 (parent\u2019s right to litigate custody issues related to the child ends when parental rights terminated). Therefore, authority to determine visits, based upon the needs of the children, has been left, appropriately, with the guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">b. <em>Sibling visitation. </em>The parents did not raise the issue of sibling visitation at trial, and thus, that issue is waived. See <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. at 712. The children, however, do have recourse to the courts to seek visits with their siblings. See <em>Adoption of Pierce, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 342, 347-348 (2003). General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 26, provides for sibling visitation for a child who is in the care of the department with his or her siblings when it is \u201creasonable and practical\u201d and in the \u201cbest interests of the child.\u201d The statute also provides for visitation if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the siblings are subsequently separated through other placements. <em>Ibid. </em>Periodic reviews of such visitation are provided for children, such as Stephen, who are in the care of the department, and children who are over twelve, such as Gillian, may request visitation with their siblings. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial judge did not initially order visits between the siblings, but subsequently, such visits have been resumed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">c. <em>Lack of evidentiary hearing on the adoption plan for Stephen. </em>We also find the parents\u2019 argument that the judge erred in approving the adoption plan for Stephen without holding an evidentiary hearing to be without merit. On December 20, 2002, the judge issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in which she reaffirmed that both parents were unfit and, further, that she had reviewed sufficient evidence upon which to terminate their parental rights with respect to Stephen. However, she declined to do so because the department failed to produce sufficient evidence of its permanent plan for him. The department filed a plan in April, 2003, and the parents filed objections with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">On April 25, 2003, the judge set the matter for hearing on May 22, 2003, and notified the parties that she would hear evidence on that date. The parents, however, were not prepared to proceed on the day of the hearing and requested a continuance. Their request was denied by the judge, who expressed concern with the length of time that had passed without resolving the matter as to Stephen, especially in view of the legislative policy for speedy resolution of such matters. The decision on whether to continue any judicial proceeding is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the judge, and the judge\u2019s decision will be upheld absent an abuse of that discretion. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Quinn, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 117, 120 (2002). The record does not support a claim that the judge abused her discretion on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">d. <em>Motion for relief from judgment. </em>Although the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply in termination of parental rights case, we proceed by analogy to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974). <em>Adoption of Reid, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 341. After the judge terminated parental rights with respect to Stephen on May 22, 2003, the parents filed motions to reopen the evidence<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and for relief from judgment. Both motions were denied by the judge without an evidentiary hearing. It is well-established that while a judge may hold an evidentiary hearing regarding postjudgment motions in a termination of parental rights case, she is not required to do so. <em>Adoption of Marc, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 798, 800 (2000). We discern no abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Finally, with regard to the merits of the motion for relief from judgment, the judge explicitly detailed her reasons for denying it. The mother, by affidavit, supported her request with facts that we summarize as follows. On July 26, 2002, less than three months after the entry of the permanent guardianship, the aunt returned Gillian to live with the mother. Apparently the guardian\u2019s companion had become abusive toward Gillian. Neither the guardian nor the mother informed the department, the judge, or Gillian\u2019s teachers of that development. Gillian continued to live with the mother until May, 2003, when the mother sent Gillian to live with her paternal grandmother. The mother contends that she has (1) maintained custody of Gillian for ten months without problems, (2) been in compliance with her service plan, (3) learned a great deal from her parenting classes, and (4) maintained a restraining order against her husband. These facts, she contends, present a sufficient basis to warrant relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>However, the affidavit also disclosed that Gillian informed the mother of incidents of domestic violence between the guardian and her boyfriend, incidents that were not reported to the department by the mother until she filed the motion for relief from judgment. If she had informed the department sooner, it would have been clear that Gillian was no longer living with her guardian but, rather, was living with her mother. In addition, Gillian was having problems in school. The mother was aware of the problems, but again did not report them to the school because she did not want it known that Gillian was living with her. Though the mother stated that she maintained a restraining order against the father, there was no indication that she enforced that order. Indeed, while Gillian was living with her mother, there were indications that the father was still a presence in the mother\u2019s and, thus, Gillian\u2019s life. The judge found that, rather than addressing the problems that arose with Gillian, the mother and guardian acted \u201cto conceal or misrepresent in order to avoid scrutiny.\u201d She concluded that \u201cthe parental behaviour reflected in the Affidavit is the very kind of behaviour that contributed to the original adjudication, permanent custody order and guardianship. It does not present a sufficient basis, even if proven at an evidentiary hearing, to \u2018warrant relief\u2019 from judgement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">A judge\u2019s denial of such a rule 60(b) motion is within her discretion and is entitled to great deference by a reviewing court. <em>Adoption of Marc, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 800-801. It will not be reversed on appeal except on a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the judge abused her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The judge confronted and resolved the relevant factors to be considered when ruling on a motion under rule 60(b)(6): whether the circumstances were so extraordinary as to warrant relief; whether the parents presented a \u201cmeritorious\u201d contention; and whether the \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of other parties would be adversely affected by granting the motion. <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. 809, 815 (1983). <em>See. Adoption of Reid, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The judge expressly concluded that the mother\u2019s affidavit highlighted many of the issues amounting to parental unfitness present at the trial and that the affidavit failed to establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>there was any sufficient change in the mother\u2019s circumstances in light of the extensive evidence presented at trial. In her decision, the judge carefully distinguished the cases cited by the parents in support of their motion. See <em>Adoption of Rhona, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 479 (2003); <em>Adoption of Theodore, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 355 (1994). In those cases, the original findings focused on a particular failing of the parent that appeared to have been remedied in the intervening years following the decrees. For example, in <em>Rhona, supra </em>at 482-486, the judge\u2019s primary reason for dispensing with consent to adoption was the mother\u2019s persistent drug use; however, during the trial and thereafter, the mother remained drug free, in total for a period of six years, a major change of circumstances. In <em>Theodore, supra </em>at 356-357, the only basis for dispensing with the mother\u2019s consent was her inability to break off her relationship with an abusive husband and to protect her child. The mother there later obtained a divorce and a rehearing was warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 357-358. This case is distinguishable in that the termination of parental rights was not based on any one failing of the mother, but rather numerous failings, none of which have substantially changed since trial. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\n<em>Decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\n<em>Orders denying motion for relief from judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The department was involved even before the birth of the parents\u2019 first child, Sam, who was bom on October 30, 1988. Sam is in the guardianship of the maternal grandmother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The case regarding Jake was resolved prior to the trial regarding Gillian and Stephen. On February 27, 2001, a guardianship petition was filed for Jake and a permanent guardianship of Jake was granted to his paternal grandmother. The care and protection petition relative to Jake was dismissed in the spring of 2001 and is not under appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In her memorandum of decision, the judge ruled sua sponte that the parents\u2019 appeals were untimely as to the \u201cadjudication and permanent custody orders\u201d and findings that the parents were unfit and that the children were in need of care and protection. She reasoned that the entry of those items on the docket on May 3, 2002, precluded the parents from contesting them in their later appeals from the decrees terminating their parental rights on December 20, 2002, as to Gillian, and on May 22, 2003, as to Stephen. Given the ambiguous nature of the judge\u2019s in-court statements and the docket entries, it would not be unreasonable to conclude that there was no appealable judgment as of May 3, 2002. <em>Adoption of </em>Carlos, 413 Mass. 339, 344-346 (1992); <em>Adoption of Karla, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 64, 66 (1998). Even if there was an appealable judgment on May 3, 2002, as to permanent custody, the parents here were not required to appeal at that point to preserve their rights to appeal the finding of unfitness when their parental rights were terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">As our courts have repeatedly stated, determinations as to unfitness and to the best interests of the child \u201care not separate and distinct but cognate and connected.\u201d <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. 631, 641 (1975). <em>Adoption of Nancy, </em>443 Mass. at 515. In <em>Nancy, supra </em>at 516, the court determined that separate findings as to the best interests of the child were not required where the findings as to unfitness were detailed and specific, which demonstrated that the judge had paid close attention to the evidence and the G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3(c), factors. Here, as well, the finding of unfitness cannot be separated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>from the findings as to the best interests of the children. In addition, the parents did not have the same incentive to appeal from any such prior adjudication, from which, for example, they could seek review and redetermination, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, as they did from the termination of their parental rights. <em>See Adoption of Frederick, </em>405 Mass. 1, 6 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\">\u201cUnless the [parents\u2019] legal relation to [their] children is terminated, [they] would be entitled to receive notice of all proceedings affecting the welfare of the children, to petition every six months \u2018for review and redetermination\u2019 of their current needs, and to participate in an annual permanency planning hearing.

As such, a judge must consider issues of domestic violence and its effect upon the children as well as a parent\u2019s fitness. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Lillith, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 139 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b437-5\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 82, states as follows: <em>\u201c(a) </em>the out-of-court statements of a child under the age of ten describing any act of sexual contact performed on or with the child, the circumstances under which it occurred, or which identifies the perpetrator shall be admissible as substantive evidence in any civil proceeding, . . . provided, however, that such statement is offered as evidence of a material fact and is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; the person to whom such statement was made or who heard the child make such statement testifies; the judge finds pursuant to subsection (b) that the child is unavailable as a witness; and the judge finds pursuant to subsection (c) that such statement is reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\"><em>\u201c(b) </em>The proponent of such statement shall demonstrate a diligent and good faith effort to produce the child and shall bear the burden of showing unavailability.
