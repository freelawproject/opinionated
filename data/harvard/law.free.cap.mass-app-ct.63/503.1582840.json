L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H. She now seeks to withdraw that guilty plea on two main bases: (1) she was not advised that she could be required to register as a sex offender; and (2) she was not given the opportunity to withdraw her \u201cdefense-capped\u201d plea after the judge indicated he would exceed the defendant\u2019s sentencing recommendation. In addition, she argues she should be permitted to withdraw her plea because she was not informed, as required by Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c)(3)(B), 378 Mass. 868 (1979), of the possibility of being subject to additional punishment under the sexually dangerous person provisions of the General Laws. See note 3, <em>infra. </em>She also asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. For the following reasons, we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The facts, in brief, are these. The defendant was working as a prostitute and was approached by an undercover police officer. He asked if she \u201cwas working.\u201d In the process of their negotiations, the defendant several times invited the officer to touch her breasts. She then placed her hands on the officer\u2019s genital area. This formed the basis for the indecent assault and battery charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The defendant claims first that she should be permitted to withdraw her guilty plea because she was not informed that she could be required to register as a sex offender. The mandate that a defendant be informed that she could be required to register derives from G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E(d), as appearing in St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2, which provides, \u201cAny court which accepts a plea for a sex offense shall inform the sex offender prior to acceptance and require the sex offender to acknowledge, in writing, that such plea may result in such sex offender being subject to the provisions of sections 178C to 178P, inclusive.\u201d The last sentence of \u00a7 178E(d), however, states: <em>\u201cFailure to so inform the sex offender shall not be grounds to vacate or invalidate the </em>plea\u201d (emphasis supplied). Compare G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D (specifically permitting defendant to withdraw guilty plea if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>is not informed of certain possible immigration consequences of guilty plea and later faces such a consequence).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Generally, under Massachusetts law, failure to inform a defendant of collateral or contingent consequences of a plea does not render a plea involuntary. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 840, 843 (1989). The possibility of registration as a sex offender would be a contingent or collateral consequence of such a plea: minimum due process requires that a defendant be granted a hearing before being required to register as a sex offender, see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 137 (1997); thus, not only is the possibility that the defendant could be required to register as a sex offender an uncertainty, it is also a decision made not by the trial court, but by the sex offender registry board. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>428 Mass. 90, 91 (1998). The fact that an entity outside the court decides whether the defendant ultimately must register is the very definition of a collateral consequence. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraire, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 916, 918 (2002) (\u201cit is not the indeterminate nature of immigration consequences that makes them collateral in nature; it is the fact that such consequences are handed down by a body entirely separate from the court that accepts the guilty plea\u201d). General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 29D, which requires that information as to possible immigration consequences be given a defendant before a plea is accepted, carves out an exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the general rule on collateral consequences by permitting a defendant who was not given the required warning and faces such a consequence to withdraw the plea. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraire, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. at 918. The statute in question here, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E(d), however \u2014 as we have seen \u2014 while requiring that a defendant entering a plea to a sex offense be informed of \u00a7\u00a7 178O to 178P, specifically provides that failure to so warn is not a ground to invalidate the plea. Although it may appear anomalous to require such a warning but to provide that no consequence follows if the requirement is not met, we are constrained by the wording of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">2. The defendant next argues that she should be permitted to withdraw her guilty plea because the judge exceeded the defendant\u2019s requested sentence but never gave the defendant an opportunity to withdraw her plea. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18; Dist./Mun.Cts.R.Crim.P. 4(c) (1996). See also Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c), as amended, 399 Mass. 1215 (1987).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This argument fails for the reason, if no other, that the defendant had not actually pleaded guilty at the time the judge announced what his sentence would be. The actual plea colloquy did not begin until the judge announced what his sentence would be. It was only <em>after </em>the conclusion of the colloquy that the defendant tendered her plea.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is made clear by the transcript of the plea hearing itself, wherein the judge, after indicating what his sentence would be, obtaining agreement from the prosecutor (who had recommended a more severe sentence), and stating that he would hand down his decided-upon sentence, then proceeded to engage in a colloquy with the defendant. It is apparent from this colloquy that the defendant had every opportunity to decide not to plead guilty, but instead chose to do so. In almost all instances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the judge\u2019s statements during the colloquy were couched in the subjunctive, e.g., <em>\u201cif </em>you plead guilty . . . .\u201d After the judge\u2019s announcement of what his sentence would be, his thorough colloquy with the defendant, and the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of facts (which the defendant acknowledged were true), the judge asked the defendant, \u201cDo you plead guilty willingly, freely, and voluntarily?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The judge then asked several more questions to make certain the defendant\u2019s understanding and agreement with the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">At the hearing on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the judge (who was the same judge who had accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea) commented, \u201cAll parties should be aware of the fact that I am very familiar with this case,\u201d and stated further, \u201cThere was a lengthy period of time spent discussing the tender of plea with [defense counsel] and you see some inaudible indications on the side. I recall telling [defense counsel] to make sure that his client was aware of the ramifications of her tender of her plea. She [i.e., the defendant] chose to do that at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">3. Finally, we find no merit in the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The defendant\u2019s assertion that she had a valid defense \u2014 consent \u2014 to the charge of indecent assault and battery is without merit in the circumstances of this case. Here, neither the facts admitted to nor the more expanded version of the facts in the police report suggest that the undercover officer consented to the touching. The mere fact that the undercover officer asked the defendant if she \u201cwas working\u201d does not mean that he consented to having his genitals touched. According to the description of the incident in the police report, after the undercover officer asked if she was working, the defendant asked him to grab her breasts. He refused, saying the area was too public. The defendant then \u201cgrabbed the officer by placing her hand on his crotch and squeezing.\u201d Since the facts support a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim did not consent to the touching, it is unlikely that the defendant was deprived of a \u201csubstantial ground of defence\u201d in that respect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Further, counsel was not ineffective in allegedly failing to inform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>defendant that she could be subject to sex offender registration. As we have stated, such a potential consequence remains collateral in nature; therefore, counsel was not constitutionally ineffective, since it is unlikely (as discussed above) that counsel\u2019s performance deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defense. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Indelicato, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 944, 945 (1996) (counsel not ineffective despite rendering misleading advise as to collateral consequence of guilty plea); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraire, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 918 (because defendant not entitled to any warning as to collateral consequences beyond that mandated by statute, counsel not ineffective for failing to give additional warning). In brief, the defendant received all to which she was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion to withdraw guilty plea and for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">She also pleaded guilty, on the same day, to negotiating sex for a fee. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53A. That plea is not at issue in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In prior times, perhaps her attorney would have entered the defense of \u201cmolliter manus imposuit\u201d (\u201che [or she] [only] gently laid hands upon\u201d the victim), a term \u201cused in actions of trespass and assault to justify a defendant\u2019s use of force as reasonable.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1021 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The defendant also relies in part on Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c)(3)(B), which provides that prior to tender of a guilty plea, a defendant must be informed \u201cof any different or additional punishment based upon . . . sexually dangerous persons provisions of the General Laws, if applicable.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rodriguez, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 572, 580-581 (2001). The portion of the rule relied on, however, is directed to situations where a defendant may face involuntary commitment pursuant to G. L. c. 123A and, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, does not speak to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C - 1780 (the Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act). Moreover, although indecent assault and battery is included in the \u201csexual offense[s]\u201d listed in the definitions in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant meets the remaining portion of the definition of \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d set out in that section. Therefore, it seems unlikely that advisement of the possibility of proceedings pursuant to c. 123A would have made any difference in the decision to plead guilty. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 718 (1997) (defendant must show that alleged omission made a difference in decision to plead guilty).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\">See now Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c), as amended, 442 Mass. 1511 (2004), applicable to cases under indictments or complaints filed on or after September 7, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Our interpretation of the plea hearing is guided by the transcript of the recorded proceedings of the plea hearing supplemented, for parts marked \u201cinaudible\u201d or \u201cunintelligible,\u201d by what is captioned in the appendix as an \u201cunofficial\u201d transcript, apparently prepared by the parties, which the judge at the motion hearing (who was also the plea judge) described as \u201cpretty accurate.\u201d See generally Mass.R.A.P. 8(b)(3)(v), 388 Mass. 1106 (1983), and 8(c)-(e), 378 Mass. 932 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
