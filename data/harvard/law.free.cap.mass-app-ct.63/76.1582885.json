L. c. 265, \u00a7 13F. We conclude that the evidence in the present case was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction. We also reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial judge abused his discretion in finding the victim competent to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">The term \u201cmentally retarded\u201d is not defined in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13F. We accordingly look to the term\u2019s \u201cusual and accepted meaning!],\u201d so long as it is \u201cconsistent with the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>442 Mass. 118, 124 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Zone <em>Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1938 (2002) defines the term \u201cretarded\u201d as \u201cslow or limited in intellectual development, in emotional development, or in academic progress.\u201d In a regulation promulgated by the Department of Mental Retardation (DMR), 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01 (1994), mental retardation is said to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201cmanifested by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skills areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure and work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">A DMR service coordinator testified at trial that the victim was eligible to receive services from DMR, and that only persons with an IQ level below 76 were so eligible. The witness further testified that the victim\u2019s IQ was significantly below that threshold, having tested at 33 in 1959 (at age 10) and at 27 in 1962, and that she required assistance with virtually all of her basic life skills, including managing her money, making and keeping medical appointments, and even keeping track of the days of the week. Given the severe impairment of the victim\u2019s mental function, it is of no consequence that the evidence did not include testimony by an expert psychiatric witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The Commonwealth also presented sufficient evidence that the defendant was aware that the victim was retarded. The defendant assaulted the victim in her room on the first floor of a group home managed by DMR and the Massachusetts Association for the Blind. According to the DMR service coordinator, all of the residents of that group home were mentally retarded. The defendant had been employed at the group home for approximately five years at the time of the assault, and testified that his <em>duties </em>included caring for mentally retarded patients and that he had received training in the care of mentally retarded patients. Finally, the victim testified extensively at trial, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>jury were able from their observations of her to assess both the question of her mental retardation and the likelihood that the defendant was aware of it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderick, </em>411 Mass. 817, 819 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The victim\u2019s retardation was, in fact, sufficiently pronounced that the defendant claims error in the determination by the trial judge that she was competent to testify at trial. However, the trial judge holds broad discretion to make that determination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 656 (1980). Mentally handicapped or insane persons may be competent to testify. See <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>May, </em>10 Allen 59, 64 (1865); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zelenski, </em>287 Mass. 125, 129 (1934). The question whether to order a psychiatric examination is likewise left to the discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 444 (1980). The trial judge conducted a thorough voir dire examination of the victim, and we discern no basis to disturb his conclusion that she possessed the requisite mental \u201ccapacity to observe, remember, and give expression to that which she has seen, heard, or experienced.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatisos, </em>238 Mass. 322, 325 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The defendant made no objection at trial to the testimony of the DMR service coordinator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support a conclusion that he committed an indecent assault and battery rests on his claim that there was no evidence of the assault other than the victim\u2019s testimony. The victim\u2019s testimony, of course, provides sufficient direct evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 23-24 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiRusso, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 240-241 (2003). The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 936, 937 (1990), overlooks the fact that the victim\u2019s testimony in that case did not directly establish whether the defendant\u2019s threat of force occurred prior to or concurrently with the sexual assault. Here the victim\u2019s testimony, if credited, directly established that the defendant committed an indecent assault and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
