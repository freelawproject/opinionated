L. c. 138, \u00a7 34 (furnishing alcohol to a person under twenty-one), means precisely that. As such, the defendant, a young college student with no criminal record, will serve a jail sentence, the sadness of which is overshadowed by the death of a sixteen year old child struck by another to whom the defendant furnished alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant pleaded guilty to one count of violating G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, for furnishing alcoholic beverages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>to a person under twenty-one years of age, and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, six months to be served and the balance suspended. On appeal, the defendant argues (1) that his conviction must be reversed because the statute does not apply to persons under twenty-one years old; and (2) that the trial court erred when it accepted a plea to a crime that did not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><em>Facts. </em>On January 7, 2003, the defendant, a nineteen year old freshman at Syracuse University, was spending his winter break at his parent\u2019s home in Newburyport. His parents were not home that evening, and after collecting money from three friends, each also nineteen years old, he drove to Seabrook, New Hampshire, and purchased a case of beer from a convenience store. The defendant returned to Newburyport, and he and his friends drank the beer until the defendant\u2019s mother phoned, telling him of her imminent arrival. The group prepared to meet elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The defendant had anticipated driving and had therefore not consumed as much alcohol as the others. As they prepared to leave, he noticed that his friend, William White, was too drunk to drive and offered to drive him. White had drunk eight to ten beers at the defendant\u2019s house in addition to red wine that he had earlier consumed. Refusing to heed the defendant\u2019s warnings that he should not drive, White drove off alone. Soon after, he hit two pedestrians, sixteen year old Trista Zinck and seventeen year old Neil Bornstein, killing her and seriously injuring him. A week later, the defendant was charged with a violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34. He pleaded guilty to that charge on August 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">On August 8, 2003, the defendant, now with new counsel, filed a motion for postconviction relief under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30, as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), seeking release from imprisonment and/or a new trial. He argued that the guilty plea was constitutionally invalid because he did not know that the statute under which he was charged did not apply to him. The judge denied the motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a memorandum of decision, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cThe plain language of the statute is clear. Section 34 states that \u2018whoever\u2019 engages in the proscribed conduct shall be punished. Whoever is defined as \u2018whatever person\u2019 or \u2018whoever.\u2019 The defendant certainly falls into that category. There is no indication in the statute that it applies only to individuals 21 or over. Had the legislature intended that the statute appl[y] only to individuals 21 or over, the statute could very easily have been worded in that precise language.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We agree with that assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>The law. </em>General Laws c. 138, \u00a7 34, is a patchwork of several related, but distinct, provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At issue in this appeal is the so-called \u201cfurnishing\u201d provision, which the Legislature inserted deep into the existing text in 2000 as the result of an emergency act known as the Social Host Act. That provision states, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201c[W]hoever furnishes . . . alcohol for a person under 21 years of age shall be punished by a fine of not more than $2,000 or by imprisonment for not more than one year or both. . . . For the purpose of this section the word \u2018furnish\u2019 shall mean to knowingly or intentionally supply, give, or provide to or allow a person under 21 years of age except for the children and grandchildren of the person being charged to possess alcoholic beverages on premises or property owned or controlled by the person charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, inserted by St. 2000, c. 175. This portion of \u00a7 34 was enacted in response to public outcry over a series of drunk driving incidents that occurred after parties at private homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">\u201cWhoever\u201d is not specifically defined in this statute. A definition of \u201cwhoever,\u201d although no more helpful for our purposes, does appear in the definitions provision of the General Laws. There, \u201cwhoever,\u201d apparently interchangeable with the term \u201cperson,\u201d is defined only through the direction that it \u201cshall include corporations, societies, associations and partnerships.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, cl. twenty-third.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>The defendant\u2019s contention. </em>The defendant advances a multilayered argument that the furnishing provision of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, punishes only adults over the age of twenty-one for furnishing alcohol to those under twenty-one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the defendant to succeed, we must first agree with him that the term \u201cwhoever,\u201d as used in the statute, is ambiguous. If that hurdle is overcome, he directs us to the legislative history of \u00a7 34, where he suggests we will find a clear legislative intent to limit the class of offenders under the statute to persons twenty-one or older. To augment his argument, he further claims that the \u201cinternal consistency\u201d of \u00a7\u00a7 34, 34A, and 34C of G. L. c. 138, read as a whole,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> manifests a legislative intent that the applicable class of offenders was persons twenty-one or older,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the history of the furnishing amendment indicates an express intent not to alter this statutory scheme. As a fallback, the defendant argues that under the lenity rule, we must resolve any statutory ambiguity in his favor. The defendant concludes that as the furnishing provision of \u00a7 34 does not apply to persons under twenty-one, the trial court committed reversible error by accepting the defendant\u2019s guilty plea without a factual basis to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cIt is elementary that the meaning of a statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, ... the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>James J. Welch &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Deputy Commr. of Capital Planning &amp; Opera</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>tions, </em>387 Mass. 662, 666 (1982), quoting from <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We agree with the motion judge and the Commonwealth that the meaning of \u201cwhoever,\u201d as employed in \u00a7 34, is plain. \u201cWe derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). \u201cWhoever\u201d is defined as \u201cwhatever person: any person at all: no matter who.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2611 (2002). \u201cPerson,\u201d whose meaning is the same as \u201cwhoever\u201d under our statutory scheme, is defined as \u201can individual human being.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1686. No distinction is made between an \u201cadult\u201d person and a \u201cminor\u201d person. One could reasonably conclude, therefore, that when the Legislature used the term \u201cwhoever,\u201d without a qualifier, it intended it to apply to all persons, and not just those over twenty-one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The defendant insists that the statute should effectively be read \u201cwhoever, <em>being age twenty-one or over.\u201d </em>Suffice it to observe a bedrock rule of statutory construction that \u201c[a] court may not add words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Ct. Dept., </em>439 Mass. 352, 355 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u201cWhoever\u201d is a term commonly used in criminal statutes in this Commonwealth. General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 23, for instance, which deals with statutory rape, uses the term \u201cwhoever\u201d to describe the applicable class of persons punishable under the statute. No modifier follows \u201cwhoever,\u201d and it has been construed to pertain to persons under the age of fourteen. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter R., </em>414 Mass. 714, 717-719 (1993) (common-law presumption that a fourteen year old is incapable of committing rape invalid).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">When language is absent from a statute that the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>easily could have supplied, and in fact did supply in similar statutes, we can only conclude that the omission was intentional. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of- Worcester, </em>421 Mass. 117, 128 (1995). \u201cIf the Legislature intentionally omits language from a statute, no court can supply it.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>There are several other statutes that do, in fact, insert a qualifier after the term \u201cwhoever.\u201d See, e.g., G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 36A, inserted by St. 1963, c. 203 (\u201cWhoever, having arrived at the age of sixteen years\u201d); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, as amended by St. 1973, c. 925, \u00a7 77 (\u201cwhoever over the age of eighteen commits a second or subsequent offense\u201d). Even within c. 138, the Legislature specifically narrowed the class of offenders identified as \u201cwhoever\u201d or \u201cany person\u201d by inserting modifiers after those terms. See, e.g., G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34A, as amended through St. 1984, c. 312, \u00a7 6 (\u201cAny person under twenty-one years of age who purchases . . . alcoholic beverages . . . shall be punished\u201d); G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34C, as amended through St. 1992, c. 110 (\u201cWhoever, being under twenty-one years of age . . . knowingly possesses . . . any alcohol. . . shall be punished\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s argument that reading the provision in light of the entire statute requires a conclusion that the Legislature intended application only to persons twenty-one years or older. The defendant contends that G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, is \u201ca licensing statute,\u201d and that because a person must be twenty-one or older to hold a liquor license, the entirety of the statute therefore applies only to persons over twenty-one. We disagree. Whatever \u00a7 34\u2019s original purpose when enacted, it has evolved over the years and no longer applies only to licensees. As the Commonwealth asserts, the first clause of the second sentence of \u00a7 34 was amended in 1980 by striking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>phrase \u201cbeing licensed under this chapter,\u201d which had previously followed \u201cwhoever.\u201d See St. 1980, c. 193. Furthermore, the furnishing provision at issue here plainly is not limited to licensees, but imposes criminal punishment on \u201cwhoever.\u201d Thus, even when read in context, we find it untenable that only persons twenty-one or over were the sole intended class of offenders punishable under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Finally, it appears clear that the intent in passing this legislation was to hold persons criminally responsible for furnishing those under twenty-one with alcohol. The defendant\u2019s interpretation would create a loophole, permitting, for example, a twenty year old college student to hold a party in his dorm room or apartment and furnish alcohol there to those under twenty-one, a result the Legislature would hardly endorse. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 253 (1998).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u201cThe Legislature has granted substantial rights to and has placed substantial obligations on people who are nineteen years old.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Ganias, </em>417 Mass. 666, 667 (1994). A nineteen year old is \u201cold enough to vote, to make a valid will, to enter into valid contracts, to get married without parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>consent, to serve on a jury, to work on any job, for as many hours as he wished, to buy and carry a firearm,[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] and to be treated as an adult in the criminal justice system\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 667-668. To this list, the Legislature has added the responsibility of not furnishing alcohol to those under twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for post-conviction relief affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The defendant\u2019s sentence was stayed by a justice of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Most of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, concerns eligibility for licenses to sell alcoholic beverages, and the imposition of criminal penalties associated with selling or delivering alcoholic beverages to persons under age twenty-one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Commonwealth concedes in its brief that if we hold that persons under twenty-one cannot be punished under the furnishing provision of G. L. c. 13, \u00a7 34, the defendant would be entitled to a dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">See G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34 (licensing; establishments; sale, delivery or furnishing alcohol to persons under twenty-one; employment of persons under eighteen); \u00a7 34A (persons under twenty-one purchasing alcohol); \u00a7 34C (persons under twenty-one possessing, transporting or carrying alcohol).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">More specifically, the defendant argues that \u00a7\u00a7 34, 34A, and 34C of G. L. c. 138 were designed to \u201caddress the problem of the consumption of alcohol by minors.\u201d He observes that \u00a7 34A criminalizes the purchase of alcohol by persons under twenty-one, and that \u00a7 34C makes it a crime for a person under twenty-one to transport alcohol. The penalties for violation of those provisions, he points out, are far less severe than that in the furnishing provision. We should therefore conclude, according to the defendant, that only adults are subject to the more severe penalties of \u00a7 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">We note that \u201cadult\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, cl. fiftieth, inserted by St. 1973, c. 925, \u00a7 1, as \u201cany person who has attained the age of eighteen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Numerous other criminal statutes employ similar terminology. See, e.g., G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 197, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 925, \u00a7 53 (\u201cWhoever, himself or by his servant or agent, admits a child under fourteen to any licensed show or place of amusement. . . shall... be punished\u201d); G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 130, as amended through St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 38 (\u201cwhoever sells or furnishes to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>person under 21 years of age a firearm or large capacity rifle or shotgun or ammunition therefor shall have his license to sell firearms, rifles, shotguns, machine guns and or ammunition revoked . . . and shall be punished\u201d); G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 6, as amended by St. 1985, c. 345 (\u201cWhoever . . . not being his parent or guardian, gives a cigarette, chewing tobacco, snuff or tobacco in any of its forms to any person under the age of eighteen shall be punished\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b406-12\">There are circumstances, however, in which a strict reading of a statute leads to an absurd result. In such an instance, a deviation is justified so long as it \u201cpreserve[s] the substance of a statute rather than diminish[es] it.\u201d <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 309 (2000). See <em>Brittle </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>439 Mass. 580, 585 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We thus reject the defendant\u2019s contention that G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34 (furnishing alcohol), when read in conjunction with \u00a7 34A (purchasing alcohol) and \u00a7 34C (transporting alcohol), mandates a conclusion that it involves offenders twenty-one or over. Sections 34A and 34C by their explicit terms restrict potential defendants to those under twenty-one; conversely, \u00a7 34 has no such qualifier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The defendant does not argue that he did not control the property or premises in question, i.e., his home. He does argue that if he furnished the alcohol outside of his house, say at a park or the home of another, the statute would not apply; that \u00a7 34C (transporting alcohol, which carries a fine) would apply; and that it is thus unfair for \u00a7 34 to apply here given the potential for jail as opposed to merely a fine. The Commonwealth, at oral argument, conceded that the furnishing provision of \u00a7 34 is limited to the premises or property controlled by the one providing or furnishing the alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">As to the unfairness argument, that two statutes may punish similar conduct yet impose different penalties does not violate any rights of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, </em>391 Mass. 394, 397 (1984) (holding disparity of sentences proscribed by statutes for indecent exposure, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, and open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, not violative of due process); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>404 Mass. 282, 288 (1989) (\u201cThe fact that the same conduct could be prosecuted under two statutes, each with different maximum penalties, does not violate the notice requirements of due process\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">At the time of the decision in <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Ganias, </em>G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (license to carry a firearm), permitted persons eighteen and over to carry a firearm. The statute was subsequently amended in 1998, St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 41, increasing the age from eighteen to twenty-one. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. 171, 179 n.1 (2001). In contrast, an applicant for a firearm identification card need only be fifteen or older (with permission of his parent if under eighteen). G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
