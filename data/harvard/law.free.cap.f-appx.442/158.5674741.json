Because Rangel essentially seeks to reopen the time for filing a timely notice of appeal, he does not need a COA to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See Dunn v. Cockrell, </em>302 F.3d 491, 492-93 (5th Cir.2002). His motion for a COA is therefore DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-23\">When necessary, this court must sua sponte examine the basis of its jurisdiction. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Rangel\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, submitted for mailing on December 17, 2010, and directed to this court, if liberally construed, was sufficient to evince timely his intent to appeal from the denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Rule 60(b) motion filed in the district court. <em>See Bailey v. Cain, </em>609 F.3d 768, 765-66 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Eleby v. American Medical Systems, Inc., </em>795 F.2d 411, 412 (5th Cir.1986); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), (c), and (d). We, therefore, have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Rangel\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. Our review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>Eleby, </em>795 F.2d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Rangel renews his claim that the applicable limitations period for filing a timely notice of appeal is subject to equitable tolling, in light of <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010), and that he is entitled to equitable tolling because he was in transit when he was required to file a timely notice of appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. Rangel is mistaken. The time for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case is not subject to equitable tolling, and a timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite to appeal. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 213-14, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Moreover, the district court was without power to correct any error allegedly made by this court with respect to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"Ams\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rangel\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Eleby, </em>795 F.2d at 414. Rangel\u2019s appeal lacks any arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
