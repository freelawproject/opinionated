A hearing was held before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) to determine whether his injury was compensable. The ALJ found that he had sustained a permanent partial disability and awarded Ta-panes compensation for that disability. At the same time, the ALJ entertained POM-TOC\u2019s (and insurer Signal Mutual\u2019s) petition for relief under Section 8(f) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f), i.e., a limitation of liability for such compensation payments to 104 weeks, on the ground that Tapanes had sustained a heart attack six months earlier, in April 2005, and that his compen-sable rotator cuff disability was greater due to his disabling heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">Acting on a stipulated record, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) agreed, and held that POMTOC had proven, as Section 8(f) required, three elements: (1) Tapanes had a preexisting permanent partial disability (the heart condition) prior to injuring his rotator cuff; (2) POMTOC was aware of the preexisting condition, i.e., it was \u201cmanifest\u201d to POMTOC, prior to the occurrence of the work-related injury; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>(B) the preexisting disability made Ta-panes\u2019s disability due to the rotator cuff injury materially and substantially greater than it would have been without the preexisting condition. The Director appealed the ALJ\u2019s Section 8(f) decision to the Benefits Review Board, and the Board, addressing only the second element, reversed. <em>Reyland Tapanes v. POMTOC, </em>BRB No. 09-0661 (May 20, 2010) (unpub.) The Board concluded that because the only evidence before the ALJ of Tapanes\u2019s April 2005 heart attack was contained in medical records generated <em>after </em>the October 31, 2005 rotator cuff incident. Stated another way, there was no evidence in the record from which the ALJ could have ascertained that POMTOC \u201chad actual knowledge of [Tapanes\u2019s] heart attack pri- or to the work accident.\u201d After the Board denied POMTOC\u2019s motion to reconsider its decision, POMTOC and Signal Mutual petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In support of their petition, these petitioners argue that the Board overlooked the ALJ\u2019s reliance on Tapanes\u2019s deposition testimony, which established that Tapanes was absent from work for a month following his heart attack and that his cardiac disability was manifest to POMTOC. Ta-panes\u2019s deposition was not part of the record. Acknowledging this fact, petitioners argue alternatively that the case should be remanded to the ALJ for \u201cre-opening of the evidence; or for modification under Section 22 of the Act, so that any evidence deemed necessary may be submitted to further support the reinstatement of the [ALJ\u2019s] initial Decision.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Under the Act, the Board is constrained to accept an ALJ\u2019s findings of fact unless they are irrational or unsupported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. <em>Presley v. Tinsley Maintenance Serv., </em>529 F.2d 433, 436 (5th Cir.1976). If the record contains no evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings, the Board is free to reverse. <em>Director, OWCP v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>138 F.3d 134, 144 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">We agree with the Director that POM-TOC submitted no proof that it had knowledge, actual or constructive, of Tapanes\u2019s cardiac condition <em>before </em>Tapanes sustained his rotator cuff injury. The Board\u2019s decision and its order denying POMTOC\u2019s motion for reconsideration are, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
