He contends that the district court erred in not making findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to allow this court to review the decision. He also asserts that the court should have vacated the sentences imposed for his three vacated conspiracy convictions because it was without jurisdiction to impose them.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-21\">Although the district court did not address its jurisdiction, we must consider it, <em>sua sponte </em>if necessary. <em>See EEOC v. Agro Distribution, LLC, </em>555 F.3d 462, 467 (5th Cir.2009). Garcia was not entitled to relief through a motion for a writ of error <em>comm nobis, </em>because he is still in custody. <em>See United States v. Esogbue, </em>357 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2004). Because he is challenging his federal sentence, the district court should have construed his motion as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). That court lacked jurisdiction to do so, however, because Garcia had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>tion, and this court had not authorized the filing of a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Hooker v. Sivley, </em>187 F.3d 680, 681-82 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>388 Fed.Appx. 385, 386 (5th Cir.2010); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Garcia\u2019s appeal is \u201cfrom the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Therefore, the judgment is VACATED, and a judgment of dismissal for want of jurisdiction is RENDERED. Garcia\u2019s motion to remand for findings of fact and conclusions of law is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b962-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
