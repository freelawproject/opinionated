Juica challenges the 105-month term of imprisonment imposed by the district court, contending that the district court reversibly erred by applying a four-level enhancement for serious bodily injury pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(7)(B), which was based on evidence that several aliens were physically beaten and sexually abused while they were detained. Juica contends that there was insufficient evidence to establish that any beatings resulted in serious bodily injury as that term is defined under the Sentencing Guidelines. Juica further argues that even though sexual abuse constitutes serious bodily injury, the conduct should not be attributed to him in this case because it was not reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-22\">Juica did not argue in the district court that the physical beatings did not satisfy the definition of \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d Thus, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 188-89 (5th Cir.1994). The determination of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is a factual determination. <em>United States v. Garzar-Robles, </em>627 F.3d 161, 169 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Price, </em>149 F.3d 352, 353 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that the severity of an injury in a different guidelines context is a question of fact). The record as a whole supports a finding of \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d <em>See Garzar-Robles, </em>627 F.3d at 169. As we affirm on this basis, we need not reach Julca\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>ment that the sexual abuse committed by-other members of the conspiracy was not reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b942-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
