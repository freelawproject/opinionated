Talley was originally sentenced to a term of five years\u2019 probation following his guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to use access devices fraudulently, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. On appeal, Talley argues (1) he was not given proper notice that the court intended to \u201cdepart\u201d from the guidelines range, and (2) his sentence was excessively harsh. After review, we affirm Talley\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">Talley first argues he was not given proper notice that the district court intended to \u201cdepart\u201d from the guidelines range of three to nine months. He contends he was denied an opportunity to defend against an excessively harsh sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">Talley failed to object before the district court; thus, we review for plain error, which exists only where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; and (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 362-63 (11th Cir.1996), we held that a district court\u2019s decision at a revocation hearing to sentence outside the range suggested by the Chapter 7 advisory policy statements is not a \u201cdeparture\u201d that would require advance notice. Thus, the district court did not plainly err when it failed to give Talley notice before sentencing him outside the advisory guidelines but within the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">Talley next argues his 24-month sentence for violating the terms of his proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tion was excessively harsh in light of the nature of the offenses for which his probation was revoked and his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the Chapter 7 advisory guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006). We review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of probation for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006) (addressing supervised release). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, nor was the sentence unreasonable. The policy statements of Chapter 7 are merely advisory, and the district court, after considering a number of \u00a7 3553(a) factors, found that a sentence exceeding the guidelines\u2019 range was necessary. Under the totality of the circumstances, the sentence was not greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing, especially considering the leniency the court exercised when it sentenced Talley the first time. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Talley has not met his burden to show the sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
