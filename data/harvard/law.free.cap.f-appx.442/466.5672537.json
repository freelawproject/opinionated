Appellants\u2019 brief on appeal makes only a passing reference to the reasons for the district court\u2019s dismissal, namely the lack of subject matter jurisdiction, preclusion by <em>res judicata, </em>and the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine. After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Under the <em>Roolcer-Feldman </em>doctrine, federal district courts and courts of appeal lack subject matter jurisdiction \u201cover certain matters related to previous state court litigation.\u201d <em>See Goodman ex rel. Goodman v. Sipos, </em>259 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir.2001). The doctrine applies in \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced[,] and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Appellants instituted this action in the federal district court as a \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d of the state court\u2019s order and sought to have the district court review and reverse the state court\u2019s order dismissing the case. There was no basis for either federal question jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction. Moreover, the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine prevented the district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over Appellants\u2019 claims because they were the \u201cstate-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced[,] and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Saudi Basic Indus., </em>125 S.Ct. at 1521-22. The district court did not err in dismissing Appellants\u2019 case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-19\">. <em>\"Pro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v.
