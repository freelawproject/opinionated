Rine now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming this decision. We also AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-30\">Rine filed his application for benefits in 2007, alleging disability as of November 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>2006 based on muscular deterioration and nerve problems arising out of a 2005 surgery to his back. The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) conducted a hearing and determined that Rine did not suffer a disability as that term is defined under the Social Security Act, thus defeating Rine\u2019s claim for benefits. The Appeals Council denied review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, rendering it the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>See Higginbotham v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 332, 336-37 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Rine sought review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Rine now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) is limited to two areas of inquiry: (1) whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and (2) whether the Commissioner adhered to the proper legal standards when evaluating the evidence. <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994). We will reach a finding of substantial evidence if the evidence examined by the Commissioner \u201cis \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Rine specifically claims that the ALJ improperly deemed him not credible at the benefits hearing and overemphasized his alcohol use in denying benefits. This argument lacks merit. Rine oversimplifies the ALJ\u2019s treatment of his testimony. The record reflects that the ALJ considered Rine\u2019s statements as to his condition and determined that Rine reported his symptoms as more intense, persistent, and limiting than was reflected by other evidence in the record. The ALJ only questioned Rine\u2019s testimony to the extent that it contradicted evidence that Rine could perform light work. A review of the ALJ\u2019s decision further shows that Rine\u2019s alcohol use was one of several factors that led the ALJ to deny benefits. It is not our role to \u201creweigh the evidence in the record, try the issues de novo, or substitute [our] judgment for the Commissioner\u2019s.\u201d <em>Carey v. Apfel, </em>230 F.3d 131, 135 (5th Cir.2000). We cannot say that the substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding of non-disability based on the argument Rine raises here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Rine also challenges the ALJ\u2019s finding that Rine retained the residual functional capacity for the full range of light work during the relevant time period. Rine specifically contests the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the testimony of a non-treating physician; Rine asserts that this testimony did not comport with other evidence in the record, such as letters from Rine\u2019s employers, coworkers, friends, and family members and the assessments of his treating physicians. This argument also lacks merit. The substantial evidence in the form of medical records, along with the non-treating physician\u2019s testimony, supports the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity assessment of light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">Rine asserts lastly that the ALJ misapplied Social Security regulations to determine that Rine could perform other work existing in significant numbers in the national economy. This argument also fails. Even though it is unclear whether this argument is properly raised under the substantial evidence standard, we nevertheless find that the ALJ\u2019s assessment of Rine\u2019s employment prospects involved a straightforward application of the regulations in light of Rine\u2019s residual functional capacity of light work based on his physical limitations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1569a(b) (\u201cWhen your impairment(s) and related symptoms only impose exer-tional limitations and your specific voca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>tional profile is listed in a rule contained in appendix 2 of this subpart, we will directly apply that rule to decide whether you are disabled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
