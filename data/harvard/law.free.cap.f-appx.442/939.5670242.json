He was sentenced to 46 months for each offense with 12 months of the sentence in S.D. Tex. 2:10-CR-945 (5th Cir.11-40195) to run consecutively to the sentence in S.D. Tex. 2:10-CR-943 (5th Cir.11-40199) for a total sentence of 58 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release for each offense. He contends that the district court\u2019s reasons for departing were inadequate and the departure was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-22\">Davila\u2019s arguments pertain only to the sentence imposed in S.D. Tex. 2:10-CR-945 (5th Cir.11-40195). That sentence was an upward variance from the Guidelines and not an upward departure within the framework of the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c), comment. (n.1(B)); <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d 778, 782 (5th Cir.2011). Davila has failed to show any error, plain or otherwise, in the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons for varying from the Guidelines or the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806-07 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708-10 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-23\">The judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
