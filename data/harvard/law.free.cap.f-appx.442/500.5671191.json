Cantillo was sentenced to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. After he was sentenced, Cantillo filed a notice of appeal and his counsel has since filed an <em>Anders </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-19\">While Cantillo\u2019s appeal was pending the government filed a Rule 35(b) motion in the district court to reduce his sentence because of his substantial assistance to the government. The district court granted that motion and reduced his sentence to 110 months\u2019 imprisonment. But because Cantillo\u2019s appeal was still pending when the district court granted the motion, the district court did not have jurisdiction to reduce his sentence. <em>See United States v. Russell, </em>776 F.2d 955, 956 (11th Cir.1985). Accordingly, we deny his counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion, vacate Cantillo\u2019s sentence and remand for the limited purpose of resentenc-ing in accordance with the district court\u2019s attempted resentencing. <em>Cf. United States v. Turchen, </em>187 F.3d 735, 743 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-20\">DENIED in part, VACATED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
