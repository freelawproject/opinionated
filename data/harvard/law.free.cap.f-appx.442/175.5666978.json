He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines governing crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">Although Sam acknowledges that his guidelines range was determined under the career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, he contends that the district court erred in determining that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argues that the district court had the authority to resentence him in light of the advisory guidelines system in effect after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that he was entitled to reconsideration of his sentence in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Sam further contends that the district court\u2019s terse explanation that his career offender classification precluded him from relief was insufficient and ignored \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for granting a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The district court\u2019s denial of Sam\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Sam\u2019s guidelines range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in his offenses, but rather from his career offender status under \u00a7 4B1.1. \u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>Because Sam was ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court was not required to reach the question whether the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors warranted a reduction. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Regarding Sam\u2019s contention that the district court otherwise had the discretion to resentence him to a lesser sentence, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resen-tencings. <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2690-94. The principles of <em>Booker </em>and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce the sentence any further than the reduction allowed under \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Id.; United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">Sam\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the district court\u2019s explanation for denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion also is without merit. The district court was not required to give reasons for its denial of the motion, <em>see Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674, and, in any event, the court\u2019s order denying the motion specified the relevant reason for its denial, i.e., Sam was a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
