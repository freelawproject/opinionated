Green, Texas prisoner # 1041383, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit against food service manager Harold Atkinson. Green asserts that the prison system failed to screen food properly for foreign objects and that Atkinson\u2019s deliberate indifference to a known risk violated Green\u2019s right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Green suggests that the prison had a duty to sift the food before preparing it. He further suggests that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) is liable because it is responsible for providing safety training to the inmates who prepare food. Insofar as he argues that anyone but Atkinson is liable, we previously affirmed the dismissal of the prison\u2019s warden, assistant warden, and other food service employees. The TDCJ is not a named defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-22\">Given an opportunity upon remand to cure the inadequacy of his claim against Atkinson, Green failed to allege facts related to any other incident in which an inmate was injured by a foreign object in the food. His sole allegation that a security guard knew of an incident when pebbles were found in prison beans does not support a finding that Atkinson knowingly disregarded a substantial risk that an inmate would bite into or ingest a foreign object. The security guard did not indicate that Atkinson was aware of the pebbles. In a \u00a7 1983 suit, \u201c[a]bsent vicarious liability, each Government official ... is only liable for his or her own misconduct.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Because Green was unable upon remand to remedy the insufficient factual allegations against Atkinson, the district court\u2019s dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>missal of the claim was proper. <em>See id.; George v. King, </em>837 F.2d 705, 707 (5th Cir.1988) (holding single incident of food poisoning did not amount to a violation of prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Green also addresses the merits of new claims he attempted to add to his complaint upon remand. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend. <em>See Boyd v. United States, </em>861 F.2d 106, 108 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b941-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
