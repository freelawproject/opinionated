We affirm the orders of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">I. Essential Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">On November 18, 2010, McKenzie filed a complaint in this case with the district court. McKenzie filed this civil action seeking judicial review of the Agency\u2019s final administrative decision denying her application for disability insurance benefits pursuant to Title II of the <em>Social Security Act </em>(\u201cTitle II\u201d). On January 81, 2011, the Agency sought voluntary remand to the Agency, because the Agency could not locate the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision allegedly dated March 21, 2008, and the recording of the administrative hearing allegedly held on February 12, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">On February 3, 2011, the district court granted the Agency\u2019s motion to remand. On February 15, 2011, McKenzie filed a combined motion to oppose remand and motion for reconsideration. On March 1, 2011, McKenzie filed an amendment to her motion for reconsideration. On March 2, 2011, the district court denied McKenzie\u2019s combined motion to oppose remand and motion for reconsideration. On April 1, 2011, McKenzie appealed. On July 21, 2011, this court granted McKenzie\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">This court reviews for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s order for remand pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>Bordelon v. Barnhart, </em>161 Fed.Appx. 348, 353 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Latham v. Shalala, </em>36 F.3d 482, 483 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Salinas v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 345, 347 n. 2 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Allen v. Schweiker, </em>642 F.2d 799, 802 (5th Cir.1981). Remand pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) is authorized under two circumstances: (1) on motion of the Agency for good cause before the Agency\u2019s answer has been filed, or (2) for consideration of additional evidence upon a showing that the evidence is new and material, and that good cause exists for the claimant\u2019s failure to present the evidence earlier. <em>Melkonyan v. Sullivan, </em>501 U.S. 89, 100 n. 2, 111 S.Ct. 2157, 115 L.Ed.2d 78 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>III. Analysis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">Title II provides, in relevant part: The court may, on motion of the Commissioner of Social Security made for good cause shown before the Commissioner files the Commissioner\u2019s answer, remand the case to the Commissioner of Social Security for further action by the Commissioner of Social Security, and it may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security, but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding; and the Commissioner of Social Security shall, after the case is remanded, and after hearing such additional evidence if so ordered, modify or affirm the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact or the Commissioner\u2019s decision, or both, and shall file with the court any such additional and modified findings of fact and decision, and, in any case in which the Commissioner has not made a decision fully favorable to the individual, a transcript of the additional record and testimony upon which the Commissioner\u2019s action in modifying or affirming was based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). This court has recognized that the legislative history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) authorizes, with limitation, a lost record or a lost claim file as constituting good cause for a court to remand a claim to the Agency. <em>Dudley v. Astrue, </em>246 Fed.Appx. 249, 252 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Evangelista v. Secretary of Health and Human Serv., </em>826 F.2d 136, 141 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 944, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 59, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1277, 1407)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALr\">The conferees have been informed that there are sometimes procedural difficulties which prevent the secretary from providing the court with a transcript of administrative proceedings. Such a situation is an example of what could be considered \u201cgood cause\u201d for remand. <em>Where, for example, the tape recording of the claimant\u2019s oral hearing is lost </em>or inaudible, or cannot otherwise be transcribed, or <em>where the claimant\u2019s files cannot be located </em>or are incomplete, <em>good cause would exist to remand the claim to the secretary for appropriate action to produce a record which the courts may review under [4,2 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 205(g) of the act. It is the hope of the conferees that remands on the basis of these breakdowns in the administrative process should be kept to a minimum so that persons appealing their decision are not unduly burdened by the resulting delay. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Here, in the Agency\u2019s motion for remand, the Agency represented that \u201c[u]pon receipt of the Court\u2019s order, the Appeals Council will remand the case to an Administrative Law Judge for reconstruction of the administrative record, and to hold an administrative hearing and issue a new decision.\u201d Indeed, good record keeping is a hallmark of transparency and helps ensure trust and confidence in the fairness of the Agency\u2019s actions. With a great appreciation for and due recognition to the administrative burdens on the Agency, this court implores the Agency to strive to maintain its records with the utmost attention, care and diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">McKenzie\u2019s claim is hereby remanded to the Agency pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) for further proceedings with \u2014 for reasons particular to this case \u2014 this court\u2019s strong encouragement to the Agency to expedite McKenzie\u2019s proceedings forthwith. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that McKenzie\u2019s motion for summary judgment is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\">. This court recognizes that McKenzie represents herself as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, so out of an abundance of latitude, this court liberally construes McKenzie's allegations in particular when the proceedings raise such complex issues of both civil and administrative procedure. <em>See, e.g., Securities and Exch. Comm\u2019n v. AMX, Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>7 F.3d 71, 75 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
