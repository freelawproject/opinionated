Wilbers now appeals his sentence as unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">Wilbers asserts first that the district court erred when it denied his request for a downward variance, failing to consider two purported flaws in a particular sentencing guideline.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wilbers next argues that the district court based his sentence on \u201cimproper assumptions and impermissible unrelated current events,\u201d rather than his unique circumstances and for the specific offense to which he pleaded guilty. Each of the arguments fails, and we affirm Wilbers\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-17\">The party challenging a sentence bears the high burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Our reasonableness review looks to whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This Court must first review the sentencing to ensure that the \u201cdistrict court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. In doing so, we examine whether the sentencing court: (1) properly calculated the guideline range, (2) treated the guidelines as advisory, (3) considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (4) selected a sentence based on facts not clearly erroneous, and (5) explained adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-18\">If the procedures employed in imposing the sentence were proper, we then evaluate the substantive reasonableness of a sentence in light of the record and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The ultimate question is \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In this limited scope of review, a court may vacate a sentence only if it is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect it to be so. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Wilbers\u2019s first claim includes a procedural and a substantive component. Because Wilbers raised only his substantive claim before the district court, we review his procedural claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>F.R.Crim. P. 52(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will address Wilbers\u2019s procedural claim first.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Wilbers maintains that the sentencing court did not fulfill <em>Gall\u2019s </em>admonition to explain adequately its chosen sentence insofar as it did not address his arguments about \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3). During the sentencing hearing, and after hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, the judge denied the requested downward variance \u201cin light of [Wilbers\u2019s] history and characteristics and the nature and circumstances of the offenses and the other statutory factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">When a party presents a well-grounded reason for departing from the guidelines, a judge will normally \u201cexplain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). A judge is not, however, required to address explicitly every argument raised by the parties in a sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2010) (stating that the sentencing judge need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own deci-sionmaking authority\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting argument that district court is required to state on the record that he has considered each \u00a7 3553(a) factor); <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that the absence of overt discussion does not mean district court failed to consider mitigating evidence in determining sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">The sentencing judge clearly fulfilled this standard. The transcript makes plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that the sentencing judge was quite familiar with the facts of the case and with Wilbers\u2019s circumstances; that he accounted for those specifics; and that he based his decision on them. For instance, the judge not only expressed his \u201csympath[y]\u201d for Wilbers\u2019s Attention Deficit Disorder and his concern that Wilbers stopped taking his medication for it, but also heeded Wilbers\u2019s request to be placed at a facility where he could be evaluated and treated for that condition. The district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and provided a reasoned basis for his ultimate decision. We conclude, therefore, he made no procedural error in imposing Wilbers\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We next address the substantive component of Wilbers\u2019s claim, namely, that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence after rejecting Wil-bers\u2019s request for a downward variance based on the two purported defects in a specific sentencing guideline. Wilbers first claims that the district court\u2019s use of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3) constituted reversible error because the enhancement has its origin in a statute that Congress has since allowed to expire. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCLEA) imposed a ban on semiautomatic weapons and large capacity magazines for firearms. Pub.L. No. 103-322, \u00a7\u00a7 1101012-13, 108 Stat. 1796, 1996-99 (1994). VCCLEA also directed the Sentencing Commission to establish an enhancement for possession of any firearms banned by the law, as listed in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(30). <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 110502, 108 Stat. at 2015. Following this direction by Congress, the Commission created a two-level addition to the base offense level for possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity feeding devices. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3). VCCLEA was written to expire ten years after its enactment and, absent further Congressional action, the law expired in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Nevertheless, when reviewing the guidelines in 2006, the Sentencing Commission elected to retain the sentencing enhancement engendered by the statute, deleting the reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(30) and replacing it with the phrase \u201ca semiautomatic firearm that is capable of accepting a large capacity magazine.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, amend. 691 (Nov. 1, 2006). The revision, done out of concern \u201cregarding inconsistent application ... in light of [VCCLEAj\u2019s expiration,\u201d made clear the Sentencing Commission\u2019s intent to keep the enhancement in place. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Wilbers next contends that the district court\u2019s use of the guideline provision constituted reversible error because the enhancement is \u201cnot based on empirical evidence.\u201d He refers to a study by The Urban Institute finding that assault weapons bans have \u201conly a limited effect on total gun murders\u201d and produce no detectable reduction in the \u201ctwo types of gun murders that are thought to be closely associated with assault weapons, those with multiple victims in a single incident and those producing multiple bullet wounds per victim.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wilbers ties this argument to his previous point, saying that if there were evidence supporting the notion that assault weapons present a risk to public safety, \u201ca political consensus would have developed to continue the ban on them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">We review the district court\u2019s application and legal interpretations of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>nations for clear error. <em>United States v. Zaldivar, </em>615 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2010), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 ,U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 959, 178 L.Ed.2d 791 (2011). Our precedent provides that a lack of supporting empirical evidence does not, alone, render a guideline provision invalid. <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 870 (11th Cir.2010). Wilbers acknowledges this in his brief, as well he should, because the Supreme Court itself has recognized that not all guidelines provisions are tied to empirical evidence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46 n. 2, 128 S.Ct. at 594 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">At root, Wilbers\u2019s substantive claim faults the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy decision to retain the enhancement for possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity feeding devices. But this Court evaluates only the reasonableness of the judgment imposed upon the individual, not the reasonableness of the sentencing guidelines themselves. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 785; <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, by this argument, Wilbers has identified no substantive problem with his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Wilbers raises a second substantive objection to his sentence, namely, that the district court based his sentence on \u201cimproper assumptions and impermissible unrelated current events,\u201d rather than his unique circumstances and the specific offense to which he had pled guilty. Specifically, Wilbers alleges that his sentence \u201cwas based in significant part on the improper assumption that Wilbers posed a significant danger to his girlfriend, and in reaction to the recent killings of two police officers, neither of which are permissible sentencing factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">At sentencing, \u201c[a] district court abuses its discretion when it ... gives significant weight to an improper or inappropriate factor-\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, the scope of proper and appropriate factors is great. The district court has broad discretion to consider \u201cthe fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics.\u201d <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1235-36, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. Thus, for a district court\u2019s comment to constitute reversible error, it must compel us \u201cto conclude that the district judge closed his mind to evidence favorable to appellant before the sentencing proceedings were concluded.\u201d <em>United States v. Greenman, </em>700 F.2d 1377, 1379 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">The district court in this case did not abuse its discretion by considering the evidence regarding Wilbers\u2019s past domestic violence arrests. Section 3353(a)(1) establishes as a permissible factor the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d The judge could reasonably have concluded that the evidence concerning Wilbers\u2019s \u201csupposed loving relationship with his girlfriend\u201d reflected a measure of relational instability and personal volatility, undercutting Wilbers\u2019s claim that familial support makes him less likely to recidivate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">Neither did the district court\u2019s mention of officer killings amount to an abuse of discretion. Here a defendant was being sentenced for selling weapons illegally, and the judge referenced a recent instance in which police officers were killed \u201cby a young man who purchased a weapon illegally.\u201d The judge made the comment during a colloquy with Wilbers, inquiring whether he had contemplated the possible consequences of dealing in illegal weapons. It was, in fact, an example of the possible consequences that can flow from behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>such as that for which Wilbers was convicted. A judge might well consider these possible consequences when weighing \u00a7 3553(a)(2 \u2014 4): (2) the seriousness of the offense; (3) deterrence; and (4) the need to protect the public. Thus, we conclude that the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion by mentioning to outside events when imposing sentence upon Wilbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We conclude that Wilbers\u2019s 108-month sentence is neither procedurally defective nor substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-11\">.
