The district court sentenced Caillier to 168 months of imprisonment, 15 years of supervised release, and registration as a sex offender. He argues on appeal that none of the four images he received on his cellular phone constituted child pornography and that he therefore pleaded guilty to a crime that was never committed. Because he has raised this argument for the first time on appeal, we review the issue only for plain error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-23\">Caillier specifically asserts that the sole photograph showing the victim\u2019s genitals or pubic area does not qualify as the \u201clascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(2)(A)(v) because the victim\u2019s genitals or pubic area is covered by clothing in the photograph, the focal point of the photograph is not the victim\u2019s genitals or pubic area, and the other aspects of the depiction in the photograph do not meet the relevant Dost<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> factors. <em>See United States v. Steen, </em>634 F.3d 822, 826-27 (5th Cir.2011) (analyzing <em>Dost </em>factors to determine whether depictions meet definition of lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area). After examination of the evidence and analysis of the <em>Dost </em>factors, we conclude that Caillier has failed to show clear or obvious error as to this issue. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-24\">Tim district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b930-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
