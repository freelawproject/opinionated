Johnson obtained the position through Appellee Manpower Professional Services, a staffing company. Because we find that Air Liquide is Johnson\u2019s employer and that it failed to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Johnson\u2019s loss of overtime pay, we REVERSE the district court's grant of summary judgment as to Johnson\u2019s Title VII claim against Air Liquide and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Additionally, because we find that Air Liquide was Johnson\u2019s employer and Johnson\u2019s Title VII/ \u00a7 1981 claim against Manpower regarding pre-hiring screening procedures lacks merit, we AFFIRM district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Manpower as to the Title VII/ \u00a7 1981 claims. Finally, because we find that Johnson\u2019s retaliation claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>have been waived, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Manpower and Air Liquide on the FLSA retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">In October 2006, Manpower and Air Liquide entered into a staffing arrangement whereby Manpower would provide temporary employees to Air Liquide when Air Liquide required such employees. Under this arrangement, Manpower would recruit employees for Air Liquide and would handle the administrative and payroll issues, while Air Liquide would decide which of Manpower\u2019s recruits to hire and would manage and supervise them once hired. Air Liquide required a recruiter for its ALPC division, and Manpower was charged with filling that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Johnson, an African-American man, responded to Manpower\u2019s advertisement for the ALPC recruiter position. As a part of Manpower\u2019s application process, Johnson submitted to a background check and a drug test. Manpower then referred Johnson to Air Liquide, who hired him to fill the ALPC recruiter position. Johnson started at ALPC in April 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">For the first five weeks that Johnson worked at Air Liquide, he received overtime for those hours he worked in excess of forty per week, but in May 2007, Johnson stopped receiving the higher hourly wage for overtime hours. In October 2007, Johnson asked Jennifer Murphy, his Manpower supervisor and a Caucasian woman, about why he was no longer receiving increased overtime pay. Murphy sent Johnson an email on October 15, 2007 stating that his status from \u201covertime nonexempt\u201d had been changed to \u201covertime exempt\u201d at the request of Dennis Schwartz, Air Liquide\u2019s director of finance and accounting. Johnson\u2019s overtime status was never restored. Johnson continued to work at ALPC receiving no extra overtime pay. In November 2007, Johnson\u2019s Air Liquide supervisor Roger Mayes, an African-American man, gave Johnson a good performance review, and in December 2007, Johnson received two extra days of holiday pay due to his good work at Air Liquide. Throughout this time, however, Air Liquide claims that various staff members expressed dissatisfaction with Johnson\u2019s work, specifically his pace of filling the positions for which he was recruiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">On April 1, 2008, Murphy sent Air Liq-uide an email requesting a raise for Johnson. Around the same time, Manpower\u2019s legal counsel was reviewing its policy on overtime for workers in their professional business line-the same line of work that Johnson was in. Meanwhile at Air Liquide, John Andresen, a Caucasian man, replaced Mayes as Johnson\u2019s Air Liquide supervisor. Andresen received more negative feedback about Johnson\u2019s job performance. As a result, Air Liquide asked Manpower to replace Johnson. Johnson was terminated on April 29, 2008. Manpower filled Johnson\u2019s old position at ALPC with Patricia LaSalle, a Caucasian female. LaSalle was paid extra overtime pay and did not have to take a drug test or undergo a background check.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">Johnson sued Manpower and Air Liq-uide in August 2008 under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>for his back overtime pay. He later settled that suit with Manpower. As a part of that settlement, Manpower requested that Johnson execute a broad release of \u201cany and all claims,\u201d including future claims, against Manpower; Johnson refused. He did, however, sign a \u201cLimited Release\u201d that \u201cwaive[d]\u201d his claims against Manpower, \u201cits parent, subsidiary, related, and affiliated companies\u201d of \u201cany and all ... claims ... arising under the [FLSA] or any state of local law concerning pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>ment of wages ... including] but not limited to all claims for payment of wages, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, or attorney\u2019s fees arising under the aforesaid statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Johnson then went to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and submitted charges against Manpower and Air Liquide. He received a right to sue letter and commenced this action in July 2009, pursuing claims under Title VII, Section 1981, and the FLSA. After discovery was completed, Manpower and Air Liquide both moved for summary judgment. The district court granted both motions, <em>Johnson v. Manpower Prof. Servs., Inc., </em>No. 4:09-CV-2423, 2011 WL 689375 (S.D. Tex. Feb 17, 2011), and Johnson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>641 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate where the movant shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. 56(c) (2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In making this determination, all inferences are drawn in favor of the non-movant. <em>Id. </em>Our cases require that if the burden at trial rests on the non-movant, then the movant must \u201cdemonstrate an absence of eviden-tiary support in the record for the non-movant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Bayle v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>615 F.3d 350, 355 (5th Cir.2010) (footnote omitted). If the movant does that and \u201cmeets the initial burden of demonstrating that there exists no genuine issue of material fact,\u201d then absent rebutting evidence by the non-movant, summary judgment should be granted. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317[, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265] (1986)). Moreover, the non-movant must do more than just raise \u201c \u2018some metaphysical doubt\u2019 as to the material facts\u201d to prevail. <em>Thibodeaux v. Vamos Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>487 F.3d 288, 295 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Johnson raised many claims in the district court but has only appealed three claims to this court: (1) his denial of overtime benefits because of his race under Title VII and \u00a7 1981, (2) his being subjected to a background check and drug test because of his race under Title VII and \u00a7 1981, and (3) his allegedly retaliatory termination under the FLSA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">A. Title VII and Section 1981</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Additionally, section 1981 affords all persons within the United States the \u201csame right ... to make and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>enforce contracts\u201d without respect to race. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1981. Here, Johnson does not offer any direct evidence of discrimination but rather brings a claim based on disparate treatment. In <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), the Supreme Court first established a framework for adjudicating Title VII discrimination claims where the plaintiff lacks such direct evidence. This is the same standard used to analyze claims of disparate impact discrimination brought under \u00a7 1981. <em>Payne v. Travenol Labs., </em>673 F.2d 798, 818 (5th Cir.1982); <em>compare Lee v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., </em>574 F.3d 253, 259 (5th Cir.2009) (setting out the elements of a prima facie case under Title VII) <em>with Bryan v. McKinsey &amp; Co., </em>375 F.3d 358, 360 (5th Cir.2004) (setting out the elements of a prima facie case under \u00a7 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Under that framework, an employee establishes a prima facie case of racial discrimination if he can demonstrate that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-6\">(1) he is a member of a protected class,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-7\">(2) he was qualified for the position at issue, (3) he was the subject of an adverse employment action, and (4) he was treated less favorably because of his membership in that protected class than were other similarly situated employees who were not members of the protected class, under nearly identical circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\"><em>Lee, </em>574 F.3d at 259. Adverse employment actions under this test are limited to \u201cultimate employment decisions such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating\u201d and do not include employment actions that do not \u201caffect job duties, compensation, or benefits.\u201d <em>Pegram v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 272, 282 (5th Cir.2004). In establishing the similarly situated element, a plaintiff must identify an employee under \u201cnearly identical\u201d circumstances who did not have adverse employment action taken against him. <em>Okoye v. Univ. of Tex. Houston Health Sci Ctr., </em>245 F.3d 507, 514 (5th Cir.2001). Our cases do recognize that the comparator can be someone employed at a different time than the plaintiff. <em>Uviedo v. Steves Sash &amp; Door Co., </em>738 F.2d 1425, 1431 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">If the plaintiff proves his prima facie case, then \u201cthe inference of intentional discrimination is raised, and the burden of production shifts to the employer\u201d to offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Lee, </em>574 F.3d at 259 (footnotes omitted). If the employer provides such a reason, then the inference \u201cdrops out and the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the employer\u2019s explanation is merely a pretext for racial bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 255-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)). To prove pretext, plaintiff must rebut the non-discriminatory reason with \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Laxton v. Gap Inc., </em>333 F.3d 572, 578 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">In determining whether a given defendant is an employer, we use the standards laid out in <em>Deal v. State Farm Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>5 F.3d 117 (5th Cir.1993) and summarized in <em>Muhammad v. Dall. Cnty. Cmty. Supervision &amp; Corrections Dep\u2019t:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbX\">Determining whether a defendant is an \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII involves a two-step process. First, the court must determine whether the defendant falls within Title VH\u2019s statutory definition of an \u201cemployer.\u201d Title VII defines an \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201ca person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees ..., and any agent of such a person....\u201d If the defendant meets this definition, the court must then analyze whether an employment relationship exists between the plaintiff and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>To determine whether an employment relationship exists within the meaning of Title VII, we apply a hybrid economic realities/common law control test. The most important component of this test is the right to control the employee\u2019s conduct. When examining the control component, we have focused on whether the alleged employer has the right to hire, fire, supervise, and set the work schedule of the employee.... The economic realities component of the test focuses on whether the alleged employer paid the employee\u2019s salary, withheld taxes, provided benefits, and set the terms and conditions of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">479 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir.2007) (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">1. Overtime Denial</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Denial of overtime pay is an adverse employment action because it relates to Johnson\u2019s compensation. <em>Pegram, </em>361 F.3d at 282; <em>cf. Shannon v. Bell Telecomms., Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir. 2002) (holding that denial of the opportunity to work overtime is an adverse employment action sufficient to make out a prima facie case under Title VII). Moreover, when using LaSalle, a Caucasian female who did receive overtime pay, as the comparator, Johnson has made out a prima facie ease for discrimination. Because of this, we are required to determine who Johnson\u2019s employer was.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Both Manpower and Air Liquide meet the statutory definition of an employer under Title VII so resolution of this question turns on the application of the hybrid economic realities/right to control test. The staffing arrangement agreement sets out the respective responsibilities of Manpower and Air Liquide. Manpower\u2019s responsibilities after it placed a worker at Air Liquide were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-10\">1) Maintaining personnel and payroll records; 2) Paying, withholding, and transmitting payroll taxes; 3) Making unemployment contributions; 4) Handling unemployment and workers\u2019 compensation claims involving Assigned Employees with respect to compensation that [Manpower] has agreed to pay; 5) and removing any Assigned Employee at the request of [Air Liquide], provided there is a valid legal reason for doing so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">We consider first the factors that go towards the more important assessment of right to control. Manpower, while technically in charge of hiring and firing, does so only at Air Liquide\u2019s approval with respect to hiring and at Air Liquide\u2019s request with respect to firing. Moreover, while Johnson had supervisors at both Air Liquide and Manpower, it seems that Murphy, Johnson\u2019s Manpower supervisor, merely responded to the requests of Johnson\u2019s Air Liquide supervisors \u2014 Schwartz, Mayes, and Andresen. Additionally, Johnson\u2019s job performance was reviewed by Air Liq-uide. To be sure, almost all of the factors under the economic realities test point to Manpower being Johnson\u2019s employer, as Manpower paid Johnson and withheld taxes on his behalf. Nonetheless, because the majority of the more important right to control factors point to Air Liquide as Johnson\u2019s employer, we conclude that Air Liquide and not Manpower is Johnson\u2019s employer for the purposes of his overtime denial claim. <em>See Deal, </em>5 F.3d at 119. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Manpower as to Johnson\u2019s overtime denial claim against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>Reviewing the summary judgment record reveals that Air Liquide offered no reason for changing Johnson\u2019s status to overtime exempt. Although, as the district court concluded, there does not appear to be any evidence that Air Liquide\u2019s decision was based on Johnson\u2019s race, Johnson has raised an inference of discrimination by establishing a prima facie case under <em>McDonnell Douglas. Lee, </em>574 F.3d at 259 (footnote omitted). Such a showing requires the employer to give a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, and where no such reason is given the employer cannot be awarded summary judgment. <em>See Alvarado v. Tex. Rangers, </em>492 F.3d 605, 617 (5th Cir.2007). Therefore, we reverse the district court with respect to Johnson\u2019s overtime denial claim against Air Liquide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">2. Background Check and Drug Testing \u2014 Manpower</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">As stated above, for an employment action to form the basis of either a Title VII or a \u00a7 1981 claim, it must be an \u201cultimate employment decision,\u201d which includes those affecting \u201cjob duties, compensation, or benefits.\u201d <em>Pegram, </em>361 F.3d at 282. Although Johnson did show that La-Salle, his replacement, did not undergo these pre-hire screening procedures, these are not the type of actions that give rise to a disparate treatment claim, as neither the background check nor drug test affected Johnson\u2019s duties, compensation, or benefits. Johnson admitted in his surreply to Manpower\u2019s motion for summary judgment that these pre-hiring screening procedures are not actionable under the standard set forth in <em>Pegram. </em>Therefore, we affirm the district court on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">B. Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">The FLSA makes it unlawful for anyone to \u201cto discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to [the FLSA.]\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3). The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework has been adapted to apply to claims brought under the FLSA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-10\">First, a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of (1) participation in protected activity under the FLSA; (2) an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the activity and the adverse action. If a plaintiff meets this burden, the defendant must then articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision. The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\"><em>Hagan v. Echostar Satellite, L.L.C., </em>529 F.3d 617, 624 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">1. As to Manpower</p>\n<p id=\"Ax4A\">The district court held that Johnson was precluded from claiming against Manpower because when he settled his first lawsuit, he signed a release that effectively waived any claim under the FLSA. Johnson admits that his claim arises under the FLSA; the only question is whether this release covers this FLSA retaliation claim. Texas rules of construction control the interpretation of this release. <em>Austin Bldg. Co. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>432 S.W.2d 697, 701 (Tex.1968) (\u201cThe effect of a contract is to be determined by the law intended by the parties to control, and in the absence of a contrary manifestation, the presumption is that the parties contract with reference to where the contract was made.\u201d). When called upon to apply state substantive law, we look to the decisions of the state\u2019s highest court, and where there is no definitive answer, we \u201cmust determine, in its best judgment, how the state\u2019s highest court would resolve the issue if presented with it.\u201d <em>Holt v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>Releases can be broad or narrow, but regardless, \u201c[i]n order to effectively release a claim in Texas, the releasing instrument must \u2018mention\u2019 the claim to be released.\u201d <em>Victoria Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Brady, </em>811 S.W.2d 931, 938 (Tex.1991). For a claim to be mentioned, it need only be able to be fairly encompassed in the language of the release. <em>See Keck, Mahin &amp; Cate v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>20 S.W.3d 692, 698 (Tex.2000). \u201cUnder Texas law, a release is a contract,\u201d <em>Williams v. Glash, </em>789 S.W.2d 261, 264 (Tex.1990), and when construing a contract, it is well-known that \u201cthe primary concern of the court is to ascertain the true intentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Compliance Source, Inc. v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>624 F.3d 252, 259 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, </em>128 S.W.3d 223, 229 (Tex.2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">The relevant language of the \u201cLimited Release\u201d Johnson signed is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-5\">Willie Johnson ... hereby waives, and fully releases, Manpower Inc., its parent, subsidiary, related, and affiliated companies from any and all liability, claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, grievances, ... and remedies of any type that Johnson now has of may hereafter have from the beginning of time arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>or any state or local law concerning the payment of overtime wages. This Release shall include but not be limited to all claims for payment of wages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, liquidate damages, or attorney\u2019s fees arising under the aforesaid statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXmS\">Although stylized as a \u201cLimited Release,\u201d the language is broad, releasing Manpower and all related company from \u201cany and all liability [and] claims ... arising under the [FLSA] or any state or local law concerning the payment of overtime wages.\u201d Johnson argues that this should be read as limited to FLSA claims \u201cconcerning the payment of overtime wages.\u201d Such a reading is incorrect. We conclude that the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d between FLSA and the \u201cany state or local law\u201d means that the modifier \u201cconcerning the payment of overtime wages\u201d only relates to and modifies the latter antecedent, \u201cany state or local law,\u201d and not also FLSA. <em>See Barrand, Inc. v. Whataburger, Inc., </em>214 S.W.3d 122, 134 n. 2 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2006) (\u201cAlthough the doctrine of last antecedent has been generally applied as a canon of statutory and constitutional interpretation, we see no reason why it should not be equally applicable to issues of contract construction.\u201d); <em>cf. Spradlin v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number><em>Jim Walter Homes, Inc., </em>34 S.W.3d 578, 580-81 (Tex.2000) (applying the doctrine of last antecedent, which states \u201ca qualifying phrase ... must be confined to the words and phrases immediately preceding it to which it may, without impairing the meaning of the sentence, be applied\u201d). Therefore, Johnson\u2019s execution of the \u201cLimited Release\u201d does operate to preclude his FLSA retaliation claim and the district court is affirmed on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">2. As to Air Liquide</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Johnson contends that the reason the district court found for Air Liquide was that Johnson presented insufficient evidence of pretext to rebut Air Liquide\u2019s proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Johnson. In fact, that was an alternative holding by the district court; the district court determined that Johnson failed to state a prima facie case for retaliation because Johnson failed to show his participation in any protected activity under the FLSA. Johnson has presented no reasons for reversing the district court as to the failure to make out a prima facie case and therefore, his claims are waived.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>see also Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cA party who inadequately briefs an issue is considered to have abandoned the claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Because we find that Air Liquide is Johnson\u2019s employer and failed to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Johnson\u2019s loss of overtime pay, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to Johnson\u2019s Title VII denial of overtime claim against Air Liq-uide and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Relatedly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Manpower as to Johnson\u2019s Title VII denial of overtime claim because we find that Air Liquide was Johnson\u2019s employer. As to Johnson\u2019s Title VII claim against Manpower regarding pre-hiring screening procedures, we find that these procedures are not ultimate employment decisions and therefore are not within the ambit of Title VII, and we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Manpower as to this claim. Finally, because we find that Johnson\u2019s FLSA retaliation claims have been waived, by release as to Manpower and by failure to brief it as to Air Liquide, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Manpower and Air Liq-uide on the retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1004-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">. Because the summary judgment motions in this case were filed before the effective date of the most recent amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the previous version of the Rule 56 was applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">. Johnson failed to specify in his complaint under what law he is bringing his retaliation claim. The district court treated Johnson's claim as one under the FLSA, and we do the same as Johnson has admitted in his brief to this court that his claim arises under the FLSA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">. The district court did not analyze who Johnson\u2019s employer was because it found that both Air Liquide and Manpower had provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for denying Johnson overtime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">. There are some Texas cases that seem to suggest that evidence beyond the four corners of the contract may be relevant to the inquiry: \"To give effect to the parties\u2019 intent[,] a release will be construed in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding its execution.\u201d <em>Tricentrol Oil Trading, Inc. v. Annesley, </em>809 S.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex.1991). The cases where the Texas courts look beyond the express terms of the agreement are ones where a party has not known about a right at the time it was releasing it. Such a situation is distinct from what Johnson claims here \u2014 district court construed the release more broadly than he intended it. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 221 (in a case dealing with a resulting trust, discussing how one party failed to disclose its claim to trust property to the other parties); <em>Williams, </em>789 S.W.2d at 264 (in a case dealing with a release of medical claims arising from an automobile accident, discussing how the executing party to the release did not know of his injury at the time he signed the release). Johnson knew about his retaliation claim against Manpower before he signed the release because the basis of that claim was his termination, which happened nearly a year before Johnson signed the release. Therefore, we only need to look to the language of the release to see if Johnson's current FLSA claim is \"mentioned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">. Johnson also alleged error based on the district court's allegedly improper admission of John Andresen's \"declaration.\u201d As that evidence only relates to Air Liquide's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Johnson and Johnson has waived his retaliation claim by failing to brief the issue of prima facie case for retaliation, that point of error is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
