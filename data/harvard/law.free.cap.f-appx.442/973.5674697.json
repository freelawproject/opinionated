Because the record shows material fact issues, this court must dismiss for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-18\">The district court\u2019s finding that fact issues are raised is supported by the testimony of the plaintiff. (Record pp. 331, 645). Dr. Kemp was the principal supervising Mr. Nesbit, a teacher. Nesbit testified that he was rudely interrupted in class, required to do more work, urged to resign, interfered with in his ability to teach, etc. \u2014 as other white teachers were treated but not the black teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
