On appeal, he first argues that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. He contends that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court: (1) failed to adequately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 sentencing factors; (2) failed to consider all of the arguments presented by defense counsel and to adequately explain the sentence; (3) assumed facts not in evidence regarding a proposed guideline departure and variance; and (4) treated the Guidelines as mandatory. He further argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing. Secondly, he argues that the district court erred by failing to allow him to allocute prior to sentencing. Lastly, he argues that the court erred by failing to elicit fully articulated objections following sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">In this case, Garcia-Hernandez\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. The record reflects that, although the district court did not explicitly discuss or cite any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court\u2019s consideration of his arguments for a variance under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his request for downward departure indicate that the court did consider the sentencing factors. Furthermore, the court\u2019s comments during the sentencing hearing indicate that it considered the need for deterrence, protecting the public from further crimes, his history, and what would constitute just punishment. The record also demonstrates that the court considered his arguments and adequately explained its reasons for the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">With regard to the motion for a downward departure, the district court stated that it saw \u201cno reason to depart from the guidelines,\u201d which implies that it understood that it had the authority to depart from the guideline range. Therefore, we have no authority to review the court\u2019s decision to deny the downward departure. To the extent that Garcia-Hernandez also argues that the court should have varied from the guideline range, he has failed to show that his sentence, which was at the very bottom of the guideline range, was unreasonable. Although he contends that the district court\u2019s decision not to depart or vary below the guideline range was based on facts not in evidence, the court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">The record further demonstrates that the court correctly treated the Guidelines as advisory. Lastly, Garcia-Hernandez failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. His 77-month sentence is within the advisory guideline range and below the statutory maximum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">Next, although the district court neglected to allow Garcia-Hernandez to allo-cute prior to sentencing him, after defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>counsel pointed out this error, the court specifically addressed the defendant and asked if he had anything to state to the court. He was given an opportunity to be heard by the court before the proceeding had ended and while he was still under the \u201cpresence and control\u201d of the court. The court clearly advised the defendant that his post-sentencing allocution might make a difference, which demonstrates that the sentence still could have been changed following his allocution. Under these circumstances, we find no errors as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Finally, we find no merit to Gareia-Hernandez\u2019s claim that the court failed to elicit fully articulated objections following sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Although, after sentencing Garcia-Hernandez, the district court asked only whether there was \u201canything further\u201d that defense counsel wished to state to the court, defense counsel responded with several objections to the sentence, which indicates that counsel understood that the court was eliciting objections, which counsel made.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
