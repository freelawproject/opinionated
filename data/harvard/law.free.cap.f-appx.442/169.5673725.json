He asserts that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) because the Government failed to prove that a Washington district court imposed a sentence of over 13 months for his prior conviction for conspiring to distribute methamphetamine. The abuse-of-discretion standard applies to our review of sentencing decisions. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Charon, </em>442 F.3d 881, 887 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Having reviewed the record, including the documents obtained from the Washington court, we conclude that the district court\u2019s finding that Torres was sentenced to 66 months of imprisonment on his methamphetamine conviction \u201cis plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As a result, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentencing enhancement, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
