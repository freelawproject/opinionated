We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In October 2008, two vessels owned by the respective parties to this action were involved in a maritime accident in the Port of Lagos, Nigeria. The Turkish flagged M/V YASA H. MEHMET, owned by Defendants-Appellants/Cross-Appellees Ya-Sa Denizcilik Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. and Ya-Sa Ship Management &amp; Trading S.A. (collectively Ya-Sa), Turkish domieiliaries, allided<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the Greek flagged M/V KRI-TI FILOXENIA, owned by Kriti, a Greek domiciliary. Kriti\u2019s vessel \u2014 the only one to sustain physical damages in the accident \u2014 required temporary repairs in Nigeria, and more extensive dry dock repairs in Turkey. The dry dock repairs caused loss of use damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In 2010, Kriti filed this suit against Ya-Sa in the Eastern District of Louisiana, seeking restitution for both the ship\u2019s physical damages as well as for its loss of use damages. The M/V YASA H. MEH-MET was then arrested during an unrelated call to a U.S. port.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In its motion for partial summary judgment, Kriti argued that no foreign law clearly governs this dispute. Accordingly, Kriti contended, the district court should have applied U.S. law. Before the district court ruled on Kriti\u2019s motion, however, the parties settled the physical damages claim. Thereafter, with only the loss of use claim remaining, Kriti filed a supplemental memorandum in which it argued that Nigeria lacks any legal connection to the dispute and that Ya-Sa\u2019s only reason for seeking the application of Nigerian law is to avoid loss of use liability. Kriti therefore contended that if the court declines to apply U.S. law, it should apply the law of Greece or Turkey to resolve that claim. Ya-Sa responded by filing a surreply, in which it argued that Nigerian law should govern because the wrongful act occurred in Nigerian waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The district court agreed with Ya-Sa and denied Kriti\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Kriti then filed a motion to certify this interlocutory appeal. The district court granted Kriti\u2019s motion, finding that the choice-of-law issue is a controlling question of law, and that this question necessitated immediate appeal. This court agreed, and granted leave to address this single issue on interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s choice-of-law determination <em>de novo. Fogleman v. ARAMCO, </em>920 F.2d 278, 282 (5th Cir.1991). Whether U.S. or foreign law governs a maritime tort \u201cdepends on an assessment of eight factors articulated by the Supreme Court\u201d in <em>Lauritzen v. Larsen, </em>345 U.S. 571, 73 S.Ct. 921, 97 L.Ed. 1254 (1953), and <em>Hellenic Lines, Ltd. v. Rhoditis, </em>398 U.S. 306, 90 S.Ct. 1731, 26 L.Ed.2d 252 (1970). <em>Fogleman, </em>920 F.2d at 282. The factors are: (1) the place of the wrongful act; (2) the law of the flag; (3) the allegiance or domicile of the injured party; (4) the allegiance of the defendant shipowner; (5) the place of the contract; (6) the inaccessibility of the foreign forum; (7) the law of the forum; and (8) the shipowner\u2019s base of operations. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Lauritzen, </em>345 U.S. at 582-93, 73 S.Ct. 921; <em>Rhoditis, </em>398 U.S. at 309, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>90 S.Ct. 1731). Because the <em>Lauritzen-Rhoditis </em>test \u201cis not a mechanical one,\u201d counting the number of factors in favor of each nation is not the controlling consideration. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the weight of each factor depends on \u201cthe particular context of the claim and the national interest that might be served by the application of United States law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The district court conducted a thorough analysis of each factor, which we will not repeat. We agree with the district court that Nigeria is the place of the wrongful act, and thus its law should apply. Applying the law of the place of the wrongful act promotes stability in maritime law and comity between nations, key concerns in the international choice-of-law context. <em>See Lauritzen, </em>345 U.S. at 582, 73 S.Ct. 921. Applying Nigerian law, moreover, should not surprise either party, as both vessels intentionally entered the jurisdiction. <em>See Calhoun v. Yamaha Motor Co., </em>216 F.3d 338, 347 (3d Cir.2000). As the district court correctly observed, Nigeria represents Ya-Sa\u2019s and Kriti\u2019s common legal denominator.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">On appeal, Kriti argues that we should treat Turkey, where Kriti\u2019s vessel was repaired in dry dock, as a place where Kriti suffered a \u201csecond\u201d wrongful act. We disagree. Although Kriti incurred its loss of use damages in Turkey, these damages stem entirely from the original Nigerian allision. <em>See Rationis Enterprises Inc. of Panama v. Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co., </em>426 F.3d 580, 587 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he state where the negligence occurred holds the greatest interest in regulating the behavior of the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">We also agree with the district court that none of the other seven <em>Launtzen-Rhoditis </em>factors are determinative. This includes the law of the forum factor, which generally receives little weight in the analysis. <em>See Lauritzen, </em>345 U.S. at 590, 73 S.Ct. 921 (\u201cThe purpose of a conflict-of-laws doctrine is to assure that a case will be treated ... under the appropriate law regardless of the fortuitous circumstances which often determine the forum.\u201d). Kriti\u2019s and Ya-Sa\u2019s presence in the United States is happenstance; therefore, U.S. law should not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Finally, Kriti argues, without any support whatsoever, that Nigerian law and its unique legal structure will effectively nullify Kriti\u2019s loss of use claim. This species of result-oriented argument has no proper bearing on our analysis. <em>See Lauritzen, </em>345 U.S. at 593, 73 S.Ct. 921 (declining to consider the outcome in its choice of law analysis, or which nation\u2019s law would do \u201cthe greater or lesser good.\u201d). Because Nigeria is the situs of the wrongful act, Nigerian law governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Kriti\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b193-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
