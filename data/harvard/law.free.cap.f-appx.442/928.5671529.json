In 2008, Rudisill filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 arguing that his money laundering convictions should be invalidated in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s then-recent decision in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>district court dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition concluding that Rudisill did not meet the requirements for proceeding under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 as set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>248 F.3d 898, 904 (5th Cir.2001). In reviewing the denial of habeas relief, the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">In this case, the district court limited the application of <em>Santos </em>to cases of illegal gambling. The district court did not have the benefit of this court\u2019s contrary reasoning in <em>Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 402-04 (5th Cir.2010), when it reached this conclusion. Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal of Rudisill\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is VACATED, and the matter is REMANDED to determine whether, consistent with <em>Garland, </em>his claim falls within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b954-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
