In 2008, Holloway was charged in a single-count indictment with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base. He was convicted by a jury and was sentenced to life in prison. <em>See United States v. Holloway, </em>377 Fed.Appx. 383, 383-84 (5th Cir.2010). On direct appeal, this court reversed, holding that the Government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Holloway had entered into an agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>with any other person to distribute crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 386-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">In 2010, the Government returned a new indictment charging Holloway with distribution of crack cocaine. Holloway filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on principles of double jeopardy, arguing that because the 2008 and 2010 indictments related to the same cause of action involving events within the same time frame, double jeopardy applied. The district court denied the motion, finding that although an acquittal was won on the conspiracy charge, the Government was allowed to now retry Holloway on the substantive distribution count in the present 2010 indictment because the two charges were dissimilar, did not meet the <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) test, and did not constitute double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Holloway argues that the <em>Blockburger </em>\u201csame-elements\u201d test alone is not sufficient. He contends that this court also requires that the district court \u201cundertake a factually rigorous analysis\u201d to ensure \u201cthat all components of a double-jeopardy challenge, to include the collateral estoppel component, are addressed.\u201d Because this argument was not raised in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">\u201cAs applied against the government in criminal cases, collateral estoppel may either bar a subsequent prosecution, or it may prevent the relitigation of particular facts necessarily established in the prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Neal v. Cain, </em>141 F.3d 207, 210 (5th Cir.1998). Because Holloway has not shown that the factual issue allegedly barred by collateral estoppel, his knowing distribution of a controlled substance, was necessarily decided against the Government in the first trial, the district did not err, much less plainly err, by failing to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel and by failing to conduct \u201ca factually rigorous analysis\u201d of the Government\u2019s case. <em>See Garcia v. Dretke, </em>388 F.3d 496, 501 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Brackett, </em>113 F.3d 1396, 1398-1400 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b958-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
