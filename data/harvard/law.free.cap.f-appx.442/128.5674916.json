California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Sinegal has not filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>During the pendency of this appeal, Sinegal completed his sentence of imprisonment and began a term of supervision. The appeal is, therefore, moot. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>645 F.3d 328 (5th Cir.2011). The appeal is dismissed and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b154-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
