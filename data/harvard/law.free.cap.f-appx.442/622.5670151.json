As the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-20\">In 2000, Concepcion pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to distribute heroin, and the District Court sentenced him to 325 months of imprisonment. This Court affirmed. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 00-2132 (May 10, 2001). Concepcion then filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, which the District Court denied. This Court declined to issue a COA. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 02-4127 (June 19, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">Concepcion then filed a RICO complaint against 56 governmental employees and officials, including judges, U.S. Attorneys and FBI agents. Concepcion pursued this litigation vexatiously; as a result, the District Court entered an order permanently enjoining him \u201cfrom filing further claims in this jurisdiction without leave of the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-23\">Concepcion later filed a motion purportedly brought pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, seeking reconsideration of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. The District Court denied the motion as violative of the injunction, and we denied a certificate of appealability, noting that the motion sought only to attack Concepcion\u2019s underlying conviction, and that the District Court thus lacked jurisdiction to consider what was in reality an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 06-3833 (March 13, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-24\">Concepcion filed a request for permission to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in August 2010. The District Court dismissed the petition without prejudice, and Concepcion eventually paid the filing fee, filed another motion for permission to file the \u00a7 2241 petition, and filed the petition itself (with exhibits). On December 3, 2010, the District Court entered an order directing Concepcion to show cause within 30 days why the request to file the habeas petition should be granted. The order noted that if Concepcion failed to show cause, the request to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>would be denied and the matter terminated. Concepcion filed a response to the Show Cause order, discussing his claims. The District Court denied Concepcion permission to file his habeas petition because although Concepcion\u2019s response \u201cwas to include the submission of a sworn affidavit that the facts upon which he bases his claims are true and include a clear statement of the legal bases for his claims,\u201d his response \u201cdid not comply with the Court\u2019s Order and fail[ed] to show good cause why the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus should be filed.\u201d The District Court also denied his related motions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Concepcion filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We may affirm a district court for any reason supported by the record. <em>Brightwell v. Lehman, </em>637 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir.2011) (citation omitted). It is apparent that Concepcion\u2019s petition is not viable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Concepcion is trying to challenge his 2000 conviction, but a federal prisoner can challenge his conviction or sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his or her detention. <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). This occurs \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent\u201d the petitioner from receiving adequate adjudication of his or her claims under \u00a7 2255. <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. This exception is extremely narrow and applies only in rare circumstances. <em>See, e.g., In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251-52 (3d Cir.1997) (applying exception where an intervening change in the law decriminalized the conduct underlying the petitioner\u2019s conviction and he had no other opportunity to pursue his claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">After considering Concepcion\u2019s petition and submissions to this Court, we find that he has failed to demonstrate that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, as he raised arguments that could have been raised on direct appeal or in his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">For these reasons, we conclude that this appeal presents \u201cno substantial question,\u201d and will therefore summarily affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\">.
