He claims that he was denied due process of law because the Government bolstered its case during its opening statement. Armstrong contends that his conviction must be reversed because the cumulative effect of the Government\u2019s errors so tainted the jury that he could not receive a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">As Armstrong concedes, he failed to object during the Government\u2019s opening statement. Thus, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rice, </em>607 F.3d 133, 138 (5th Cir.2010). A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377 (5th Cir.2009). When those elements are shown, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u201cThe government\u2019s attempt to bolster a witness by vouching for his credibility constitutes error when the prosecutor\u2019s statements \u2018might reasonably have led the jury to believe that the prosecutor possessed extrinsic evidence, not presented to the jury, that convinced the prosecutor of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Binker, </em>795 F.2d 1218, 1223 (5th Cir.1986) (citation omitted). \u201c[F]or bolstering to constitute plain error, the prosecutor must intertwine \u2018his personal and official credibility with the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>831 F.2d 63, 67 (5th Cir.1987) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">The purpose of an opening statement is to present what the evidence would show. <em>United States v. Garza-Vasquez, </em>1994 WL 35615, *5 (5th Cir. Jan.27, 1994) (unpublished). Here, the Government\u2019s opening statement merely provided an overview of the case and the evidence it expected to present. Armstrong has not demonstrated plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
