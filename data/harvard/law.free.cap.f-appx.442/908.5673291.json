He argues that his sentence, which was the result of an upward variance from the recommended guidelines range of 21 to 27 months, is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">With respect to the procedural reasonableness of the sentence, Salizar-Proa argues that the district court erred in finding that he had \u201cfive prior illegal reentry convictions, plus six other removals from this country.\u201d He asserts that, because five of the six referenced removals resulted from his five prior illegal reentry convictions, the district court \u201cdouble-counted\u201d his removals when deciding upon his non-guidelines sentence. He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it relied upon a mistake of fact as justification for his sentence, it failed to take into account the fact that he had a non-violent criminal history, it failed to take into account the fact that he was an \u201citinerant laborer\u201d living a \u201cmeager existence,\u201d and it failed to take into account that he had a heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">The district court\u2019s finding regarding Salizar-Proa\u2019s number of prior removals is reviewed for plain error. \u201cTo preserve error, an objection must be sufficiently specific to alert the district court to the nature of the alleged error and to provide an opportunity for correction.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Salizar-Proa objected in the district court to the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence, he did not alert the district court to any alleged error with respect to its summary of his prior illegal reentry convictions and removals. Accordingly, we review that argument for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>To show plain error, Salizar-Proa must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cQuestions of fact capable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing can never constitute plain error.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Salizar-Proa\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s finding that Salizar-Proa had \u201csix other removals\u201d could easily have been resolved by the district court if he had objected to that finding. Because he did not object to the district court\u2019s finding regarding his number of removals, he cannot show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Regardless, there was no plain error for the additional reason that Salizar-Proa\u2019s substantial rights were not affected. \u201cIn the sentencing context, ... an appellant can show an impact on substantial rights ... where the appellant can show a reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s error, the appellant would have received a lower sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sali-zar-Proa was removed five times following his five illegal convictions and was ordered removed, voluntarily returned, or removed on three other occasions. Salizar-Proa has not shown that if the district court had found that he had been ordered removed, voluntarily returned, or removed a total of eight times, as opposed to finding, as Sali-zar-Proa suggests, that he had been removed a total of eleven times (that is, the five removals following the convictions plus the \u201csix other removals\u201d that the district court found), that there is a reasonable probability that he would have received a lesser sentence. Such a conclusion would be especially difficult to draw in light of the district court\u2019s particular emphasis on Salizar-Proa\u2019s five prior illegal reentry convictions when it discussed why the above-guidelines sentence was warranted under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In contrast, it mentioned the removals only once in passing.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">Salizar-Proa\u2019s above-guidelines sentence is not substantively unreasonable otherwise, either. We consider the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This Court \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court heard Salizar-Proa\u2019s arguments for a within-guidelines sentence and was aware of the above-noted mitigating facts that he advanced. The district court noted, however, that despite Salizar-Proa\u2019s five prior convictions for illegal reentry, he continued to commit the same offense, and it cited specific 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors to support its decision to impose the non-guidelines sentence. Salizar-Proa\u2019s sentence does not unreasonably fail to reflect the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>of the variance is not unreasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence that was outside of the recommended guidelines range.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Because Salizar-Proa has not shown that his sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b935-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
