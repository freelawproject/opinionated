By moving to proceed IFP, Sears challenges the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court may authorize Sears to proceed IFP on appeal if the appeal presents a nonfrivolous issue. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1); <em>see Holmes v. Hardy, </em>852 F.2d 151, 153 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-20\">Sears alleged that the defendant state governor and members of the Louisiana Board of Pardons \u2014 Governor Bobby Jindal, Larry Clark, Eugene Hathaway, Ken<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>neth A. Jones, Henry Powell, and Clement LaFleur, Jr. \u2014 should be enjoined from using changes in Louisiana\u2019s pardon process instituted after his 1971 indictment and subsequent conviction and sentence for murder because the changes \u201ceffectively alter or extend [his] prison terms\u201d in violation of ex post facto provisions contained in the United States Constitution and the Louisiana Constitution. The defendants moved for summary judgment, alleging that Sears\u2019s complaint was time barred by the Louisiana liberative prescription of one year applicable to delictual actions. Sears argued, inter alia, that his complaint was timely under the doctrine of contra non valentem. He reasoned that the doctrine applied because he was unable to bring a \u00a7 1988 challenge to Louisiana\u2019s pardon procedures until the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (holding that the claims of two state prisoners challenging the validity of state procedures for determining parole eligibility were properly brought under \u00a7 1983 and did not have to be brought in a habeas proceeding). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the mov-ants, and it also dismissed the claims against Cain and LeBlanc as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Sears does not dispute (1) the district court\u2019s finding that he had actual or constructive knowledge as early as 1977 that the 1974 constitutional changes had been applied to his sentence or (2) the district court\u2019s finding that he knew or should have known that laws, policies, and practices concerning sentence commutation that had been enacted or adopted thereafter had been applied retroactively to his sentence in 1997 when he sought to have it commuted. Instead, he reiterates his contention that the doctrine of contra non valentem applies to save his claims from a time-bar dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Sears\u2019s reliance on <em>Wilkinson </em>is misplaced. We have long adhered to the rule that <em>Wilkinson </em>later stated for all federal courts. <em>See Orellana v. Kyle, </em>65 F.3d 29, 31 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that \u00a7 1983 was the proper vehicle for a prisoner\u2019s challenge, on due process and ex post facto grounds, to parole procedures that, were the challenge successful, \u201cwould not automatically entitle [him] to accelerated release\u201d); <em>see also Serio v. Members, Louisiana State Board of Pardons, </em>821 F.2d 1112, 1118 (5th Cir.1987). Thus, Sears has failed to show that prescription had not run on his claims when he filed his \u00a7 1983 action in 2006. See <em>Terrebonne Parish Sch. Bd. v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>310 F.3d 870, 877 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Additionally, a failure to reach a result desired by a prisoner-grievant is not a deprivation of due process. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Sears\u2019s claims against LeBlanc and Cain as frivolous. <em>See Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Sears has not shown that his appeal is taken in good faith, i.e., that it presents a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). A non-frivolous issue is one that does not \u201clack an arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we must deny Sears\u2019s IFP motion, <em>see Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586, and dismiss this appeal. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">The district court\u2019s partial dismissal of the complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Center, </em>136 F.3d 458, 460-64 (5th Cir.1998). Sears is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>he will be unable to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">MOTION TO PROCEED IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
