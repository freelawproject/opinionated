The district court sentenced him to 57 months of imprisonment, within the guidelines range of imprisonment of 57 to 71 months. He argues that his within-guidelines sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">When, as here, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">This court has rejected Bustamante\u2019s argument that a prior conviction should not be used to increase both the offense level and the criminal history score, i.e., the double-counting argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). This court has also rejected Bustamante\u2019s assertion that his illegal reentry was simply an international trespass. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">As Bustamante acknowledges, his fast-track argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-64 (5th Cir.2008). As for Busta-mante\u2019s personal history and circumstances, he has not shown that any irrelevant or improper factor was considered, that any relevant factor was not considered, or that the court\u2019s weighing of those factors was a \u201cclear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">Bustamante\u2019s disagreement with the court\u2019s assessment of the referenced factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b172-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
