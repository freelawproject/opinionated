Le-Blanc asserts that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not follow the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 procedure for upward departures and because the district court did not provide adequate reasons for the upward departure. Because LeBlane did not raise these arguments in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-22\">The district court did not plainly err in departing upward based on the inadequacy of LeBlanc\u2019s criminal history category and the violent nature of his actions. The district court expressly referred to the undisputed facts in the Presentence Report (PSR) which provided details concerning LeBlanc\u2019s numerous juvenile and adult criminal convictions that were not counted for purposes of his criminal history score and the violent nature of LeBlanc\u2019s actions. The Guidelines specifically permit a sentencing court to depart upward if it determines \u201cthat the [defendant\u2019s] criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or likelihood of recidivism.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, comment, (backg\u2019d). The district court\u2019s decision to departure upward was permissible under the Guidelines, was based on permissible factors that advanced the objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and was justified by the facts of the case. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). Further, the district court provided adequate reasons to support the upward departure as it adopted the PSR and stated that it was departing upward based on the inadequacy of LeBlanc\u2019s criminal history score and the violent nature of his actions. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>287 Fed.Appx. 384, 385 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Castro-De Los Santos, </em>261 Fed.Appx. 681, 682-83 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-23\">Although the district court did not explicitly state that it rejected the intermedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ate offense levels, the district court\u2019s explanation indicated that it determined that the extent and nature of LeBlanc\u2019s criminal history and the violent nature of his actions warranted no less than 300 months of imprisonment. Further, LeBlanc has not shown that any error affected his substantial rights as he has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the alleged errors, he would have received a lesser sentence. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 438 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">LeBlanc also argues that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. The record indicates that the district court\u2019s rationale justified the upward departure as a whole and that the district court considered the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including LeBlanc\u2019s history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of the instant offenses, the need to deter future criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public and promote respect for the law. <em>See United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 248-49 (5th Cir.), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>479 F.3d 904 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347. Moreover, the extent of the departure was not excessive under the circumstances as it did not exceed the statutory maximum sentences for the offenses, and this court has affirmed similar and more substantial departures. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806-07 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
