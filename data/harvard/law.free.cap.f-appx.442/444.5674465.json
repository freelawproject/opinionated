Swin-dell\u2019s Amended Complaint alleged she was indigent and unable to obtain counsel to represent her in a foreclosure action. She claimed the failure to appoint counsel violated her Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of due process and equal protection. The district court dismissed the Amended Complaint with prejudice, stating the Supreme Court made clear that a right to appointed counsel exists only where the litigant may lose his or her physical liberty and no such risk exists in a foreclosure action. <em>See Lassiter v. Dept. of Soc. Serv. of Durham Cnty., N.C., </em>452 U.S. 18, 25, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">On appeal, Swindell argues her right to counsel and her rights of due process and equal protection were violated when the State of Florida failed to appoint counsel in her foreclosure action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and the briefs in this case and find no merit to this argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court stated an indigent\u2019s right to appointed counsel \u201chas been recognized to exist only where the litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This was a civil foreclosure action and Swindell was not at any risk of losing her physical liberty.
