The BIA dismissed the appeal due to Nava\u2019s prior conviction of an aggravated felony. Our jurisdiction is limited to colorable constitutional issues and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-23\">Nava contends his prior conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon was <em>not </em>an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because his entire sentence was suspended. He asserts that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d) requires one to <em>serve </em>a sentence of one year. Because the question whether Nava has committed an aggravated felony is a legal one, we have jurisdiction to review his petition; it\u2019s reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Dale v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 294, 297 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-24\">The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) as \u201ca crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year\u201d. \u201cAny reference to a term of imprisonment or a sentence with respect to an offense is deemed to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>the period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law <em>regardless of any suspension </em>of the imposition or execution of that imprisonment or sentence in whole or in part.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Therefore, if the sentencing court imposes a sentence of imprisonment, and then suspends it, the sentence nevertheless counts under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) for determining whether the term of imprisonment was at least one year. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Nava\u2019s five-year suspended sentence meets the required term of imprisonment to constitute an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Nava contends his ineligibility for relief from removal, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), violates his Fifth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws. Although our court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(h), we do have jurisdiction \u201cto review the question of law presented by [a] challenge to the BIA\u2019s construction of [\u00a7 1182(h) ]\u201d. <em>Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 541 (5th Cir.2008). An alien\u2019s equal-protection challenge arises under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>E.g., Malagon de Fuentes v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 498, 502-03 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.2006). An equal-protection challenge in this context is subject to rational-basis review. <em>Flores-Ledezma v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">In <em>Malagon de Fuentes, </em>462 F.3d at 506, petitioner maintained, as does Nava, that it was an equal-protection violation for the law to distinguish between lawful permanent residents (LPRs), such as Nava, and aliens who entered the country illegally, for the purpose of \u00a7 1182(h) waiver eligibility. Our court noted: \u201cEvery one of our sister courts to have addressed this question have upheld \u00a7 1182(h)\u2019s apparent favoring of non-LPRs against equal protection attack\u201d. <em>Id. </em>We agreed with those courts that Congress\u2019 distinction between LPRs and inadmissible aliens for \u00a7 1182(h) waiver eligibility has a rational basis. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Nava\u2019s equal-protection contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">Citing <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), Nava contends his conviction for aggravated assault is invalid because he was <em>not </em>properly advised of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. He asserts he has filed a writ of habeas corpus in the criminal court on this basis, and he could <em>not </em>have brought this claim before the BIA because it was <em>not </em>available until after 31 March 2010, when <em>Padilla </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">We lack jurisdiction to address this claim, due to Nava\u2019s conceded failure to exhaust his remedies before the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b960-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
