In his complaint, filed on February 16, 2011, Smith alleged that on May 21, 2004, and on December 22, 2005, while he was incarcerated, prison officials used excessive force against him. The magistrate judge construed Smith\u2019s complaint as one alleging a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and recommended that it be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because Smith\u2019s claims are barred by the statute of limitations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number><em>See Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989) (\u201cwhere state law provides multiple statutes of limitations for personal injury actions, courts considering \u00a7 1983 claims should borrow the general or residual statute for personal injury actions\u201d); <em>Moore v. McDonald, </em>30 F.3d 616, 620 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cTexas\u2019 general personal injury limitations period is two years.\u201d) (citing Tex. Civ. PraC. &amp; Rem.Code ANN. \u00a7 16.003(a)). The district court overruled Smith\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss the complaint with prejudice as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">In his <em>pro se </em>brief, which we construe liberally, Smith seems to contend that a four- or five-year statute of limitations should apply to his claims. Even if we accepted this contention, it would not help Smith, because he filed his complaint more than five years after the complained-of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Smith\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
