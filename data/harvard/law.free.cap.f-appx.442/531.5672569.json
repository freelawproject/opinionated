Aside from passing references, Petitioners\u2019 appellate brief does not raise any arguments regarding relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c); thus, they have abandoned that issue on appeal and we do not address it. <em>Prado-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., </em>75 F.3d 631, 632 (11th Cir.1996) (finding that a petitioner abandons an issue on appeal where he does not seek judicial review of that issue in his brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">Petitioners raise three issues on appeal. First, they argue that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding was clearly erroneous because it was based on hearsay evidence from an overseas investigation. Second, they contend that their former counsel was ineffective because he failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>object to allegedly inadmissible evidence and the interpreter\u2019s allegedly faulty translation during their removal proceedings, which they assert affected the outcome of their case. Third, Petitioners submit that they were deprived their due process right to a full and fair hearing because of faulty translation.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Petitioners are native-born citizens of Uzbekistan seeking asylum protection based on the Azizova\u2019s claims. Petitioners request asylum on the grounds that Azizo-va was forced to flee Uzbekistan after being persecuted by the government based on her political opinion. Azizova taught mathematics at the Polytechnic University Lyceum in Tashkent starting in 1995. In 2002, Azizova researched a concept called \u201ccritical thinking,\u201d presented it to her colleagues, and introduced it into the curriculum with permission of her supervisor. In April 2004, Azizova was instructed by the Department of Internal Affairs of the National Security Service to cease using critical thinking or her employment would be terminated. In June 2004, Azizova spoke out against the Uzbek government in class during a lecture on the comparative minimum wage. She claims that her remarks were sparked by her anger at the recent death of her brother-in-law who, she believed, was arrested due to his political beliefs and who, she believed, died in an Uzbek prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">One week after her lecture, the police arrested Azizova and demanded $1,000 from Rustam, her husband, for her release. He gathered the money, and she was released. Azizova testified that she was ordered to resign on September 2, 2004, although an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) through the American Embassy in Uzbekistan produced evidence that she resigned on September 2, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">In January 2005, Azizova and a friend were arrested, held for five days, and assessed a f\u00edne of $500. Azizova did not mention beatings during this confinement in either her asylum application or in her testimony on direct examination. However, on cross-examination Azizova testified that she had been beaten by the police during this detention. Addressing the discrepancy, she stated that it was difficult for her to remember what happened. In June 2005 the police raided Petitioners\u2019 home and \u201ctook everything,\u201d including the \u201cworkbook\u201d Azizova kept with official stamps noting the start and end dates of her government employment. They also threatened Rustam at his business and told him that unless he paid $1,000 per month, his family would be harmed. Azi-zova produced a copy of her workbook indicating a resignation date of September 2, 2004 to the IJ in September 2009. She stated that her daughter who is still in Uzbekistan had a copy and sent it to her over the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Farida was admitted to the United States on August 18, 2005 on a nonimmi-grant exchange-student visa, and in January 2006 Azizova attempted to visit Farida. Azizova was detained in the airport, transferred to Internal Affairs, and imprisoned. In her asylum testimony, Azizova testified that she had been beaten once during this period. In the hearing before the IJ, she testified that she was beaten once per month, if not once per week. When confronted with the contradictory testimony, she stated that her asylum application contained only major events. Internal Affairs demanded $4,000 for her release. After six months, Rustam was able to gather the money and she was released. Rustam paid people to bring Azizova through the Uzbek airport, and so she was able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>travel to the United States in September 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On September 17, 2006, Azizova and Rustam were admitted to the United States on nonimmigrant visas. In the spring of 2007, Azizova filed an application for asylum protection, listing her husband Rustam and her daughter Farida as derivative beneficiaries. They appeared in Immigration Court in August and September of 2009. At the conclusion of the hearings, the IJ denied Azizova\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. After a timely notice of appeal, the BIA dismissed Azizova\u2019s appeal and entered a final order of removal on December 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As part of the investigation into the merits of the claim, the IJ requested that DHS verify Azizova\u2019s story. As part of this investigation, they contacted the embassy in Uzbekistan. This investigation led to evidence inconsistent with Azizova\u2019s statements. The Human Resources department at the Lyceum indicated that Azizo-va\u2019s supervisor had been terminated in December 2008 or January 2004, not in the spring of 2004, and that Azizova had resigned in September 2003, not in September 2004. These facts were stated in an email from Rachel Waldstein, with a State Department email address, to Thomas Ayz, a DHS employee working at the Miami Office of Chief Counsel. Ayz testified before the IJ as to the contents of this email.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004). To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 817. We also review constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1143 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). However, \u201c[ijnsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he qualifies as a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). To meet this burden, \u201cthe applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">To be withheld from removal under the INA, an alien must show that his life or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to her country. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005) (per cu-riam). Because this standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum, an alien who fails to establish eligibility under the refugee status is generally precluded from qualifying for withholding of removal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The trier of fact must determine credibility, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. Under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, we will not reverse an administrative credibility finding unless \u201cthe evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">While an adverse credibility finding may be sufficient to support denial of asylum, such a determination does not relieve the fact finder of his duty to consider other evidence presented by the applicant. <em>Id.; Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). However, \u201c[o]nce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the ... credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. The alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended the INA\u2019s asylum provisions under INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), to provide that an adverse credibility determination can be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods, regardless of whether they relate to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), (d), 119 Stat. 302, 303-05 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">In this case, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on a number of omissions, inconsistencies, and contradictions among Azizova\u2019s testimony, asylum application, and overseas investigations. Weighing this evidence, the IJ found that Azizova lacked credibility due to the cumulative material inconsistencies. The IJ based his adverse credibility finding on: inconsistent evidence as to the date of Azizova\u2019s resignation and authenticity of letters from her former employer; Azizova\u2019s contradictory statements regarding her employment status; Azizova\u2019s offering the death certificate of her father-in-law rather than that of her brother-in-law; Azizova\u2019s presenting evidence from her workbook when she claimed it had been seized by the government; and Azi-zova\u2019s cursory explanation of the \u201ccritical thinking\u201d curriculum, implementation of which she alleges is one of the bases of her persecution. We find that substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>dence supports the determination by the BIA and the IJ that Azizova\u2019s testimony was not credible. The BIA\u2019s finding that Azizova\u2019s testimony was incredible, together with the insufficient corroborative evidence that she submitted, do not compel a reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision to deny relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Pursuant to the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, \u201c[a]liens enjoy the right to the effective assistance of counsel in deportation proceedings.\u201d <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted) (involving an application for discretionary suspension of deportation). \u201c[T]o establish the ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of a deportation hearing, an alien must establish that his or her counsel\u2019s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing such that the alien was unable to reasonably present his or her case.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>371 F.3d 771, 774-75 (11th Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, a petitioner seeking to reopen her proceedings due to ineffective assistance of counsel must show that counsel\u2019s performance was so deficient that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We have held that an attorney\u2019s deficient representation does not deprive an alien of due process if the inadequate representation only prevents him from being eligible for purely discretionary relief from removal. <em>Mejia Rodriguez, </em>178 F.3d at 1146, 1148. However, aliens do have a protected interest in petitioning for asylum. <em>Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Smith, </em>676 F.2d 1023, 1038 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (finding \u201cin the federal regulations establishing an asylum procedure ... a clear intent to grant aliens the right to submit and the opportunity to substantiate their claim for asylum\u201d). While the grant of asylum is a matter of discretion lying with the Attorney General, his discretion is not unlimited as it is in purely discretionary relief from removal. INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (\u201cThe Attorney General\u2019s discretionary judgment whether to grant [asylum relief] shall be conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d). Thus, the BIA erred in finding that the Petitioners\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim was barred due to the discretionary nature of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Nevertheless, Petitioners\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on the non-discretionary withholding of removal was heard by the BIA. Because the Petitioners\u2019 asylum and withholding of removal claims are predicated on the same hearing and the same facts, the BIA\u2019s failure to address their ineffective assistance of counsel claim for asylum is not reason to remand. <em>See Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. Kraus-Anderson Const. Co., </em>607 F.3d 1268, 1274 n. 11 (11th Cir.2010) (noting that remand is futile when the opinion explores all possibilities of the complainant\u2019s allegations).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Petitioners\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails because they did not show that their former counsel\u2019s performance was so deficient that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings, nor did they show that former counsel\u2019s actions prejudiced the outcome. <em>See Dak-ane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">The Petitioners\u2019 first basis for their claim is a failure to object to evidence containing multiple hearsay. To find ineffective assistance of counsel, we must find both that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that this deficient performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>resulted in prejudice affecting the outcome of the proceedings. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the email in which the Department of State official provided information stating that Azizova resigned one year prior to the date she claims amounted to deficient performance, Petitioners have not shown that the outcome of their case was prejudiced by such a finding. As stated above, Azizova\u2019s resignation date was one of the inconsistencies upon which the IJ based his credibility finding, but not the only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Additionally, Petitioners argue that their counsel was ineffective for failing to object to faulty translation. Petitioners again fail to establish that they were prejudiced by failure to object to the translation. They have indicated neither what the ruling on an objection would have been, nor how it would have changed the result of the case. The adverse credibility finding was premised not only on inconsistencies in the testimony at trial, but also on omissions and inconsistencies between information from various sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Therefore, we do not find that the petitioners met the standard to show ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\u201cThe presence of a competent interpreter is important to the fundamental fairness of a hearing, if the alien cannot speak English fluently.\u201d <em>Matter of Tomas, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 465 (BIA 1987). There is no due process violation where an interpreter translated all the questions asked of the alien and there was no complaint by the petitioner\u2019s attorney at the hearing that the hearing was unfair or that the petitioner was unaware of what was transpiring. <em>Soares v. I.N.S., </em>449 F.2d 621, 623 (5th Cir.1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Because an interpreter was present at the proceedings and translated all the questions, and Petitioners\u2019 former attorney did not complain that Azizova was unaware of what was transpiring during the proceedings or make any objections to the translation, there was no due process violation. <em>See Soares, </em>449 F.2d at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">. We have adopted Fifth Circuit precedent decided before the Circuit split in 1981 as binding as binding on this court. <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
