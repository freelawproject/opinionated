De Los Santos-Vallejo now appeals the judgment of the district court and requests that this court order the modification of his presen-fence report (PSR), which incorrectly concluded that De Los Santos-Vallejo\u2019s statutory maximum term of imprisonment was 20 years, implying that he should be sentenced pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) rather than \u00a7 1326(b)(1), and of the judgment, which merely cites \u00a7 1326(b) in reference to De Los Santos-Vallejo\u2019s punishment. De Los Santos-Vallejo concedes that he did not object on these grounds in the district court. The Government agrees that the judgment should be modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-21\">Because De Los Santos-Vallejo did not object in the district court, we review for plain error his argument that the PSR should be modified. A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 371, 175 L.Ed.2d 124 (2009). When those elements are shown, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-24\">We decline to order the modification of the PSR, as De Los Santos-Vallejo has not demonstrated that the error therein affects his substantial rights. However, the judgment is modified to reflect that De Los Santos-Vallejo was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 369 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-25\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
