After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s removal jurisdiction. <em>Henson v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., </em>261 F.3d 1065, 1068 (11th Cir.2001). As a general rule, however, we cannot review a district court\u2019s decision remanding a case to state court. <em>Hernandez v. Seminole Cnty., Fla., </em>334 F.3d 1233, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2003); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). This rule, codified in \u00a7 1447(d), applies when the district court concludes that it \u201clack[s] removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1441 [because] the case is not one over which the court has original jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Cogdell v. Wyeth, </em>366 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir.2004). But \u00a7 1447(d) expressly permits appellate review of an order remanding a case to state court if the case was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. Thus, where an appellant challenges a district court\u2019s order remanding a case that was removed pursuant to \u00a7 1443, we must determine whether the district court properly remanded the proceeding based on an implicit finding that removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443 does not exist. <em>See Alabama v. Conley, </em>245 F.3d 1292, 1293 n. 1 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In this case, we previously dismissed Taylor\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, pursuant to \u00a7 1447(d), but upon Taylor\u2019s motion for reconsideration, we reinstated the appeal \u201cfor the limited purpose of reviewing the district court\u2019s remand of an action removed to federal court pursuant to ... \u00a7 1443.\u201d Accordingly, we now address the only remaining issue in this appeal: Whether the district court erred in implicitly finding that the action was not properly removed to federal court pursuant to \u00a7 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Under \u00a7 1443, a defendant may remove an action if it is brought:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">(1) Against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">(2) For any act under color of authority derived from any law providing for equal rights, or for refusing to do any act on the ground that it would be inconsistent with such law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">A removal petition filed pursuant to \u00a7 1443(1) must satisfy the two-prong test developed in <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 792, 794, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 1790-91, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966). \u201cFirst, the petitioner must show that the right upon which the petitioner relies arises under a federal law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u201d <em>Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295 (quotation marks omitted). This \u201cdoes not include rights of general application available to all persons or citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). We have also explained that \u201cbroad assertions under the Equal Protection Clause ... are insufficient to support a valid claim for removal under \u00a7 1443(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1295-96. \u201cSecond, the petitioner must show that he has been denied or cannot enforce that right in the state courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1295. This provision normally requires that the denial be \u201cmanifest in a formal expression of the state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1296 (quotation marks omitted). Blanket charges that a defendant is unable to obtain a fair trial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>state court are insufficient to support removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Taylor failed to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Rachel </em>test. <em>See id. </em>at 1295. In essence, Taylor argues that the case is removable under \u00a7 1443 because the City of Lake Worth violated her due process and equal protection rights by intervening without notice in her quiet title action well after final judgment in her favor and after the statute of limitations had expired. In both her Notice of Removal and Amended Notice of Removal, Taylor alleged that the City\u2019s enforcement of its regulations constituted a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">[t]he City of Lake Worth\u2019s practices of not having its claim reduced to judgment, not having first commenced a separate action at law for collections of the claim and asserting a claim after it is barred by the statute of limitations are a violation of the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution of the United States, as well as the balance of the other parts of the Constitution of the United States and its Amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Thus, Taylor relies on \u201crights of general application available to all persons or citizens\u201d and makes \u201cbroad assertions under the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d both of which we have found \u201cinsufficient to support a valid claim for removal under \u00a7 1443(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1295-96 (quotation marks omitted). Because Taylor has not shown that she relied upon a right that arose under a federal law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality, we conclude that this case was not properly removable under \u00a7 1443(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">We also conclude that the action was not properly removable to federal district court under \u00a7 1443(2), which provides removal \u201c[f|or any act under color of authority derived from any law providing for equal rights, or for refusing to do any act on the ground that it would be inconsistent with such law.\u201d The first clause under \u00a7 1443(2), dealing with \u201cany act under col- or of authority,\u201d confers the right to remove only upon \u201cfederal officers or agents and those authorized to act with or for them in affirmatively executing duties under any federal law providing for equal civil rights.\u201d <em>City of Greenwood v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 824, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 1810, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966). The second clause under \u00a7 1443(2), dealing with \u201crefusing to do any act on the ground that it would be inconsistent with such law,\u201d allows the right to remove only to state officers. <em>Id. </em>at 824, 86 S.Ct. at 1810 n. 22. Taylor has not shown that she is a state or federal officer, or working for one. We therefore conclude that Taylor did not properly remove the case under \u00a7 1443.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AD-\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">. In her reply brief, Taylor asserts for the first time that she relies upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985. Aside from her statement that these statutes protect her right to \"make and enforce[] contracts,\u201d Taylor does not explain how her claims fall within \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1985. We recognize that \u00a7 1981 does satisfy the first prong of the <em>Rachel </em>test, and we have previously assumed without deciding that \u00a7 1985 may as well. <em>See Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1296. However, \u201cwe do not address arguments raised for the first time in a <em>pro se </em>litigant's reply brief.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, we do not consider Taylor\u2019s belated and conclu-sory assertions that her claims fall within \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\">. We also reject Taylor\u2019s argument that the defendants waived their right to seek remand. Although non-jurisdictional challenges to removal can be waived, such as through the failure to file a timely motion to remand, <em>see Wilson v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>888 F.2d 779, 781 n. 1 (11th Cir.1989), the district court may \u2014 and, indeed, must \u2014 remand a removed case <em>sua sponte </em>\u201d[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c); <em>see Corporate Mgmt. Advisors, Inc. v. Artjen Complexus, Inc., </em>561 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also Burr &amp; Forman v. Blair, </em>470 F.3d 1019, 1035 n. 38 (11th Cir.2006) (\"[Fjederal courts are duty bound to consider their subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte.\"). </em>Here, the district court's <em>sua sponte </em>remand was plainly for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c), and therefore \"the concepts of equity, waiver, and estoppel are inapplicable,\u201d because \"[t]he subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts is limited by the Constitution and the Congress, and cannot be expanded by judicial interpretation or by the acts or consent of the parties to a case.\u201d <em>In re Carter, </em>618 F.2d 1093, 1100 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see also Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc) (adopting as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before the close of business on September 30, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
