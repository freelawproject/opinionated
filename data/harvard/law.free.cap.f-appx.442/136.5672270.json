Moulder, </em>141 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>F.3d 568, 571 (5th Cir.1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn determining whether the terms of the plea bargain have been violated, [our] court must determine whether the government\u2019s conduct is consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>309 F.3d 882, 886 (5th Cir.2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Our court reviews a breach-of-plea-agreement claim <em>de novo; </em>the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>393 F.3d 540, 546 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In exchange for Hernandez\u2019 plea, the Government agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[a]t the time of sentencing, ... not to oppose defendant\u2019s anticipated request ... that he/ she receive a two (2) level downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. Section 3El.l(a) <em>should the defendant accept responsibility as contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines </em>\u201d. (Emphasis added.) But, in the light of Hernandez\u2019 assault on his co-defendant, the district court determined that Hernandez had obstructed justice and was, therefore, <em>not </em>entitled to an acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment. The court also determined Hernandez had <em>not </em>given truthful testimony at the sentencing hearing and this was a further basis for denying the adjustment. Hernandez does <em>not </em>challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s determinations that he obstructed justice and gave untruthful testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Guidelines \u00a7 3E1.1 provides for a decrease of up to three levels if defendant accepts responsibility for his offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). \u201cIf a defendant enters a guilty plea prior to trial, truthfully admits the conduct comprising the offense, and admits, or at least does not falsely deny, any additional relevant conduct for which he is accountable, the court may find significant evidence of the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 648 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n.3). On the other hand, and understandably, conduct such as obstructing justice \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Because Hernandez did <em>not </em>accept responsibility under the Guidelines, the condition triggering the Government\u2019s obligation <em>not </em>to oppose Hernandez\u2019 request for an adjustment was <em>not </em>fulfilled; the Government was, therefore, <em>not </em>in breach of the agreement by opposing his request for an acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment. <em>See United States v. Mejia, </em>No. 93-2611, 1994 WL 243287, *1 (5th Cir. May 19, 1994) (unpublished); <em>see also </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5.3 (unpublished opinion before 1996 is precedential). Hernandez\u2019 contention-that the Government remained contractually bound by the plea agreement because it failed to follow the procedure established by the agreement to determine if a breach by Hernandez had occurred-is unavailing. Because a breach of the agreement by Hernandez was <em>not </em>at issue in district court, the provision on which he relies was <em>not </em>implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b162-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
