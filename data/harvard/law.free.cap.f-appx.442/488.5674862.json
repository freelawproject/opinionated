Wu filed a timely motion to reopen after the BIA affirmed an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) denial of Wu\u2019s first application for asylum and withholding of removal, which was based on his fear of being persecuted on account of his political opinion. Wu wished to reopen his removal proceedings so that he could file a new application for asylum and withholding of removal, based on his fear of persecution on account of his Christian religion. On appeal, Wu argues that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen because he made a <em>prima facie </em>showing that he was eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cMotions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-16\">A motion to reopen may only be granted if the alien presents to the BIA new evidence that is material and could not have been discovered or presented at the removal hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). \u201cAn alien who attempts to show that the evidence is material bears a heavy burden and must present evidence that demonstrates that, if the proceedings were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">At a minimum, there are at least three independent grounds upon which the [BIA] may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case [that the petitioner is entitled to relief]; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\"><em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d at 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">To make a <em>prima facie </em>case for asylum, a movant must set forth \u201cdetailed, specific facts\u201d to establish \u201cthat [ ]he has a well-founded fear that [ ]he will be persecuted if removed to h[is] home country.\u201d <em>Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57. The movant also must show \u201cthat race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). If an alien fails to show that he is entitled to asylum, he necessarily fails to meet the more demanding burden of proving his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Xia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>608 F.3d 1233, 1237 n. 4 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">In light of the evidence that Wu submitted in support of his motion to reopen, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Wu failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for asylum or withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, although Wu stated in his affidavit that he intended to practice Christianity in China, he did not state that he intended to do so in any particular church, much less an unauthorized house church. The 2007 Religious Freedom Report indicates that Christianity is one of five authorized religions in China and that the government\u2019s interference with Christian worship targets members of unregistered house churches. Notably, Wu\u2019s petition to reopen his removal proceedings is almost entirely devoid of \u201cdetailed, specific facts\u201d establishing an objective fear of persecution on account of his religious practice. <em>Mohammed, </em>547 F.3d at 1345. Wu did not explain whether his religious beliefs would prevent him from attending a Christian church, or under what circumstances. We think he has presented precious little to establish \u201ca well-founded fear that []he will be persecuted if removed to h[is] home country,\u201d <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57, let alone that his new motion is even remotely specific enough to rest his considerable burden in moving to reconsider the BIA\u2019s original determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Second, the 2007 Religious Freedom Report and the news articles submitted by Wu indicate that the government\u2019s treatment of Christian house church members varies widely from region to region. Although the 2007 Religious Freedom Report mentions that government officials closed some house churches in Fujian Province in 2007, most of the reports in the record identify other regions of China as being more dangerous for house church worshipers, and many of the articles that Wu submitted detailed events that occurred three to five years before the filing of his motion to reopen. Thus, it is not clear that the government\u2019s interference with Christian house churches in Fujian Province currently is so widespread as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>create a well-founded fear of future persecution. Additionally, although the letter of Wu\u2019s neighbor details the arrest of members of one particular house church in Fujian Province, it is not clear that Wu intends to attend this particular church upon returning to China. The single incident described by Wu also does not establish widespread persecution of Christian house church members in Fujian Province. As a result, Wu failed to establish that his fear of future persecution was well-founded, and the BIA, therefore, properly found that he failed to make <em>prima facie </em>showing of eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57; <em>Xia, </em>608 F.3d at 1237 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\">. To the extent that Wu challenges the BIA\u2019s failure to consider the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2010 Religious Freedom Report, his argument is meritless, because Wu did not submit this report to the BIA and it is not included in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
