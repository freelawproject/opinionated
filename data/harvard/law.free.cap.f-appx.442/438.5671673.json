Wilcox appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Social Security Administration Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability, disability insurance benefits, and supplemental security income under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and 1383(c)(3). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">When reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence, and we seek to ensure that was based on the proper legal standards. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation -marks omitted). Where the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). In our review, \u201c[w]e may not decide facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (alteration omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">The Social Security Administration applies the following five-step, sequential analysis to determine whether an applicant is entitled to disability benefits. First, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). If not, at the second step, the ALJ must determine whether the impairment or combination of impairments from which the claimant allegedly suffers is \u201csevere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If there is no severe impairment, the claimant is not deemed to be disabled, and the claim is denied. <em>Id. </em>At the third step, the ALJ must decide whether the claimant\u2019s severe impairments meet or medically equal a listed impairment. <em>Id. </em>If so, the fourth step requires the ALJ to assess the claimant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d and whether she can perform her \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If she cannot perform her past relevant work, then the ALJ moves to the fifth step, considering whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s disability, she can perform other work. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">Wilcox\u2019s appeal concerns the third and fourth steps. <em>See id. </em>Specifically, Wilcox argues that the ALJ erred by (1) giving greater weight to the medical opinion of a non-treating specialist than to her own physician, and (2) failing to credit her subjective experience of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">\n<em>A. Weight Given to Physician Opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">Social security regulations provide guidelines for the ALJ in evaluating medical opinion evidence. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527. The ALJ may consider many factors when weighing medical evidence, including the claimant\u2019s relationship with the examining or treating physician, whether a medical opinion is well-supported, whether a medical opinion is consistent with the claimant\u2019s record, and a doctor\u2019s specialization. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d). Generally, the opinions of examining or treating physicians are given more weight than non-examining or non-treating physicians unless \u201cgood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(1), (2); <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). We have found \u201cgood cause\u201d where the opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the physician\u2019s own medical records or where the evidence supported a contrary finding. <em>See Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. Finally, the opinions of specialists regarding medical issues related to his area of specialty generally are given more weight than the opinions of non-specialists. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">As our limited review precludes us from reweighing the evidence, we will find no reversible error when the ALJ has articulated specific reasons for failing to give the opinion of a treating physician controlling weight, if those reasons are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Additionally, the ultimate issue of disability is left to the determination of the Commissioner, and, thus, a statement by a medical source that a claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cunable to work\u201d is not binding on the ALJ. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Here, we are satisfied that the ALJ\u2019s articulated reasons for failing to accord controlling weight to Dr. Jones\u2019s opinion are supported by substantial evidence. We cannot reweigh the evidence related to Wilcox\u2019s claim anew; thus, we conclude that the ALJ did not err by giving greater weight to the medical opinion of a non-treating specialist than to Wilcox\u2019s own treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>B. Assessment of Wilcox\u2019s Credibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">A three-part \u201cpain standard\u201d applies when a claimant attempts to establish disability through his own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). The standard requires the court to review (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition, and (2) either objective medical evidence that confirms (a) the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition, or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition is of such a severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain. <em>Id. </em>A \u201cclaimant\u2019s subjective testimony supported by medical evidence that satisfies the standard is itself sufficient to support a finding of disability.\u201d <em>Brown v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1233, 1236 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cIndeed, in certain situations, pain alone can be disabling, even when its existence is unsupported by objective evidence.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1561 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam). But if the ALJ decides not to credit such testimony, he must discredit it explicitly, and articulate adequate reasons for doing so. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Here, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence and that the ALJ articulated adequate reasons for discrediting Wilcox\u2019s subjective testimony. The ALJ found that her impairments reasonably could be expected to produce the alleged symptoms, but that her statements on the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of the symptoms were not entirely credible. In support of this finding, the ALJ considered Wilcox\u2019s testimony together with all of the medical evidence in the record. Thus, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Upon a thorough review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
