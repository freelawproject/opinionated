Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-19\">Our court lacks jurisdiction over denial of the temporary restraining order; therefore, Flores\u2019 appeal of that ruling is dismissed. <em>Faulder v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 741, 742 (5th Cir.1999). Our court does have jurisdiction to review denial of the preliminary injunction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-20\">The denial of a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g. Women\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Bell, </em>248 F.3d 411, 418-19 (5th Cir.2001). A movant for a preliminary injunction must demonstrate each of the following: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat that failure to grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury; (3) the threatened injury outweighs any damage that the injunction will cause to the adverse party; and (4) the injunction will <em>not </em>have an adverse effect on the public interest. <em>Id. </em>at 419 n. 15. \u201cThe denial of a preliminary injunction will be upheld where the movant has failed sufficiently to establish <em>any one </em>of the four criteria.\u201d <em>Black Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n v. City of Dallas, </em>905 F.2d 63, 65 (5th Cir.1990) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-21\">In denying the preliminary injunction, the magistrate judge determined Flores\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>allegations failed to \u201cdemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, that the threatened injury outweighed any damage that might be caused to the Defendants, or that the requested relief was not adverse to the public interest\u201d. Flores\u2019 brief, liberally construed, challenges only the first of the magistrate judge\u2019s determinations; he does <em>not </em>address the other two. Because Flores has <em>not </em>shown he meets each of the four prerequisites for a preliminary injunction, he has <em>not </em>shown the magistrate judge abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Flores also asserts the magistrate judge erred by <em>not </em>holding an evidentiary hearing and ordering discovery and briefing on his request for injunctive relief. Our court reviews this matter for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g. Anderson v. Jackson, </em>556 F.3d 351, 360-61 (5th Cir.2009). Flores\u2019 assertion is without merit. He does <em>not </em>state what additional testimony and evidence would have been adduced at an evidentiary hearing that was <em>not </em>already presented at the <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985) hearing, and he does <em>not </em>state how discovery and briefing would have changed the proceedings\u2019 outcome. Flores\u2019 unsupported allegations are insufficient to establish an abuse of discretion. The denial of the preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
