Smith, Texas prisoner # 855314, seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal in part and grant of summary judgment to the defendants in part of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Smith is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-18\">Smith argues that the district court erred by not granting him a default judgment because the defendants did not file a timely answer. However, a district judge has discretion to determine that a default judgment \u201cshould not be granted on the claim, without more, that the defendant had failed to meet a procedural time requirement.\u201d <em>Lacy v. Sitel Corp., </em>227 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Since Smith has failed to make the necessary showing, the district court did not abuse its discretion. Because Smith\u2019s appeal is frivolous, the IFP motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Smith\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also denied. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-21\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). As Smith has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Smith v. Sheeley, </em>No. 6:09-CV-002, slip op. at 1 (W.D.Tex. Aug. 20, 2009) (unpublished); <em>Smith v. Owens, </em>No. 5:09-CV-181, slip op. at 1, 2010 WL 786304 (E.D.Tex. Mar. 8, 2010) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-22\">IFP MOTION DENIED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
