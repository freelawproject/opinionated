He contends that the above-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, he argues that the sentence was more than double the lowest sentence recommended by the what the parties agreed was the correct guidelines range, that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 double counted his criminal history and overstated the seriousness of his relatively minor trespassing offense, that the Guidelines failed to account for his benign motive for returning to the United States, and that he was ignorant of the serious sentence he faced for illegally reentering the United States. He also argues that the district court\u2019s comments at sentencing demonstrated a disdain for circuit precedent and appellate review, thereby undermining respect for the law and the perception of fairness in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">We review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing an above-guidelines sentence for substantive reasonableness, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We also review whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence and give deference to the district court\u2019s determination that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the variance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">Before imposing sentence, the district court considered the two possible guidelines ranges, the applicable policy statements, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the facts set forth in the presentence report, and Hernandez-Portillo\u2019s arguments in mitigation of his sentence. The district court made an individualized assessment and concluded that neither range adequately took into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although Hernandez-Portillo\u2019s 36-month sentence is 15 months greater than the top of the 15-to 21-month guidelines range and three months greater than the top of the 27- to 33-month guidelines range, we have upheld variances considerably greater than the increase to his sentence. <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 348-50; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 441-42 (5th Cir.2006). We have also held that a district court may impose a non-guidelines sentence based upon its disagreement with the Guidelines, <em>United States v. Herrerar-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530-31 (5th Cir.2008), and rejected arguments that double counting renders a sentence unreasonable, <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Hernandez-Portillo\u2019s arguments do not show a clear error of judgment on the district court\u2019s part in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; instead, they constitute a mere disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of those factors. Given the significant deference that is due to a district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the district court\u2019s reasons for its sentencing decision, Hernandez-Portillo has not demonstrated that the sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-53, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
