In his appeal he argued that the IJ abused its discretion in failing to consider his membership in a particular social group. The BIA dismissed his appeal, however, finding that he did not define the social group or provide a persuasive argument for disturbing the IJ\u2019s decision. Velasco-Rojas then filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA in which he argued that the BIA had failed to consider that he was persecuted on the basis of his political opinion. The BIA denied Velasco-Rojas\u2019 motion to reconsider, reasoning that his arguments in that motion related only to a political opinion claim and did not assert a specific error with respect to the BIA\u2019s previous deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>mination that he did not belong to a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v.

An alien may file a motion requesting that the BIA reconsider a prior decision, but that motion must specify the errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s previous order and must be supported by pertinent authority. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Velasco-Rojas\u2019 motion to reconsider. Contrary to his argument, the BIA did not improperly refuse to consider his political opinion claim, which Velasco-Roj as did not present to the BIA in his initial appeal. His motion to reconsider did not specify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s previous order.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
