He also appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying his motion for extension of time to file a notice of appeal. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AgX\">A. Proceedings in Bankruptcy Court</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-26\">This appeal arises from an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court between the debtor, Appellant Michael Anthony Brewer (\u201cBrewer\u201d), and Appellee Gary C. Lindros (\u201cLindros\u201d). Brewer <em>pro se </em>filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. In bankruptcy court, Lindros filed an adversary proceeding against Brewer, objecting to the discharge of Brewer\u2019s debt. Brewer continued to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-27\">On July 23, 2010, following a trial, the bankruptcy court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered a judgment against Brewer on two of the counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>in Lindros\u2019s complaint: failure to maintain adequate records in conducting business, (Count 2), and knowingly making false statements under oath by filing false schedules and statements with the bankruptcy court (Count 3). The bankruptcy court denied Brewer\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">In its order denying Brewer\u2019s discharge, the bankruptcy court noted Brewer had not complied with the scheduling order and in fact did not file his witness or exhibit lists until after the trial began. The court granted Lindros\u2019s motion to strike Brewer\u2019s witness and exhibit lists as untimely, which prohibited Brewer from offering documentary or testimonial evidence other than his own testimony and evidence admitted at a previous hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In explaining its sanction, the bankruptcy court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-5\">Defendant is not a novice at litigation in this Court or in the state court. Defendant has elected to represent himself in whole or in part in five separate adversary proceedings associated with this bankruptcy case. As such, Defendant is tasked with being familiar with and complying with the orders of the Court. The fact that he is a pro se litigant does not excuse his failure to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">Notice of the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment was sent to Brewer on July 28, 2010. On August 13, 2010, Brewer, <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u201cMotion for Extension of Time for Notice of Appeal,\u201d which he later amended, stating he had received the judgment on July 31 and his attorney had been out of town and unable to file the notice of appeal on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">On August 25, the bankruptcy court denied the motion, noting that Brewer\u2019s notice of appeal was due within fourteen days of the entry of judgment under Bankruptcy Rule 8002(a). The bankruptcy court concluded that, under Rule 8002(c), Brewer had failed to show excusable neglect for the delay to warrant a time extension for filing the notice of appeal. The bankruptcy court noted that Brewer had represented himself <em>pro </em>se \u201cin numerous matters before this Court,\u201d and could have filed a notice of appeal without the assistance of counsel, just as he filed his motion for extension of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">On September 7, 2010, in bankruptcy court Brewer filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration/Rehearing for Extension of Time to File an Appeal,\u201d which the bankruptcy court denied on October 7, 2010. On October 18, 2010, Brewer filed a notice of appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s October 7 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">B. Proceedings in District Court</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">On January 11, 2011, the district court clerk filed a \u201cNotice of Filing Bankruptcy Appeal in the District Court,\u201d notifying the parties that, on January 10, 2011, the record on appeal from the bankruptcy court was filed. The notice advised the parties that they must comply with Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8009 and Local Rule 1.05 for the Middle District of Florida.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>On January 26, 2011, Appellee Lindros filed a motion in district court to dismiss Brewer\u2019s appeal, arguing that under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8009, Brewer was required to serve and file a brief within 14 days after entry of the appeal on the district court docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">On February 1, 2011, Brewer, <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u201cMotion for Extension of Time to File Brief,\u201d contending that he received the district court clerk\u2019s notice on January 14, 2011 and mailed his motion 14 days later, making his motion timely under \u201cthe fifteen day deadline per Rule 8009.\u201d Brewer also requested more time \u201cbecause he has never filed an appeal and needs more time to understand the process and format required.\u201d Brewer stated that he needed assistance from an attorney to comply with the proper requirements and could not locate Local Rule 1.05 after searching diligently. Brewer also filed a motion to strike Lindros\u2019s motion to dismiss, arguing that Brewer\u2019s motion for extension of time was timely, and citing a typographical error in the style of Lind-ros\u2019s motion. Brewer did not file a substantive answer to Lindros\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Lindros responded, noting that Brewer had a history in the bankruptcy court of missing deadlines, claiming ignorance, and seeking extensions. Lindros contended, \u201cAppellant will do nothing and file nothing unless and until he is forced by a court do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Brewer never filed an initial appellate brief in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">On February 10, 2011, the district court issued a two-paragraph order denying Brewer\u2019s motion for extension of time, granting Lindros\u2019s motion to dismiss, and affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. The district court stated in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-12\">This Cause is before the Court on Appellant\u2019s Motion for Extension of Time (Dkt.6) and Appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (Dkt.5). Appellant seeks leave of court to file an untimely appeal brief based on the fact that he is proceeding pro se.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-13\">While the Court would ordinarily grant this type of request, in the instant case Appellant fails to cite good cause for missing the deadline. Further, the underlying bankruptcy order being appealed is a denial of appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider a motion for extension of time to file his appeal. Given the fact that Appellant has a history of missing deadlines, and fails to articulate a legitimate reason for missing the deadline for filing his brief in this case, it is ORDERED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-15\">2. Appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (Dkt.5) is GRANTED; the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED. The clerk is directed to close the file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-14\">1. Appellant\u2019s Motion for Extension of Time (Dkt.6) is DENIED;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-16\">Brewer now appeals (1) the district court\u2019s February 10, 2011 dismissal of his appeal and (2) the bankruptcy court\u2019s October 7, 2010 order denying his \u201cMotion for Reconsideration/Rehearing for Extension of Time to File an Appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-17\">II. DISCUSSION<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-18\">Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8009(a)(1) provides, \u201cUnless the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>court or the bankruptcy appellate panel by local rule or by order excuses the filing of briefs or specifies different time limits ... [t]he appellant shall serve and file a brief <em>within Ilf, days after entry of the appeal on the docket </em>pursuant to Rule 8007.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). Rule 9006 governs how time periods are calculated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 9006 also states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-4\">[W]hen an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified period by these rules or by a notice given thereunder or by order of court, the court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion ... on motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9006(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">This Court interpreted Bankruptcy Rule 8009 in <em>Brake v. Tavormina (In re Beverly Manufacturing Corp.), </em>778 F.2d 666 (11th Cir.1985). In that case, a district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal from a bankruptcy court decision for failure to file briefs within the then-15-day deadline after the entry of the appeal on the court docket. <em>Id. </em>at 666. We held that the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of an appeal from a bankruptcy decision is proper only where \u201cbad faith, negligence or indifference\u201d has been shown, a \u201cflexible standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667. We noted that \u201c[dismissal typically occurs in cases showing consistently dilatory conduct or the complete failure to take any steps other than the mere filing of a notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667. We remanded the case for a determination of whether the appellant\u2019s reasons for the delay were supported and sufficient to excuse the late filing. <em>Id. </em>at 667-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">Here, Brewer was clearly delinquent in filing his initial appellate brief under Rules 8009 and 9006. Brewer\u2019s appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s October 7 order was entered on the district court docket on January 10, 2011. Under Rule 9006, Brewer\u2019s opening appellate brief was due fourteen days later, on January 24, 2011. He did not file a brief or a motion for more time within this time frame. Rather, on February 1, 2011, Brewer, <em>pro se, </em>filed only his \u201cMotion for Extension of Time to File Brief.\u201d And thereafter he never filed an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">Brewer\u2019s stated reasons for missing this deadline are (1) that he needs the assistance of an attorney and (2) does not fully understand the appeals process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>er, we note that Brewer had prior experience with filing deadlines in bankruptcy court, also proceeded <em>pro se </em>throughout this bankruptcy case, and was familiar with the consequences of late filings. As the district court stated in its order dismissing the case, Brewer exhibited a history of failing to meet filing deadlines. Brewer ignored the scheduling order in the bankruptcy court trial, leading the district court to exclude his witness and exhibit lists when they were filed late. In fact, Brewer\u2019s appeal here (as to the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of his brief) is itself an appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of his requests for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal after the deadline had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">These overall particular circumstances of Brewer\u2019s case demonstrate sufficient \u201cindifference\u201d and \u201cconsistently dilatory conduct\u201d such that we cannot say the district court committed reversible error in dismissing Brewer\u2019s appeal. <em>See Beverly Mfg. Corp., </em>778 F.2d at 667. \u201c[Although we are to give liberal construction to the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>litigants, we nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.\u201d <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Nor did Brewer demonstrate \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under Rule 9006. \u201cExcusable neglect is generally an \u2018equitable inquiry\u2019 based upon the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Conn. State Dental Ass\u2019n v. Anthem Health Plans, Inc., </em>591 F.3d 1337, 1355 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick </em>As<em>socs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>507 U.S. 380, 389, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 1495, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">Brewer\u2019s pattern of late filings in the bankruptcy court and his failure to file an appellate brief in district court, even at this late date, has greatly delayed the judicial proceedings. Brewer\u2019s filing was within his reasonable control and was not inadvertent. By his own admission, he received notice of the docketing of the appeal on January 14, 2010. Given his extensive experience with bankruptcy procedures and the record of his prior delayed filings, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying Brewer\u2019s request for late filing of his appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that Brewer\u2019s appeal was properly dismissed by the district court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">.
