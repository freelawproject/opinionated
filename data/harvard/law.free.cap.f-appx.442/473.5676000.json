U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Because the BIA issued its own decision without adopting or expbcitly agreeing with any portion of the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s findings of fact under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor thereof. <em>Id. </em>at 1350-51. To reverse the BIA\u2019s decision, we must find that the record compels reversal: \u201c \u2018[t]he mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351 (quoting <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Lin applied for asylum based solely on a well-founded fear of future persecution. \u201cTo establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution that is (2) on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The INA expressly recognizes forced sterilization as persecution on account of a protected ground, namely, political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). The BIA has adopted a case-by-case analytical framework to evaluate whether an alien has demonstrated an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution based on the threat of forced sterilization, requiring the alien to (1) establish the details of the family planning policy; (2) show that she violated the policy; and (3) demonstrate that the violation \u201cwould be punished in the local area in a way that would give rise to an objective fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re J-H-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 196, 198-99 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The BIA has held that a fine may amount to persecution if it causes a \u201csevere economic disadvantage,\u201d considering the alien\u2019s net worth, other sources of income, and the conditions of the local economy. <em>See In re T-Z-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 163, 173-74 (BIA 2007). To meet the severe economic disadvantage standard, the fine should reduce the alien \u201cto an impoverished existence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Lin is ineligible for asylum. The record reveals that, although there were reports of forced sterilizations from Fujian Province, China\u2019s family planning policy is primarily dependent upon economic incentives and penalties. Lin\u2019s individual, particularized evidence does not alter this conclusion. The BIA\u2019s decision indicates that it thoroughly analyzed Lin\u2019s particularized evidence together with her other documentary evidence. Lin\u2019s documentary evidence was cumulative of and previously examined by the BIA in its prior published decisions, and Lin has not provided a basis for distinguishing these decisions; therefore, the BIA\u2019s reliance on its previous rejections of this evidence was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Lin has also failed to demonstrate that any future fine for her alleged violation of the family planning policy would rise to the level of persecution because the record is devoid of evidence of her financial situation or conditions of the local economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Since the record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision, we are constrained to deny Lin\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-11\">. Our references to Lin in this opinion also include her husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b500-12\">. Although Lin cites to the burden of proof applicable for withholding of removal, she offers no argument in support of this claim. Likewise, Lin offers no argument regarding her claim for relief under the Convention Against Torture. Thus, we do not address these claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (reiterating that issues not raised in the initial brief, and those given only a passing reference, are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
