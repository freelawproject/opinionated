Hum-phries, a prisoner, filed a pro se, <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking damages and other relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. Humphries asserted ten claims, including false arrest and malicious prosecution, based on a lengthy narrative of events dating back to his September 20, 2006, arrest on drug charges in Venango County, Pennsylvania. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing the complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, citing four grounds: (1) any claim based on acts that predate November 8, 2008, is barred under the two-year statute of limitations; (2) insofar as Hum-phries seeks relief due to allegedly perjured testimony and false evidence in connection with his 2009 federal conviction, his claims are not cognizable under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); (3) the prosecutor defendants (Houghton, Lope, and Veon) are entitled to absolute immunity; and (4) the doctrine of claim preclusion bars claims that Humphries raised, or could have raised, in an earlier suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Humphries timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Humphries has been granted leave to proceed in <em>forma pawper-is </em>on appeal. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), an action or appeal must be dismissed if it is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. We exercise plenary review over the sua sponte dismissal of Humphries\u2019 complaint. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">After a review of the record, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s analysis. \u201cThe statute of limitations for a \u00a7 1983 claim arising in Pennsylvania is two years.\u201d <em>Kach v. Hose, </em>589 F.3d 626, 634 (3d Cir.2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A cause of action \u201caccrues when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which [his] action is based.\u201d <em>Sameric Corp. of Del. v. Phila., </em>142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir.1998); <em>see Dique v. N.J. State Police, </em>603 F.3d 181, 185 (3d Cir.2010). According to the complaint, the alleged constitutional violations that Humphries incurred at the hands of state officials occurred between September 20, 2006, and April 17, 2008, when charges brought against him in Butler County were dismissed. <em>See </em>Compl. at \u00b6 86. Humphries filed this suit on November 8, 2010. We agree with the District Court that Humphries is barred from asserting claims based on acts allegedly committed by defendants prior to November 8, 2008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, Humphries is precluded from asserting the claims in his complaint that arise out of his 2006 prosecution in Venan-go County; the alleged termination of his parental rights; the events surrounding the arrest of his girlfriend, Dena Papania; his arrest in November 2007; and the dismissed charges brought against him in Butler County.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">As to the remainder of the complaint, which appears to center upon Hum-phries\u2019 arrest, indictment, and conviction on federal criminal charges, the District Court properly dismissed the claims for relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant Houghton, a federal prosecutor, is entitled to absolute immuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ty for actions performed within her authority. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 431, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976) (\u201c[I]n initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State\u2019s case, the prosecutor is immune from a civil suit for damages under \u00a7 1983.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Humphries does not assert a plausible claim that Houghton acted outside the scope of her duties in bringing the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Humphries\u2019 claims that defendants used perjury and false evidence to secure his federal conviction are not cognizable under Heck\u2019s favorable termination rule. As noted, Humphries entered a plea of guilty to violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and there is no evidence that any court has called the conviction into question. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>see also Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (explaining that <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable termination rule applies \u201cno matter the target of the prisoner\u2019s suit <em>... if </em>success in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Finally, Humphries appears to challenge the factual basis for the initial federal criminal complaint filed against hi m, arguing that the absence of probable cause supports a claim for malicious prosecution. In particular, he complains that defendant Rogers, an Investigator for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, must have lacked probable cause for the \u201cSchedule II\u201d controlled substance allegation that was included in the original criminal complaint given that only a \u201cSchedule III\u201d controlled substance formed the factual basis for the superseding indictment to which Humphries pleaded guilty. This malicious prosecution claim, however, is barred by the <em>Heck </em>rule in light of Humphries\u2019 conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 \u2014 the same offense that he was charged with in the original criminal complaint. See <em>Kossler v. Crisanti, </em>564 F.3d 181, 194 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc) (explaining that \u201ccourts need not reach the probable cause element unless they first make a finding of favorable termination after examining whether the proceeding as a whole indicates the innocence of the accused with respect to the conduct underlying all of the charges\u201d). Furthermore, if not premature under the <em>Heck </em>rule, this claim is barred by the statute of limitations. As discussed, Humphries cannot assert claims that pre-date November 8, 2008.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The original federal complaint, accompanied by defendant Rogers\u2019 supporting affidavit, was filed on April 15, 2008, and Humphries does not suggest a later accrual date for any claim based on the facts asserted in Rogers\u2019 affidavit. Humphries\u2019 malicious prosecution claim, therefore, would be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that this appeal lacks any arguable legal merit, and therefore we will dismiss the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Humphries\u2019 motions to consider an audio recording and for leave to file an extended brief are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-14\">. <em>See Humphries v. Venango County Dist. Att\u2019y, </em>W.D. Pa. Civ. No. 08-cv-00335.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-5\">. Insofar as Humphries seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985, the same two-year limitations period bars his claims. <em>See Lake v. Arnold, </em>232 F.3d 360, 368 (3d Cir.2000). Further, Humphries fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under \u00a7 1985 because he does not allege facts giving rise to a plausible claim that a racial or other class-based invidious discriminatory animus lay behind defendants\u2019 alleged actions. <em>See Brown v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>250 F.3d 789, 805 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">. Humphries argues that the limitations period should be tolled because he filed a complaint against certain defendants with the Office of Professional Responsibility in February 2010 and did not receive a response until September 2010. Generally, state law governs the question of whether to afford tolling of the limitations period in a civil rights suit. <em>See Dique, </em>603 F.3d at 185; <em>Kach, </em>589 F.3d at 639. We find no authority for the proposition that tolling is available under Pennsylvania law for the time in which Humphries pursued an administrative complaint that was not a prerequisite to suit under \u00a7 1983. <em>Cf. Ammlung v. City of Chester, </em>494 F.2d 811, 816 (3d Cir.1974) (explaining that \"[t]he running of a Pennsylvania statute of limitations against a federal cause of action is not tolled under Pennsylvania concepts of tolling by the commencement of a similar suit in state court\u201d). We have considered the additional tolling arguments presented in Humphries' \"Brief,\u201d but conclude that those arguments do not provide a basis to toll the limitations period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\">.Humphries was indicted in federal court on November 19, 2008, within two years prior to filing this suit. He entered a plea of guilty to one count of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and was sentenced on March 20, 2009, to twenty-one months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. See W.D. Pa.Crim. No. 08-cr-00402.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">. While Humphries\u2019 suit against Houghton, a federal official, is properly construed as an action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), rather than \u00a7 1983, the same result obtains. \"[C]ourts have generally relied upon the principles developed in the case law applying section 1983 to establish the outer perimeters of a <em>Bivens </em>claim against federal officials.\u201d <em>Schrob v. Catterson, </em>948 F.2d 1402, 1409 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b655-12\">. Humphries\u2019 claims under <em>Bivens </em>are also subject to a two-year limitations period. <em>See Napier v. Thirty or More Unidentified Fed. Agents, </em>855 F.2d 1080, 1087 &amp; n. 3 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
