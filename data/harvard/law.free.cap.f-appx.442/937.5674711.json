He contends that the documents used to prove his 1983 California conviction of sale of a controlled substance did not prove that he committed a drug trafficking offense for purposes of the 12-level offense level adjustment of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). He asserts that California abstracts of judgment are unreliable as a matter of law; that the charging instrument is insufficient to prove a drug trafficking offense because it may have merely tracked the language of section 11352; and that the entry of plea document is insufficient because it contains check-off boxes, is not a transcript, and bears no judicial signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">We review for plain error the issue whether Jimenez committed a drug trafficking offense, as Jimenez did not raise that issue in the district court. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009). To the extent that Jimenez challenged the adequacy of the documents to prove his conviction, his challenge on appeal to the documents should be reviewed de novo as to the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and for clear error as to its factual findings. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">We employ the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a drug-trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 524 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273 (5th Cir.2005). In so doing, we look to the elements of the prior offense, rather than to the facts underlying the conviction. <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273. However, when a statute includes conduct that both does and does not constitute a drug trafficking offense, we may look to records of the conviction to determine whether the defendant\u2019s conduct fell under a statutory section constituting a drug trafficking offense. <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 356, 359 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cSuch records include the charging paper, a written plea agreement, the guilty-plea transcript, factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented, and jury instructions.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">The challenged documents here were not necessary to determine how Jimenez violated section 11352. The abstract and entry of plea document demonstrate that Jimenez\u2019s guilty plea was responsive to the two counts of the complaint alleging that he sold heroin. A clerical document like an abstract may be used to prove the existence of a prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 449-50 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Neri-Hernandes, </em>504 F.3d 587, 590-92 (5th Cir.2007). Here, the complaint charging Jimenez with the sale of heroin indicated how he violated section 11352; the challenged documents merely indicated that his guilty plea was responsive to the counts of the complaint alleging actual sale. The actual sale of heroin falls within the definition of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
