The trial judge sentenced defendant to two concurrent four-year terms in the Illinois State Penitentiary. The judge also fined defendant $1,000 for the public defender\u2019s costs and charged him $140 for court costs. The issues defendant raises on appeal are: (1) that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because the State failed to prove he was the driver of the car that caused the death of his two companions; and (2) that he is entitled to a new trial because his defense would have been different had his counsel been aware of several police reports which the State neglected to tender to defense counsel until after the prosecutor had presented his case. Additionally, we granted both sides in this litigation leave to file supplemental briefs on the issue of whether defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel when, after receiving these reports in the middle of trial, defense counsel agreed to stipulate to the information in the reports instead of requesting another remedy.</p> <p id=\"b74-5\" pgmap=\"74\">Officer Michael Bennon testified that on April 18, 1987, at approximately 4:15 a.m., he and his partner, Officer Mark Juska, were stopped for a red light on Ogden Avenue at Milwaukee when they observed a 1971 green two-door Plymouth Fury (Plymouth) with three occupants traveling westbound on Chicago Avenue at a high rate of speed. According to Bennon, two of the occupants were in the front seat and one person was in the rear behind the front seat passenger. Bennon stated that the Plymouth went through a red light at Ogden, made a right turn and proceeded northeast on Ogden. Bennon testified that they pursued the Plymouth after turning on their \u201cMars\u201d lights and their siren and activating the patrol car\u2019s flashing high beam. Bennon estimated that they were about 200 to 250 feet behind the Plymouth and that the Plymouth was traveling at approximately 60 miles an hour.</p> <p id=\"b74-6\" pgmap=\"74\">According to Bennon, the Plymouth swerved hard to the left across the northbound lanes over the double yellow line to the southbound lanes and to the south curb. Bennon stated that, as the Plymouth was about to hit the south curb, it swerved back across the southbound lanes toward the north curb. Bennon estimated that the distance between their car and the Plymouth was \u201cabout 100 feet, maybe a little less\u201d when the Plymouth first hit the retaining wall on the north side of the street. Officer Bennon described this first impact in detail:</p> <blockquote id=\"b74-7\" pgmap=\"74\">\u201cThe vehicle struck the retaining wall. It bounced backwards, and it struck the wall again and, at that point, the vehicle, with the rear tires spinning, was turning to the side while riding along the wall.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b74-8\" pgmap=\"74(33) 75(53)\">Bennon then testified that the car spun around and \u201ccompletely changed directions while up against the wall.\u201d Bennon estimated that, at the time the Plymouth turned while up against the wall, they were within 30 to 50 feet of the Plymouth. He emphasized that \u201cI had to brake the squad car so I didn\u2019t strike the vehicle.\u201d He stated that, after the Plymouth turned, they \u201cwere broadside to the car, in other words perpendicular to it\u201d and could see the driver. He further testified:</p> <blockquote id=\"b75-5\" pgmap=\"75\">\u201cThe vehicle again proceeded from the north side of the northbound lanes, the east side of the street, across the road, across the northbound lanes, across the southbound lanes, strike [sic] the retaining curb on the southbound lane side of the street, the west side of the street.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b75-6\" pgmap=\"75\">It jumped the curb, went up on the sidewalk and hit the pillars, the retaining wall for the pedestrians on the sidewalk at the end of the sidewalk. It came to rest there.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b75-7\" pgmap=\"75\">Bennon explained that, after the Plymouth came to rest, he stopped the patrol car about five feet behind the Plymouth. Bennon stated that they ran up to the driver\u2019s door and \u201cobserved the driver of the vehicle sliding over\u201d to the passenger seat and attempting to exit through the passenger side door. According to Bennon, the damage from the accident prevented the door from opening, however, and defendant had to exit through the driver side door. Bennon stated that at this point he did not see any other people within the Plymouth.</p> <p id=\"b75-8\" pgmap=\"75\">Bennon further testified that, when defendant exited the Plymouth, his breath smelled strongly of alcohol, his eyes were bloodshot, he was having trouble standing, and his speech was slurred. Bennon said that as he placed defendant under arrest, Juska ran over to the two victims, who lay in the northbound lanes just south of where the Plymouth came to rest. Defendant had a broken arm and small cuts and bruises on his head and was taken from the scene in an ambulance. Bennon also mentioned that they got two or three different names from defendant because it was hard to understand him. He stated that \u201cM-I-K-I-A\u201d was one of the names and \u201cM-I-K-A\u201d was another.</p> <p id=\"b75-9\" pgmap=\"75(103) 76(94)\">On cross-examination, Bennon conceded that in a traffic accident report made several hours after the incident, he did not include as graphic a description of the accident as he did at trial. Additionally, Bennon asserted that they only lost sight of the Plymouth \u201cvery briefly\u201d for only a second or two in an underpass as the patrol car was entering the pass and the Plymouth was ascending. Bennon also admitted that he and his partner, Juska, spoke with Officers Smith and Wesolek, major traffic accident specialists, at the hospital on the morning of the accident. He denied telling Smith or Wesolek or hearing Juska tell Smith or Wesolek that both victims were front seat passengers. He also denied that he told either officer or heard Juska tell either officer that they were \u201c300 feet behind the green vehicle when they lost sight of it where Ogden curves to the north.\u201d Moreover, he denied telling Smith or Wesolek or hearing Juska tell either officer that they heard a loud noise and when they got to the curve in the road they saw the Plymouth on the west side of the road up against the concrete railing.</p> <p id=\"b76-3\" pgmap=\"76\">On redirect, the prosecutor brought out that Bennon had checked the \u201cyes\u201d box on his field report next to the question \u201cdid you see the defendant driving?\u201d Bennon had not checked the box next to the question \u201cif parked, was defendant behind the wheel?\u201d Bennon explained that this box is only checked if the officer did not observe the accident, but is called to the scene or comes upon a stopped vehicle. He stressed that the reason he did not check this box was \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t come upon a parked vehicle. I saw the accident.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b76-4\" pgmap=\"76\">On re-cross, Bennon maintained that he never lost sight of the Plymouth as it was crashing, but admitted that he did not see either victim \u201cfly from the car.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b76-5\" pgmap=\"76\">Officer Juska\u2019s testimony was almost identical to Bennon\u2019s testimony. He also described the accident in detail. He stated that the Plymouth struck the east side embankment and then turned 90 degrees and went perpendicular to them and across their path into the west side embankment. He testified that at that point they were approximately 30 feet away and could see into the Plymouth. He stated that he saw only the defendant in the car. According to Juska\u2019s testimony, defendant was in the driver\u2019s seat with his hands on the steering wheel. Juska said, however, that Bennon opened the passenger door to get defendant out of the Plymouth.</p> <p id=\"b76-6\" pgmap=\"76\">Dr. Yuksel Konakci, a Cook County assistant medical examiner, testified that both victims died from multiple internal and external injuries caused by extreme blunt trauma due to being thrown from the automobile during the crash. He also stated that tests upon both victims\u2019 blood indicated that they were both legally intoxicated.</p> <p id=\"b76-7\" pgmap=\"76\">After Dr. Konakci\u2019s testimony, the parties stipulated that blood was taken from \u201cAntonio Mikia\u201d who, in fact, is defendant Antonio Mejia, and the blood was transported to the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office. Dr. Michael Schaffer, a forensic toxicologist, testified that the blood sample was analyzed and was found to have a .146 blood-alcohol content.</p> <p id=\"b76-8\" pgmap=\"76(21) 77(93)\">After Dr. Schaffer testified, the court granted a defense request to recall Juska. Juska admitted to speaking with major traffic accident investigators Smith and Wesolek both at the scene and at the hospital. Juska said he did not recall telling nor did he hear Bennon tell either officer that they were 300 feet behind the Plymouth and lost sight of it where Ogden curves to the left going northbound. He also denied telling Smith or Wesolek or hearing Bennon state to Smith or Wesolek that they heard a loud noise and when they got around the curve they saw the Plymouth already on the west side of Ogden up against the concrete railing.</p> <p id=\"b77-3\" pgmap=\"77\">The State then rested and the judge excused the jury for the day. The judge then conducted a short conference with both parties to discuss the course of the proceedings the next day. Defense counsel indicated that, in addition to calling the defendant and Raphael Samaniego, the prosecutor \u201chad indicated that he would make available to us Officer Smith and/or Wesolek in order to clarify some of this.\u201d The trial judge incredulously responded, \u201cWell, you\u2019re saying that the State is offering to attempt to get defense witnesses?\u201d The prosecutor stated that Wesolek was on furlough and they would be unable to notify him, but that Smith had been notified. The judge reminded defense counsel that, although the prosecutor surely would make his best effort to get the defendant\u2019s witnesses in court, \u201cit is the defense obligation to present witnesses.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b77-5\" pgmap=\"77\">The following day before the trial resumed and the defense proceeded with its case, the prosecutor tendered to counsel seven police accident reports which the defense had requested prior to trial. One of the reports was written by Officer Hanson, whom defense counsel was unaware of because he had not been mentioned in any of the previously tendered reports. These reports contradicted both Bennon\u2019s and Juska\u2019s testimony and indicated that they had not seen the accident. At the start of the day\u2019s proceedings, defense counsel made the substance of the reports known to the trial judge \u201cbecause it may make somewhat of a difference eventually.\u201d He made it clear he was merely informing the court and he gratuitously conceded that the prosecutor was without blame. The relevant portions of transcript read:</p> <blockquote id=\"b77-6\" pgmap=\"77\">\u201c[Defense attorney]: The reason I bring this up is only in the event that this \u2014 if there were to be a guilty verdict in this case. Judge, I have to complain about this and I\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b77-8\" pgmap=\"77\">THE COURT: Fine, you\u2019re complaining. Fine, you\u2019re objecting. What action do you want me to take? Who do you want me to hold in contempt of court?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-2\" pgmap=\"78\">[Defense attorney]: I don\u2019t know that I want anyone held in contempt of court at all, but I do bring this up because, as I say, this changes our whole point of view.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-3\" pgmap=\"78\">I think \u2014 we made an opening statement that says we are going to produce certain witnesses. It is our belief that with this information, we need not even produce a witness.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-5\" pgmap=\"78\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-6\" pgmap=\"78\">THE COURT: Well, you\u2019re bringing it to my attention, but you\u2019re not asking the Court to do anything.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-7\" pgmap=\"78\">[Defense attorney]: I ask for no remedy at this stage, Judge.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"A6u\" pgmap=\"78\">THE COURT: Well, you see, don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t lead me to believe that you\u2019re going to ask for a remedy later that I can\u2019t give to you.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-9\" pgmap=\"78\">I mean, if the defendant is found guilty, the normal things that flow after a felony case will take place. So, don\u2019t ask for any magical formulas that\u2019s [sic] going to erase something later. If you have a \u2014 if you have a remedy you want to suggest to the Court now, I \u2014 I\u2019ll consider it now.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-10\" pgmap=\"78\">[Defense attorney]: No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-11\" pgmap=\"78\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to do it three or four hours from now when you get a verdict that you don\u2019t like. That\u2019s too late.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-12\" pgmap=\"78\">[Defense attorney]: Our feeling is that we should proceed as we had planned, and I bring it up solely because it is important that I bring it up now.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b78-13\" pgmap=\"78\">THE COURT: Okay.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b78-14\" pgmap=\"78\">The prosecutor explained that about V-k hours before at approximately 10:20 a.m., Smith came to his office because the defense had requested he be present in court. The prosecutor stated that, as he went through Smith\u2019s reports, he noticed seven reports that he did not have in his files. Recognizing that these reports may be Brady material, he immediately copied them and made them available to defense counsel. The prosecutor stated, therefore, that he was willing to stipulate to the information contained in the reports \u201cso as to not delay this trial in any form.\u201d The defense agreed to stipulate \u201cto the things that we want out of here.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b78-15\" pgmap=\"78(71) 79(111)\">The jury was then called back and the trial judge instructed them that a stipulation was a \u201ctime-saving\u201d device where the testimony of the witnesses is not challenged by either party. Defense counsel then read the stipulation to the jury. It was stipulated that if Smith or Wesolek were called to testify, they would both state that immediately after the accident they interviewed Bennon and Juska and then made out a police report. In that report they indicated that both of the victims were front seat passengers. Smith and Wesolek would also testify that when Bennon and Juska were chasing the Plymouth they informed communications that \u201cdue to the speed of the vehicle, [they were] about 300 feet behind the green vehicle when they lost view of it, where Ogden Avenue curves to the left to go northbound.\u201d They would further testify that Bennon and Juska \u201cheard a loud noise and when they got to the curve in the road, they observed the green Plymouth on the west side of Ogden, up against the concrete bridge rail.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b79-3\" pgmap=\"79\">It was further stipulated that if Officer James B. Hanson was called to testify he would also state that he interviewed Bennon and Juska and that they indicated to him that they also made a report in which they indicated that they were \u201cabout 400 feet behind the vehicle and due to the incline and the curving of the roadway, [were] not able to observe the accident.\u201d Additionally, it was stipulated that \u201c[b]oth officers also related they did not know if the driver, Mikia, it says, knew that a squad was pursuing them.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b79-4\" pgmap=\"79\">The defense then called the defendant as its only witness. Defendant testified that at approximately 5 p.m. on April 17, 1987, he and several friends, Jose Trejo and Raphael Samaniego, went cruising and drinking in a car that defendant borrowed from a co-worker. According to defendant, at approximately 10 p.m., they picked up Pedro Salgado. Defendant testified that they had just run out of beer so they stopped at a bar to get some more. Defendant stated that after they came out of the bar, Trejo took over the driving because \u201cI wasn\u2019t in no condition to drive.\u201d Defendant testified that he lay down in the back seat on the passenger side. According to defendant, they continued drinking and cruising. About two or three hours later, at approximately 2:30 a.m., they dropped off Samaniego. According to defendant, Trejo was still driving. Defendant testified that at the time of the accident he was in the back seat on the passenger side. He stated that all he remembers is \u201cthe noise and flashing lights and a loud noise, and everything spinned [sic] around.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b79-5\" pgmap=\"79\">Defendant\u2019s first contention on appeal is that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because the State failed to show that he was the driver of the car that caused the death of his two companions. He asserts that Hanson\u2019s stipulated testimony indicates that Bennon and Juska lied when they stated that they observed the entire accident and that they saw defendant driving the Plymouth. Defendant maintains that this stipulated testimony in conjunction with defendant\u2019s denial that he was driving raises a reasonable doubt.</p> <p id=\"b80-2\" pgmap=\"80\">The responsibility of weighing the evidence, assessing the credibility of witnesses, and resolving conflicts in testimony is uniquely that of the jury. (People v. Young (1989), 128 Ill. 2d 1, 49, 538 N.E.2d 453, 473, citing Jackson v. Virginia (1979), 443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, 573-74, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2788-89.) In fulfilling its duty as the trier of fact, the jury \u201cmay believe as much or as little as it pleases of a witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d (People v. Beasley (1977), 54 Ill. App. 3d 109, 114, 369 N.E.2d 260, 264.) Our review of the sufficiency of the evidence, therefore, is limited to determining \u201c \u2018whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d (Young, 128 Ill. 2d at 49, 538 N.E.2d at 472, quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 318-19, 61 L. Ed. 2d at 573-74, 99 S. Ct. at 2788-89.) As has been so often stated, \u201c \u2018the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Young, 128 Ill. 2d at 49, 538 N.E.2d at 472, quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 318-19, 61 L. Ed. 2d at 573-74, 99 S. Ct. at 2788-89.</p> <p id=\"b80-3\" pgmap=\"80\">In order for the State to prove defendant guilty of reckless homicide, it must show that defendant caused another person\u2019s death by recklessly driving a motor vehicle in a manner likely to cause death or great bodily harm. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 38, par. 9\u20143; People v. La Combe (1982), 104 Ill. App. 3d 66, 72, 432 N.E.2d 672, 676.) In the instant case, after a careful review of the record in the light most favorable to the State, we cannot say that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The State and the defense never stipulated that Bennon and Juska lied; they stipulated that several other officers, if called to testify, would contradict Bennon\u2019s and Juska\u2019s assertions that they saw the entire accident and that defendant was behind the wheel. If the jury chose to believe the in-court testimony of Bennon and Juska, then the evidence was more than sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of reckless homicide.</p> <p id=\"b80-4\" pgmap=\"80(99) 81(236)\">Notwithstanding the fact that the evidence was sufficient to support a guilty verdict, we believe that had defense counsel called Smith, Wesolek and Hanson to testify in order to contradict the testimony of Bennon and Juska, instead of \u201csaving time\u201d by stipulating to their testimony, there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that defendant would have been acquitted. When determining whether a defendant received the ineffective assistance of counsel, a reviewing court must be mindful that appellate review is governed by Strickland v. Washington (1984), 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052, and Illinois\u2019 adoption of Strickland in People v. Albnese (1984), 104 Ill. 2d 504, 473 N.E.2d 1246. These cases recognize that to succeed on such a claim, it must be shown that (1) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d (Albnese, 104 Ill. 2d at 525, 473 N.E.2d at 1255, quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 698, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.) \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 698, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.) In evaluating the performance factor, there is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within a wide range of reasonable professional assistance and that the challenged conduct might have been nothing more than part of counsel\u2019s sound trial strategy. (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 694-95, 104 S. Ct. at 2065.) In the end, \u201c[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 692-93,104 S. Ct. at 2064.</p> <p id=\"b81-3\" pgmap=\"81\">Counsel\u2019s performance in this case fell below an objective standard of reasonableness which, as a result, seriously undermines our confidence in the outcome. In his opening statement, defense counsel stated that the evidence would show that defendant was not driving the Plymouth when it crashed. He told the jury that Raphael Samaniego would testify that, when he was dropped off at his house, defendant was not driving. Later, after the State rested, he again informed the trial judge that Samaniego would testify. Samaniego, however, was never called.</p> <p id=\"b81-4\" pgmap=\"81(137) 82(69)\">Additionally, the focus of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of both officers was that they had made statements contradictory to their in-court testimony to at least two other officers just after the accident. Counsel cross-examined Bennon by asking him whether he had ever told traffic investigators Smith or Wesolek that both victims were front seat passengers or that neither he nor his partner actually saw the accident. Bennon denied ever making these statements to Smith or Wesolek. Counsel also specifically recalled Juska in order to ask him these same questions. He also denied ever making them. The stipulation entered into between the parties establishes that both Smith and Wesolek would have testified that Bennon and Juska told them, in effect, that they had not seen the accident. The stipulation also demonstrates that both Smith and Wesolek had concluded that both victims were front seat passengers. The record shows, however, that defense counsel had not subpoenaed either Smith or Wesolek and was relying upon the State to make these witnesses available when the defense presented its case. Wesolek was not in court and the record is unclear as to whether Smith was available. Nonetheless, the defense never called Smith or Wesolek and instead stipulated to their testimony.</p> <p id=\"b82-3\" pgmap=\"82\">Finally, the morning after the State rested and immediately preceding the presentation of defendant\u2019s case, the State tendered seven police reports to defendant. One of the reports was made by an Officer Hanson who had interviewed both Bennon and Juska after the accident. His report was consistent with the reports of Smith and Wesolek and contradicted Bennon\u2019s and Juska\u2019s assertions that they saw the accident and that defendant was driving. Defense counsel made the trial judge aware of these new developments, but refused to request a remedy. He stated that he was \u201cbringing] it up solely because it is important that I bring it up now,\u201d but that he was sure that the prosecutor\u2019s nondisclosure was not willful and that he did not want any remedy. Instead, counsel agreed with the State to stipulate to Hanson\u2019s testimony \u201cso as to not delay this trial in any form.\u201d After stipulating to the testimony of Smith, Wesolek, and Hanson, defendant got on the stand and denied driving the Plymouth when it crashed. The defense then rested. The stipulation was entered into the record, the morning after the State had rested, just before the defense put on the defendant as their one and only witness and after the jury had been waiting at least one hour for the proceedings to begin.</p> <p id=\"b82-4\" pgmap=\"82\">We cannot imagine any trial strategy which would protect counsel\u2019s actions in this case. Counsel failed to call a witness who, in opening statement, he told the jury would corroborate the defendant\u2019s claim that he was not driving at the time of the accident. He cross-examined the police officer eyewitnesses by asking them whether they had ever made statements to Smith or Wesolek which contradicted their trial testimony. The officers denied ever making the contradictory statements. Additionally, after investigating the accident, traffic accident specialists Smith and Wesolek concluded that both victims were front seat passengers. Yet, counsel never called or even subpoenaed Wesolek or Smith. Moreover, at trial he discovered that Bennon and Juska also had made these contradictory statements to Hanson. Despite persistent hinting and prodding by the trial judge, counsel failed to seek any remedy for this violation of discovery.</p> <p id=\"b83-2\" pgmap=\"83\">The State clearly and concisely set forth its case against defendant with the pivotal testimony of Bennon and Juska, who allegedly were the sole eyewitnesses to what transpired; the police reports reveal, however, that they perhaps witnessed nothing. Defense counsel was aware of three witnesses whose testimony could completely impeach Bennon and Juska; yet, counsel did not call any of these officers as witnesses. Instead of calling these witnesses, he stipulated to their testimony in what takes up all of 21k pages of transcript. He was aware of both Smith and Wesolek prior to trial, yet neither was under subpoena. He was informed of Hanson\u2019s existence during trial, yet did not request a continuance to locate Hanson and bring him in to testify. He also did not ask that Bennon and Juska be recalled to further impeach them with Hanson\u2019s report. At a minimum, counsel should have asked for a mistrial.</p> <p id=\"b83-3\" pgmap=\"83\">A stipulation is a \u201ctime-saving\u201d device used to admit necessary, but foundational or peripheral evidence which both parties to the litigation concede the truth of and which, obviously, is not a point of contention between the parties. A stipulation is no match for in-court live impeachment and is not properly used for that purpose. A reasonable standard of representation dictates that defense counsel subject the State\u2019s case to \u201cmeaningful adversarial testing\u201d and that these officers be confronted with their prior, inconsistent statements before the eyes of the trier of fact.</p> <p id=\"b83-4\" pgmap=\"83\">Our learned colleague believes that, in effect, we are second-guessing defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy. However, we cannot agree that failure to recall Bennon and Juska to cross-examine them about Hanson\u2019s report and failure to call even one of the three officers defense counsel was aware of whose testimony would contradict Bennon and Juska was \u201ctrial strategy.\u201d Although we recognize that there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s actions were part of a valid trial strategy and that \u201c[e]ven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way\u201d (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 694-95, 104 S. Ct. at 2065), we are confident that no competent attorney would have defended his client in this manner. In today\u2019s overcrowded courtrooms, saving time is a valid concern in criminal trials; however, we believe that counsel\u2019s concern for an expeditious proceeding goes too far when, other than putting the defendant on the stand to deny his guilt, counsel presents defendant\u2019s entire defense through stipulation.</p> <p id=\"b83-5\" pgmap=\"83(29) 84(129)\">Regarding the prejudice factor under Strickland, we believe that counsel\u2019s failure to exact full mileage from the impeaching police reports seriously undermined the adversarial process \u201cthat our system counts on to produce just results.\u201d (Strickland, 466 U.S. at 696, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 699, 104 S. Ct. at 2069.) A verdict of guilt should be determined by a jury only after the complete truth has been presented to it in a meaningfully adversarial proceeding. As the case stands now, the jury was presented with the well-polished and well-rehearsed testimony of two uniformed officers testifying 21k years after the accident. The police reports of at least three other officers illustrate, however, that within hours after the event both Bennon and Juska made statements in direct opposition to their trial testimony. In the absence of Bennon\u2019s and Juska\u2019s testimony, there is no direct evidence that places defendant in the driver\u2019s seat of the Plymouth.</p> <p id=\"b84-5\" pgmap=\"84\">Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that reading the cold facts from the police reports into the record as a stipulation the day after the State rested and just before defendant put on his defense was no substitute for live, in-court impeachment of the police officers who, in effect, were the State\u2019s only \u201ceyewitnesses\u201d to the accident. We find the statements in the reports to be completely impeaching, or so much so that there is a reasonable probability that a different verdict may have been rendered. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and remand this cause for a new trial. In light of the fact that we have granted defendant a new trial, we need not address defendant\u2019s second contention on appeal which asserted that he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s failure to tender the police reports until after the prosecutor had presented his case.</p> <p id=\"b84-6\" pgmap=\"84\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions of the circuit court of Cook County are reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b84-7\" pgmap=\"84\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"b84-8\" pgmap=\"84\">CAMPBELL, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b84-9\" pgmap=\"84\">PRESIDING JUSTICE MANNING,</author> <p id=\"A0M\" pgmap=\"84\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b84-10\" pgmap=\"84\">The majority has chosen to sua sponte raise and rule upon the issue of whether or not the defendant received the effective assistance of counsel at trial. While I certainly support the court\u2019s obligation and right to sua sponte raise issues, especially in criminal cases, where the ends of justice so demand, I disagree that the instant case is an appropriate one to do so because of the factual matrix.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b85-3\" pgmap=\"85\">As is shown in the majority opinion, defense counsel chose to stipulate to the contents of police reports which contained contradictory information to that of the trial testimony of the two sole eyewitnesses. As the majority so aptly points out, \u201c[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686, 980 L. Ed. 2d at 692-93,104 S. Ct. at 2064.</p> <p id=\"b85-5\" pgmap=\"85\">Our supreme court has stated that effective assistance of counsel refers to competent, not perfect, representation, and that mistakes in trial strategy, or tactics, or judgment do not of themselves render representation ineffective. (People v. Stewart (1984), 104 Ill. 2d 463, 491-92, 473 N.E.2d 1227, 1240.) In the instant case, trial counsel\u2019s maneuver could have been an attempt to place the inconsistent reports before the jury without giving the witnesses an opportunity to offer an explanation for the inconsistency. We must look to the totality of trial counsel\u2019s performance in determining ineffectiv\u00e9ness claims. (People v. Mitchell (1984), 105 Ill. 2d 1, 473 N.E.2d 1270; Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2065.) Defense counsel set forth a defense, challenged the credibility and perceptions of the People\u2019s witnesses, and performed in a generally reasonable and competent manner.</p> <p id=\"b85-7\" pgmap=\"85\">The majority has set forth a strategy which perhaps it, as well as many criminal lawyers, may have followed. That, however, is not the standard. The jurors, contrary to the majority\u2019s statement, were fully apprised that these uniformed officers had made contradictory statements. They were fully apprised because the State entered into a stipulation with defense attorney and the stipulation, setting forth the contradictory statements, was read aloud, in open court to the jurors. The triers of fact, notwithstanding the contradictions, and in full compliance with their duty as jurors, weighed all of the evidence including the physical evidence relating to the damage to defendant\u2019s car, injuries to the victims\u2019 bodies, and the scrape marks on the concrete wall, and decided adversely to the defendant. We must assume that the jury considered the impeachment, but nevertheless decided credibility in favor of the State. I am not convinced that the defense counsel\u2019s failure to recall the officers to cross-examine them was not trial strategy.</p> <p id=\"b85-8\" pgmap=\"85\">Additionally, I am not convinced that, assuming the failure was error, the outcome would have differed in light of the totality of the evidence presented by the State.</p> <p id=\"b85-9\" pgmap=\"85\">Accordingly, I would affirm.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b84-11\" pgmap=\"84\"> The court at oral argument sua sponte raised a question regarding the performance of counsel at trial. Both sides responded and were subsequently granted leave to file supplemental briefs addressing the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
