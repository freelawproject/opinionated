Thompson, is a veteran of World War II, who was in receipt of compensation from the Veterans Administration for a service connected disability. The Veterans Administration terminated the payments on the authority of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504, on the basis of a finding that he had aided an enemy of the United States during the Korean Conflict. This action is brought for the purpose of setting this ruling aside on the alleged ground that the foregoing statute is unconstitutional, as well as on the alleged grounds that the Administrator misconstrued the statute; that the procedure followed by him was lacking in due process of law; and that his finding of fact is not sustained by substantial evidence. Inasmuch as a question of constitutionality of an Act of Congress was raised, this three-judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>court was convened.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both parties moved for summary judgment and the case is now before the court on these cross-motions. We uphold the constitutionality of the statute and sustain the decision of the Veterans Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The following undisputed facts appear from the papers attached to the motions and the rulings of the various agencies of the Veterans Administration. The plaintiff served in the United States Army from November 28, 1941 to August 23, 1943, when he was honorably discharged. During his term of service he received the Distinguished Service Cross. He was awarded compensation by the Veterans Administration for pulmonary tuberculosis, which was found to be service connected. On October 14, 1949, he was one of a number of defendants who were convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on a charge of knowingly and wilfully conspiring to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing and destroying the Government of the United States by force and violence. This conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, United States v. Dennis, 183 F.2d 201, and later by the Supreme Court, Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 71 S.Ct. 857, 95 L.Ed. 1137. The decision of the Supreme Court was rendered on June 4, 1951. Early in July, 1951, when the plaintiff was under an order to surrender to serve his sentence, he disappeared, became a fugitive, and remained in hiding until he was found and taken into custody a couple of years later. In view of the fact that his whereabouts were unknown, no compensation was paid him subsequently to June 30, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On April 29, 1955, \u2014 after the plaintiff had been apprehended, \u2014 the Central Committee on Waivers and Forfeitures, an agency of the Veterans Administration, determined that the award of compensation to the plaintiff should be set aside on the ground that he had aided an enemy of the United States during the Korean Conflict. Pursuant to the prescribed procedure the plaintiff appealed to the Board of Veterans Appeals, which was an appellate agency within the Veterans Administration. In accordance with his request, a full hearing was accorded to him by the Board. A summary of the evidence against him was submitted to him in advance of the hearing. He was granted an opportunity to introduce evidence and to present an argument and a brief. In effect, the proceeding before the Board of Appeals was a trial <em>de novo. </em>On July 31, 1956, the Board affirmed the prior <em>action o\u00ed </em>the Committee in a lengthy and comprehensive opinion. Subsequently the plaintiff requested a reconsideration, which was denied on May 5, 1959, again in a detailed opinion. The Veterans Administration, while setting aside the award of compensation to the plaintiff, apportioned and allocated to the plaintiff\u2019s dependent wife and children for direct payment to them, an appropriate portion of the amount previously paid to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In brief the evidence on which the Committee and the Board acted, showed that the plaintiff had joined the Communist Party in 1933 and became a member of various groups within the party. In August 1935, he went to Russia as an adviser to the Sixth World Congress of the Young Communist International Congress and remained there for over a year, working as a machinist and attending lectures and courses in Marxism-Leninism. In January 1937, he fought with the International Abraham Lincoln Brigade of the Spanish Republican Army. He returned to the United States in 1938 and became the State Secretary of the Young Communist League at Columbus, Ohio, and later a national vice president of the Young Communist League. <em>In </em>1941, he transferred his activities to New York City, where he worked for the Young Communist League, until he entered the armed forces. After his discharge from the military service, he be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>came national secretary of the Young Communist League, and a contributor to \u201cthe Daily Worker\u201d, \u2014 a publication of the Communist Party. He was an active member of various organizations within the Communist Party. As above stated, he was convicted in the Southern District of New York, on a charge of violating the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2385, and this conviction was affirmed first by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and then by the Supreme Court. After July 2, 1951, he avoided apprehension for over two years and was finally arrested on August 27, 1953, in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The evidence of plaintiff\u2019s activities prior to the beginning of the Korean Conflict, which commenced on June 27, 1950, was considered by the Veterans Administration solely as casting light upon the plaintiff\u2019s intent in committing the specific acts subsequently to June 27, 1950, on the basis of which the award of compensation was vacated. These activities consisted of various speeches made by the plaintiff at meetings and conventions of Communist organizations during the Korean Conflict. These statements were designed to weaken and hinder the military and economic efforts of this country. Among these utterances were the following : that \u201cmass action now can still halt a Police State\u201d; that \u201cAmerican imperialism is hiding behind the skirts of the Negro GI in Korea\u201d; a demand for the withdrawal of the United States troops from Korea; criticism of the \u201cgigantic armament program\u201d and its costs; an assertion that \u201cthe Truman \u2018get tough with Russia policy\u2019 means in the last analysis get tough with the American people\u201d; that \u201cthe way of life of the working people * * * daily becomes more cruelly affected and more viciously warped with each war move of the Wall Street bankers and the Washington politicians\u201d ; references to the war effort of the United States as \u201cthe savage Truman-MacArthur war of aggression\u201d in Korea; as well as similar utterances.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The pertinent statutory provisions are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 310:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201cFor disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, in the active military, naval, or air service, during a period of war, the United States will pay to any veteran thus disabled and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable from the period of service in which said injury or disease was incurred, or preexisting injury or disease was aggravated, compensation as provided in this subehapter, but no compensation shall be paid if the disability is the result of the veteran\u2019s own willful misconduct.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apo\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">\u201c(a) Whoever knowingly makes or causes to be made or conspires, combines, aids, or assists in, agrees to, arranges for, or in any way procures the making or presentation of a false or fraudulent affidavit, declaration, certificate, statement, voucher, or paper, concerning any claim for benefits under any of the laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration (except laws pertaining to insurance benefits) shall forfeit all rights, claims, and benefits under all laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration (except laws pertaining to insurance benefits).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504(a) and (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-12\">\u201c(a) Any person shown by <em>evidence satisfactory to the Administrator </em>(to) be guilty of mutiny, treason, sabotage, or rendering assistance to an enemy of the United States or of its allies shall forfeit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>all accrued or future gratuitous benefits under laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">\u201c(b) The Administrator, in his discretion, ihay apportion and pay any part of benefits forfeited under subsection (a) to the dependents of the person forfeiting such benefits. No dependent of any person shall receive benefits by reason of this subsection in excess of the amount to which he would be entitled if such person were dead.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">It is contended by the plaintiff that Section 3504 is repugnant to the Constitution in that it is a bill of attainder and an <em>ex post facto </em>law; that it is lacking in due process of law; and that it fails to formulate a definite standard of guilt. These contentions are predicated on the major premise that the result contemplated by Section 3504 is additional punishment for the offenses to which it refers. On the other hand, it is argued by counsel for the Government that this provision merely sets forth additional qualifications for eligibility to receive gratuitous payments from the Government, and does not involve any penalty or punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\"> The basic question to be determined on this aspect of the case is, therefore, whether a discontinuance of compensation for any of the causes enumerated in Section 3504, constitutes punishment or is to be regarded as failure to qualify for the receipt of the gratuity. In support of their position that it is to be deemed punishment, counsel for the plaintiff point to the use of the word \u201cforfeit\u201d in the text of the statute. The matter, however, may not be disposed of in this manner. Substantial rights may not be immolated on the altar of semantics. They may not be determined on the basis of precision in the use of terminology or felicity in the choice of words. The question is to be resolved on the basis of the purpose of the statute and the intent of Congress. This is particularly true in this instance since \u201cforfeiture\u201d is not a word of art. It may have any one of several meanings and its exact significance depends on the context in which it is used or on the connection in which it is employed. Under some circumstances the term \u201cforfeiture\u201d may mean a punishment or penalty; under other conditions it may be used in a purely remedial sense as a loss or deprivation resulting as a consequence of specified activities or events.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The latest and one of the most explicit discussions of this point is to be found in an opinion of Chief Justice Warren in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 95 et seq., 78 S.Ct. 590, 595, 2 L.Ed.2d 630:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">\u201cEach time a statute has been challenged as being in conflict with the constitutional prohibitions against bills of attainder and <em>ex post facto </em>laws, it has been necessary to determine whether a penal law was involved, because these provisions apply only to statutes imposing penalties. In deciding whether or not a law is penal, this Court has generally based its determination upon the purpose of the statute. If the statute imposes a disability for the purposes of punishment \u2014 that is, to reprimand the wrongdoer, to deter others, etc., it has been considered penal. But a statute has been considered nonpenal if it imposes a disability, not to punish, but to accomplish some other legitimate governmental purpose. The Court has recognized that any statute decreeing some adversity as a consequence of certain conduct may have both a penal and a nonpenal effect. The controlling nature of such statutes normally depends on the evident purpose of the legislature. The point may be illustrated by the situation of an ordinary felon. A person who commits a bank robbery, for instance, loses his right to liberty and often his right to vote. If, in the exercise of the power to protect banks, both sanctions were imposed for the purpose of' punishing bank robbers, the statute authorizing both disabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ties would be penal. But because the purpose of the latter statute is to designate a reasonable ground of \u25a0eligibility for voting, this law is sustained as a nonpenal exercise of the power to regulate the franchise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 399-400, 58 S.Ct. 630, 633, 82 L.Ed. 917, in an opinion written by Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is, the Supreme Court held that penalties for fraud under the income tax laws, constitute an additional remedy, rather than a criminal sanction. In discussing this subject, the learned Justice stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201cThe question for decision is thus whether \u00a7 293(b) imposes a criminal sanction. That question is one of statutory construction. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\u201cRemedial sanctions may be of varying types. One which is characteristically free of the punitive criminal element is revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyW\">\u201cForfeiture of goods or their value and the payment of fixed or variable sums of money are other sanctions which have been recognized as enforcible by civil proceedings since the original revenue law of 1789. Act of July 31, 1789, c. 5, \u00a7 36, 1 Stat. 29, 47. In spite of their comparative severity, such sanctions have been upheld against the contention that they are essentially criminal and subject to the procedural rules governing criminal prosecutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">In Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333, 347, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637, the Court had before it for consideration a statute of the Territory of Idaho, which excluded from the privilege of voting, or of holding any office of honor, trust or profit, any person who was convicted of certain offenses, as well as any person who advocated resistance to the laws of the Territory, or justified or approved the commission of crimes forbidden by it. The \u25a0Court construed the statute as simply excluding the specified classes of persons from the privilege of voting or of holding office, and held that the Act was not open to any objection on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">In United States v. Landers, 92 U.S. 77, 79, 23 L.Ed. 603, it was held that a statute imposing a forfeiture of a soldier\u2019s pay on the ground of desertion, was not a punishment, and the fact of desertion did not have to be established by the finding of a court-martial, but might be determined administratively. This ruling was followed in United States v. Kingsley, 138 U.S. 87, 91, 11 S.Ct. 286, 34 L.Ed. 896.</p>\n<p id=\"A-M\"> It follows that the use of the term \u201cforfeiture\u201d is not determinative of the question whether Section 3504 provides punishment or prescribes an additional qualification for the award of compensation. The matter depends upon the intention of the Congress. It must be borne in mind that we are dealing with a gratuity or a gift. It is not an annuity to which the veteran has contributed, or insurance for which he has paid premiums. The Congress obviously has it within its power to grant or withhold gratuities in its discretion. It determined to pay such a gratuity to veterans suffering from a service connected disability, but it made an exception as against such veterans as were guilty of mutiny, treason, sabotage, or rendering assistance to an enemy of the United States. It seems natural that Congress would withhold gratuities from persons whose activities might undermine the very existence of the government of the United States. While it is far from conclusive, nevertheless the circumstance that this Section was included by Congress in the Title of the Code relating to \u201cVeterans\u2019 Benefits\u201d, rather than in the Criminal Code, is some indication of legislative intent that the provisions of Section 3504 should not be deemed .as imposing an additional punishment for the offenses therein enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">We are of the opinion, therefore, that Section 3504 does not seek to impose punishment, but merely prescribes an addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tional qualification fox' eligibility to receive a gratuity.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">The authorities on which the plaintiff relies are distinguishable. Cummings v. State of Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 71 U.S. 277, 18 L.Ed. 356, and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 71 U.S. 333, 18 L.Ed. 366, involved statutes that barred persons from practicing certain professions or pursuing specified occupations, unless they took an oath to the general effect that \u25a0 they had not participated in any armed hostility against the United States or manifested adherence to the cause of any enemy of the United States, foreign or domestic, or had any sympathy with those engaged in rebellion. The statutes in question had been enacted during the Reconstruction era after the Civil War. Manifestly there is a vast distinction in principle between barring a person from earning a livelihood in his' chosen endeavor and refusing to pay him a discretionary gratuity out of Government funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 78 S. Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460, involved a California statute which granted certain tax exemptions to veterans, but required them, in order to secure the benefit of the exemption, to take an oath that they had not advocated the overthrow of the Government by force or violence, or by other unlawful means. The statute was held unconstitutional purely because of what was deemed by the Supreme Court a vital procedural defect, in that it construed the measure as placing the burden of proof on the claimants to the exemption. The Supreme Court did not hold that it was unconstitutional to deny the tax exemptioxx to those veterans who refused or who were unable to take the required oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We conclude, therefore, that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504 is constitutional and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">It is further urged by the. plaintiff, however, that even if the statute is not repugnant to the Constitution, the Veterans Administration misconstrued the-Act; that the procedure provided by it was lacking in due process; and that the-conclusion of the Board is not supported, by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">At the threshold, however, the-plaintiff is confronted by the contention! of the Governmeixt that the action of the-Administrator of Veterans Affairs is-final and is not subject to review. This contention is based on 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211 (a), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-14\">\u201c(a) Except as provided in sections 784, 1661, 1761, and as to matters arising under chapter 37 of this, title, the decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact, concerning a claim for benefits or payments under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall be final and conclusive and' no other official or any court of the-United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">It is well settled that the Government may not be sued without its consent and that, therefore, it is under no-obligation to accord a judicial remedy in respect to claims against itself. Therefore, statutes either denying or withdrawing judicial remedies against the United States in respect to claims against it are constitutional. Lynch v. United States, 292 U.S. 571, 54 S.Ct. 840, 78 L. Ed. 1434. <em>A fortiori </em>this must be true in respect to gratuities and grants. Thus in Van Horne v. Hines, 74 App.D.C. 214, 216, 122 F.2d 207, 209, Groner, C. J., wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-16\">\u201cThere can be no doubt that veterans\u2019 benefits are gratuities and establish no vested rights in the recipient. * * * And this being so, such benefits may be withdrawn at any time by act of Congress, and to make the withdrawal effective, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>'Congress may in turn withdraw jurisdiction from the courts over decisions of the Administrator ih relation thereto. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">\u201cAnd this brings us to the single \u2022question, whether the act on its face \u25a0shows that Congress meant to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the \u25a0courts every final decision of the Administrator in relation to benefit payments in the nature of gratuities provided for under the act. We \"think this unmistakable intent is \u2022shown by the language of the act, and that the plain meaning of the words used bring us necessarily to this result, for the language is that the court shall not consider or review questions of law or fact \u2018concerning a claim for benefits or payments\u2019. The words \u2014 concerning a \u25a0claim for payments \u2014 can have no \u2022other meaning than \u2014 having relation to \u2014 such payments, and whatever the language of the prayer of the present complaint, the obvious purpose of the suit is to require the .Administrator to resume benefit payments to appellant which the Administrator has decided appellant has forfeited all right to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The following cases hold to the same effect: Hahn v. Gray, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 188, 203 F.2d 625; Sinlao v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 263, 271 F.2d 846; Magnus v. United States, 7 Cir., 234 F.2d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">This provision is equally applicable to \u25a0decisions terminating, discontinuing, or declining to renew payments as it is to original decisions on claims for compensation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Van Horne v. Hines, supra; Sinlao v. United States, supra. The conclusion is inescapable that the governing statute bars judicial review of the action of the Veterans Administration in this instance, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Assuming, however, <em>arguendo, </em>that the decision of the Veterans Administration was subject to judicial review, we would reach the following conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">\u2022 Section 3504 comprehends four differ-, ent grounds for denying or discontinuing the payment of gratuitous benefits to a-veteran, i. e., a finding on evidence satisfactory to the Administrator that the veteran has been guilty of mutiny; that he has been guilty of treason; that he has been guilty of espionage; or that he has been guilty of rendering assistance to any enemy of the United States or its allies. It should be observed that the statute is phrased in the disjunctive and not conjunctive. In this instance, the Administrator on evidence satisfactory to him found that the veteran had rendered assistance to an enemy of the United States during the Korean Conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\"> The procedure pursued by the Veterans Administration was proper and in accordance with the formula enunciated by the Supreme Court in Morgan v. United States, 304 U.S. 1, 18-19, 58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. 1129. A full hearing was accorded to the plaintiff. He was given notice of the claims and contentions of the Government with a detailed summary of the evidence supporting them, and was accorded an opportunity to meet them and present evidence and argument. The Constitutional requirement of confrontation with witnesses is limited only to criminal cases. The fact that the hearing was granted to the plaintiff at the appellate stage, instead of at the initial level is immaterial. Mr. Justice Stone in Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, 312 U.S. 126, 152, 61 S.Ct. 524, 536, 85 L.Ed. 624, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-12\">\u201cThe demands of due process do not require a hearing, at the initial stage or at any particular point or at more than one point in an administrative proceeding so long as the requisite hearing is held before the final order becomes effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The findings of fact and the conclusions of law made by the Veterans Administration are fully supported by substantial evidence. It is well settled that aid and assistance to the enemy may be extended in the <em>form </em>of verbal utterances alone, as was the case in this instance. Cramer v. United States, 325 U. S. 1, 29, 65 S.Ct. 918, 89 L.Ed. 1441; United States v. Burgman, D.C., 87 F. Supp. 568, 571; 88 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 188 F.2d 637; Gillars v. United States, 87 U.

United States, 9 Cir., 192 F.2d 338, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In the light of the foregoing discussion, the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted; and the plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-13\">.

S.C. \u00a7 3504 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">The Administrator did not find plaintiff guilty of mutiny, treason or sabotage, nor did his decision rest upon plaintiff\u2019s previous conviction under the Smith Act. In the case of another veteran the Court of Appeals for this Circuit had strongly intimated that a Smith Act conviction could not be the basis for forfeiture, that Act containing its own penalties. Wellman v. Whittier, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 6, 259 F.2d 163, opinion by Judge Danaher. The finding against the present plaintiff was that by speeches and articles he had been guilty of \u201crendering assistance to an enemy of the United States.\" I assume that this language describes an independent category of conduct and is not simply a modifying description of the immediately preceding categories of \u201cmutiny, treason, sabotage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">The application of the language to the speech and writings of the plaintiff constitutes a direct penalty for, and restriction upon, the use of speech and press. This is obvious. The case is indistinguishable in this respect from Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 518, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">We are asked by the Administrator to hold that by the vague language he relies upon Congress intended this restriction on speech and press. So to hold would require us to decide the serious and delicate question whether the restriction violates the mandate of the First Amendment that \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2022* * * abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press * If the statutory language can be reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ably interpreted so as to avoid penalizing the use of speech and press that interpretation should be adopted so that the constitutional issue is not reached for decision. Though not to be construed so as to destroy its effectiveness, a statute is to be construed \u201cnarrowly to avoid constitutional doubts.\u201d United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 623, 74 S.Ct. 808, 815, 98 L.Ed. 989.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">* * * what Congress has written, we said through Mr. Chief Justice (then Mr. Justice) Stone, \u201cmust be construed with an eye to possible constitutional limitations so as to avoid doubts as to its validity.\u201d Lucas v. Alexander, 279 U.S. 573, 577, [49 S.Ct. 426, 428, 73 L.Ed. 851]. As phrased by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, \u201cif a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\u201d Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 296, 76 L.Ed. 598, and cases cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 45, 73 S.Ct. 543, 97 L.Ed. 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In contrast with the statute involved in Flemming v. Nestor, 80 S.Ct. 1367, decided June 20, 1960, the language relied upon by the Administrator here is indefinite. It does not mention speech or writings. It can well be construed not to apply to these modes of expression, used however critically, when unaccompanied by conduct which, considered with what is said or written, would constitute a crime or at least would render direct assistance to the enemy. Gillars v. United States, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 16, 182 F.2d 962, held that speech as there used was not protected by the First Amendment since it constituted an element of the crime of treason. A construction which limits the restriction before us to comparable situations \u2014 that is, to situations where speech or writing is punishable or prohibitable without raising a serious issue under the First Amendment \u2014 is plainly indicated. See Speiser v. Randall, supra, 357 U.S. at pages 519-520, 78 S.Ct. at pages 1338-1339. Cf. Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 482-485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The language relied upon appears in immediate conjunction with \u201cmutiny, treason, sabotage.\u201d I am not willing to hold that in this context Congress provided that a veteran receiving disability benefits could not criticize the Government\u2019s participation in a war. The grant by Congress of disability compensation to a veteran is not to be construed as an attempt by Congress to withdraw a veteran\u2019s First Amendment rights. The Administrator, not Congress, has applied the language to speech and writings, unaccompanied by direct assistance or criminal conduct. Of course the Administrator has done this in the belief Congress has authorized it. But I think this belief is a mistaken one. For under the decisions of the Supreme Court I cannot ascribe to Congress a deliberate penalization of the spoken or written word in the absence of much clearer language to show a purpose to do so. The language here used not only does not mention speech or press but is so general as to the type of conduct intended to be covered that serious doubts arise not only under the First Amendment but under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">The contrary view would permit a forfeiture because of some indirect or remote assistance to an enemy thought by the Administrator, rather than specified by Congress, to arise from critical speech or writings. A forfeiture might occur should a veteran step over a line so vaguely drawn as to be indiscernible. As the Supreme Court in another connection recently stated, in Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 507, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 1419, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">\u201c * * * explicit action, especially in areas of doubtful constitutionality, requires careful and pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>poseful consideration by those responsible for enacting and implementing our laws. Without explicit action by- lawmakers, decisions of great constitutional import and effect would be relegated by default to administrators who, under our system of government, are not endowed with authority to decide them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The subsequent history of the provision fortifies me in the view that the language is not applicable to speech or writing unaccompanied by more direct assistance to an enemy. The Administrator himself played a commendable part in this history by his communications to those Members of Congress, Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, and Representative Olin E. Teague of Texas, who were in charge of amendments to the statute. The amendments enacted in 1959 have the effect, prospectively, in the case of a veteran who, like plaintiff, is a resident of or domiciled in a State when the acts relied upon for forfeiture occur, of permitting forfeiture only upon conviction of specified crimes. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3503(d), 3505 (Supp. I, 1959); H.R. Rep. No. 420, 86th Cong. 1st Sess. (1959); S. Rep. No. 664, 86th Cong. 1st Sess. (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">For the reasons set forth in the opinion of our Court of Appeals in Wellman v. Whittier, supra, I think the court has jurisdiction to review the administrative action in this case; and for the reasons above indicated I think the veteran is entitled to a judgment declaring the forfeiture of his service-connected disability benefits, on the grounds assigned by the Administrator, to have been unauthorized by Congress, and, therefore, invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">I have given my views on the merits because the three-judge court has taken jurisdiction, but under Flemming v. Nestor, supra, it appears the case is one for decision by a single District Judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">. \u201cTo deny an exemption [there a tax exemption to veterans] to claimants who engage in certain forms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such speech. Its deterrent effect is the same as if the State were to fine them for this speech.
