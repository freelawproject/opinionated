McBride, the only children of John then born, were respectively about seven, five, and three years of age; Francis afterwards died at the age of eight jmars. After the testator\u2019s death, as represented, three other children were born, viz.: John, now twenty-three years of age ; Caroline, now fifteen years of age, and Helen, now in her thirteenth year. John McBride, the fathel of these children, is now, as represented to the court, sixty-three years old, and his wife, Mary A. McBride, sixty years old. Joseph Augustine McBride, the trustee named in the will, died in 1886, and the present accountant, the Real Estate Title Insurance and Trust Company, was then appointed in his place. . . . The ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>count is of the stock held under the trust so created, and it has been filed at the instance of Charles J. and John P. McBride, claiming that the trust has ceased and that the estate is now distributable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\"><em>\u201c </em>The general rule in case of a legacy to the children of a designated person is that it shall not extend to after-born children, but where it is given with any suspension of the time so as to make the gift take place at a future period, then such children shall take as are living at that period (Singleton v. Gilbert, 1 Cox, 63); and hence if the distribution is to be made when all attain the age of twenty-one, or when the youngest attains the age of twenty-one, all, whenever born, may be admitted: Hughes v. Hughes, 3 Bro. C. C. 434; 14 Yesey, 256. A more restricted rule may be applied, where by reason of letting in members of the class coming into existence after the testator\u2019s death the limits of perpetuity may be exceeded or some principle of law violated: Kevern v. Williams, 5 Sim. 171.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">\u201c It is very evident in the present case that the trust for accumulation, except so far as it may be saved by the contingent limitation to a charity, is void unless it is confined to a minority in existence at the testator\u2019s death. The act of 1853, unlike the Thelussen act, does not permit accumulation during an arbitrary period of twenty-one years, but confines it to an existing minority, and for the benefit of the minor (Washington\u2019s Estate, 25 Smith, 102; Carson\u2019s Appeal, 3 Outerb. 325); and hence, if \u2018 the youngest child \u2019 spoken of in the will is to be understood as the youngest child of John McBride, whenever born, and the accumulation' as continuing until he shall attain the age of twenty-one, not only will the trust be invalid so far as concerns such accumulations, but as the persons who are to take are uncertain until the time for distribution, the accumulations themselves, instead of enuring to the benefit of the children of John, will, under the authorities, go to the residuary legatees to their entire exclusion: Ellis v. Maxwell, 3 Beav. 587; Gray on Perp. \u00a7 704, etc. And not only this, but as the law contemplates the possibility of the birth of issue, no matter what may be the age of the parents, no distribution of the principal could be made until the death of John McBride, because until then it could not be known that any of his liv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ing children would be the \u2018youngest.\u2019 The inconvenience thus arising would, of course, be of no consequence if the testator\u2019s meaning is clear and unequivocal, but it is not to be lost sight of in construing the will and in determining the meaning of what he has said. See Bonaffon\u2019s Estate, 14 W. N. 501. A construction which will satisfy the language used without leading to absurd or inconvenient results is to be preferred, still more so if the opposite construction will defeat the will altogether, and divert the bounty of the testator from those whom he manifestly intended to benefit, and give it to persons whom he thought he had already sufficiently provided for. Kevern v. Williams, supra; Bonaffon\u2019s Estate, supra; Gray on Perp. \u00a7 633.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">\u201c Before recurring to the language of the will with regard to the time of distribution, it is proper to consider how far the trust for accumulation is preserved by the limitations to the Orphan Asylum in the event of the death of the grandchildren or their ceasing to be connected with the Roman Catholic Church.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\">\u201cThe act of 1853 forbids accumulation except for the benefit of an existing minority, but with this qualification: \u2018 Provided, That any donation, bequest, or devise for any literary, scientific, charitable, or religious purpose shall not come within the prohibition of this section.\u2019 Literally, this would apply to contingent no less than vested gifts for the excepted purposes, but the act is a remedial one, and is to be interpreted so that the mischief may be suppressed and the remedy made effectual. It is to be construed in a manner that will \u2018 supresse subtill inventions to creepe out of the statutes\u2019 (Co. Litt., 230, <em>a.-l.') </em>; and unless the proviso be confined to direct gifts for charitable, etc., purposes, it is clear that all that would be necessary to prevent its operation in any case would be to insert in the will directing an accumulation for any period, within the limits of the rule against perpetuities, a provision that if all persons for whom it was intended should be then dead, the fund with its increase should go for religious or charitable or literary purposes. The act only excepts gifts of the character referred to where religious, charitable, or literary use is the sole and exclusive purpose of the accumulation. Anything beyond this would defeat the operation of the statute, which must, therefore, be understood accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201c The will was executed, as already stated, four years before the death of the testator. The gift is for \u2018 the use of Charles Joseph McBride, Catharine Philomena McBride, and Francis Aloysius McBride, children of my son John McBride, and such other children, lawful issue, which he may have, the said sum to accumulate until the youngest surviving of these children shall have attained the age of twenty-one years.\u2019 This may mean \u2018 such other children \u2019 as the son may have in the lifetime of the testator; such other children as he may have at any time while he lives; or such other children as he may have before the time of distribution. If it is to be understood as confined to children born during the lifetime of the testator, the three who have since been born must be excluded. If it is to be understood as including all who may by possibility be born in the son\u2019s lifetime, the trust for accumulation fails altogether, the accumulations pass to the residuary legatees, and the grandchildren get not even a share of the principal until the death of their father. But, it will be observed, the period of distribution is not \u2018 when the youngest child \u2019 who may be born to the son shall have attained the age of twenty-one yearn, but \u2018 when the youngest of these.\u2019 What is meant by \u2018 these ? \u2019 The names of the children then in being had just been mentioned by the testator, and the words which follow were words of general description merely. The word 'these \u2019 may refer to the designated children or it may refer to the whole class. In the former case the intention bf the testator will be in accordance with the law, and may be fully carried into execution; in the latter it fails utterly. We are warranted, therefore, under the authorities referred to, in adopting the former as the proper construction. <em>Benignos faoiendce sunt interpretaciones propter simplicitatem laicorum ut res magis valeat quwm pereat.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">\u201c Of the three children thus referred to by the testator, Catharine, the youngest survivor, attained the age of twenty-one in 1880. This was the time for distribution, and the class of distributees was then closed, no after-born' child being capable of taking (Iloste v. Pratt, 3 Vesey, 730; Picken v. Matthews, 10 Ch. Div. 264; Gray on Perp. \u00a7 379), though all born before then are.

It is not denied in the exceptions which were dismissed by the orphans\u2019 court in banc, or in the specifications of error filed in this court, that the appellees are members of the Roman Catholic Church, but it is contended that inasmuch as this conceded fact does not specifically appear in the adjudication the decree should be reversed. If it be true, as now intimated by the counsel for the appellant in their his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>tory of the case, that some of the appellees do not answer the testator\u2019s description of the persons entitled to share in the distribution, it is a matter which affects not the St. John\u2019s Orphan Asylum, but the other appellees, because by the terms of the will such grandchildren as answer that description at the time of distribution take the whole fund. If one of the five grandchildren to whom the trust fund was awarded was qualified to receive it the claim of the appellant is as effectually defeated as if all were qualified. If on the other hand all of the appellees are now incompetent to share in the distribution, it is difficult to understand why the appellant resists a construction which would give it the fund it is so anxious to appropriate to its own uses. We conclude in view of the concession on the audit, the attitude of the appellant on the question of construction and the absence of even a suggestion that all the grandchildren are disqualified, that the ninth specification requires no further consideration and should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The material and controlling question to be considered under the remaining specifications is whether the learned judge erred in ascertaining the time appointed by the will for the distribution of the trust fund. The conclusion reached by him in a clear and able opinion was, that the words, \u201c the youngest surviving of these children,\u201d refer to the children of John named in the will and living at the time of its execution, and that the persons entitled to the fund at the time of distribution are such of John\u2019s children or their issue, as then answer the testator\u2019s description of the primary objects of his bounty. This construction gives the fund in equal shares to the five children of John, now living, and harmonizes best with the obvious purpose of the testator in the creation of the trust and the disposition of its principal and accumulations. It was plainly his intention that John\u2019s children or their issue having the requisite qualifications, should have the full benefit of this trust, but it is clear that they cannot if the construction contended for by the appellant prevails. The statutory limit of a trust for accumulation to take effect at the death of the creator of it is twenty-one years, and such a trust for any period beyond this limit is void as to the excess. Act of April 18, 1853, P. L. 503 ; Brown et al. v. Williamson\u2019s Executors, 36 Pa. 338. A trust to accumulate until the youngest surviving of the chib <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>dren John may have attains the age of twenty-one years is transgressive. It must according to the contention of the appellant continue while John lives, and it may cover a period of twenty-One years after his death. The presumption is that the testator knew and endeavored to comply with the law applicable to the trust he created, and if his will fairly admits of a construction which sustains the trust and gives the proceeds of it to his intended beneficiaries it should be adopted. It was in'the light of these principles that the learned auditing judge read and construed the will, and the learned orphans\u2019 court in banc approved the adjudication. Is such construction justified by the language of the will and the authorities pertinent to the subject ? It sustains and its results are in harmony with the letter and spirit of the trust. If the words \u201c until the youngest surviving of these children shall have attained the age of twenty-one years \u201d refer to the children the testator had previously, in the same paragraph of his will, designated by their \u201e names, the time for distribution came when Catharine was twenty-one, because she was the youngest of \u201c these children \u201d who attained that age, and if the words \u201c such other children lawful issue which he may have \u201d mean such other children as John may have at that time, the adjudication is right. We think this construction is fairly warranted by the authorities referred to in the opinion of the learned auditing judge, and that by it effect is given to the manifest intention of the testator. As it terminates the trust and is decisive against the claim of the appellant, we need not discuss the matters which are merely incidental, further than to say that the appellees are not estopped by the petition under which The Real Estate, Title, Insurance and Trust Company was appointed trustee from now asserting their claim to the trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
