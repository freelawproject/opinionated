After execution of deed, and before recording of mortgage, a house was built upon the land, and various mechanics\u2019 liens attached. The liens allowed were conceded to be-in proper form. One of them claimed for work begun Oct. 28, 1889, and stated defendant\u2019s title as an equitable one. Appellant claimed that there was no evidence that the material was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>necessary for the improvement of the separate estate or on the wife\u2019s credit. The evidence showed that she knew of the building contracted for by her husband, and did nob object. The auditor distributed the fund to the mechanics\u2019 liens in preference to the mortgage, allowing interest on the liens to the date of distribution. Various exceptions were filed to the auditor\u2019s report, all of which were overruled by the court in an opinion by Barker, P.

The mortgage in favor of J. J. Pepperday was not filed until more than sixty days from its execution, and after the mechanics\u2019 liens had attached. This answers the first and second specifications of error. The third does not conform to the rules of court and will not be considered. The fourth specification alleges that the court below erred in allowing interest on the liens to the day of distribution. This was doubtless an oversight, and would have been corrected in the court below had the attention of the learned judge been called to it. The interest should have been allowed only to time of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">With this modification the decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
