Schmertz to William Loeffler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-7\">The court below filed the following opinion, by White, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-8\">\u201cThe affidavits on which an issue is demanded set forth many facts, which, if true, would indicate fraudulent conduct on the part of W. E. Schmertz in purchasing goods and carrying on his business when he was insolvent and must have known that fact. [But there is no averment of any fraudulent act on the part of the plaintiff, Loeffler, and no averment that the judgment given to the plaintiff was fraudulent, or that he was knowingly a party to any fraudulent acts of - Schmertz.] [2] The only ground on which it is assailed is, that it was given for a larger amount than was necessary to cover his liabilities for Schmertz. [And that question is to be determined by his answer, for there is nothing to contradict the answer and affidavit of Loeffler.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-9\">\u201c In his answer he says that when Schmertz asked him on the 13th June, 1891, to indorse notes for the amount of $13,000, he said \u2018 he woujd indorse the paper to the amount of $13,000, if he, Schmertz, would secure him not only against the loss of that sum, but would also, through him, secure the firm of Robt. C. Schmertz &amp; Co., Limited, against all loss and liability by reason of money loaned him by said firm, and indorsements then made or that might thereafter be made for him by affiant as secretary and treasurer of said firm; and secure affiant against all loss and liability individually upon all indorsements, loans and advances made or that might thereafter be made by said affiant for him; and against all loss and liability by reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of his suretyship in said bonds mentioned or by reason of any and all payments made by affiant to him as guardian aforesaid. To this, \u00a5m. E. Schmertz then and there assented and agreed. With this understanding and for that purpose, the judgment note was signed by the said Wm. E. Schmertz and delivered to affiant; whereupon affiant indorsed three additional notes,\u2019 etc., for the $53,000. The suretyship referred to was on bonds of said Schmertz, as guardian of the minor children of Robt. C. Schmertz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-4\">\u201c At the time said judgment of $100,000 was given, June 13, 1891, the claims and liabilities of said Loeffler for said Schmertz were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-5\">Endorsements for R. C.

The stock was pledged by Schmertz for loans he obtained, and is still in pledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-17\">\u201c The amount of this stock added to the actual liabilities of June 13,1891, amount to more than the money realized on the said execution and now in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-18\">\u201c The plaintiff is entitled to hold his judgment as security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>for his suretyship on the guardian bonds. He may not be entitled to collect that amount of money, if it can be realized on the judgment given directly to the minors or their guardian ; or, possibly, until it is absolutely certain he will have to pay it. But that question is not involved in this rule. [The only question before us is, was the judgment to Loeffler fraudulent, given for a fraudulent purpose, or fraudulently given for an excessive amount ?] [7] I think there is no evidence that would justify such an inference. As Loeffler sets forth all the facts in the case, the amount due, if any, on this account, can be ascertained, when the time arrives, without an issue. Rule for issue discharged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-4\">The court entered a decree Oct. 24, 1891, ordering payment of money in court to plaintiff.

That was not what the statute intended. The statute intends that the jury shall do that. What is committed to the court is the applicant\u2019s affidavit. If it sets out facts relevant and material to an issue on the validity of the judgment, then the court must grant the issue and at the trial submit the fact to the jury: Providence Co. v. Chase, 108 Pa. 522 Dormer v. Brown, 72 Pa. 407; Benson\u2019s Ap., 48 Pa. 159 Bichel v. Rank, 5 Watts, 140; Trimble\u2019s Ap., 6 Watts, 133; Robinson\u2019s Ap., 36 Pa. 81; Souder\u2019s Ap., 57 Pa. 498.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-7\">A judgment confessed for a sum greater than is due is -prima facie fraudulent: Benson\u2019s Ap., 48 Pa. 159; Clark v. Douglas, 62 Pa. 408, 417.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-8\">If this appeal was taken in accordance with the statutes as in other cases, when this court\u2019s writ of certiorari sur appeal was filed in the lower court, it superseded all further proceedings there. By it the record was removed into this court, and there was nothing left in the lower court upon which the court below could enter a valid decree. A writ of error or certiorari is a supersedeas at common law: Ewing v. Thompson, 43 Pa. 372.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>January 3, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-2\">The act of June 16, 1836, \u00a7 7, P. L. 762, only changed the common law by providing that execution should not be stayed unless recognizance was given with sufficient sureties conditioned \u201c to prosecute the writ with effect and to pay the defendant damages and costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-3\"><em>George O. </em>Wilson, for appellee. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1U\">An appeal not having been taken from the decree of distribution within twenty days, this proceeding should be quashed: Providence Co. v. Chase, 108 Pa. 319.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-4\">A chief object of the act of 1846 was to prevent frivolous applications and to confer power upon the court to determine whether any material facts were in dispute: Providence Co. v. Chase, 108 Pa. 323.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-5\">Under \u00a7 87 of the act of June 16, 1836, as amended by the act of April 20, 1846, a party is not entitled to an issue upon a mere allegation without evidence or against the evidence: Knight\u2019s Ap., 19 Pa. 494.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s judgment was proper to secure him in the liability which he has assumed. That he has not actually paid the money matters not. He may have his judgment, and not only his judgment, but his execution: Miller v. Howry, 3 P. &amp; W. 374; Ardesco Oil Co. v. Mining Co., 66 Pa. 374; Balph v. Rynd, 26 Pitts. L. J. 45; Stewart v. Stocker, 1 Watts, 135; Lyle v. Ducomb, 5 Bin. 585; Bamford v. Keefer, 68 Pa. 391.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-7\">Nor is there anything in any of the cases cited by appellants that conflicts with the principle laid down in our eases. Bichel v. Rank, 5 Watts, 140, and Trimble\u2019s Ap., 6 Watts, 133, were under the original act of 1836, and before the passage of the supplementary legislation had for its chief object \u201c the prevention of frivolous applications: \u201d Providence v. Chase, 108 Pa. 323.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-8\">Other cases cited by appellant\u2019s counsel, Dormer v. Brown. 72 Pa. 407; Benson\u2019s Ap., 48 Pa. 159, and Clark v. Douglass, 62 Pa. 408, go no further than this, that if a judgment be fraudulently confessed and petitioner\u2019s affidavit shall set forth the nature and character of the fraud, then the court shall determine whether such issue shall be granted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AFd\">Mr. Chief Justice Paxson,</author>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The first specification alleges that the court below erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>refusing an issue as prayed for in appellant\u2019s petition. The \u2022appellant relies on the act of April 20, 1846, P. L. 411. That portion of it, which affects this case, is as follows: \u201c Provided, that before an issue shall be directed upon the distribution of money arising from sales under execution, or orphans\u2019 court sales, the applicants for such issue shall make affidavit that there are material facts of dispute therein, and shall set forth the nature and character thereof; upon which affidavit the \u25a0court shall determine whether such issue shall be granted, subject to a writ of error or appeal by such applicant, if the issue be refused, in like manner as in other cases in which such suit now lies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Under this act it is plain that it is the duty of the court below to determine whether the facts in dispute are material, and are sufficiently set forth, and if they are not so, to refuse the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">If the facts on which this issue were demanded are correctly set forth in the affidavits they would certainly indicate fraud \u25a0on the part of Schmertz. But conceding that he is a rogue and that his purchases of goods were made with intent to cheat his creditors, it is necessary to connect the plaintiff, Loeffler, with the fraud, before he can be affected. This has not been made to appear. It is not denied that he was a creditor of \u25a0Schmertz, and the only ground on which the judgment held by him was seriously attacked is that it was given for a larger amount than was necessary to cover the liabilities of Loeffler for Schmertz. The learned judge below finds that at the time the judgment of $100,000 was given, June 13, 1891, the claims and liabilities of said Loeffler for said Schmertz amounted to $101,616.66. It is not needed that we should go into the items of which this sum was composed, as the learned judge below has given sufficient reasons for' his refusal to award an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
