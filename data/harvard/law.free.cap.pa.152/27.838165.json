J., of the 33d judicial district, specially presiding, plaintiffs claimed that defendants were liable for 796,372 bricks, the number being ascertained by measurement in the wall. Defendants claimed that they were liable for only 603,131, which number they found by counting the bricks in the wall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-11\">Plaintiffs introduced, under objection and exception, various testimony which tended to show the expression \u201c measured in the wall \u201d was a term in common use among brick makers, and that it meant to measure up the wall to get the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>cubic feet and take twenty-one and one half brick to the cubic foot. [1-5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-4\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\">[\u201c What is meant by \u2018 measuring in the wall,\u2019 whether it is taking the number of cubic feet and allowing twenty-one and one half brick to the cubic foot, or whether it is counting the number of bricks long, the number of rows high and the number of bricks in thickness of this wall, and counting out the openings ? To arrive at that, gentlemen, you will take into consideration from the evidence placed before you the kind of contract they would enter into, or what they meant by this kind of a contract, being men engaged in that kind of business, whether or not it is reasonable that they both, or either of them, would understand that brick were to be counted in the wall by the manner in which the defendants allege, or whether it was to be counted by so many brick to the cubic foot as the plaintiffs allege.] [6] ....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\">\u201c [In the defendants\u2019 testimony on that point there seems to be a good many persons called who had practical experience in that line \u2014 in the way of measuring, counting brick in the wall to find out the material, who <em>s\u00bfiy </em>the way is to count by actual count, as they call it \u2014 counting the number of bricks long, the number of rows high and the number of bricks wide. These witnesses are from Allegheny county; the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses are from this county. We will not undertake to say whethei there should be any different usages in the trade in this county and Allegheny county. They seem to be almost contiguous vicinities, and it will be for you to say which of these claims is the correct one, whether it is right as stated by the witnesses for the plaintiff to measure the wall in accordance with this contract by taking cubic feet and allowing twenty-one and one-half brick to the cubic foot, or whether or not the claim of the defendants is the correct way of taking this under this contract \u2014that is, counting the brick as given by the witnesses of the defendants.\u201d] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-7\">Defendants\u2019 point, refused, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-8\">\u201c 3. The evidence of the rule as to there being a custom among builders to ascertain the number of brick in a building by measuring the wall in cubic feet and ascertaining its contents in this case does not fulfill these requirements, and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>be excluded from the. jury in ascertaining the number of brick in this building.\u201d [8]</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ak\">November 7, 1892:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-3\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff.

The contract was not in writing and the parties differed in their recollection of it. This raised a question of fact which was fairly submitted to the jury. There was no question of \u201ccustom\u201d in the case, in the ordinary meaning of the term. It was entirely competent to show by the testimony of persons in the trade what the expression \u201c measured in the wall \u201d means, and how such measurement is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">There is an expression in that portion of the charge embraced in the sixth specification which is not free from criticism, but we regard it as harmless. The effect of it was merely to leave the jury to find whether the brick were to be counted in tbe wall by the manner in which the defendants allege, or whether it was to be counted by so many bricks to the cubic foot as the plaintiffs allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
