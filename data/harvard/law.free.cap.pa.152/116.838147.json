The bill contained an alternative prayer that should the court be of opinion that defendant had the right to make such crossing of plaintiff\u2019s tracks in any manner, the court would prescribe the place where and the manner in which such crossing might be made and used, and what precautions or provisions should be observed to best protect life and property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">On hearing of motion for preliminary injunction, the court, in an opinion by Stowe, P. J., 1 Dist. R. Ill, ordered an injunction to issue until the court should be informed by sufficient evidence as to the safest and best manner of regulating and guarding the crossing. The case being put at issue a commissioner was appointed to take testimony, and, upon the coming in of his report, the following facts were agreed upon by the parties:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">Plaintiff company, incorporated in 1846, acquired, in 1850, under its power of eminent domain, a strip of land sixty-six feet in width through the land of Isaac Mills in what is now Braddock township, Allegheny county, Pa., for the construction and operation of its railroad, and upon this strip (which includes the point of crossing in controversy) shortly after-wards constructed and has since operated its railroad, consisting now, at Copeland station, the proposed crossing point, of four main tracks, to which is shortly to be added a fifth track. In addition to the main tracks there is also at present an additional track or siding leading into an ice-house on the south side of plaintiff\u2019s railroad and on the west side of the road below mentioned, upon which defendant\u2019s railway is constructed. Plaintiff has also constructed and erected upon its said right of way telegraph wires, and the signal appliances below re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ferred to, which are in use and necessary for the operation of plaintiff\u2019s railroad. Plaintiff\u2019s railroad at the proposed point of crossing has a heavy grade descending eastwardly, being about forty-seven feet per mile. The four main tracks are used indiscriminately for freight and passenger traffic, and a large number of trains pass Copeland station daily upon said tracks. The number of regular daily trains in December, 1891, was two hundred and twenty-eight, of which about two hundred pass Copeland between 6 A. M. and midnight. In October, 1889, at No. 13, March sessions 1889, of the court of quarter sessions of Allegheny county, a road for public use was confirmed and ordered to be opened [sixty feet wide] from the northerly line of the borough of Braddock (being an extension of Fourth street in said borough), a distance of about twelve hundred and fifty feet, crossing plaintiff\u2019s railroad at grade, and extending to the public road from Braddock to Wilkinsburg which runs in this locality approximately parallel and near to plaintiff\u2019s railroad. This road was accordingly opened by the township supervisors, and has since been maintained and used as a township road. This road, however, had previously existed on both sides of plaintiff\u2019s tracks through dedication to public use by the owners of the land upon plans laid out by them. The plaintiff owns in fee a lot of land on the southern side of its railroad adjoining its right of way and abutting or fronting upon the said road, and on this lot are located the Copeland station buildings. Approaching plaintiff\u2019s tracks from the southern side the said road for a distance of one hundred and fifty feet from the centre of plaintiff\u2019s tracks rises at a grade of ten and one half feet in the hundred, and after crossing plaintiff\u2019s tracks continues to rise on the north side thereof at the rate of six and nine tenths feet per hundred to the public road between Braddock and Wilkinsburg, called Charles street or Hawkins avenue. On the west side of the said road on the north and south sides of plaintiff\u2019s tracks are buildings which interfere with the view of plaintiff\u2019s tracks by any one approaching the same upon the road, but when one has reached plaintiff\u2019s tracks they can be' seen, if not occupied by trains, for a distance of about nineteen hundred feet to the west and about thirteen hundred feet to the east from the crossing. West of the said road on both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>sides of plaintiff\u2019s tracks are several streets or highways dedicated to public use leading to, but not crossing, plaintiff\u2019s right of way. The topography is such that at First street, about seven hundred feet west of the said road, it would be practicable to cross plaintiff\u2019s tracks by means of an overhead crossing or bridge. A substantial structure spanning plaintiff\u2019s right of way would cost from $6,000 to $7,000, exclusive of approaches on the south side, which would have to be constructed above the natural grade of the ground with the consent of property owners affected thereby. A short distance east of the said road a crossing beneath plaintiff\u2019s tracks is also practicable, but at considerably greater cost, and in part through private property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-3\">On June 9,1890, defendant company was incorporated under the act of May 14,1889, with authority to construct, maintain, and operate a street railway for public use in the conveyance of passengers by power other than locomotive upon certain streets and highways in Braddock borough and Braddock township, but not including or covering the road at the crossing here in controversy. Pursuant to the power given by said act defendant company on July 29, 1890, Jan. 15, 1891, and May 22, 1891, by action of its board of directors, changed or modified its route, one of these modifications or extensions (that of July 29,1890) covering the road and the crossing here in controversy. In February, 1891, the then supervisors of Braddock township gave their written consent to the construction of defendant\u2019s railway. On June 9, 1891, defendant asked consent of plaintiff to construct at the expense of defendant a bridge for its electric railway to cross plaintiff\u2019s tracks overhead at First street. No definite reply was given immediately to this request, the delay, as explained by Mr. Robert Pitcairn, plaintiff\u2019s general agent and superintendent, to whom defendant\u2019s letter was addressed, being by reason of an effort made by him to effect an arrangement with the supervisors of Braddock township, under which plaintiff company might, at its own expense, construct a bridge over its railroad at some suitable point near Copeland which would furnish an overhead crossing both for general travel and for the electric railway, so as to abolish the grade crossing of the road at Copeland station. On Aug. 20, 1891, Mr. Pitcairn, on behalf of plaintiff, wrote to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the defendants letter, intended, as lie says, to express plaintiff\u2019s assent to the construction of the bridge as proposed by defendant\u2019s letter of June 9th, but which defendant says it understood to be an assent to the construction of an overhead bridge on the road at Copeland station instead of at First street. Defendant having let its contract for the construction of its railway upon the road crossing plaintiff\u2019s tracks at grade at Copeland, this bill was filed. Defendant has constructed its railway upon and along the said road on both sides of plaintiff\u2019s tracks, with air overhead trolley wire carrying the electric current, which trolley wire is supported by cross wires and poles set in the ground erected on both sides of the road or highway, and upon this railway so constructed (at present a single track) proposes to operate and- run street cars by electricity, crossing plaintiff\u2019s tracks at grade from the southern side to the northern.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-4\">Plaintiff has in use upon all of the tracks of its railroad between Pittsburgh and Stewart station, a distance of about seventeen miles (and thus extending beyond or east of Copeland station), a system of signals necessary for the operation of its trains, known as the automatic-pneumatic electric system. Under this system the railroad is divided into sections of about one half mile each, and at the end of each section are located for each track two signals, known respectively as the home and distance signals, the home signal indicating the condition of the section of track first in advance and the distance signal indicating the condition of the section second in advance. These signals are operated by an electric current, of which the rail of the track is the conductor. Anything which makes a metallic connection between the two rails of the track, as, for example, the wheels and axles of an engine or car, permits the electric current to pass from one rail to the other, and thereby automatically moves the signals at the end of the section, the home signal indicating danger and the distance signal indicating caution. The construction of defendant\u2019s railway makes a metallic connection between the two rails of each one of the plaintiff\u2019s main tracks, and would render useless the signals on that section unless some means were taken to overcome .the difficulty. So far as the operation of the signals is concerned, it is practicable to overcome the difficulty by insulating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the rails of each track on both sides of the proposed crossing and connecting the rails between the insulated points, using as conductors underground wires instead of the rails themselves. While this restores the operations of the signals as to the section generally it necessarily cuts out of and disconnects from the signal system that portion of each of plaintiff\u2019s tracks between the insulated points on both sides of the crossing (being a distance of two rail lengths, or about sixty feet), so that an obstruction of any sort on plaintiff\u2019s tracks between the insulated points or on defendant\u2019s track upon, the crossing would have no effect upon the signals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-3\">The court, after argument, entered a decree dissolving the injunction previously granted, sustaining defendant\u2019s right to cross at grade, and prescribing the terms upon which defendant should construct and operate its grade crossings, in opinion by Stowe, P.

One of the witnesses, whose large and varied experience as a railroad superintendent entitles his opinion to great weight, says: \u201c My own judgment in regard to a street crossing, either by horses, electricity or cable, is that any one attempting such a crossing at camp Copeland is no less guilty than a man who would in cold blood murder his fellow being. ... I mean by that, what I have said to these people,that no power on earth, nor any arrangement, nor any mechanical, electrical or other device that I am personally aware of at present, can prevent the loss of life.\u201d Again, speaking of electric roads, he further testifies: \u201c I can say from personal observation that an electric street railroad is the most dangerous of all street car railroads, from the fact that there are two parties in control, the motorman in front with his electricity and the conductor in the rear with his trolley \u2014 and unless they both act in unison and fully understand what each other desires to do, trouble ensues. A conductor on the rear end of the car can place the motorman entirely helpless. In crossing the railroad at such points as Copeland there is great danger \u2014 as I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>personally noticed in Pittsburgh. \u2014 of their trolley being disconnected and the car stopping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">Without further reference to the testimony, it is sufficient to say, that the very frequent and rapid passage, to and fro, of trains on the four tracks of plaintiff\u2019s road (over two hundred daily between six o\u2019clock, A. M., and midnight), the descending grade and curvature of said tracks, obstructed view, in short, all the environments of the crossing, co-operate in making it exceedingly perilous, so exceptionally dangerous, indeed, that it is surprising the directors of defendant company are willing to imperil the lives and limbs of their patrons by attempting to cross at grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">It is conceded that the topography of the vicinity is such, that, at First street, about seven hundred feet west of defendant\u2019s road, it would be practicable to cross plaintiff\u2019s tracks by means of a substantial overhead viaduct or bridge, spanning plaintiff\u2019s right of way and costing from $6,000 to $7,000, exclusive of approaches on the south side; that, \u201c a short distance east of the said road, a crossing, beneath plaintiff\u2019s tracks, is also practicable, but at considerably greater cost, and in part through private property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">More than twenty years ago, the necessity for special judicial control of corporations, and especially railroads, assumed tangible form in passage of the act of June 19,1871, entitled \u201cAn act relating to legal proceedings by or against corporations: \u201d P. L. 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The first section provides that in all proceedings in which it is alleged that the private rights of individuals or the rights or franchises of other corporations are injured or invaded by any corporation, etc., it shall be the duty of the court to examine, inquire, and ascertain whether such corporation does in fact possess the right or franchise to do the act or acts complained of, and, if it does not, to restrain such injurious acts, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The second section declares: \u201c When such legal proceedings relate to crossings of lines of railroads by other railroads, it shall be the duty of the courts of equity of this commonwealth to ascertain and define by their decree the mode of such crossing which will inflict the least practical injury upon the rights of the company owning the road intended to be crossed; and, if in the judgment of such court it is reasonably practicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>avoid agrade crossing, they shall by their-process prevent a crossing at grade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APD\">The manifest purpose of this is not merely <em>to discourage </em>grade crossings because of their danger to the public as well as injury to the company whose road is crossed, but also to <em>prevent </em>them whenever in the judgment of the court it is reasonably practicable to avoid such dangerous and injurious crossing. As an exercise of the police power of the state, the wisdom of the provision has become more manifest, from year to year, as railroads multiply. Referring to the general necessity for exercising the restraining power thus conferred on courts of equity, the present Chief Justice, in Perry County Railroad, etc. v. Newport, etc. Railroad Co., 150 Pa. 193, 199, says: \u201c The time for grade crossings in this state has passed. They ought not to be permitted, except in case of imperious necessity. They admittedly involve great danger to life and property. In the earlier period of railroads this danger was overlooked, or, at least, disregarded. The desire of the people for this species of improvements tended to close their eyes to the dangers involved. The traffic then upon railroads was comparatively light, and trains ran at long intervals. The rapid development of the country, the enormous growth in wealth, population and business, has materially changed the relations of railroads to the public and to each other. The result is that we now see railroad companies and municipalities spending enormous sums in correcting the defects of earlier railroad construction, and especially in avoiding grade crossings. We must, therefore, construe the act of 1871 in accordance with our present surroundings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It is claimed by defendant, however, that the eighteenth section of the act of 1889, under which it is incorporated, expressly authorizes it \u201cto cross at grade, diagonally or transversely, any railroad operated by steam or otherwise, now or hereafter built.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">If by the language thus employed the legislature intended not only to barter away the police power of the state in regard to such grade crossings, but also to limit the jurisdiction of courts of equity in relation thereto, then, indeed, the learned judge fitly characterized such legislation as \u201cexceedingly vicious,\u201d but we cannot think any such construction as that-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>should be given to \u00a7 18 of the act (art. 16, \u00a7 8, const.). It is a well recognized principle of legislation that grants of franchises \u00e1re made and accepted in subordination to the police power of the state. This results from the inherent nature of that power, which, \u201c in its broadest acceptance, means the general power of a government to preserve and promote the public welfare, even at the expense of individual rights: \u201d 18 Am. &amp; Eng. Ene. L. 740. The exact scope of the term is not easily defined, but all agree that it \u201c extends to the protection of life, limbs, health, comfort and quiet of all persons, and protection of all property within the state, according to the maxim <em>sio utere tuo ut alienum non laedas: </em>\u201d Thorpe v. Railroad Co., 27 Vt. 149. In Com. v. Alger, 61 Mass. 53, Mr. Chief Justice Shaw speaks of it as a settled principle, growing out of well ordered civil society, that every holder of property, however absolute and unqualified may be his title, holds it under the implied liability that his use of it may be so regulated that it shall not be injurious to others or to the rights of the community. The principle finds appropriate expression in the maxim, <em>salus populi suprema lex. </em>\u201cFranchises are always granted subject to the police power. The doctrine that grants of .franchises are contracts has also been frequently invoked in efforts to protect corporations from the operation of laws passed in pursuance of the police power of states. But all .agree that the legislature cannot bargain away the police power of the state: \u201d 8 Am. &amp; Eng. Ene. L. 621, and notes. We are, therefore, warranted in concluding that a\u2019surrender of that power was neither affected nor intended to be made by the act under consideration. Nor, do we think that the jurisdiction, conferred by the second section of the act of 1871, was in any manner restricted or limited by the act of 1889. As we have seen, the latter is entitled \u201cAn act to provide for the incorporation and government of street railway companies in this commonwealth.\u201d This title conveys not the slightest intimation of any intention to interfere with the jurisdiction theretofore conferred on courts of equity relating to railroad crossings at grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">The tenth section of the general railroad act of April 4, 1868, provides that \u201c railroad companies formed under the provisions of this act shall have the right to construct roads so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>to cross at grade the track or tracks of any other railroad in this commonwealth.\u201d In Pittsburgh etc. R. R. Co. v. Railroad Co., 77 Pa. 173, it was held that the exercise of this right was subject to judicial control. It was there said: \u201c The appellee was subjected to the operation of the act of June 19, 1871. Under the act of 1868, the place where and the manner in which one railroad might cross another at grade were undoubtedly subjected to review by a court of equity. The fact that it might cross at grade gave it no perverse and arbitmy right to do so, regardless of the rights of the corporation injured thereby, and of the safety of the public. Every legislative grant is made with the implied reservation that it shall not injure others: Com. v. Penna. Canal Co., 66 Pa. 42. Railroads are public highways. They cannot, therefore, for all purposes, be considered private property only. As they possess a public character, they are subject to public supervision. Besides we cannot presume the legislature ever intended to divest itself of the exercise of the police power of the state. The right to regulate railroad crossings naturally flows from that reserved power. . . . Moreover, the evident intendment of the statute is to discourage crossing at grade. . . . Each succeeding year will increase the necessity for avoiding them. Their construction should now and henceforth be discouraged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We have no doubt electric railways are within the purview of the act of 1871. They are certainly within the mischief for which the second section provides a remedy. In Hestonville R. R. Co. v. Phila., 89 Pa. 210, it was held that the act of May, 1861, entitled an \u201c act relating to railroad companies,\u201d included passenger railway companies. This was approvingly followed in Citizen\u2019s Pass. Railway Co. v. Pittsburgh, 14 W. N. 268, wherein it was held that the real estate of a passenger railway company was within the meaning of an act making real estate of \u201c railroads \u201d liable to taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The view we have thus taken of the main question renders unnecessary the consideration of minor questions presented by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Decree reversed, with costs to be paid by defendant, and record remitted to the court below with instructions to enter a decree perpetually enjoining defendant from crossing plaintiff\u2019s road at grade, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
