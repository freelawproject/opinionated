The court affirmed a point which required an instruction that \u201cthe style and tone of the narrative exaggerate and magnify the alleged fault of the plaintiff and is evidence of malice,\u201d and left the whole case to the jury on the two questions whether the article contained a substantially fair and true account of what happened, and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the defendants had probable and reasonable cause to believe their statement true, and made proper inquiries and used care in what they said, believing it to be true. <em>Held </em>not to be error.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b431-4\">\n<em>Comment by the court upon plaintiff\u2019s conduct.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b431-5\">In such a case a statement of the court that they could not see how an officer could be more degraded than to be under the influence of liquor while on duty, was within the bounds of just judicial comment.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>Evidence in support of good faith of publication.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b431-7\">Evidence that the military authorities preferred charges against plaintiff for his conduct, and that the inspection roll of his company showed that he was under arrest after the date of the publication, was properly received in support of the statements and the good faith of the published articles, although the charges and the entry in the inspection roll were after the main transaction.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b431-8\">\n<em>Sending out libelous publication with the jury.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b431-9\">It is not error for the court to refuse to send out with the jury the libelous publication, especially where it does not appear that the court was asked to do so.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b431-10\">Argued Oct. 25, 1892.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADQ\">Appeal, No. 214, Oct.

If the officer of the guard had won there might have been a tragedy, for he was drunk. The homeless deputy sheriff, with his wife and babies swept to death past the place where they struggled, was dead sober and in the right. The officer of the National Guard was First Lieutenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Joseph Jackson, Company G, Fourteenth Regiment. His company came with that regiment in this hour of distress to protect survivors from ruffianism and maintain the peace and dignity of the state. The man with whom he fought for the weapon was Peter Fitzpatrick, almost crazy in his own woe, but singularly cool and self-possessed regarding the safety of those left living. It was one o\u2019clock this afternoon when <em>The Times </em>correspondent noticed on the Cambria road the young officer with his long military coat cut open, leaning heavily for support upon two privates of Company I, Hawthorne and Stewart (boys). He was crying, in a maudlin way, \u201c You just take me to a place and I\u2019ll drink soft stuff.\u201d They entreated him to return to the regimental quarters, even begged him, but he cast them aside and went staggering down the road to the line, where he met. the grave-faced deputy face to face.

The Lieutenant put his hand to his pistol pocket, then Deputy Fitzpatrick seized him and the struggle for the weapon began. For a moment it was fierce and desperate, then another private came to the deputy\u2019s assistance. The revolver was wrested from the drunken officer, and he himself was pushed back, panting to the ground. Deputy Fitzpatrick seized the military coat he had thrown on the ground, and with it and the weapon started to the regimental headquarters. Then the privates got around him and begged him, one of them with tears in his eyes, not to report their officer, saying that he was a good man when he was sober. He studied a long while, standing in the road, while the officer slunk away over the hill. Then he threw the disgraced uniform to them and said: \u201cHere, give it to him; and mind you, if he does not go at once to his quarters, I\u2019ll take him there, dead or alive.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-3\">THE DISGRACED SOLDIER.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\"><em>He demands and is granted an Investigation </em>\u2014 If <em>found </em>guilty, <em>He will be severely punished.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">Branch Office of The Pittsburg Times, Johnstown, June, 6.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\">Lieutenant Jackson has had his sword taken from him and he is put off all duty.

Davis, the two correspondents of <em>The </em>Times, who witnessed the whole of his disgraceful conflict while he was drunk and in full uniform on Wednesday with the poor deputy on the Cambria road who had lost his family and home in the flood.

The patrols to the desolate districts were just going out of camp and could be seen marching down through the valley in the distance, while the guards already held the river passes and Company G filed by with the Second Lieutenant in command.

The law is that where a public officer is concerned the people have a right to know, particularly in times like those when they were sent there to prevent marauding and protect the p\u00ab or people who were distressed beyond anything that has evei happened in our state. Under those circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>stances, did this correspondent in writing, to the paper do any more than to give a substantial account of what happened? Not whether the one struck first or the other, not whether they talked loud, but substantially did he state the facts of the occurrence ? If he did the paper had a right to print it, and we had a right to read it. The learned counsel argued very eloquently to you that they went beyond that. That is for you to say and not for the court. He alleges that they went away beyond that, and especially that the tone of the article was malicious, and intended to further degrade the plaintiff. [Well, for my part I cannot see how an officer could be more degraded than to be under the influence of liquor while he is on duty. It is certainty not commendable, to say the least. I only say this for myself, not for the jury.] [9] . . . . Plaintiff says that he was not arrested and his sword taken from him; that these statements are not correct, and that things are put in this article which did not occur. So, you will say whether that was a fair and substantial statement of what occurred there. [The correspondent only gives what occurred there, not who was in the right or wrong in this fuss, or whether one of these men struck him first, or who began the fuss.] [10] The question is, was it a report of what happened there ? And if it was a substantial account, a true and substantial account \u2014 not necessarily exact \u2014 then the defendants were justified and should have a verdict in their favor. On the other hand, if you think it was not a substantially fair account of what occurred there, then the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict, because they were bound to give a fair and substantial account. It is not necessary to be correct in every word, as I told you; that is not common sense, and could not be done; nobody could conduct a paper if that were so, but the law is that it has to be a fair and substantial account of the occurrence. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-4\">[\u201cI say to you, first, that if you believe this article contained a substantially true and fair account by this correspondent of what happened up there, then the plaintiff is not entitled to a verdict, because the law of the land says that comments of that kind may be made, report may be made about public officers if they are fair, reasonably and substantially true.] [11] In the second place, if you find that the defendants had reasonable and probable cause to believe their statements true, made proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>inquiries, and used care in what they said, believed it to be true, then the paper was justified in printing it and the public had a right to read it, because it was a matter of public importance connected with a public matter of great importance and great interest at the time, and about a public officer, an officer who was there on duty at the time. On the other hand, if you do not find either of those points, the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict, because then it would be unjustifiable and would be a libel. If you find that they were not justified on either of these grounds, then the next question is the measure of damages. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-3\">\u201c Counsel for defendant having asked to have some documentary testimony on his side go out with the jury, along with the alleged libel, and counsel for plaintiff having objected, the court refuses to send either out unless requested by the jury.

The court said further: \u201c On the other hand if you do not find either of these points the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict, because then it would be unjustifiable, and would be a libel. If you find that they were not justified on either of these grounds, then the next question is the measure of damages.\u201d It is difficult to understand what more the court could have done. The case was necessarily for the jury. The court could not direct them absolutely to return a verdict for the plaintiff and were not asked to do so. They could not affirm the plaintiff\u2019s first point and say, without qualification, that, \u201c the words and language used in describing the occurrence are not justified by the evidence, and a verdict should be rendered for the plaintiff,\u201d because the jury were to judge whether the words used were or were not justified by the evidence. The great trouble with the plaintiff\u2019s case is that, in the substantial particulars of the narration, \u201c the words and language used in describing the occurrence \u201d were justified by the evidence. The plaintiff was at the time a public officer, actually on duty in performing a very grave and serious public service. Such persons are amenable to public criticism in the newspapers, without liability for libel, if there was probable cause for their comments and no proof of express malice, even though the statements are not strictly true in all respects: Briggs v. Garrett, 111 Pa. 404; Neeb v. Hope, Id. 145; Press Co. v. Stewart, 119 Pa. 584. In the first case we said: \u201cA communication to be privileged must be made upon a proper occasion, from a proper motive, and must be based upon reasonable or probable cause. When so made in good faith, the law does not imply malice from the communication itself, as in the ordinary case .of libel; actual malice must be proved before there can be a recovery. . . . An action for libel is upon all fours with an action for malicious prosecution. The latter is but an aggravated form of an action for libel, as in it the libel is sworn to before a magistrate. The cases make no distinction between them.\u201d In the course of the opinion by the present Chief Justice numerous authorities are cited in support of his conclusions. Among them are the following : \u201cIf fairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, the communication is protected for the common convenience and welfare of society. ... I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>conceive the law to be that, though that which is spoken or written may be injurious to the character of the party, yet if done bona fide, as with a view to the investigation of a fact in which the party is interested, it is not libelous. Lord EllenBOJROUGH in Delany v. Jones, 4 Esp. 191. If there is probable cause it is of no consequence that the libel was malicious. . . . In case of a privileged communication probable cause is a bar to the suit: Chapman v. Calder, 14 Pa. 365.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">In Press Co. v. Stewart, supra, we said: \u201c The defendant filed what was substantially, though not perhaps in strict technical form, a plea of justification. It alleges that the article in the \u2018 Press \u2019 was a just and true account of the interview between its reporter and the plaintiff, and asked the court to instruct the jury that, \u2018 if they believed that the publication complained of is a fair and true account of an interview had between the plaintiff and Mr. Cooke, your verdict must be for the defendant.\u2019 The court declined to affirm this point, and herein we think the learned judge erred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">In Neeb v. Hope, supra, our late brother Trunkey said, in the opinion: \u201cIt is a matter of law for the court- to determine whether the occasion of writing or speaking criminatory language, which would otherwise be actionable, repels the inference of malice, constituting what is called a privileged communication, and if there is no intrinsic or extrinsic evidence of malice, it is the duty of the court to direct a nonsuit or verdict for the defendant. If the communication contains expressions which exceed the limits of privilege, such expressions are evidence of malice and the case shall be given to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">This is precisely what the learned court below did in the present case. They refused the fourth point of the defendant, which asked for a binding instruction for the defendant, and affirmed the defendant\u2019s three other points, which are couched in almost the exact language of this court in the opinion above referred to; they affirmed that part of the plaintiff\u2019s second point which required an instruction that \u201c the style and tone of the narrative exaggerate and magnify the alleged fault of the plaintiff and is evidence of malice,\u201d and left the whole case to.the jury on the two questions whether the article contained a substantially fair and true account of what happened, and whether the defendant had reasonable and probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>believe their statements true, and made proper inquiries and used care in what they said, believing it to be true. It seems to us that nothing more than this could have been done by the court, and that the plaintiff\u2019s real cause of complaint is with the verdict. But when it is considered that the plaintiff was, at the time of the occurrence, a public officer engaged in the performance of a most serious public duty, that by his own confession and the testimony of his own witnesses, as well as those of the defendant, he was under the influence of liquor, having taken four drinks of whiskey in a very short time and was, when the occurrence in question took place, insisting on going back to the saloon to get another drink, that his commanding officer, when he heard of the matter, advised him to go home, which he did, and was out of the service for several months, that during all this time he was not entitled to wear his sword, having demanded a court-martial; that charges were preferred against him for his conduct by the proper military officers, which though never tried remained pending for a long time, and that his conduct upon the occasion in question was certainly not that of a prudent and sober person, it must be conceded that the jury may well have felt it to be their duty to find their verdict for the defendant. It is true that in some particulars the statements in the published articles were exaggerated and sensational in their character, after the reprehensible manner of many, though not all, of the newspapers of the present day, but the effect of that kind of comment was fairly left to the jury as evidence of malice, and it was their function to decide upon its effect in the cause. It seems to us that the testimony as to the preferment of charges, and the inspection roll of the plaintiff\u2019s company, was properly received, in support of the statements, and the good faith of the published articles, although they occurred after the main transaction. Nor do we see any error in the court\u2019s statement that it was very clear that the charges published were not all false, and that the plaintiff was in liquor, as these were really very proper deductions from testimony, much of which came from the plaintiff himself and which was scarcely controverted. Also the statement of the court, that they could not see how an officer could be more degraded than to be under the influence of liquor while on duty, we think was within the bounds of just judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>comment, and certainly was not error in any legal sense, when the evidence is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">As to the twelfth assignment we are not referred by counsel to any authority which requires the court to send out with the' jury the libelous publication, especially when it does not appear that the court was asked to do so. There is nothing on the record upon this subject except the remark of the court that counsel for the defendant having asked to send out some document along with the alleged libel, and the plaintiff having objected to this, the court refused to send out either unless requested by the jury. We see no error in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Upon the whole case we think the cause was correctly tried, the court giving every opportunity to the plaintiff to get a verdict that he could ask for, and that his want of success was due to the views of the jury as expressed in their verdict rather than to errors on the part of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
