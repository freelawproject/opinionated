T. 1892, No. 32, awarding preliminary injunction.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"ASY_\">Before Paxson, C.

The prayers were for injunction and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-3\">No answer was filed to the bill. Numerous affidavits were offered both hy plaintiffs and defendants. The case was heard upon bill and affidavits, and after argument the court filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-4\">\u201cNo questions seem to arise in this case which were not considered in the case of Brace Bros. v. Evans, decided by Judge Slagle [35 Pitts. L. J. 399<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>] ; that of Moorhead v. Krause, recently decided by Judge Stowe, and that of MoCandless &amp; Kinser v. O\u2019Brien, August term of this court. The right of workingmen to organize into associations cannot be questioned ; and the right of the members of such associations, either as individuals or as an organization, to cease to work for any employer and to use all lawful and peaceful means to induce others to refuse to work for such employer are equally well founded. But the members of such associations have no right, by force, menances or threats, to attempt to prevent the members of any other association, or men who belong to no association, from working upon such terms as they may be willing to do, nor, upon the other hand, have nonunion workmen any right to use such means to prevent the members of any association or union from working upon such terms as they may agree-upon with any employer. When any number of men so con-ij duct themselves as to commit a continuing trespass or become i a nuisance they may be enjoined. Under the affidavits sub-' mitted there can be no doubt that a number of the defendants, with others, have been in the habit of collecting in crowds about the establishment of the plaintiffs, having followed their workmen to and from their boarding houses, and purposely interfered with them in passing along the public streets, in some instances even resorting to actual force. The purpose of those engaged in these proceedings was evidently correctly stated by one of the defendants when, in reply to the words of one of the plaintiffs, \u2018 Our men are getting sick and tired of this,\u2019 he said, \u2018 That is what we are here for, to make them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>sick and tired.\u2019 The whole course of those actively engaged in these movements was a menace to the workmen of the plaintiffs, as well as to the public peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-3\">\u201c A number of the defendants named in the bill are not shown by the affidavits to have taken any part in the acts which are complained of, and, as to all except those hereinafter named, the motion for a preliminary injunction is refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-4\">\u201c It is ordered that a preliminary injunction issue against the defendants, T.
