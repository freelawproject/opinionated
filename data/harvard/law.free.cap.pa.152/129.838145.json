The legislature has no power to appoint a board of viewers 'without judicial power, and thus exclude citizens from a judicial hearing, when their property is damaged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-8\">The act of May 16,1891, never contemplated that any party in interest was to be excluded from a hearing in court, by reason of his failure to proceed before the board of viewers, or, if he did avail himself of every hearing before the board of viewers, that he should only come into court when he could make a full report of his proceedings before the said board of viewers, and do so under the obligation to not only show that the report of the board of viewers was unjust and injured him, but that also the board of viewers had disregarded the evidence before them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-9\"><em>W.

The appellants did not appear before the viewers, and offered no evidence to inform or enlighten the board, and they filed no exceptions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the report when it was completed. Under such circumstances they can have no standing in court to object to the report. Had they offered and furnished proper proof, non constat but that the viewers would have corrected and modified their report.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKI\">January 3, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-3\">The court properly exercised the discretion given to it by the act in confirming the report.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ALu\">Mr. Justice Williams,</author>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">This.is a proceeding begun upon the petition of the city of Pittsburgh, for the assessment of benefits upon lot holders resulting from the improvement of Omega street. \u25a0 The improvements had been made under an act of assembly that was unconstitutional. The contract entered into by the city with the parties who did the work was in several respects ultra vires. The contractors had to look to the city for what their work was reasonably worth, and the city was left without any means for enforcing contribution from those who had been benefited by the improvement. To remedy the inconvenience thus encountered the remedial legislation of May 16, 1891, was provided. The report before us was made by viewers appointed under that act, and was confirmed by the court below. This appeal is from the decree of confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The duties of the viewers are very plainly laid down in the act authorizing their appointment. They must give notice of the time and place of their meeting for the discharge of the duties laid upon them. At the time fixed they are to go upon the premises and \u201cvisit and personally inspect the improvements and the property supposed to be damaged or benefited thereby.\u201d They are required to \u201c hear all parties interested, on all questions before them; \u201d and, after such hearing, \u201c to ascertain and determine the total damages and costs and ex-' penses of such improvement.\u201d They are then to ascertain who has been benefited and to what extent by the improvement made, and assess, not the aggregate sum at which they have arrived, but the actual benefits accruing to each lot owner upon his lot. Whatever portion of the damages, costs and expenses may remain unprovided for by the assessment of benefits must fall upon the city. Having heard the parties fully they are to prepare their report, stating the following among other particulars :</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>1. What the improvement is.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">2. The place and places where it has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">3. The damages, costs and expenses of the improvement as ascertained and determined by them upon the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">4. The properties in the neighborhood particularly benefited by said improvement and the names of the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">5. The properties damaged and the amount allowed in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">6. The amount of benefits assessed against each property benefited.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">7. What amount of the total amount of damages, costs and expenses are left unprovided for by such assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">When this report is prepared it must be open to inspection and exception on a day fixed, and of which notice has been given as required by the act; and if exceptions are filed the viewers \u201c shall give a hearing on the same, and after such hearing modify their report if equity and justice shall require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">The report next goes into the court by which the viewers were appointed where exceptions may be again filed to be heard and disposed of by the court, after which final decree may be made. The courts of Allegheny county appear to have adopted no rules regulating the practice in these cases, but there ought to be little doubt about the intention of the legislature. The questions which a lot owner desires to raise should be raised before the viewers in the first instance, or at least upon the hearing before them when their report is made up. All exceptions, and requests in writing for rulings, placed before them should be returned with their report to the court. If one does not appear before the viewers to raise the questions of fact on which he wishes to be heard, he may properly be held to have waived them, unless he accounts satisfactorily for his failure to appear before the viewers. Questions of form or of law, arising upon the face of the report, may however be brought to the attention of the court by exceptions by any one interested, and without regard to his appearance or nonappearance before the viewers. Among the questions raised by this appeal are some that it is alleged were raised before the view, and one that could only have been raised by an exception to the report. The court dismissed them all. An application was then made for a rehearing upon a petition signed by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>setting forth that an effort was made to secure a hearing before the viewers upon all the questions of fact that had been raised by the exceptions filed in court, but that the effort was unsuccessful, the viewers stating that they would hear no evidence regarding the character of the work or its value \u201c and would only take the contract price as furnished by the city engineer.\u201d If this petition stated the truth it was sufficient ground for setting the report aside and appointing a new view that would comply with the requirements of the law under which it was appointed. The petition was however refused and a final decree of confirmation entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">But independently of the petition for a rehearing the report itself affords conclusive evidence that the viewers adopted a false basis for their report and misconceived their duties. They state that, they have assessed the damages, costs and expenses at five thousand seven hundred and seven dollars and ninety-eight cents, and to show how they have arrived at that sum they incorporated into their report the following document:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">\u201c Chief Department of Public Works.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">Statement of Costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">2950 cubic yards grading $0.30 $ 885.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">1488 square \u201c paving 2.00 2976.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">1254 lineal feet curbing .89 1116.06</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">104 sq. \u201c crossing 1.00 104.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-12\">8 \u201c yards block stone 3.74 29.92</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">Total costs &amp;c. $ 5110.98\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-14\">To this they add damages assessed by them to lot holders 597.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-15\">Making an aggregate of $ 5707.98</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">The items that make up their total of damages, costs and expenses do not even purport to have been ascertained by them, but to have been furnished from the books of the city, showing the payments made under the contract which fell with the law under which it was made. Whether this contract furnishes a measure of compensation on which the contractor could insist as between him and the city is a question not raised here, and which it is not necessary to consider, but we have distinctly held that it does not furnish a measure binding on the lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>bolder: Bingaman v. The City of Pittsburgh, 29 W. N. 364, 147 Pa. 353. In that case, and upon this precise question, the present Chief Justice expressed the unanimous opinion of the court in these words: \u201cWe are of opinion that the act contemplates that the assessment should be made on the basis of a quantum meruit. At the same time the contract under which the work was done is some evidence of the cost of the improvement and may be considered by the viewers when they come to make the assessment.\u201d In this case the viewers do not so much as say that they believe, or that they find from the evidence, that the contract price was a fair price. They make no inquiry, but acting upon the mistaken idea that they were bound by the contract price they had the proper officer certify that price to them, embody that certificate in their report, and as is asserted in the petition for a rehearing, declare their purpose to \u201c only take the contract price as furnished by the city engineer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The first and fifth exceptions should have been sustained and the report set aside or re-committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The decree of confirmation is set aside at the cost of the appellee and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
