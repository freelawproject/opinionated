Pow appointed . master. Plaintiffs petitioned for payment to them of $15,000 in partial distribution, pending proceedings for a final account. The court directed the master to make a special report thereon. The master found that the firm had no creditors; that the amount in the hands of the receiver after payment of expenses amounted to $69,150; that the amount asked for by plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>would not affect defendant\u2019s rights; and that ample means would be left for the payment of all expenses. He recommended the payment of the money and the court so ordered. Exceptions to the master\u2019s findings aud to the decree were dismissed. Appeal No. 137 was then taken by defendant. The facts of appeal No. 139 appear by the. opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AiR\">November 7, 1892:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-5\"><em>Joseph L. </em>Tull, <em>Thomas D.

Nothing of this kind appears in this case. At the same time we think the court should require a refunding bond in double the amount before the receiver pays over the money. This is the proper practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Appeal No. 139 was from an order of the court below requiring the defendants to pay over to the receiver the sum of $13,171.61, which the master found to be in his hands and belonging to the late copartnership of William Thornton &amp; Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">This was also an interlocutory order. The money was ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>mittedly in the defendants\u2019 hands, and it belongs to the partnership. One of the purposes of appointing the receiver was to take possession of the partnership property. The defendant must comply with the order of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The rules are made absolute, and the appeal quashed in each case at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
