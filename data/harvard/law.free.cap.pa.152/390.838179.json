On the return from Aliquippa, according to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the conductor refused to take the tickets, saying they were not good on his train, and put plaintiff and her companion off at Shannopin. The conductor on the other hand testified that plaintiff asked for a stop-over check, and upon his refusal to give it, she refused to give up her ticket, and that he thereupon required her to leave the train.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-10\">The facts as to the conduct of plaintiff after she was ejected appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-11\">When plaintiff was on the stand she was asked this question: \u201c Q.

That if the jury believe that the plaintiff was put off at Shannopin, a regular station of the railroad, and where the train upon which she came to Nimicks stopped, and where she could have gotten on the train, no damages may be allowed for anything that happened after she left Shannopin to go to Aliquippa, or for the results of anything that happened after she left Shannopin.\u201d Refused. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">\u201c 3. That if the jury believe that the plaintiff was put off the cars at Shannopin, a regular station of the railroad, without any rudeness or discourtesy, then the measure of the damages is actual compensation for loss of time while waiting for the next train, which in this case is nominal.\u201d Refused. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">\u201c 4. If the court refuses to affirm the third point, that if the jury believe that the plaintiff was put off at Shannopin, a regular station of the railroad, where she could have gotten on the train upon which she afterwards came to Chartiers, then the measure of the damages is actual compensation for the time which would be lost waiting at Shannopin, and a reasonable compensation for any humiliation or mortification that there may have been in the case. <em>Answer: </em>This point ignores the fact of the knowledge of the plaintiff that she was at such station, and with such facilities as are described, and possibly other material facts, and is therefore refused.\u201d [4J</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">\u201c 5. That the defendant can only be held liable for results as under the circumstances of the case might and ought to have been foreseen by the conductor could result from the plaintiff getting off the train; and that the plaintiff would get caught in a rain on her way back to Aliquippa, was not such a result as could be foreseen by the conductor. <em>Answer: </em>Refused.

R., 54 Wis. 342.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AetS\">Mr. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The first assignment, that the verdict should have been directed for the defendant, was not seriously pressed, as in fact it could not be except by totally ignoring the plaintiff\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The main stress of the defence rests upon two propositions, that the plaintiff should not have undertaken to return to Alequippa, and that having done so, she was herself responsible for all the injury she received on the way. Neither proposition can be maintained without disregarding the evidence. Indeed the real burden of appellant\u2019s complaint is that the jury rendered a wrong verdict. This however is not for us to consider. We start with the fact established by the verdict that plaintiff was wrongfully put off the train, at a regular station to be sure, but one where she was a stranger and where there was at the time no regular station house. She was in no fault herself, and being thus put in a position of embarrassment and difficulty, she was not bound to use the best judgment, but only to good faith and reasonable prudence: R. R. Co. v. Werner, 89 Pa. 59. She had been told that her ticket was not good on that train, and she had not enough money to pay the fare from that point to Pittsburgh. After consultation with her. companion and asking some questions of the station agent, she started to walk back to Alequippa where she had been that morning and also the previous day, and where she must have been to some extent known, as she had that morning paid five dollars to get back her watch which she had lost the day before. For the judge to have directed the jury as matter of law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>this action was improper and negligent, and that plaintiff should have waited where she was for the next train, would have been plain error. It was a matter for the jury and was properly left to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The same view applies to the other proposition. If returning to Alequippa on foot was a natural and reasonable thing for plaintiff to do under all the circumstances, then it was a course of action which the defendant should have.foreseen, and the consequences which attended the effort were not too remote to enter into the computation of damages. The condition of the weather and the risk of getting wet by an approaching storm, were facts bearing directly on the prudence and reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s conduct. It is said that she walked right into the storm within ten minutes after leaving Shannopin, and that it was plain negligence not to stay where she was and take the next train. But her evidence is that she did not know she could do that, and if the storm was imminent it might properly be regarded as the duty of the agent to inform her that she could have shelter in the box car that was serving temporarily for a station house. There were too many elements and uncertainties in the situation as disclosed by the evidence for the court to decide and the whole question was properly left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The evidence in regard to the effect of the occurrence on plaintiff as to taking charge of her boarding house was not an effort to show loss of profits, but loss of earning capacity in her business or occupation. Such evidence is entirely competent. In fact it is an important part of every accident case that is tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
