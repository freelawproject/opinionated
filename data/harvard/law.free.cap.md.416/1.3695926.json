Each indictment contained the following assertion:</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">STATE OF MARYLAND, CARROLL COUNTY, TO WIT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">The Grand Jurors of the State of Maryland, for the body of Carroll County, do on their oaths and affirmations present that [the Respondent] late of said County, on or about January 23, 2007 at 999 Crouse Mill Road, Keymar, Carroll County, Maryland, did recklessly engage in conduct, to wit: did fail to contact emergency services (9-1-1) in a timely manner that created a substantial risk of death and serious physical injury to Isaiah Simmons, III, while in Defendant\u2019s care and custody and a duty to do so existed, in violation of the Criminal Law Article, Section 3-204, A-l, contrary to the form of the act of the assembly in such case made and provided and against the peace, government and dignity of the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Respondents filed motions to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the reckless endangerment statute does not proscribe the <em>failure </em>to act. The Circuit Court entered an \u201cORDER\u201d dismissing the indictments \u201cpursuant to Md. Rule 4-252 for failure to charge the Defendants with a crime,\u201d and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed that decision in an unreported opinion. <em>State v. Kanavy, et al, </em>Nos. 3008-3012, September Term, 2007, filed August 10, 2009. The State then filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, in which it presented this Court with three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>1. Where the indictments contained all the elements required to charge reckless endangerment, did the lower courts err in focusing on surplus language regarding the manner and means by which defendants committed the crime to find that the indictments failed to charge an offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">2. Alternatively, if it was appropriate to consider the manner and means alleged in the indictments in determining their sufficiency, does the \u201cconduct\u201d required for reckless endangerment include acts of omission where there is a duty to act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">3. Did the trial court err in going beyond the four corners of the indictments to find a basis for dismissal, contrary to the Court of Appeals decision in <em>State v. Taylor, </em>371 Md. 617[, 810 A.2d 964] (2002)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">We granted the petition. 411 Md. 599, 984 A.2d 243 (2009). For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and direct that the cases be remanded to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">On January 23, 2007, Isaiah Simmons, III, a juvenile who had been committed to the Department of Juvenile Services, died at the Bowling Brook Preparatory School in Carroll County. Respondents are employees of that juvenile facility who were on duty when the juvenile died. The record shows that, at the conclusion of a Grand Jury investigation, the State\u2019s Attorney for Carroll County requested that the Grand Jury return a three count indictment against each Respondent. \u201cCount 1\u201d would have charged each Respondent with manslaughter as a result of the deadly force he allegedly used against the deceased; while \u201cCount 2\u201d would have charged each Respondent with the lesser-included offense of reckless endangerment as a result of the deadly force he allegedly used. The Grand Jury, however, elected to charge each Respondent only with \u201cCount 3,\u201d the indictment quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The Circuit Court\u2019s Order was accompanied by a \u201cMEMORANDUM OPINION\u201d that included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">The State contends that the statutory definition of conduct includes an omission, which would violate a specific duty owned by the Defendants to Isaiah Simmons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">Maryland appellate courts have considered numerous cases concerning reckless endangerment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">The general patterns of these cases consistently show convictions for reckless endangerment stemming from direct actions taken by the Defendants. This court is unable to \u2022find a single case in which a Defendant was convicted of reckless endangerment based on the omission of a duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">The State argues that the <em>Craig </em>case serves as the basis in holding that criminal liability can be assessed against a Defendant for the omission of a duty. In <em>Craig, </em>the Defendants were convicted of the involuntary manslaughter of their infant child for failing to obtain proper medical care for their child because of their personally held religious beliefs. <em>Craig v. State, </em>220 Md. 590, 593, 155 A.2d 684, 686 (1959). The State contends that since the crime of reckless endangerment has been held to constitute a lesser form of gross involuntary manslaughter, that omitted actions which serve as a basis to charge a Defendant with the crime of involuntary manslaughter must also be applicable to charge the Defendants with reckless endangerment. This court disagrees. In <em>Craig, </em>the State was able to prove that under Article 72A, Section 1 of the old Maryland code, that a statutory duty existed for a parent to care for a child, and therefore \u201cinaction\u201d in failing to obtain medical treatment for a child who eventually dies would leave the parents liable for manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97[, 155 A.2d at 687-688]. Here, this court finds no case in which any court in Maryland has even construed the definition of \u201cconduct\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>under the reckless endangerment statute to include an omission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">Assuming for purposes of this argument however, that the Court found that a person may be found guilty of reckless endangerment for failing to perform a legal duty, the court would still need to find evidence that such a duty legally exists. At common law there is no legal duty to assist a person in distress. <em>See Pope v. </em>State, 284 Md. 809, 324-25, 396 A.2d 1054, 1064 (1979). Statutes have affirmatively imposed criminal liability for the failure to act on a duty____Here, the State would not need to prove at this stage of the proceedings that the Defendants failed to perform a legal duty. The State would only need to show some authority for the proposition that a duty exists, the violation of which renders the Defendants guilty of reckless endangerment. But, this court finds no such evidence that any statutory duty exists in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">In this case, the sole count is based upon an alleged omission of failing to call emergency services in a timely manner rather than the actual commission of any act by the Defendants. Therefore this court finds that the indictment fails to adequately allege or charge the Defendants with a crime, and accordingly dismissal of the indictment is warranted under Md. Rule 4-252.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">While affirming the decision of the Circuit Court, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">There is no doubt that the Grand Jury\u2019s indictments would have been sufficient to allege the commission of a crime if the Grand Jurors had simply followed the formula set forth in section 3-206(d). As can be seen, the indictments set forth each defendant\u2019s name, the date of the act, the county, and alleged that the defendant \u201cdid recklessly engage in conduct\u201d in violation of section 3-204(a)(l) of the Criminal Law Article. The problem arises because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>indictments went on to describe how the State contended that the reckless endangerment statute was violated, i.e., by describing the defendants\u2019 passive conduct (failure to call 911 in a timely manner where a duty to make the call existed).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">Because the State elected to describe the conduct alleged to be wrongful, the defendants were presented with an opportunity to raise the issue of whether the indictments, as worded, charged them with a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">We agree with the State that there are circumstances (e.g., where the defendant engages in an act of commission) where reckless endangerment has been held to be a lesser included offense of negligent manslaughter. <em>See State v. Albrecht, supra, </em>336 Md. [475] at 477-78[, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994) ]. (proof that shotgun was recklessly held by police officer when it accidently discharged and killed a citizen was sufficient to prove the crime of reckless endangerment and negligent manslaughter). But no case cited by the State stands for the proposition that the statutory crime of reckless endangerment is a lesser included offense to manslaughter in situations where the defendants are accused of passive conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\"><em>State v. Kanavy, et al, </em>Nos. 3008-3012, September Term, 2007, slip opinion, pp. 2-3, 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Respondents\u2019 Duty to the Deceased</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">It is clear that, while the deceased was confined at the Bowling Brook facility, the United States Constitution imposed a duty to provide him with medical care. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State to provide medical care to injured persons who are in the custody of State agents. <em>Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>463 U.S. 239, 244-45, 103 S.Ct. 2979, 2983-2984, 77 L.Ed.2d 605 (1983); <em>Buffington v. Baltimore County, </em>913 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>113, 119 (4th Cir.1990). As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq\">When the state by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual\u2019s liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at the same time fails to provide for his basic human needs\u2014e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety\u2014it transgresses the substantive limits on state action set by the <em>Eighth Amendment </em>and the Due Process Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 200,109 S.Ct. at 1005-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">It is also clear that the laws of Maryland imposed a duty to provide the deceased with appropriate medical care. The Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ) and the Human Services Article (HS) impose on the Department of Juvenile Services the duty to provide a child in the Department\u2019s custody with appropriate medical care. The purposes of the Juvenile Causes Subtitle include the purpose of providing children in State care and custody with a safe, humane, and caring environment, as well as access to required services. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 3-8A-02(a)(7). HS \u00a7 9-223 requires that the Department comply with the provisions of CJ \u00a7 3-8A-02. HS \u00a7 9-237 requires that the Department provide children in its custody with a safe and humane environment. As employees of the Department, Respondents had a legal duty to comply with the applicable laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u201cConduct\u201d Includes \u201cOmissions\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">In <em>Williams v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 468, 641 A.2d 990 (1994), while holding that a reckless endangerment conviction merged into an assault conviction, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">A reckless endangerment resulting in death will constitute either a grossly negligent involuntary manslaughter or a depraved-heart second-degree murder. In either event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the reckless endangerment will merge into the greater inclusive criminal homicide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 485, 641 A.2d at 998. We agree with this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">In <em>Criminal Homicide Law, </em>Judge Moylan states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">With gross negligence manslaughter ..., the act of killing may be by omission as surely as by commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1.9 <em>supra. </em>A finding of guilt is subject to the general limitation that for a homicide by omission to be criminal, the homicidal agent must have owed a duty to the homicide victim, such as the duty owed to a patient by a doctor or nurse; to a child by a parent, guardian, teacher or baby-sitter; to a person placed in a position of danger by the person creating such danger. In <em>State v. Albrecht </em>[, 336 Md. 475, 499, 649 A.2d 336, 347 (1994),] Judge Raker defined the gross negligence variety of involuntary manslaughter in terms that included both the modality of commission and that of omission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">In Maryland, involuntary manslaughter is a common law felony, generally defined as an unintentional killing done without malice, in negligently doing some act lawful in itself or <em>by the negligent omission to perform a legal duty.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">(Emphasis supplied [in treatise]).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\"><em>Craig v. State </em>[, 220 Md. 590, 155 A.2d 684 (1959) ] and <em>Palmer v. State </em>[, 223 Md. 341, 164 A.2d 467 (1960) ] were cases in which the defendants were [convicted of] gross negligence manslaughter for the acts of omission that led to the deaths of their children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr., <em>Criminal Homicide Law, </em>\u00a7 12.9, pp. 235-236 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">According to Respondents, reckless endangerment is a lesser-included offense of gross-negligence manslaughter only if the reckless conduct is \u201cactive\u201d rather than \u201cpassive,\u201d because a reckless endangerment conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did <em>engage in conduct </em>that created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>conduct proscribed by the reckless endangerment statute includes the wilful failure to perform a legal duty. This conclusion is consistent with the following authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The word \u201cconduct\u201d is defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as \u201cpersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction; the manner in which a person behaves.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 292 (7th ed.1999). The entry continues with a case quotation which states, \u201cThe word \u2018conduct\u2019... covers both acts and omissions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original, citation omitted). Our reckless endangerment statute is derived from the Model Penal Code, in which the term \u201cconduct\u201d is defined as \u201can action or omission and its accompanying state of mind, or where relevant, a series of acts and omissions[.]\u201d Model Penal Code, \u00a7 1.13(5) (1985). New York\u2019s reckless endangerment statute provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the second degree when he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.\u201d McKinney\u2019s Penal Law (N.Y.) \u00a7 120 (2009). In <em>People v. Sanford, </em>24 A.D.3d 572, 808 N.Y.S.2d 274 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>6 N.Y.3d 852, 816 N.Y.S.2d 758, 849 N.E.2d 981 (2006), the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York reversed the dismissal of a multi-count indictment that included (first degree and second degree) reckless endangerment counts based upon \u201cthe defendant\u2019s knowledge of her mother\u2019s age and health, the seriousness of the fall as shown by her mother\u2019s injuries and subsequent death, and the defendant\u2019s failure to have rendered or summoned aid for approximately five hours, although she was a geriatric nurse[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275. According to the appellate court, the State\u2019s evidence \u201cif unexplained and uncontradicted at trial, would support a jury verdict that the defendant recklessly or with criminal negligence caused the death of or injuries to her mother, or recklessly created a substantial risk or serious injury to her mother.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Section 168.195 of the Oregon Revised Statutes, in pertinent part, provides that \u201c(1) A person commits the crime of recklessly endangering another person if the person recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.\u201d In <em>State v. Nelson, </em>224 Or.App. 398, 198 P.3d 439 (2008), while reversing a reckless endangerment conviction on the ground that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish an essential element of the offense, the Court of Appeals of Oregon stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">Thus, to obtain a conviction under the reckless endangerment statute, the state generally has to prove, first, that the defendant performed an act, or omitted to perform an act as required by law. ORS 161.085(3), (4); second, that the act or omission created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person; third, that the act or omission presented such a substantial and unjustifiable risk of serious physical injury that only a person demonstrating a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care would so act or omit to act; fourth, that the defendant was aware of the risk; and fifth, that the defendant consciously chose to disregard the risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">Here, we agree with the state (and defendant concedes) that allowing a two-and-one-half-year-old child to wander unattended in a commercial and residential neighborhood for six hours put the child at substantial risk of sustaining serious physical injury. We also agree that doing so is a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">To convict a Respondent of the reckless endangerment offense charged in the indictment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the Respondent owed a duty to obtain emergency medical care for the deceased, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the Respondent was aware of his obligation to perform that duty, (3) the Respondent knew that his failure to perform that duty would create a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to the deceased, (4) under the circumstances, a reasonable employee of the Department of Juvenile Services in Respondent\u2019s position would not have disregarded his or her duty to (in the words of the indictments) \u201ccontact emergency services (9-1-1) in a timely manner,\u201d and (5) the Respondent consciously disregarded his duty. The wording of the indictments at issue is legally sufficient to charge the offense of reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS THAT THE CASE AGAINST EACH RESPONDENT BE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR TRIAL; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">BELL, C.J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-11\">.

On motion of the petitioners, the Circuit Court for Carroll County ruled that the indictments were insufficient, as to each, \u201cthe sole count [being] based upon an alleged omission of failing to call emergency services in a timely manner rather than the actual commission of any act by the Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed.
