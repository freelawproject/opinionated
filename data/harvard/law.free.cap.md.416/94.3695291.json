Vol.) \u00a7 5-639<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and under the common law, pursuant to Maryland Code (1990, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>2006 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 5-507<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, from liability for damages resulting from injuries sustained by William Chaplain and Denise Webb-Cobb, the respondents, during an accident caused by the petitioner while, during the course of his duties, he was driving an emergency vehicle. This Court granted the petitioner\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">\u201c1. Whether Petitioner\u2019s conduct constitutes, \u2018[pjursuing a violator or a suspected violator of the law;\u2019 thereby, qualifying as an \u2018emergency service\u2019 under Md.Code Ann[ ].

Art. \u00a7 5-639(b) renders him immune from the Respondents\u2019 suit. \u201c3. Whether the Petitioner\u2019s public official immunity renders him immune from the Respondents\u2019 negligence claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The first two issues are related and, thus, will, be considered, and resolved, together.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">I. <em>Statutory Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Whether the conduct of the petitioner comes within the prescription of Maryland Code (1983, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 19-103<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Transportation Article is dependent upon how the word, \u201cpursuing,\u201d or its variant, \u201cpursuit,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as used in reference to police officers engaged in \u201cemergency service,\u201d under \u00a7 19\u2014103(a)(3)(ii), is defined. Confident that the Legislature\u2019s choice of the word, \u201cpursuing,\u201d was purposeful and, therefore, demands more than investigatory curiosity on the part of the officer, this Court will not extend the privilege of immunity, <em>see </em>\u00a7 5-639, to the petitioner. Instead we shall hold that the word \u201cpursuing\u201d or \u201cpursuit\u201d and its application must have limits and, more to the point, there must be, at a minimum, movement by a suspect or violator of the law, and reactive movement by the officer to apprehend said individual. It follows, therefore, that, pursuant to \u00a7 19\u2014103(a)(3)(ii), the investigative actions of the petitioner cannot be construed to amount to \u201cpursuing\u201d or to constitute a \u201cpursuit\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">To be entitled to immunity under \u00a7 5-639, the petitioner, at the time of the accident, must have been authorized to \u201coper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ate\u201d an \u201cemergency vehicle in the performance of emergency service.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 5\u2014639(b)(1). The parties agree that the petitioner\u2019s marked patrol car was an \u201cemergency vehicle.\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 2006 RepLVol.) \u00a7 11-118<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Transportation Article. They also concede that the petitioner was authorized to drive this \u201cemergency vehicle\u201d on the day of the accident in question. At issue, therefore, is only whether, at the time of the accident, the petitioner was operating the \u201cemergency vehicle in the performance of emergency service.\u201d Relevant to this issue, \u00a7 19-103(a)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201c \u2018Emergency service\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201c(i) Responding to an emergency call;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u201c(ii) Pursuing a violator or a suspected violator of the law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">\u201c(iii) Responding to, but not while returning from, a fire alarm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The subsection in dispute here is \u00a7 19-103(a)(3)(ii), and, more specifically, the meaning of \u201c[p]ursuing a violator or a suspected violator of the law,\u201d as used therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">In order to resolve this issue, it is clear to this Court, as it was to the trial judge, that this case turns on what the Legislature intended the word \u201cpursuing\u201d to mean. Once that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>is established, that meaning will inform whether, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the petitioner was, indeed, \u201c[pursuing a violator or suspected violator\u201d as contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">When faced with a question of statutory interpretation, we must ascertain the intent of the legislature, the paramount object of that inquiry. <em>Bowen v.

The petitioner, a member of the Baltimore Police Department\u2019s Special Enforcement Team, whose focus is violent crime detection and drug offenses, was driving a marked patrol vehicle when he observed what he believed to be an illegal drug transaction. In his words, he saw a \u201cbunch of individuals lined up [in an alley] and it appeared that one individual was handing small objects to the people in this line.\u201d Interested in investigating further, but not wishing to \u201calert them\u201d to his presence, the petitioner, without activating his emergency lights or siren, made a u-turn down a one-way street, going against traffic. While so traveling, the petitioner\u2019s patrol car collided with the car driven by William Chaplain, in which Denise Webb-Cobb, was a passenger, injuring both.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The respondents filed a complaint in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Baltimore City, seeking damages for the personal injuries they suffered in the accident. They alleged that the petitioner\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of their injuries. Testifying at trial, the petitioner described his actions as an attempt to \u201cpursue the suspected violators, the suspected drug dealer.\u201d That testimony prompted an objection by the respondents. Focusing on and emphasizing \u201cthe t[erm] pursue,\u201d the respondents\u2019 counsel observed, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anybody say anybody was running. They were standing there.\u201d Although the court overruled the objection, the respondents returned to the issue, when, on cross-examination of the petitioner, they asked: \u201cHow do you define pursuing in your line of work?\u201d The following colloquy then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: It could be all kinds of pursuit. I mean there\u2019s pursuing, that\u2019s either\u2014in that way you\u2019re pursuing to try to catch the narcotics violators, which you wouldn\u2019t go lights and sirens blazing, you know, in there, you would use stealth to pursue that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u201cIf it was a person with a, with a gun that had just robbed someone and is running, well, obviously that would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201c[RESPONDENTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: If those guys didn\u2019t run, what were you gonna do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: If they didn\u2019t run?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201c[RESPONDENTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Yeah, if they just stayed there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201c[PETITIONER]: Then we would have approached them and done our investigations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The petitioner also addressed the trial court\u2019s concern that \u201ceverything else ... in that part of ... section [\u00a7 19-103(a)(3) ] kind of talks about exigent circumstances, like an emergency call is and they talk about responding to a fire alarm.\u201d He argued that his change in direction \u201cin order to at least stop or encounter\u201d the suspects conformed with the statute. Countering that argument, the respondents, consistent with the concerns expressed by the trial court, stressed that \u201cpursuit\u201d implied that there was an ongoing emergency, not unlike the fourth amendment cases, in particular those dealing with hot pursuit. They concluded that the petitioner was not acting \u201cin the performance of an emergency service\u201d and, rather than engaging in pursuit, the petitioner was \u201cinvestigating suspected drug activity\u201d while \u201ccruising around looking for drug activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The trial court agreed with the definition of \u201cpursuit in the <em>American Heritage Dictionary,\u201d </em>on which the respondents relied, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">\u201c1. pursue, to follow in order to overtake, capture, kill ... chase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\"><em>\u201c2. </em>follow, close upon, go with, attend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">\u201c3. to strive, to gain, to seek, to attain, to accomplish^.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHE\">Accordingly, it was not convinced that the petitioner qualified for immunity pursuant to \u00a7 5-639. In fact, the trial court determined that the petitioner was not acting \u201cin the performance of emergency service,\u201d because he was not pursuing a subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">On appeal, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed that ruling. To do so, relying on <em>Torres v. City of Perth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Amboy, </em>329 N.J.Super. 404, 748 A.2d 125 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.2000), it interpreted \u00a7 5-639 to \u201c\u2018require the police to engage in high-speed pursuit in order to attain immunity while operating the emergency vehicle in the performance of emergency services.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In <em>Torres, </em>a police officer, on routine patrol, clocked, by radar, a van proceeding in the opposite direction, to be traveling at 22 miles above the posted speed limit. As a result, he made a u-turn and proceeded after the van with the intention of stopping it and presumably giving the driver a traffic citation for speeding. <em>Id. </em>at 126. Before catching up to the van, the officer\u2019s vehicle struck a pedestrian, injuring him. <em>Id. </em>Reviewing the grant of summary judgment in favor of the officer, the New Jersey Superior Court interpreted N.J.S.A. 59:5\u20142(b)(2), a section of an immunity statute, captioned \u201cParole or escape of prisoner; injuries between prisoners.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to that section, \u201c[njeither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for: ... any injury caused by ... an escaping or escaped person.\u201d Characterizing the \u201ccore issue\u201d as \u201cwhether [the police officer] was engaged in a \u2018pursuit\u2019 to which the immunity attaches,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court concluded that he was not. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201cThe New Jersey Police Vehicular Pursuit Policy (Pursuit Policy) ... informs our consideration of the issue. It defines a pursuit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u2018Pursuit driving is an active attempt by a law enforcement officer operating a motor vehicle and utilizing emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>warning lights and an audible device to apprehend one or more occupants of another moving vehicle when the officer reasonably believes that the driver of the fleeing vehicle is aware of the officer\u2019s attempt to stop the vehicle and is resisting apprehension by increasing vehicle speed, ignoring the officer or otherwise attempting to elude the officer.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">\u201cThe critical element in this definition is the officer\u2019s reasonable belief that the pursued driver is aware of a police attempt to stop the vehicle and the pursued driver \u2018is resisting apprehension by increasing vehicle speed, ignoring the officer or otherwise attempting to elude the officer.\u2019 \u201cWe are persuaded that section 2b(2) immunity applies to a pursuit as defined in the Pursuit Policy[ ], but not to Officer Montalvo\u2019s attempt to close the gap on the speeding van. In <em>Tice [v. Cramer, </em>133 N.J. 347, 627 A.2d 1090 (1993) ], the Court, in construing the phrase \u2018escaping person\u2019 in section 2b(2), stated that the phrase \u2018fairly describes someone who is fleeing from a police pursuit by vehicle.\u2019 ... 627 A.2d 1090. Additionally, the Court in <em>Tice </em>defined the issue before it as \u201cwhether police officers in pursuit of a vehicle that has failed to heed their command to stop are immune from liability for injuries resulting from the pursuit.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 350, 627 A.2d 1090; <em>see also Fielder [v. Stonack, </em>141 N.J. 101, 661 A.2d 231 (1995) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201c... A pursuit involves at least two vehicles and often involves more than two. In contrast, a police officer\u2019s attempt to close the gap on a speeding vehicle that is not attempting to flee does not involve the risk synergies of a pursuit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\"><em>Torres, </em>748 A.2d at 126-27. Persuaded by this analysis,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Circuit Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cAs the District Court correctly noted, there was no indication that the suspected violators of the law were aware or concerned about the police presence, or were going to leave the area or attempt to flee. Upon review of the statute and relevant case law, we cannot conclude that the District Court was clearly erroneous in its interpretation of the statutory language, and therefore the decision of the lower court must be affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Neither \u00a7 5-639 nor \u00a7 19-103 defines \u201cpursuing\u201d or its variant, \u201cpursuit.\u201d The parties, however, have entered the breach and offered their differing interpretations. \u201cPursuit,\u201d the petitioner urges, is the natural consequence of a \u201creasonable belief that a crime has been committed,\u201d and it is the observations made by the officer which \u201ccreate[ ] the emergency.\u201d In that regard, he adds, \u201c[t]here is an exigency that the suspects and their contraband or other evidence of illegal conduct will be lost unless the police pursue the suspects at that moment.\u201d Thus, the petitioner favors an officer-centric approach, under which the officer\u2019s subjective belief and intent are determinative; there need not be an actual emergency or exigency. He rejects the notion that a suspect\u2019s knowledge of the officer\u2019s intention is relevant, and dictates whether the officer is entitled to immunity. The petitioner relies on the <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1237 (6th ed.1990) definition of \u201cpursue:\u201d \u201c[t]o follow, prosecute, or enforce a matter judicially, as a complaining party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In contrast, the respondents, relying on the Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online\u2019s definition of \u201cpursue\u201d: \u201c \u2018to follow in order to overtake, capture, kill or defeat,\u2019 \u201d listing \u201cchase\u201d as a synonym. They argue that the petitioner was not \u201cpursuing\u201d anyone when the accident occurred. They submit, in fact, that the petitioner, instead, was simply \u201capproaching\u201d the suspects. \u201cApproach\u201d\u2014\u201cdraw closer to,\u201d Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online\u2014and \u201cpursue,\u201d they submit, are different; they are not interchangeable. It is clear, note the respondents, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the suspects were \u201cin a stationary position,\u201d the petitioner was not following or chasing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We agree with the respondents. Where the applicable term is not a defined term, this Court looks to the plain and ordinary meaning of the word. <em>Pelican Nat\u2019l Bank v. Provident Bank, </em>381 Md. 327, 336, 849 A.2d 475, 480 (2004); <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Kolzig, </em>375 Md. 562, 567, 826 A.2d 467, 469 (2003).

To be sure, a non-moving target may be overtaken, but that would not have been as a result of a pursuit; rather he or she simply would have been approached, <em>albeit </em>stealthily. But a stealthy approach does not equate with being chased or pursued. Had the suspects spotted the officer attempting to approach surreptitiously and fled, and the officer followed, a pursuit, chase, would then have occurred. This factual scenario would then fall within \u00a7 19-103\u2019s definition of \u201cpursuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The need for purposeful movement by both parties also comports with police manuals which use the word \u201cpursuit\u201d to discuss a chase or active search for a fleeing person. The <em>Prince George\u2019s County Police General Order Manual, </em>section 4/234/10 (1993)\u2014DEFINITIONS, for example, defines \u201cVehicle Pursuit\u201d as: \u201c[a]ctive attempt by police to apprehend a motorist who exhibits a clear intention to avoid apprehension by high speed driving, evasive tactics ... [and/or] [continuing normal driving actions, but willfully failing to stop on police signal.\u201d \u201cPursuit,\u201d according to the manual, may be initiated for \u201canyone who attempts to elude apprehension for a violation of the law.\u201d <em>See Manual </em>at Section 4/234.20. It logically follows that the same result would occur when the suspect or violator of the law is on foot. The <em>Prince George\u2019s County Police General Order Manual </em>describes vehicle pursuits as \u201cone of the most potentially dangerous, high risk situations facing the law enforcement professional today.\u201d Section 4/234.05, January 31, 1994; <em>see also Howard County Department of Police General Order </em>OPS-48\u2014Vehicle Pursuit Policy, Effective March 21, 2005, Section I. Policy. It is unlikely that, when the Police Department spoke of such severe risks it was referring to initial investigations. Notably, the manual\u2019s use of the word \u201cpursuit\u201d changes to \u201capprehend\u201d when the person discontinues his or her efforts to flee. <em>See Manual </em>at Section 4/234.50\u2014APPREHENSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 19-103 and 5-639 codified certain exceptions to the general rule that police officers must abide by the laws of the road, as would any lay citizen. The Legislature recognized, in so doing, that, in certain situations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>police officers and other drivers of authorized emergency vehicles must have the ability to deviate from the norm to perform their duties, without the fear of personal liability. <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 326, 418 A.2d 1173, 1179 (1980) (\u201c \u2018the official has the freedom and authority to make decisions and choices.\u2019 <em>[State, Use, Clark v. Ferling, </em>220 Md. 109, 113, 151 A.2d 137, 139 (1959) ]. And in <em>Schneider v. Hawkins, </em>179 Md. 21, 25, 16 A.2d 861, 864 (1940)\u2019 which \u2018denotes freedom to act according to one\u2019s judgment in the absence of a hard and fast rule. When applied to public officials, \u2018discretion\u2019 is the power conferred upon them by law to act officially under certain circumstances according to the dictates of their own judgment and conscience.\u2019 \u201d). Given the enormous risk associated with disregarding the rules of the road, however, the Legislature only carved out three exceptions. These are found at \u00a7 19-103(a)(3). Notably, these shields from liability do not apply when the police officer is grossly negligent. <em>See Ashbum II v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 621-24, 510 A.2d 1078, 1079-81 (1986). This is only fitting because, while police officers should be encouraged, and permitted, to do their job without unnecessary fear of liability, this saving cloak should be used sparingly and only when appropriate. <em>James, </em>288 Md. at 327, 418 A.2d at 1180 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">In the case of two of the situations delineated in \u00a7 19-103(a)(3)\u2014emergency call and responding to fire\u2014it is unmistakable that the General Assembly intended the exception for only those situations that require immediate attention, emergency situations. To the extent that the third\u2014pursuing a violator or suspected violator\u2014is ambiguous on this point, its inclusion with the other two clearly focused situations resolve the ambiguity and makes clear that it, too, is subject to the same requirement. <em>See e.g. Grey v.

The facts, as presented here, however, do not reflect such exigent circumstances. Consequently, this Court is unable to characterize the petitioner\u2019s actions as a \u201cpursuit\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 19-103(a)(3)(ii). On this record, the petitioner, while on routine patrol for drug and violent offenders, saw something that caused him to want to investigate further. The record does not support the existence of any, never mind the requisite, exigency, that an immediate arrest was intended to be made on the basis of the observation or that one could have been made on that basis. In fact, the petitioner\u2019s testimony was that he only wanted to investigate the situation further. Acting on that desire is simply not tantamount to \u201cpursuing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Courts that have interpreted the legislative use of the word \u201cpursuing\u201d or \u201cpursuit\u201d in this, or similar, contexts, provide guidance. While this Court has never defined \u201cpursuit,\u201d <em>but see Bost v.

Whatever difference there may be between the various iterations, what is characteristics of each is purposeful movement, and, perhaps, evasive movement, by the pursued, usually in the form of a chase, consisting of the police officer trying to apprehend the suspect or violator and the suspect or violator attempting to avoid it. <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 375, 127 S.Ct 1769, 1773, 167 L.Ed.2d 686, 690-91 (2007) (\u201cFollowing respondent\u2019s shopping center maneuvering which resulted in slight damage to Scott\u2019s police car, Scott took over as the lead pursuit vehicle.\u201d); <em>County of Sacramento v.

During the chase, the defendant dropped a pouch which was picked up by the pursuing officer.\u201d). All these cases have a similar underlying theme. In each case, the person pursued, whether aware of the officer\u2019s approach or not, was moving<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the officer was also moving in his or her direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">It should also be noted that, contrary to the findings of the Circuit Court and the position espoused by the petitioner, (\u201cThe pursuit of a violator or suspected violator of the law by police is created by the officer\u2019s perception of the present commission of a crime, or the officer\u2019s reasonable belief that a crime has been committed.\u201d), this Court will hold that what the officer believes subjectively, may not accurately address, or tend to determine, whether there has been a \u201cpursuit;\u201d such intent cannot always reflect or account for the actions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>all of the parties. That said, an officer\u2019s perception of the situation, <em>ie. </em>whether he or she is in pursuit or not, may help inform the court as whether a pursuit occurred, but is not dispositive and cannot change what is not a pursuit, into one. While how the officer characterizes the situation and his or her intent is properly a part of the inquiry, the true nature of the situation, <em>e.g. </em>chase, stakeout, or investigation, ultimately controls whether it falls squarely within the \u00a7 19\u2014103(a)(3)(ii) exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">If it were otherwise, if intent is the decisive factor, not only would the results be inconsistent, but, and more important, the determination would not be subject to objective evaluation and verification. Immunity would be subject to abuse. What would prevent a police officer from, after-the-fact, categorizing his or her conduct as \u201cpursuit\u201d in order to shield him or herself from liability? In order for \u201cpursuit\u201d to occur, the suspect or violator of the law, at a minimum, has to be moving. If standing still that person is not subject to being followed. The most that can be said is that, when contact is made with him or her, he or she will have been approached and apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Sections 19-103 and 5-639 were enacted by the General Assembly to provide immunity to police officers under certain clearly delineated emergency circumstances. One of those circumstances is when the officer is pursuing the perpetrator or suspected perpetrator of a crime. Under this exception, the \u201cpursuit\u201d must be underway. Section 19\u2014103(a)(3)(ii) requires that the officer be engaged in trying to overtake or apprehend or pursue a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">If the word \u201cpursuing\u201d in \u00a7 5-639 is to have meaning, it cannot encompass every non-emergency situation in which a police officer patrols or undertakes to investigate suspicious behavior. Surely, the Maryland Legislature did not intend to convert all routine police officer investigations into \u201cemergency service.\u201d Section 19-103 is specifically reserved for emergency situations. Accordingly, construing and taking the word \u201cpursuing,\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 19\u2014103(a)(3)(ii) and 5-639, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>context, with the Legislature\u2019s intention in enacting the statute, and the relevant case law, the petitioner is not eligible for the immunity afforded by that statute. When, as we have seen, the accident in question occurred, the petitioner was not \u201c[p]ursuing ... a suspected violator of the law\u201d as \u00a7 19-103(a)(3)(ii) requires. The petitioner, having observed suspicious behavior, intended to, and, indeed, began to investigate further; he made a maneuver which was designed to enable him to approach the suspects. The petitioner\u2019s intended targets did not move, buttressing the characterization of the petitioner\u2019s actions by the respondents, that the petitioner was acting to approach his targets, rather than, as a result of exigency, \u201cpursue\u201d them. Our holding recognizes the boundaries carved out by the Legislature when it enacted \u00a7 19-103(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">II. <em>Common Law Public Official, Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Asserting that he is a public official, who, when the accident occurred, was exercising discretion and acting within the scope of his law enforcement functions, the petitioner argues that he is entitled to common law public official immunity. That being so, he urges, he is immune from the negligence claims brought against him by the respondents. Critical to the viability of that argument is the applicability of \u00a7 5-507 to members of the Baltimore City Police Department. To establish that link, the petitioner cites <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 116 n. 23, 660 A.2d 447, 469 n. 23 (1995), for the proposition that \u00a7 5-507 was enacted by the General Assembly to \u201c[s]afeguard[ ] common law public official immunity\u201d and, while conceding that the Baltimore City Police Department is a State agency, makes the point that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201cit is defined as a \u2018local government\u2019 for purposes of LGTCA.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] Thus, employees of the Department are re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>garded as local government employees. City police officers therefore have the protection provided by LGTCA,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">(quoting <em>Smith v. Danielczyk, </em>400 Md. 98, 111 n. 6, 928 A.2d 795, 803 n. 6 (2007)), a status it shares with municipalities and municipal corporations. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1987, 2006 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 5-301(d)(5) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. From these premises, he argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201cBased on MD.Code Anno. Cts. and Jud. Proc. Art. \u00a7 5-507(b)(1),1[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] Officer Schreyer possesses common law public official immunity from suit from negligence committed in the course of his efforts to stop the suspected violators of the law that he had observed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The petitioner is wrong for two reasons. First, \u00a7 5-507(b) is, by its very terms, applicable to municipal corporations and officers of those corporations; it does not extend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Baltimore City police officers. In <em>Houghton v. Forrest, </em>412 Md. 578, 989 A.2d 223 (2010), this Court made this clear. In that case, a Baltimore City police officer was sued for intentional and constitutional torts. He defended by claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was entitled to immunity under \u00a7 5-507. <em>Houghton, </em>412 Md. at 582, 989 A.2d at 226. Addressing the question whether section \u00a7 5-507(b) applied to Baltimore City police officers, this Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201c[M]unicipal official immunity under CJ Section 5\u2014507(b) does not apply because the BCPD was created as a state agency, through an act of the General Assembly, and not as a municipal agency. <em>See </em>1867 Md. Laws 761-74 (establishing the BCPD and defining its duties); <em>see also Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. v. Clark, </em>404 Md. 13, 28, 944 A.2d 1122, 1131 (2008) (holding that \u2018notwithstanding the Mayor\u2019s role in appointing and removing the City\u2019s Police Commissioner, the Baltimore City Police Department is a state agency.\u2019). Since that time, \u2018this Court has consistently held that Baltimore City should not be regarded as the employer of members of the [BCPD] for purposes of tort liability.\u2019 <em>Clea v. Mayor of Balt., </em>312 Md. 662, 668, 541 A.2d 1303, 1306 (1988). Thus, for the purposes of tort liability, Houghton is an employee of a state agency and not a municipal agency. He therefore cannot claim to be a municipal official, and cannot claim municipal official immunity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 588-89, 989 A.2d at 229. It follows that, consistently, the petitioner <em>sub judice </em>is also not eligible for immunity pursuant to \u00a7 5-507(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The petitioner\u2019s argument is not simply that he is entitled to \u201ccommon law public official immunity,\u201d but, rather, that immunity as codified in \u00a7 5-507(b) and, more particularly, in subsection (b)(1). Even had we not addressed the issue head-on, the path by which the petitioner poses to bring himself within the ambit of \u00a7 5-507 logically does not get him there. Section 5-507 and \u00a7 5-304 are different statutes, which, conceding a degree of overlap, generally apply to different officials. To be sure, both the Baltimore City Police Department and municipal corporations have been included by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the General Assembly in the definition of \u201cLocal Government.\u201d That legislative decision, however, did not render them identical; despite being legislatively placed under the broad definition of \u201cLocal government,\u201d rather than becoming one and the same, thus, interchangeable, both the Baltimore City Police Department and municipal corporations retained their distinct and separate identities. Municipal corporations were not thereby transformed to a local government entity; they remained municipal corporations. The Baltimore City Police Department was not thereby possessed of the attributes of a municipal corporation, in addition to its status as a local government. In short, that the Baltimore City Police Department is a local government, and, thus, subject to the LGTCA, does not make it also a municipal corporation to which \u00a7 5-507 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Since the viability of the petitioner\u2019s argument is dependent on \u00a7 5-507 being applicable and we have concluded that the connection between it and the Baltimore City Police Department cannot logically be made, we hold that the petitioner is not entitled to common law immunity, as he claims, under \u00a7 5-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">HARRELL, BATTAGLIA and BARBERA, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-11\">.

We also agree that the only form of \u201cemergen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>cy service\u201d that Petitioner\u2019s conduct in this case could come within is that described in \u00a7 19\u2014103(a)(3)(ii), \u201c[pursuing a violator or a suspected violator of the law.\u201d <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 99-100, 5 A.3d at 1057</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Where the majority and I part company is in our construction of the phrase \u201cpursuing a violator or a suspected violator of the law.\u201d I am persuaded that the General Assembly did not intend to restrict its grant of immunity for police officers operating an emergency vehicle only to those circumstances when there is \u201cmovement by a suspect or violator of the law, and reactive movement by the officer to apprehend said individual,\u201d as the majority holds. Maj. op. at 99, 5 A.3d at 1057. In my view, proper application of the rules of statutory construction to \u00a7 19\u2014103(a)(3)(ii) dictates a broader, more commonsense construction, one that includes an officer\u2019s approach of an individual suspected at that moment to be breaking the law, with the intention of investigating and, if appropriate, intervening and apprehending the suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">I need not recount all of the pertinent rules of statutory construction, as the majority does a thorough job of it. I simply repeat, for emphasis, several of them. When construing a statute, the primary objective is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. <em>See, e.g., Magnetti v. University of Maryland, </em>402 Md. 548, 564, 937 A.2d 219, 228-29 (2007). To ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent, \u201cwe look first to the plain language of the statute, and if that language is clear and unambiguous, we look no further than the text of the statute.\u201d <em>Newell v. Runnels, </em>407 Md. 578, 640, 967 A.2d 729, 766 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cThe plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.\u201d <em>Magnetti </em>402 Md. at 564-65, 937 A.2d at 229 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As long as the language of the statute is unambiguous, \u201ceither inherently or by references to other relevant laws or circumstances, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends.\u201d <em>Newell, </em>407 Md. at 641, 967 A.2d at 766. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Further, as the majority points out, Maj. op. at 101, 5 A.3d at 1058 \u201cthe absence of an express definition of a term ... does not preclude us from construing its plain meaning.\u201d We are permitted \u201c \u2018to consult the dictionary to elucidate terms that are not defined in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 5 A.3d at 1058 (citation omitted). Though consultation with the dictionary is a \u201c \u2018starting point\u2019 \u201d to ascertaining the Legislative intent, it is \u201c \u2018not necessarily the end.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">I, like the majority, turn first to the dictionary to define the verb \u201cpursue,\u201d and, for completeness, the noun \u201cpursuit.\u201d The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, in relevant part, defines \u201cpursue\u201d as \u201c1. to follow in order to overtake, capture, Mil, etc.; chase. 2. to follow close upon; go with; attend,\u201d and it defines \u201cpursuit\u201d as: \u201c1. the act of pursuing\u201d; and \u201c2. an effort to secure or attain; quest[.]\u201d 1570 (2d ed.1987). The current version of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary does not define pursue; it defines \u201cpursuit,\u201d however, as: \u201c1. An occupation or pastime. 2. The act of chasing to overtake or apprehend.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1272 (8th ed.2004). These definitions, and those offered by the majority, Maj. op. at 106-10, 5 A.3d at 1061-63 embrace the conduct described by the majority (\u201cmovement by a suspect or violator of the law, and reactive movement by the officer to apprehend said individual\u201d). Indeed, it is fair to say that the conduct the majority describes lies at the core of the meaning of \u201cpursue.\u201d But it does not follow that these dictionary definitions exclude the conduct of Petitioner in the present case. A commonsense construction of \u201cpursuing,\u201d in the context of the statute we examine, should include movement by the officer that approaches the suspect in an effort to \u201covertake\u201d the suspect for purposes of investigation and, if appropriate, to \u201capprehend\u201d him or her. Application to \u00a7 19\u2014103(3)(ii) of this broader definition of \u201cpursuing,\u201d moreover, is consistent with what I suspect was the intent of the General Assembly in enacting that section and \u00a7 5-639: to protect law enforcement officers from liability for negligent acts associated with split-second decision-maMng that accompanies the operation of an emergency vehicle in \u201cemergency service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>I read the majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7 19-103(a)(3)(ii) as not requiring that the individual being pursued be aware that he or she is being pursued. <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 115-16, 5 A.3d at 1066-67. I agree that knowledge by the pursued is not necessary to application of the immunity afforded by the statute. I also agree with the majority that the statute requires the existence of \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d Maj. op. at 113, 5 A.3d at 1064. The required exigency in the scenario at bar is, of course, the need of the police officer to intercept a crime in progress in or near the officer\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In a given case, the need to act may be more or less exigent than in other situations. Yet I do not read the majority opinion as intending to limit the applicability of the immunity statute to the officer\u2019s pursuit of only those individuals who are known or suspected of having committed a certain class of crimes. Neither would I read such a limitation into the statute. Suppose, for example, that Petitioner had observed from his police cruiser persons whom he suspected had just committed an armed bank robbery, standing near or walking from the crime scene; he pursued them in the fashion done here; and, in doing so, he acted negligently and caused an accident. In my view, it defies the obvious intent of the immunity statute not to have it apply to the officer\u2019s negligent act committed while employing his vehicle to pursue, even stealthily (if that were the officer\u2019s choice) the suspected armed robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">I disagree with the majority, <em>see </em>Maj. op. at 109-110, 115\u2014 16, 5 A.3d at 1062-63, 1066-67, that the officer\u2019s approach of the crime suspect (or violator) must be triggered by some movement on the part of the individual herself, before the approach can be deemed a \u201cpursuit,\u201d for immunity purposes. Returning to the bank robbery scenario, it makes no sense to me that the General Assembly would not have intended to afford immunity to an officer who commits a negligent act while pursuing suspected bank robbers, even if, at the time the officer launched the pursuit, the suspects were standing still. In my view, Petitioner was no less in pursuit of the suspected drug dealer he spotted in the alley than he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>have been had the suspect moved in a direction away from Petitioner, and Petitioner reacted to that movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">At trial, Petitioner testified that the most effective way to pursue or \u201ccatch ... narcotics violators\u201d is to use stealth. Petitioner intended to confirm, upon his arrival at the scene, that the suspects were engaged in illegal narcotics sales and (I presume), if appropriate, arrest one or more of them. Before he could confront the suspects, however, Petitioner\u2019s vehicle collided with the vehicle in which Respondents were traveling, and the suspects dispersed. Even though the suspects escaped before Petitioner could initiate contact, these facts demonstrate that Petitioner\u2019s conduct before the accident was an immediate attempt to intercept criminal activity and apprehend the perpetrators. It is the officer\u2019s decision to apprehend a suspect, not a suspect\u2019s awareness of law enforcement efforts, that determines whether the officer is \u201ctrying to overtake or apprehend,\u201d or \u201cpursuing,\u201d the suspect within the meaning of the operative immunity statute. Petitioner\u2019s conduct, as we just described it, fits the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The majority acknowledges, Maj. op. at 110-111, 5 A.3d at 1063-64 that the purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 19-103 and 5-639 is to protect police officers who operate emergency vehicles in furtherance of the performance of their duties. <em>See, e.g., </em>Public Local Laws of Baltimore City \u00a7 16-2(a) (establishing that the Baltimore City police officers have \u201cthe specific duty and responsibility ... to detect and prevent the commission of crime [ ] ... [and] to apprehend and arrest criminals and persons who violate [the laws of this State or of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore] or are lawfully accused of violating such laws and ordinances\u201d). Rather than leave any ambiguity as to whether the officers are protected under other statutes or common law principles for liability incurred while operating emergency vehicles, \u00a7\u00a7 19-103 and 5-639 provide officers with specific protection. Furthermore, just as the public official immunity doctrine (to which I refer simply as a point of reference) protects public officials from liability incurred while exercising their discretionary authority, \u00a7\u00a7 19-103 and 5-639 ensure that law enforcement officers have \u201cthe freedom and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>authority to make decisions and choices\u201d while operating emergency vehicles in \u201cemergency service,\u201d without fear of personal economic responsibility. <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 261, 863 A.2d 297, 306 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The narrow interpretation the majority gives to \u201cpursuing,\u201d as used in \u00a7 19-103(a)(3)(ii), seriously undermines that function.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In sum, I would reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court on the ground that Petitioner is entitled to immunity under \u00a7 5-639 for the emergency service he performed in pursuing a person suspected of violating the law. I would remand the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City with directions to vacate the judgment of the District Court and enter judgment in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Judges HARRELL and BATTAGLIA have authorized me to state that they join in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
