William and Michele Pease (Appellants)\u2014husband and wife and guarantors on a Small Business Administration (hereinafter \u201cSBA\u201d) commercial loan financing substantially their acquisition of a plumbing business\u2014appeal from the denial by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of their motion to open, modify, or vacate confessed judgments in favor of Wachovia SBA Lending, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cWachovia\u201d or Appellee), entered against them upon default under the underlying note. In arguing that the confessed judgments should be opened, modified, or vacated, the Peases claim essentially that: (1) the Circuit Court erred in refusing to consider their allegations and evidentiary proffers that Wachovia and its representatives induced them, fraudulently and negligently, to enter a series of related loans through certain oral representations and omissions; or, (2) that, had certain information been disclosed to them by Wachovia, they would not have consummated the SBA commercial loan and guarantees. In response, Wachovia argues that \u00a7 5-408\u2014also coined the \u201cMaryland Credit Agreement Act\u201d\u2014bars the admission of these alleged oral representations, as they were not set forth in writing. We hold, as explained more fully <em>infra, </em>that, to the extent the Peases\u2019 assertions of negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty were advanced with an eye towards filing counterclaims against Wachovia in the suit on the commercial loan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>guarantees, such assertions do not seek to enforce or modify a \u201ccredit agreement\u201d (or constitute a defense to a \u201ccredit agreement\u201d) within the reach of \u00a7 5-408, and thus the Maryland Credit Agreement Act does not apply to bar the Circuit Court from considering the sufficiency of the allegations under Md. Rule 2-611(d). To the extent the Peases\u2019 assertions were advanced, however, with an eye towards seeking a declaration that the credit agreement represented by the SBA commercial loan and guarantees was void <em>ab initio, </em>we hold that the Maryland Credit Agreement Act would apply to bar the Circuit Court from considering such allegations in this matter. We vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court and, as explained <em>infra, </em>remand to that court for consideration of whether the Peases alleged sufficiently one or more tortious acts, that may be plead as counterclaims, so as to justify opening, modifying, or vacating the confessed judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">William Pease (hereinafter \u2018William\u201d) and Michele Pease (hereinafter \u201cMichele\u201d) were the former owners and operators of a successful plumbing business in Richmond, Virginia. In 2005, the Peases, in relocating their family to Maryland, decided to sell their business in Virginia and purchase an existing plumbing business in Maryland. They eventually settled in Harford County, Maryland, and purchased a residence for $820,000, paying $300,000 in cash and financing the remaining $520,000. Around the same time, William learned from a business brokerage firm that David Kolper was seeking to sell his Maryland-based plumbing company, Bush Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cBush\u201d). The Peases established two entities, which they would own, to purchase Bush: VLP Industries, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and VLP Real Estate, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company. To finance the purchase of Bush, William contacted Wachovia to obtain an SBA loan. He was ultimately referred to Jeffrey<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Martin (hereinafter \u201cMartin\u201d), Wachovia\u2019s agent, senior commercial business lender, and business development officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">During the period between March and August of 2005, William alleged that he spoke with Martin at least twice a week, and repeatedly told Martin that he did not want his new residence to be \u201cimplicated in the financing or to, in any manner, pledge or utilize the new home as collateral toward repayment of the [SBA] loan.\u201d Allegedly, Martin informed William that, pursuant to Wachovia\u2019s normal lending procedures, the only way the Peases would not be required to pledge their house as collateral on the SBA loan was if they had less than twenty-percent equity in the value of the home. Because the size of the Peases\u2019 down payment put the amount of equity in the home above twenty percent, Martin suggested the Peases encumber the home with a home equity line of credit with Wachovia, which would decrease the amount of equity in the property below the twenty-percent threshold. The Peases applied for and received from Wachovia a $218,000 line of credit on their residence, which reduced their personal equity in the home to ten percent. The Peases contend that Wachovia and Martin misrepresented verbally that this \u201cartificial loan\u201d would safeguard the residence from foreclosure were the commercial loan to go into default and the personal guarantees triggered. In reality, however, because the commercial loan documents (including the guarantees) provided no such restriction on Wachovia\u2019s abilities to execute on the Peases\u2019 assets in the event of default, Wachovia could foreclose on the home under those circumstances notwithstanding the home equity loan gambit. Thus, the Peases allege that these statements regarding protecting the residence from foreclosure were made to induce them into agreeing to enter the SBA loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">At the same time, William began the process of reviewing the business affairs and finances of Bush to ensure the company was valued as estimated by Kolper. According to William, as part of his due diligence in reviewing the business affairs and finances of Bush, he required Kolper and the business brokerage firm to provide various documentation, including: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>profit and loss statements for the duration of Bush\u2019s operations, prior tax returns, a list of employees, a list of contracts, a list of accounts receivables, and various other documentation. Such documentation was submitted to Wachovia\u2019s certified appraiser, Scott Gabehart, who, after conducting an independent financial analysis for Wachovia and the Peases, valued Bush at $950,000 as a going concern. Further, a separate real estate appraiser valued the real property on which the Bush business was located at $450,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">A few weeks prior to settlement on the SBA loan, Martin allegedly admitted to William that, according to the documentation supplied to Wachovia, Bush\u2019s financial health was weaker than Kolper had indicated. A centerpiece of the Peases\u2019 grievance is the allegation that Wachovia possessed certain negative financial information that it withheld from them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Allegedly, the Peases did not discover this negative financial information until after settlement. They claim that they would not have proceeded with the purchase of Bush had they known of the later-discovered negative financial information. In any event, because the financial state of Bush was not as Kolper had stated, Martin classified the proposed transaction as a \u201cvery tight\u201d deal; that is, he was not sure whether Wachovia would approve the SBA loan now. The Peases allege that Martin urged William to cause VLP Industries, Inc. to execute a promissory note in the amount of $95,000, payable to Kolper, as additional financing for the purchase of Bush and as a way to ensure that Wachovia could authorize the financing for the balance of the purchase price. Allegedly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Martin represented verbally to William that the $95,000 promissory note would be \u201chold-back money\u201d that the Peases could utilize in the event that Bush incurred any liability as a result of its operations prior to the transfer of Bush. While Martin characterized this \u201chold-back money\u201d as a safety precaution to protect against any outstanding issues associated with the purchase of Bush, the Peases maintain that this loan was merely a device for Wachovia to shift some of the risk exposure on the SBA loan from itself to the Peases.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Settlement on the purchase of Bush took place on 19 August 2005, whereby Bush\u2019s operating assets were transferred to VLP Industries, Inc., and the real property on which Bush was situated was transferred to VLP Real Estate, for a total purchase price of $1,494,075.49. On the same day, to finance the majority of the purchase price, VLP Industries, Inc. executed a commercial loan with Wachovia in the amount of $1,118,300. The Peases personally guaranteed the loan, and both William and Michele signed the loan agreement, which contained the following confessed judgment clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Q\">CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT. If payment of the indebtedness ... shall not be made when due and at maturity ... the undersigned hereby authorize and empower any attorney of any Court of Record within the United States to appear for the undersigned in any Court ... and confess judgment against the undersigned either jointly or severally in favor of the Holder of this Note for the amount then due thereon, with the interest thereon aforementioned and the cost of suit and attorneys\u2019 fees of fifteen percent (15%)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfA\">Less than one week after settlement, the Peases paid back the $218,000 home equity loan, plus $2,570.74 in related loan fees and interest. On the $95,000 hold-back note, however, the Peases made no payments to Kolper. Further, on 30 November 2007, VLP Industries, Inc. defaulted on the commercial loan, on which $1,112,312.34 was owed at that time. On that same date, Wachovia accelerated the commercial loan and informed both William and Michele of their obligation to pay the outstanding amount in full. On 28 January 2008, having not received the accelerated payments, Wachovia insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tuted confessed judgment proceedings in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Confessed judgments for $1,285,995.28 were entered and indexed against the Peases and both of their business entities on 28 January 2008.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The Peases filed a motion to open, modify, or vacate the confessed judgments on 8 April 2008, asserting allegations of negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty. In support of these allegations, the Peases attached an affidavit by John Burdiss, a purported expert in banking standards of care. Burdiss claimed that Wachovia failed to comport with commercially reasonable banking standards when it authorized the commercial loan, despite having reservations about Bush\u2019s financial stability, and when it induced the Peases into taking out the home equity loan by assuring them that, by doing so, their residence would be protected from foreclosure. Wachovia responded by arguing that the Peases\u2019 defenses of negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty were barred by the Maryland Credit Agreement Act, which states that \u201c[a] credit agreement is not enforceable ... unless it is ... [i]n writing ....\u201d\u00a7 5-408(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">On 10 December 2008, a hearing on the motion to open, modify, or vacate the confessed judgments was held in the Circuit Court. Before the trial court, the Peases asserted that, should the hearing judge order the confessed judgment opened, modified, or vacated, they would file counterclaims against Wachovia,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> yet they informed the hearing judge also that they would argue that the SBA loan agreement was void <em>ab initio </em>for the same reasons as supported the tort claims. After listening to both sides, the hearing judge denied reluc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tantly the Peases\u2019 motion, believing he was bound by the reasoning contained in a Court of Special Appeals\u2019s case, <em>ST Sys. Corp. v. Md. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>112 Md.App. 20, 684 A.2d 32 (1996):<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">I am going to deny the Motion to Vacate. And I do so with a good deal of reluctance____ The Court need only find there is a potentially meritorious defense, not to determine the amount of merit, or that the moving party will indeed prevail____ And, while I would certainly find that the Plaintiff would be, I believe be able to present a defense that in terms of having been induced by perhaps misrepresentation .... I just cannot find that in light of the Maryland Credit Agreement Statute, and particularly in light of the ST Systems Corporation vs. Maryland National Bank case.... And I too, as an individual would hope that the statute would not be such a shield as to protect lending institutions from any tort....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Yet, I am merely sitting in the Circuit Court and have been compelled to follow the dictates of the opinions of the Appellate Court. And, my understanding of what the Court of Special Appeals has said is literally the economic protective policy of the Maryland Credit Agreement statute is only upheld if tort claims based on an unenforceable alleged agreement are excluded and the torts that are alleged here as the potentially meritorious defenses are indeed based upon unenforceable alleged agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The Peases appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals. On our initiative, we granted certiorari, before the intermediate appellate court could decide the appeal, to consider, if appropriate, whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">the [Maryland Credit Agreement Act] which bars enforcement of credit agreements, unless the agreements are in writing, and the CSA decision in [ST <em>Sys.

Antezana, </em>171 Md.App. 717, 727-28, 912 A.2d 45, 51 (2006) (\u201cOn the issue of whether what is offered by a party seeking to open, modify, or vacate a confessed judgment qualifies as a meritorious defense, that is a question of law for the judge.\u201d); <em>Shafer Bros. v.

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The Peases devote a portion of their brief to canvassing the legislative history of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act. Wachovia devotes most of its brief to arguing that the Maryland Credit Agreement Act bars consideration of the Peases\u2019 allegations and evidentiary proffers of alleged negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty. Read together, the parties\u2019 briefs ask, in effect, this Court to cut through what might be a Gordian Knot of statutory interpretation and determine whether \u00a7 5-408(b) bars consideration of the Peas-es\u2019 allegations and evidentiary proffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">To be sure, \u201c[c]onstruing statutes ... is a large and essential part of the judicial process\u201d and \u201c[i]t is one of the principal functions which courts were created to perform.... \u201d <em>Mangum v. Md. State Bd. of Censors, </em>273 Md. 176, 192, 328 A.2d 283, 292 (1974); <em>see Atl. Sea-Con., Ltd. v. Robert Dann Co., </em>80 Md.App. 161, 165, 560 A.2d 592, 594 (1989), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>321 Md. 275, 582 A.2d 981 (1990). Wading up to our eyebrows in the waters of statutory interpretation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>is not required where the perceived-as-relevant statutory provision does not control the alleged facts of a given case. <em>See Boffen v. State, </em>372 Md. 724, 736, 816 A.2d 88, 95 (2003) (quoting <em>Chen v. State, </em>370 Md. 99, 106, 803 A.2d 518, 521-22 (2002)) (\u201cIn discerning legislative intent, Ve look first at the language of the <em>relevant </em>statutory provision or provisions.\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Pertinent to our case, and pursuant to Md. Rule 2-611(d), we are alert to the fact that the practical effect of a hearing judge opening, modifying, or vacating a confessed judgment is to \u201cpermit the defendant to file a responsive pleading.\u201d Admittedly, at this juncture in these proceedings, it is a bit unclear upon what grounds that pleading would be based and what its aim might be. The lack of clarity is occasioned by, on one hand, the Peases arguing before the trial court, and reiterating in their brief before this Court, that, if the judgments are opened, modified, or vacated, they intend to file counterclaims against Wachovia, asserting the same tort-based theories raised before the trial court and this Court: negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty. On the other hand, before the hearing judge, the Peases also acknowledged that they would seek to have the credit agreement declared void <em>ab initio </em>for the same reasons. At oral argument here, the Peases\u2019 counsel stated that \u201cthe defenses in this case ... create a tort defense <em>to the creation </em>of the promissory note.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Thus, it is not clear then or now whether the Peases\u2019 incipient responsive pleading would assert that they are entitled to damages, notwithstanding the enforceability of the credit agreement, or whether they will argue the credit agreement represented by the SBA commercial loan and guarantees is not enforceable in the first instance. Because different outcomes, vis \u00e1 vis the application of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act, might result from these alternative approaches, after determining precisely the situations to which the General Assembly intended the Act apply, we will address the (1) counterclaims and (2) the void <em>ab initio </em>objectives in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>A. The Maryland Credit Agreement Act</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Maryland Credit Agreement Act, Md.Code (2006 Repl. Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-408, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] credit agreement is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless it: (1) [i]s in writing; (2) [expresses consideration; (3) [s]ets forth the relevant terms and conditions of the agreement; and (4)[i]s signed by the person against whom enforcement is sought.\u201d \u00a7 5-408(b). As one would expect, however, with a statute entitled the \u201cMaryland Credit Agreement Act,\u201d the Act only serves as a statute of frauds with respect to \u201ccredit agreements.\u201d <em>See </em>Bill Analysis of H.B. 704 (1989) (\u201cThe intent of this bill is to establish a statute of frauds that makes certain <em>credit agreements ... </em>unenforceable unless they are in writing ....\u201d) (emphasis added). The Act provides that a \u201ccredit agreement\u201d is a \u201ccovenant, promise, undertaking, commitment, or other agreement by a financial institution to: 1. [l]end money; 2. [forbear from repayment of money, goods, or things in action; 3. [forbear from collecting or exercising any right to collect a debt; or 4. [otherwise extend credit.\u201d \u00a7 5-408(a)(2)(i). The Act goes on to explain that the term \u201c \u2018credit agreement\u2019 includes agreeing to take or not to take certain actions by a financial institution in connection with an existing or prospective credit agreement.\u201d \u00a7 5-408(a)(2)(ii). Both the parties in this case and the Concurring and Dissenting opinion wrestle with the Maryland Credit Agreement Act without first considering a threshold issue: whether the Act even applies\u2014in whole or in part\u2014to the Peases\u2019 assertions of negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The legislative history of the Act, though not extensive, illuminates the types of situations to which the General Assembly intended the Act apply. In 1989, at the time the legislation was enacted, \u201cmultimillion dollar lawsuits [were] being filed and recovery [was] being made based on alleged verbal promises to lend and based on modifications of existing loan agreements.\u201d Notes to H.B. 704 (1989). Thus, the purpose of the bill was to \u201cprotect lenders against claims that the lender made a verbal promise to loan money and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>refused to do so, or that the lender verbally agreed to extend the terms of a loan.\u201d Bill Analysis of H.B. 704 (1989). We interpret the plain language and the legislative history of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act consistently to mean that a court should only engage the statute of frauds portion of the Act when, either through affirmative claim or defense, a commercial borrower or lender either attempts to recover on a verbal promise to lend/borrow, or seeks to enforce a verbal modification of an existing credit agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Md. Rule 2-611(d) requires a trial judge to find \u201cthat there is a substantial and sufficient basis for an actual controversy as to the merits of the action\u201d before opening, modifying, or vacating the confessed judgment. If, however, the Maryland Credit Agreement Act bars admission of certain evidence supporting the \u201cbasis for an actual controversy,\u201d it logically follows that such evidence is not, then, \u201csubstantial and sufficient.\u201d We now move to apply our understanding of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act to the (1) potential counterclaims and (2) the void <em>ab initio </em>objective, both asserted by the Peases before the trial court and this Court, as the theories upon which a future \u201cresponsive pleading\u201d might be based, to determine whether the Act bars consideration at this stage of the proceedings of allegations and evidentiary proffers supporting either or both such objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">B. As Counterclaims</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">As explained <em>supra, </em>the Peases assert that, if successful in opening or vacating the confessed judgment, they will employ their allegations\u2014negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty\u2014as the bases for counterclaims against Wachovia. If the Act, however, would bar such counterclaims, or the evidence on which they rest, the allegations and evidentiary proffers cannot constitute a \u201csubstantial and sufficient basis as to the merits of the action\u201d sufficient to open or vacate the confessed judgments. <em>See Schlossberg v. Citizens Bank of Md., </em>341 Md. 650, 656, 672 A.2d 625, 627 (1996) (stating that a confessed judgment can only be opened if \u201cthe defendant has a potentially meritorious defense\u201d). As discussed <em>supra, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>statute of frauds portion of the Act only applies in the first instance to bar assertion of the Peases\u2019 counterclaims if they constitute either an attempt to enforce either (1) an oral credit agreement; or (2) a verbal modification of their existing loan agreement. Simply put, in filing these counterclaims against Wachovia, the Peases would be doing neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The filing of offensive counterclaims using the tort theories of negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty would be on the basis that, as the Peases acknowledge, any recovery on such claims would serve as a set-off against any judgment on the guarantees in favor of Wachovia.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, where such counterclaims are allowed to be filed, the Peases would not seek thereby to enforce or modify an oral agreement, but would be asserting such claims notwithstanding the implicitly conceded enforceability of the credit agreement (the SBA commercial loan and guarantees). On the other hand, the legislative history of the Act is clear that, if the Peases were asserting the counterclaims as a means to defeat directly or attain a modification of the credit agreement with Wachovia, the Maryland Credit Agreement Act would be triggered and bar consideration of the underlying allegations and evidentiary proffers in determining whether the confessed judgments should be opened, modified, or vacated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Notes to H.B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>704 (1989) (\u201c[A]ll this legislation is saying is that ... if you are going to sue me to enforce an alleged loan agreement, get it in writing and get it signed.\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the Peases would be asserting the counterclaims against Wachovia for negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty, not to enforce a verbal agreement to borrow or to modify their existing agreement to borrow, but to constitute a set-off against any recovery obtained by Wachovia under a concededly enforceable credit agreement, these counterclaims plainly are not the sort of situation to which the General Assembly intended the Act apply.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Steven C. Bahls, <em>Farm and Ranch Credit: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Duty-Based, Theories of Lender Liability, </em>19 Wm. Mitchell L.Rev. 367, 399 (1993) (\u201cSince many ... claims do not seek to establish or modify a credit agreement, the [credit agreement] statutes may not apply.\u201d). As such, \u00a7 5-408(b), which serves as the Act\u2019s statute of frauds, does not bar at the threshold the Circuit Court from considering the Peases\u2019 allegations\u2014in assessing the legal sufficiency of whether the appropriate legal theory of each counterclaim states a prima facie cause of action\u2014as grounds to open, modify, or vacate the confessed judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>C. As Void <em>Ab </em>Initio<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The Peases assert in the alternative that, if successful in opening or vacating the confessed judgments, they will use their allegations\u2014sounding in negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty\u2014as the bases for arguing that the SBA loan agreement and guarantees were void <em>ab initio. </em>As above, if the Act would bar the consideration of such parol evidence where the objective is to show that the credit agreement was void <em>ab initio, </em>then the parol evidence on which such a theory rests cannot constitute a \u201csubstantial and sufficient basis as to the merits of the action\u201d sufficient to open the confessed judgment. Because we believe that the Act applies to bar evidence aiming to show that a credit agreement is void <em>ab initio, </em>we hold that such parol evidence cannot constitute a \u201csubstantial and sufficient basis as to the merits of the action,\u201d and is therefore barred from consideration in the context of deciding whether to grant a motion to open, modify, or vacate a confessed judgment based on the credit agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Again, the Act would only bar the Peases\u2019 parol evidence tending to show the loan agreement was void <em>ab initio </em>if the admission of such evidence constitutes an attempt to enforce either: (1) an oral credit agreement; or (2) a verbal modification of their existing credit agreement. Here, while consideration of such evidence to nullify the credit agreement is not an attempt to enforce an oral credit agreement, we think it is an attempt to enforce a verbal modification of the credit agreement existing between the Peases and Wachovia. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The SBA note and the accompanying guarantees set forth the rights and duties of the Peases and Wachovia. These rights and duties include, in pertinent part, the Peases\u2019 duty to repay Wachovia $1,118,300, and, if default and acceleration occur under the note, failing repayment, Wachovia\u2019s right to execute on the guarantors\u2019 assets, including the real property upon which Bush is situated and the Peases\u2019 residence. The Peases\u2019 attempts to declare the credit agreement void ab <em>initio, </em>at least on the bases appearing in this record, constitute an attempt to have a court declare that they need not pay back the $1,118,300 and/or that Wachovia may not execute on the borrowers\u2019 or the guarantors\u2019 assets; as such, the Peases are arguing for the enforcement of what is, in effect, an oral modification of the original terms of the loan and guarantees. This is precisely the type of maneuver that the statute of frauds portion of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act was enacted to forestall. <em>See </em>Notes to H.B. 704 (\u201cMultimillion dollar lawsuits are being filed and recovery is being made based on ... modifications of existing loan agreements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">B. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">This case requires this Court to consider the interplay between the law and rules governing confessed judgments and the Maryland Credit Agreement Act. \u201cJudgments by confession are not favored in Maryland because Maryland courts have long recognized that the practice of including in a promissory note a provision authorizing confession of judgment lends itself far too readily to fraud and abuse.\u201d <em>Garliss </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>v. Key Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>97 Md.App. 96, 103, 627 A.2d 64, 68 (1993) (citation omitted). Not surprisingly then, Md. Rule 2-611(e) provides that \u201cthe court <em>shall </em>order the judgment by confession opened,\u201d upon showing of a \u201csubstantial and sufficient basis for an actual controversy as to the merits of the action____\u201d (Emphasis added.) A party can only successfully show the requisite \u201csubstantial and sufficient basis,\u201d however, if the allegations and evidentiary proffers supporting such a basis will be arguably admissible. It is at this juncture that the Maryland Credit Agreement Act becomes relevant. That is, if the statute of frauds section of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act would apply to bar consideration of certain parol evidence at the merit-stage of the litigation, such evidence may not be considered in deciding a motion to open, modify, or vacate a confessed judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We hold that the General Assembly did not intend the Maryland Credit Agreement Act to apply to a borrower asserting tort counterclaims against a lender, even where the asserted factual underpinnings of the tort or torts derive from transactions relating to the execution of the credit agreement. As such, to the extent the Peases\u2019 responsive pleading will assert counterclaims against Wachovia, the evidentiary proffers upon which these counterclaims appear to be based are not barred by the statute of frauds provision of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act from consideration in deciding whether to open or vacate the confessed judgment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred in refusing to consider whether the Peas-es\u2019 allegations and evidentiary proffers plead sufficiently and substantially an actual controversy. To the extent, however, that the Peases claim that the SBA loan agreement was void <em>ab initio, </em>they ask the court effectively to enforce an oral modification of their written credit agreement. Because the applicable statute of frauds applies to bar a party from effectuating the enforcement of a claimed oral modification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the evidence upon which such an argument rests would be, in that instance, inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In the Circuit Court, the hearing judge conceded that, but for his determination that he could not consider the Peases\u2019 factual allegations and evidentiary proffers at the threshold, he \u201cwould certainly find that the Plaintiff would be ... able to present a defense ... by perhaps misrepresentation about the home being used as collateral.... \u201d Because he did not make a determination whether, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-611(d), there exists in this case a \u201csubstantial and sufficient basis for an actual controversy as to the merits of the action,\u201d we remand the case, in light of this opinion, so that the court may consider whether the Peases\u2019 allegations of negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty meet this threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE ASSIGNED 50% TO THE PEASES AND 50% TO WACHOVIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">BELL, C.J., MURPHY and ADKINS, JJ., concur and dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">.

STX filed suit against MNB, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>eight separate tort claims based on MNB's conduct during the loan negotiation process. <em>Id. </em>MNB filed a motion to dismiss these tort claims, arguing that the Maryland Credit Agreement Act barred STX\u2019s tort claims that were related directly to the non-memorialized\u2014and thus unenforceable\u2014agreement. <em>See id. </em>The Court of Special Appeals explained that the Maryland Credit Agreement Act is \"intended to limit the increase in lender liability litigation,\u201d and that the statute \"has broad language that appears to incorporate an expansive view of limiting lender liability....\u201d <em>See ST Sys.

The Concurring and Dissenting opinion\u2019s efforts to grapple with the Maryland Credit Agreement Act\u2019s plain language, legislative history, and how other jurisdictions may have treated debatably similar facts under arguably similar statutory schemes, where not entirely necessary, call to mind the stoiy of the Exodus. The Midrashic interpretation of the Exodus from Egypt recounts that, upon reaching the Red Sea, the waters did not automatically part before the Israelites. Midrash Rabbah, Vot. Ill 272 (S.M. Lehrman, trans., 3d ed.1983). While the Israelites stood by the shore contemplating their impending doom, Nahshon Ben Amminadab entered the water until the sea reached his nostrils. The Jewish Encyclopedia Vol. IX 146 (Funk &amp; Wagnall 1905); Midrash Rabbah, <em>supra. </em>It was not until this act of self-sacrifice that the sea\u2019s waters parted. Imagine, however, that there was a way for the Israelites to continue on their path without having to wade in water over their heads.

The Concurring and Dissenting opinion highlights a different colloquy at oral argument between the Peases' counsel and Judge Murphy to support its view that we should decline to address the \u00bf\u2019eases\u2019 pursuit of a void <em>ab initio </em>claim. 416 Md. 211, 234 n.l, 6 A.3d 867, 880-81 n.l (2010). Apparently, Judge Adkins hears the Peases' counsel say, on the recording of oral argument, \"we challenged that the loan that was executed, through the negligence or through fraud, was improperly created and therefore could either be void <em>ab initio </em>or as a setoff,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>infers from the past-tense of the verb \"challenged\u201d that the Peases only pursued the void <em>ab initio </em>objective before the Circuit Court, but not before this Court. <em>Id. </em>(first emphasis added). After our careful review of the oral argument recording, we hear the Peases\u2019 counsel utter the word \u201cchallenge\u201d (the present tense); thus, we understand the Peases\u2019 counsel to mean that he is currently\u2014before this Court\u2014arguing that, upon remand, the Peases be allowed to seek a declaration that the SBA loan was void <em>ab initio </em>(or voidable).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Notwithstanding our difference of opinion about which tense the verb \"challenge\u201d took in the exchange between counsel and Judge Murphy, the Peases\u2019 counsel\u2014during what seems elsewhere on the recording of oral argument to be part of his prepared arguments, and not in direct response to an inquiry by a member of the Court\u2014unequivocally states that it was his belief that the defenses asserted by his clients (then and now) operate to void the SBA loan <em>ab initio. </em>Finally, the Peases\u2019 counsel, in his brief at 19, cites a Law Review article for the proposition that \"[fjraud may serve both as a defense to a suit on a contract and as an independent tort.\u201d Todd C.

In response, the Plaintiffs sued Peoples Bank, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the bank engaged in illegal bank practices, professional negligence, and intentional and negligent misrepresentation in underwriting the loan. <em>Kuechler, </em>602 F.Supp.2d at 631. The Plaintiffs premised these lender-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>liability claims on allegations that \"Peoples Bank, in order to induce Plaintiffs to execute the mortgage on their home, assured them that the foreclosure sales proceeds of the ... Property would be applied against the $500,000 loan.\u201d <em>Kuechler, </em>602 F.Supp.2d at 628. Such an allegation, however, was at odds with the express language of the credit agreement. <em>Kuechler, </em>602 F.Supp.2d at 632. Judge J. Frederick Motz held that \"Peoples Bank\u2019s promise to take or not to take certain actions, such as foreclosing on the Davidson property before foreclosing on the Kuechler\u2019s residence .... was not in writing, it is [therefore] not enforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In effect, the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim in <em>Kuechler </em>was essentially that the bank\u2019s inducements and assurances effectuated a modification of the original credit agreement. <em>See id. </em>Of course, the legislative history of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act is clear that such alleged modifications are unenforceable unless in writing. As noted <em>supra, </em>in the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, to the extent that the Peases seek to assert counterclaims against Wachovia, they are not alleging that the alleged tortious acts of negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty effectuated a modification of their credit agreement with Wachovia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">. Not all jurisdictions have held that offensive use of counterclaims are allowed under their respective credit agreement statutes of frauds.

It is worth noting that a recent decision from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri concluded that Missouri\u2019s Credit Agreement Act did not apply, in the first instance, to tort allegations similar to those before us. In <em>Four A\u2019s Investment Co., LLC v. Batik of Am. Corp., </em>2010 WL 2720713, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66976 (W.D.Mo. 6 July 2010), a borrower sued Bank of America for negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligence, and breach of covenant, stemming from the borrower\u2019s desired loan from Bank of America. Specifically, the borrower alleged that the bank \"made oral representations that the loan would be approved within a certain time\u201d and that the bank \"misrepresented the status of the loan when asked about why the process was taking so long.\" <em>Four </em>A's <em>Investment Co., LLC, </em>2010 WL 2720713, at *4, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66976, at *12. In response to these allegations, Bank of America asserted that, because the borrower was seeking a commercial loan, Missouri's Commercial Credit Agreement Statute of Frauds, Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 432.047, which provides that \"[a] debtor may not maintain an action upon or a defense ... in any way related to a credit agreement unless the credit agreement is in writing ... \u201d, barred such claims.

It is not that we \"fail to recognize\" this apparently well-settled rule of law; rather, we view it as immaterial.

Thus, it is immaterial that the Peases would be unsuccessful in using such evidence to prove that the SBA loan was void <em>ab initio; </em>rather, the only issue is whether, in so arguing, the Peases would be seeking to enforce a modification of the SBA loan agreement.

Op. at 224, 6 A.3d at 875 (quoting Notes to H.B. 704 (1989)). I would explore, which the majority does not, how this legislative history is helpful to interpreting specific words of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Specifically, I believe that the legislative history sheds light on the meaning of \u201cenforceable\u201d as used in Subsection (b) of the Act\u2014\u201ca credit agreement is not enforceable by way of action or defense[.]\u201d Maryland Code, (1973, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-408 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). The Act defines \u201ccredit agreement\u201d to include \u201cagreeing to take or to not take certain actions by a financial institution in connection with an existing or prospective credit agreement.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-408(a)(ii). It then provides that a \u201ccredit agreement\u201d is not \u201cenforceable by way of action or defense\u201d unless it is in writing. CJP \u00a7 5-408(b)(l). Wachovia argues that these provisions mean that any oral agreement or representation made by a bank in connection with a loan is barred, even when used to support a tort action. Thus, Wachovia interprets the word \u201cenforce\u201d to include an action in tort based on the oral agreement. This was the interpretation reached in <em>ST Systems v. Md. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>112 Md.App. 20, 32, 684 A.2d 32, 38 (1996). Under this construction, a suit for damages in tort would \u201cenforce\u201d the oral agreement in the sense that it would impose liability on the bank for breaching the agreement. In my view, this argument merits more discussion than the brief treatment that the majority opinion accords it. I set forth my reasons for rejecting Wachovia\u2019s argument in Section II hereof. Ultimately, though, I agree with the majority that the Act does not bar suits or counterclaims for damages in fraud, negligence, or breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>I depart from the majority when it veers into discussion of an argument that the contract is void <em>ab initio,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and holds that the Act would bar such a claim. First, the majority fails to recognize that a successful claim of fraudulent inducement renders the contract voidable, not void <em>ab initio. See Julian v. Buonassissi, </em>414 Md. 641, 667, 997 A.2d 104, 119 (2010) (\u201cWe have long recognized that contracts obtained by fraud are not absolutely void, but are voidable at the election of the parties affected by the fraud[.]\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>Wenstrom Consolidated Dynamo &amp; Motor Co. of Balt. City v. Purnell, </em>75 Md. 113, 120, 23 A. 134, 136 (1891) (\u201c[W]here a [party] has been deceived and induced to enter into a [contract], by misrepresentation and fraud ..., such contract, while not absolutely void, is voidable[.]\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 164(1) (1981) (\u201cIf a party\u2019s manifestation of assent is induced by either a fraudulent or a material misrepresentation by the other party upon which the recipient is justified in relying, the contract is voidable by the recipient.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the Restatement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the same would be true in a successful claim of negligent material misrepresentation inducing a contract. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 164 cmt. b (1981) (\u201cA representation need not be fraudulent in order to make a contract voidable under the rule stated in this Section. However, a non-fraudulent misrepresentation does not make a contract voidable unless it is material, while materiality is not essential in the case of a fraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, this case presents no issue about the effect of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act on credit agreements claimed to be <em>void ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that the Act bars use of oral statements that would render a contract void <em>ab initio. </em>The majority reasons that any \u201cconsideration of [Wachovia\u2019s oral representations] to nullify the [commercial loan] ... is an attempt to enforce a verbal modification of the [commercial loan] existing between the Peases and Wachovia.\u201d Maj. Op. at 230, 6 A.3d at 878. This determination utterly misconstrues the doctrine of \u201cvoid <em>ab initio.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>When a contract is void <em>ab initio, </em>it is \u201c[n]ull from the beginning, as from the first moment when a contract is entered into[.]\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1709 (9th ed.2009). It is as if the contract never existed in the first place. <em>Cf. Julian v. Buonassissi, </em>414 Md. 641, 666, 997 A.2d 104, 119 (2010) (\u201cA void contract \u2018is not a contract at all[.]\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 7 cmt. a (1981)). The contract never forms because there is no mutual assent, such as in situations where fraud in factum is alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">At the heart of the assertion of [fraud in factum] is the absence of that degree of mutual assent prerequisite to the formation of a binding contract; absent the proverbial \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d one cannot be said to have obligated himself in law and the <em>purported transaction is regarded as void.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Richard A. Lord, 26 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 69:4, at 502 (4th ed.2003)(quoting <em>Bancredit, Inc. v. Bethea, </em>68 N.J.Super. 62, 172 A.2d 10, 12 (App.Div.1961)) (emphasis added). Thus, contracts that are void <em>ab initio </em>are not legally recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzZ\">When deeds are ... void <em>ab initio, </em>[they are] wholly wanting in legal fitness to stand even as security for advances. They have in truth <em>no lawful existence, </em>and to use the expression of Mr. Sugden, 525, \u201cIt would be wholly inconsistent and absurd to recognize them for any lawful purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\"><em>Slingluff v. Smith, </em>76 Md. 558, 560, 25 A. 674, 675 (1893) (emphasis added). As we said in <em>Western Maryland R. Co. v. Blue Ridge Hotel Co., </em>102 Md. 307, 331, 62 A. 351, 355 (1905), a contract that is void <em>ab initio,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az8\">will not be enforced by any species of action in a Court of Justice; ... it cannot be made good by ratification, or by any succession of renewals, and no performance on either side, can give validity to the unlawful contract, or form the foundation of any right of action upon it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">(quoting 10 Cyc. 1146 (1904)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The majority\u2019s reasoning is flawed. It characterizes a claim that a contract is void <em>ab initio </em>as one barred by the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>because \u201cit is an attempt to enforce a verbal modification of the credit agreement.\u201d Certainly, the Act bars using oral agreements to prove a contract modification in a suit to enforce the modified contract. \u201cModification,\u201d however, contemplates that there is something that is to be modified. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1095 (9th ed.2009) (defining \u201cmodification\u201d as a \u201cchange to <em>something </em>[.]\u201d) (emphasis added). If the claim is that a party\u2019s tortious conduct prevented the contract from ever forming at the outset, then there is simply nothing to enforce, and the Act does not apply. Accordingly, the Act would not bar a claim that a bank\u2019s tortious conduct rendered the original commercial loan void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">I respectfully dissent from the majority on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">As the Circuit Court\u2019s analysis of the Peases\u2019 tort claims was overshadowed by its belief that the Maryland Credit Agreement Act categorically precluded the court from opening the confessed judgment, I believe that a more careful examination of that Act is key to this appeal. This Court has never before interpreted Maryland\u2019s Credit Agreement Act. As with any statute, the general principles of interpretation apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules. We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions, and our analysis ends. If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the language is not clear when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><em>People\u2019s Ins. Counsel Div. v. Allstate Ins.

It precludes a credit agreement from being enforceable \u201cby way of action or defense unless it: (1) Is in writing; (2) Expresses consideration; (3) Sets forth the relevant terms and conditions of the agreement; and (4) Is signed by the person against whom its enforcement is sought.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-408(b). Under the Act, a credit agreement \u201cmeans a covenant, promise, undertaking, commitment, or other agreement by a financial institution to: 1. Lend money; 2. Forbear from repayment of money, goods, or things in action; 3. Forbear from collecting or exercising any right to collect a debt; or 4. Otherwise extend credit.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-408(a)(2)(i). The term \u201ccredit agreement\u201d also \u201cincludes agreeing to take or to not take certain actions by a financial institution in connection with an existing or prospective credit agreement.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-408(a)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>According to the plain meaning of the Act, neither a commercial lender nor a commercial borrower may attempt to enforce an oral promise in an action on the contract. This bar includes any oral agreement to take or to not take certain actions in connection with an existing or prospective credit agreement. Thus, the Peases will not succeed in any claim that the promises made by Martin or Wachovia to forbear enforcing their judgment lien on the Peases\u2019s home constituted a modification of the terms of the commercial loan. The issue that is not so clear, however, is whether the statutory bar against using these oral promises in defense of a contract enforcement suit will bar their use in all other causes of action\u2014such as the fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence claims that the Peases assert as set-offs, to the confessed judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In examining this question, I see cases interpreting Maryland\u2019s general statute of frauds as apt guides. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 5-901. Indeed, legislative history reveals that the General Assembly enacted the Maryland Credit Agreement Act with the \u201cintent ... to establish a statute of frauds ... [for] certain credit agreements made by financial institutions.... \u201d Floor Report, <em>supra. </em>Like the Act, CJP Section 5-901 requires that certain promises must be \u201cin writing and signed by the party to be charged\u201d to be enforceable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The statute of frauds applies to any guaranty, agreement made on consideration of marriage, or agreement that cannot be performed within one year from the making of the promise. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 5-901.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In interpreting this general statute of frauds, we have drawn a distinction between actions in contract and those in tort, explaining that \u201ccontracts which are voidable by reason of the statute of frauds ... can still afford a basis for a tort action____\u201d <em>Daugherty v. Kessler, </em>264 Md. 281, 286, 286 A.2d 95, 98 (1972) (quotation marks and citation omitted). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>properly articulated by the CSA, \u201cthe statute of frauds does not bar a tort suit for either fraud or negligent misrepresentation because those counts are not based \u2018on ... [the] contract\u2019 between the parties but are based on misrepresentations that induced the contract.\u201d <em>Greenfield v. Heckenbach, </em>144 Md. App. 108, 140, 797 A.2d 68, 82 (2002) <em>(citing </em>73 Am.Jur.2d <em>Statute of Frauds </em>\u00a7 492 (2001) (\u201ctortfeasors and fraudulent intermeddlers will not be permitted to use the statute of frauds as a defense to a wrongful act or as a means of consummating a fraudulent design.\u201d)). Although not the only basis for my decision, this Court\u2019s previous treatment of our general statute of frauds lends support to a more narrow interpretation of the Maryland Credit Agreement Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Other states have also likened their credit agreement statutes to their general statutes of frauds, and on that basis reasoned that oral promises made in the context of a credit agreement could support tort claims. In Missouri, a credit agreement is an \u201cagreement to lend or forbear repayment of money, to otherwise extend credit, or to make any financial accommodation\u201d and a \u201cdebtor may not maintain an action upon or defense to a credit agreement unless the credit agreement is in writing----\u201d Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 432.045 (2009). When debtors alleged that a lender had conspired to fraudulently induce them into defaulting on their loan by making promises to remove liens on another property, the Missouri Court of Appeals held that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the lender based upon an erroneous belief that Missouri\u2019s credit agreement statute barred the debtors\u2019 claims. <em>See Mika v. Cent. Bank of Kansas City, </em>112 S.W.3d 82, 90 (Mo.Ct.App.2003). The court explained that a fraud exception to the general statute of frauds had existed for over one hundred years in that state, and that there was nothing in the express language or the legislative history of the statute to indicate that the legislature intended a different rule to be applied to credit agreements. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court reasoned, it would work a \u201cgross injustice\u201d to allow the \u201capplication of the bar [to] itself work[ ] a fraud[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Likewise, the Oklahoma Supreme Court has ruled that \u201c[sjtatutes of frauds are enacted to prevent frauds not to perpetrate them. Such statutes are not intended to be used as shield or breastwork for a wrongdoer.\u201d <em>Brown v. Founders Bank and Trust Co., </em>890 P.2d 855, 868 (Okla.1994). In <em>Brown, </em>the court held that Oklahoma\u2019s credit agreement statute did not bar a debtor\u2019s claim of fraud where the bank that provided the debtor\u2019s SBA loan dictated the location of the debtor\u2019s prospective construction project but did not disclose that it owned the land targeted for development. <em>Id. </em>at 859, 863. The Oklahoma credit agreement statute provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">No lender or borrower may maintain an action to enforce or seek damages for the breach of any term or condition of credit agreement ... unless such term or condition has been agreed to in writing and signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced or against whom damages are sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Okla. Stat. tit. 15, \u00a7 140(B) (2010).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The same conclusion was reached in Connecticut, whose statute of frauds provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">(a) No civil action may be maintained in the following cases unless the agreement, or a memorandum of the agreement, is made in writing and signed by the party, or the agent of the party, to be charged: ... (6) upon any agreement for a loan in an amount which exceeds fifty thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ2d\">Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-550(a)(6) (2010). In <em>Union Trust Company v. Jackson, </em>42 Conn.App. 413, 679 A.2d 421, 425 (1996), the Connecticut Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of a lender because the borrowers had presented evidence to create an issue of material fact regarding part performance, a common law exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>to the statute of frauds. Texas also joins this trend. Its statute provides that a \u201cloan agreement[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] in which the amount involved in the loan agreement exceeds $50,000 in value is not enforceable unless the agreement is in writing and signed by the party to be bound or by that party\u2019s authorized representative.\u201d Tex. Bus. &amp; Com.Code Ann. \u00a7 26.02(b) (2009). In <em>1001 McKinney Limited v. Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Capital, </em>192 S.W.3d 20, 29-30 (Tex.App.2005), the Court of Appeals held that Texas\u2019s credit agreement statute of frauds did not bar actions sounding in tort, including common law fraud, and thus grant of summary judgment on that issue in favor of the creditor was improper.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>all states embrace the reasoning of these cases,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>1 think this is the better-reasoned interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In still other states, legislatures have included more far-reaching language in their credit agreement statutes, which the courts have interpreted as barring all actions in tort related to unenforceable agreements. For example, Colorado\u2019s credit agreement statute precludes a debtor or a creditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>from \u201cfil[ing] or maintaining] an action or a claim <em>relating to </em>a credit agreement involving a principal amount in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars unless the credit agreement is in writing and is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 38-10-124(2) (2010) (emphasis added). Thus, in <em>Hewitt v. Pitkin County Bank &amp; Trust Company, </em>931 P.2d 456, 459 (Colo.App.1995), the Colorado Court of Appeals held that Colorado\u2019s credit agreement statute barred debtor\u2019s numerous tort claims because that state\u2019s legislature intended borrowers and lenders to \u201cput it in writing,\u201d to ensure the enforceability of any claims they may have in the future. The Illinois credit agreement statute also contains the same expansive language: \u201cA debtor may not maintain an action on or in any way <em>related to </em>a credit agreement unless the credit agreement is in writing .... \u201d \u00a7 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 160/2 (2010) (emphasis added). There, the intermediate appellate court interpreted the \u201crelated to\u201d language to be a clear bar to actions based on the common law exceptions to that state\u2019s statute of frauds, including promissory estoppel and fraud. <em>See Klem v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>275 Ill.App.3d 64, 211 Ill.Dec. 828, 655 N.E.2d 1211, 1212-13 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Additionally, when the American Bar Association\u2019s (\u201cABA\u201d) Task Force on Lender Liability Limitation Amendments to State Statutes of Frauds drafted its own model credit agreement statute, it chose language that expressly prohibited any \u201caction for legal or equitable relief____\u201d John L. Culhane, Jr. &amp; Dean C. Gramlich, <em>Lender Liability Limitation Amendments to State Statutes of Frauds, </em>45 BUS. LAW. 1779, 1792 (1991). It then listed the type of actions forbidden, including \u201cpromissory or equitable estoppel[,]\u201d \u201cpart performance[,]\u201d and \u201cnegligent misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This was done in order to \u201cforeclose \u2018end runs\u2019 under [common law] theories ... [because] experience [told the Task Force] that borrowers [would] seek such relief, and that courts may sometimes afford such relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1797.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Our General Assembly, however, chose not to include words such as \u201crelating to\u201d or specify tort theories as among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>actions prohibited. The Maryland Act merely states that a credit agreement shall not be enforceable if it is not in writing. It contains no language indicating an intent to jettison all actions that rely on oral representations made in a commercial loan setting. If our General Assembly had intended the Credit Agreement Act to preclude tort actions, as did the ABA Task Force and the legislatures of Colorado and Illinois, then it could have drafted language to facilitate that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Timing and context are key to my interpretation\u2014the Act was enacted after the tort exception to the general statute of frauds had already been established. <em>Compare Daugherty, </em>264 Md. at 286, 286 A.2d at 98, <em>with </em>CJP \u00a7 5-408 (Act enacted in 1989, seventeen years after this Court\u2019s decision refusing to interpret the general Statute of Frauds as barring oral statements supporting tort actions). When analyzing a statute, \u201cwe presume that the Legislature has acted with full knowledge of prior and existing law, legislation and policy!.]\u201d <em>Taylor v. Mandel, </em>402 Md. 109, 131, 935 A.2d 671, 684 (2007). The General Assembly\u2019s decision not to word the Credit Agreement Act more broadly than the general statute of frauds is an indication that it did not intend for the Act to be interpreted differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The legislative history of the Act is also instructive. The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, in its analysis of House Bill 74 (the genesis of CJP Section 5-408) explained that this legislation \u201cwill protect lenders against claims that the lender made a verbal promise to loan money and then refused to do so, or that the lender verbally agreed to extend the terms of a loan.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, H.D. 704, 1989 General Assembly of Maryland Floor Report. Notes attached to that bill explain: \u201cAll this legislation is saying is that in a commercial setting, if you are going to sue me to enforce an alleged loan agreement, get it in writing and get it signed.\u201d <em>See </em>Bill File, H.D. 704, 1989 Gen. Assem., 399th Sess. (1989).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This legislative history indicates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>thrust of the Act was to preclude claims seeking to enforce an oral contract to lend or modify the terms of a loan, which is not the type of claim advanced by the Peases. The Act contains no suggestion that a broader bar, which would apply to tort claims, was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The Credit Agreement Act precludes admission of verbal representations made by Martin and/or Wachovia as support for a claim or defense on the contract. I would hold that the Act does not bar proof of the elements of a tort\u2014distinct from a contract claim or defense\u2014such as the duty of care required in negligence, or the specific intent to defraud required in fraudulent misrepresentation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is no mere distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>without a difference. The torts of negligence<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and breach of fiduciary duty<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> require a showing of a duty owed to the debtor. In ordinary loan transactions, the relationship between a debtor and a creditor is a contractual one, and is not fiduciary in nature. <em>See Parker v. Columbia Bank, </em>91 Md. App. 346, 368, 604 A.2d 521, 532 (1992). To sustain an action sounding in tort, the complaining party must prove \u201ca duty or obligation imposed by law independent of that arising out of the contract itself!'.]\u201d <em>Heckrotte v. Riddle, </em>224 Md. 591, 595, 168 A.2d 879, 882 (1961). The rigorous proof requirements of these and other torts will insure that neither borrowers nor would-be borrowers can evade the restrictions of the Act by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>simply adding a' new label to their claims or defenses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Accordingly, here, to prove a claim in negligence the Peases would have to prove that Wachovia owed a duty to them more extensive than the mere obligation of good faith dealing implied in every contract. <em>See Clancy v. King, </em>405 Md. 541, 565, 954 A.2d 1092, 1106 (2008) (\u201cEven if [a] contract [does] not contain this general good faith term, Maryland contract law implies such an obligation\u201d). Arguably, an even greater burden of proof lies in the tort of fraud, where the Peases would have to show that the bank actually had the intent to defraud.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Parker, </em>91 Md.App. at 359, 604 A.2d at 527. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>These requirements are not insignificant hurdles for the Peas-es to overcome. I am confident that adopting this holding will not expose lenders, such as Wachovia, to an excessive amount of tort litigation or judgments based on oral representations made during the commercial lending process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Accordingly, like the majority, I would remand the case to the trial court so that it may determine whether the Peases can allege a potentially meritorious tort defense that is sufficient to open, modify, or vacate the confessed judgments against them. I confess that I am somewhat skeptical of the Peases\u2019s ability to do this on the facts as currently contained within their complaint. Nevertheless, with more discovery, they may be able to better develop the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge MURPHY authorize me to state that they join in the views expressed in this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-5\">. The Peases do not argue in their briefs that the loan was void <em>ab initio, </em>mentioning the phrase in their brief only as part of their review of what they filed in the Circuit Court. At oral argument, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">Judge Murphy: [How does this case] play into the line of cases that say when there is a motion to reopen we apply a pretty liberal standard to allowing a hearing on the merits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">Counsel for Peases: Correct your honor, the line of cases indicates that confess judgments are freely opened upon a showing of a meritorious defense. A meritorious defense is described in <em>[Nils, LLC v. Antezana, </em>171 Md.App. 717, 912 A.2d 45,] a defense that challenges the execution of the loan or the amount due under the note. We challenged that the loan that was executed, through the negligence or through fraud, was improperly created and therefore could either be void <em>ab initio </em>or as a setoff. In the event of a set-off, courts have stated that set-off is a meritorious defense. It is required under the Rule 6-11(c) that by motion of the defendant ... shall state a legal and factual basis for defense of that claim.... The defenses in this case that we claimed ... create a tort defense to the creation of the promissory note.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Presumably the majority relies on counsel's mention of the term as the justification for reaching the issue, even though it is not argued in the Peases\u2019 briefs.

The Peases may also encounter problems with a \u201cvoidable\u201d theory, because they would seek to void a loan agreement where they had already received the money. We have previously recognized the restitution obligation of a party seeking rescission. <em>See, e.g., Lazorcak v. Feuerstein, </em>273 Md. 69, 75-77, 327 A.2d 477, 481-482 (1974) (\u201c[T]he party seeking rescission must indicate to the other party at least the intent to restore the parties to the relative positions which they would have occupied if no such contract had ever been made[.]\u201d) The court will relax the restoration requirement, but only in limited circumstances. <em>See Funger v. Mayor of Somerset, </em>244 Md. 141, 151, 223 A.2d 168, 174 (1966) (listing seven situations in which rescission without restoration is appropriate). Under these standards, the Peases would presumably still have to account for the money they received if the contract were voided.

There, the borrower alleged that the bank made representations that it would waive its prepayment penalty, leading the borrower to pay off the loan earlier than originally contracted. <em>Id. </em>at 69.

Some states have interpreted their credit agreement statutes to bar actions, counterclaims or cross claims, but not affirmative defenses.

In <em>Hibernia National Bank v.

One year later, however, the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to allow a debtor's claims for negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty because La.Rev.Stat. Ann. Section 6:1122 \"precludefd] all actions for damages arising from oral credit agreements, regardless of the legal theory of recovery asserted.\u201d <em>Jesco Construction Corp. v. NationsBank Corp., </em>830 So.2d 989, 992 (La.2002). Florida\u2019s intermediate appellate court has similarly interpreted Section 687.0304 of the Florida Code to forbid counterclaims such as breach of an oral agreement, <em>Metro Building Materials Corporation v. Republic National Bank of Miami, </em>919 So.2d 595 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006), but not affirmative defenses such as waiver, estoppel and bad faith, <em>Brenowitz v.

On the other hand, Minnesota courts deem Section 513.33 of the Minnesota Code to be a bar to the affirmative defenses of \"unilateral and mutual mistake, no meeting of the minds, and contract modification,\u201d which sound in contract. <em>BankCherokee v.

As a result, the bank withdrew the financing proposal. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 684 A.2d at 35. ST Systems filed a complaint against Maryland National Bank alleging breach of contract and various tort claims based on the bank\u2019s conduct during the loan negotiations, including fraud in the inducement and breach of fiduciary duty. <em>Id. </em>The CSA affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of ST Systems's tort claims because it interpreted the Maryland Credit Agreement Act as excluding all tort claims based on an unenforceable alleged agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 32, 684 A.2d at 38.
