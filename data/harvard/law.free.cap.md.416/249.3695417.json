Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 252, 674 A.2d 106, 123 (1996) (\u201c[T]he statute of limitations is ... \u2018suspended\u2019 by statutes, such as the ones tolling the period for ... insolvency, <em>see </em>C.J. \u00a7 5-202.... \u201d). Dr. Ahmed M. Ali\u2014a defaulting lessee of medical equipment from an entity related to CIT Technology Financing Services, Inc. (\u201cCIT\u201d)\u2014appeals from a judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, which determined that Ali owed CIT $212,703.80, inclusive of prejudgment interest. Both the Circuit Court and the intermediate appellate court (in Ali\u2019s subsequent appeal) held that, despite CIT\u2019s failure to file its claim within the generally applicable three-year statute of limitations, as prescribed in Md.Code (1974, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>2006 RepLVol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-101,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the filing was timely nevertheless, as Ali\u2019s filing of a Chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland constituted a \u201cpetition in insolvency\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5-202, which tolled the statute of limitations for a period of time sufficient to bring the filing within \u00a7 5-101\u2019s three-year limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Ali claims here, as he did in each court in this litigation, essentially that a federal bankruptcy petition is not a \u201cpetition in insolvency,\u201d considering that the Maryland Legislature did not designate these terms expressly as synonymous, even as it recodified repeatedly the tolling provision over a period of time during which federal bankruptcy proceedings were proliferating nationally and in Maryland. As such, Dr. Ali claims that \u00a7 5-202 did not operate to toll the three-year limit, and thus CIT\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limitations. In response, CIT argues that the Legislature\u2019s frequent recodifications of \u00a7 5-202 during the 19th and 20th centuries\u2014a time period during which bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings, for the most part, were shifting from the state to the federal arena\u2014evinces a clear legislative intent to include the filing of a federal bankruptcy petition within the meaning of \u201cpetition in insolvency,\u201d as used in \u00a7 5-202. We hold, as explained more fully <em>infra, </em>that the plain meaning of \u00a7 5-202, confirmed by its legislative history and legislative purpose, supports the conclusion of the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals that a federal bankruptcy petition constitutes a \u201cpetition in insolvency,\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 5-202. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In a 17 June 1997 lease, CIT\u2019s predecessor leased medical equipment to Dr. Ali (Petitioner or \u201cDr. Ali\u201d) for a period of sixty months, payable in monthly payments of $3,097.49. Included in the lease was an acceleration clause, providing that, upon Petitioner\u2019s default, CIT could declare all rental payments immediately due and could recover interest and attorneys\u2019 fees in pursuit of the accelerated debt. Roughly midway through the lease period, Petitioner\u2019s medical practice suffered after he broke his hand in a car accident. Petitioner made payments under the lease, however, until April 1999, after which time no further payments were made to CIT. CIT declared Petitioner in default and demanded payment of $158,760.86, the accelerated balance due, on 10 August 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">On 11 June 2001, Dr. Ali filed a Chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland. At that time, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362, an automatic stay of pursuit of CIT\u2019s claim went into effect, meaning that CIT was barred from filing suit against Petitioner for breach of contract. At some point prior to September 2003, CIT filed a motion to be relieved of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\u2019s automatic stay, which the bankruptcy court granted on 4 September 2003. Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy case continued otherwise. On 21 June 2006, allegedly because Petitioner did not comply with bankruptcy procedures in completing an acceptable plan of reorganization, the bankruptcy court dismissed Petitioner\u2019s bankruptcy case pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Approximately six months after the bankruptcy case was dismissed, on 18 January 2007, CIT filed suit in the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Court for Prince George\u2019s County to enforce its rights under the lease, and sought attorneys\u2019 fees, prejudgment interest, post-judgment interest, and costs. Before the Circuit Court, Respondent presented testimony that Petitioner breached the lease and established the amount of damages recoverable. Petitioner did not deny that he breached the lease; rather, he contended (and contends today) that CIT\u2019s suit was barred by \u00a7 5-101\u2019s three-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On 27 May 2008, the Circuit Court entered judgment in favor of CIT for $190,725.85 in damages and $21,977.95 in prejudgment interest. In rejecting Dr. Ali\u2019s claim that CIT\u2019s suit was time-barred, the Circuit Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">Defendant argued that Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint and Amended Complaint are barred by a three-year statute of limitations. MD Code Ann., Courts &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-101. Given the tolling of the statute of limitations by the bankruptcy filing, the Complaint was timely filed. <em>(See </em>MD Code Ann., Courts &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-202,11 U.S.C. 108(c)(1)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Dr. Ali appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, <em>Ali v. CIT Tech. Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>188 Md.App. 269, 981 A.2d 759 (2009), undertook a lengthy and impressive survey of the history of state insolvency laws and federal bankruptcy law. <em>See Ali </em>188 Md.App. at 277-85, 981 A.2d at 764-68. In affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court, the Court of Special Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">State laws that interact with federal bankruptcy law define the term insolvency and its variants for state law purposes. Those definitions include, either explicitly or implicitly, insolvency for purposes of bankruptcy under federal bankruptcy law. For example, [the Commercial Law Article] defines \u201cinsolvency proceedings\u201d as \u201cany assignment for the benefit of creditors or other proceedings intended to liqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>date or rehabilitate the estate of the <em>person </em>involved.\u201d Bankruptcy certainly is a proceeding intended to liquidate or rehabilitate the debtor\u2019s estate. Additionally, [the Commercial Law Article] defines \u201cinsolvent\u201d as \u201c[a] person ... who either has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business or cannot pay his debts as they become due or is insolvent within the meaning of the federal bankruptcy law.\u201d Title 15 of the Commercial Law Article addresses aspects of debt collection. Section 15-101, which addresses preferences in proceedings involving an assignment for the benefit of creditors or receiverships, uses bankruptcy terms, including insolvency and void and voidable preferences, all as defined in the bankruptcy code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">If the General Assembly had intended there be no tolling provision, it would have repealed the statute. Instead, unlike almost all of Art. 47, CJP \u00a7 5-202 and its predecessors, it survived many legislative sessions and many code revisions, including code revisions in 1939, 1951, 1957, and the more recent codification of CJP. By reenacting the statute and not changing its substance on multiple occasions, we can presume that the General Assembly intended that it remain in effect. Federal bankruptcy law has expanded to include not only traditional bankruptcy but also traditional insolvency proceedings. Moreover, and very relevant to our analysis, is that the policy behind CJP \u00a7 5-202 appears to be applicable to bankruptcies. We conclude that the General Assembly, by retaining and reenacting the statute in question, even though it repealed the State insolvency laws, intended CJP \u00a7 5-202 to include bankruptcy proceedings. If the General Assembly did not so intend, it can amend or repeal the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><em>Ali, </em>188 Md.App. at 285-87, 981 A.2d at 768-69. (internal citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Dr. Ali filed timely a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, which we granted, <em>Ali v. CIT Tech., </em>412 Md. 255, 987 A.2d 16 (2010), to consider \u201cwhether the lower court erred when it upheld the trial court\u2019s decision which held that the statute of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>on respondent\u2019s claim had not expired at the time the instant complaint was filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqO\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">There is no material factual dispute in this case. The arguments before this Court center on the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that Petitioner\u2019s filing of a bankruptcy petition fell under the ambit of \u00a7 5-202, thus tolling the statute of limitations. It is well settled that \u201cwhere an order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, our Court must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a [non-deferential] standard of review.\u201d <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175, 184 (2006); <em>see Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>413 Md. 606, 618, 994 A.2d 411, 418 (2010); <em>Walter v.

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">In Maryland, the general rule is that \u201c[a] civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues .... \u201d Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5-101. This statute of limitations \u201creflects a legislative judgment of what is deemed an adequate period of time in which \u2018a person of ordinary diligence\u2019 should bring his action.\u201d <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Christensen, </em>394 Md. 227, 240, 905 A.2d 340, 348 (2006) (quoting <em>Walko Corp. v. Burger Chef Sys., Inc., </em>281 Md. 207, 215, 378 A.2d 1100, 1104 (1977)); <em>see Doughty v. Prettyman, </em>219 Md. 83, 92-93, 148 A.2d 438, 443 (1959) (quoting <em>Order of R.R. Telegraphers v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc., </em>321 U.S. 342, 349, 64 S.Ct. 582, 586, 88 L.Ed. 788, 792 (1944)) (\u201c[T]he primary consideration underlying statutes of limitations is one of fairness to the defendant; that he ought not to be called on to resist a claim when \u2018evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.\u2019 \u201d); <em>McMahan v. Dor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>chester Fertilizer Co., </em>184 Md. 155, 159-60, 40 A.2d 313, 315 (1944) (\u201cStatutes of limitations ... rest upon sound public policy, for they are enacted to afford protection against stale claims after a lapse of time which ought to be sufficient for a person of ordinary diligence, and after which the defendant might be placed at a disadvantage by reason of long delay.\u201d). Realizing, however, that a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach does not always serve to further the policies underlying the three-year limit, the Legislature enacted numerous exceptions to \u00a7 5-101\u2019s three-year statute of limitations. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5-102 (specialties); 5-105 (assault, libel, or slander); 5-116 (breast implants). Further, the Legislature, aware that certain predicaments may arise before or during the pendency of the three-year limitations period that could prevent a plaintiff from filing his or her claim, enacted various tolling provisions that operate to \u201cinterrupt[ ] the running of a statute of limitations in certain situations____\u201d <em>Turner v. Right, </em>406 Md. 167, 181, 957 A.2d 984, 992 (2008) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1525 (8th ed.2004)); <em>see Mason v. Bd. of Educ. of Baltimore County, </em>375 Md. 504, 521, 826 A.2d 433, 443 (2003) (Eldridge, J., dissenting) (\u201c[UJnlike a statute of limitations which principally benefits the defendant by delimiting a definite period of time, a tolling statute is enacted solely for the benefit of the plaintiff.\u201d). One such tolling provision, \u00a7 5-202, is at issue in the present case. Before analyzing \u00a7 5-202, however, a brief consideration of the tolling provision\u2019s connection with federal bankruptcy law is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">a [bankruptcy] petition ... operates as a stay, applicable to all entities, of\u2014(1) the commencement or continuation ..., of a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case[,] ... or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">With no protective mechanism, however, \u201ca petition in bankruptcy could sometimes give a debtor unfair advantage over a claimant by allowing the debtor to remain under the protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>tion of the automatic stay until the limitation period ... had <em>expired....\u201d In re Morton, </em>866 F.2d 561, 566 (2d Cir.1989); <em>see Meyer v. Cunningham, </em>196 Ark. 1097, 121 S.W.2d 90 (1938) (holding a claimant\u2019s claim to be barred by the statute of limitations, as the statute of limitations was not tolled during the automatic stay imposed by the bankruptcy proceedings). As such, in 1978, Congress passed what is codified now as 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">[I]f applicable nonbankruptcy law ... fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action in a court other than in bankruptcy court on a claim against the debtor, ... and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, then such period does not expire until the latter of\u2014(1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; or (2) 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the stay....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">That is, \u201c[fjederal law assured the plaintiffs 30 days in which to pick up the baton; if states want to give plaintiffs additional time, that is their business.\u201d <em>Pettibone Corp. v. Easley, </em>935 F.2d 120, 121 (7th Cir.1991). It is at this point that Md.Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-202 becomes relevant, as the Maryland Legislature has made it its business to give plaintiffs additional time.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Section 5-202 provides: \u201c[i]f a debtor files a petition in insolvency which is later dismissed, the time between the filing and the dismissal is not included in determining whether a claim against the debtor is barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d The issue before this Court is whether Dr. Ali\u2019s (or anyone\u2019s) federal bankruptcy petition constitutes a \u201cpetition in insolvency.\u201d Petitioner contends that the Legislature could not have intended a federal bankruptcy petition to constitute a \u201cpetition in insolvency,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5-202, as no federal bankruptcy procedures were authorized in 1814\u2014when the tolling provision was first enacted\u2014and because the Legislature failed over the ensuing years to designate expressly those terms as synonymous, even as it continued to recodify the provision during times in which bankruptcy and insolvency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>matters were moving increasingly from the state fora to the federal arena. Respondent, however, spins the same rationale differently, contending that the Legislature\u2019s repeated recodification of the tolling provision, during the time when federal bankruptcy practice burgeoned, evinces its intent for the state provision to apply to federal bankruptcy petitions. Simply put, CIT claims that \u00a7 5-202 operated to toll the statute of limitations for a period of time sufficient to make CIT\u2019s claim against Petitioner timely; if it did not, CIT\u2019s claim was untimely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order to determine which party\u2019s vision, if either, of \u00a7 5-202 prevails, we engage in one of \u201cthe principal functions which courts were created to perform\u201d: resolution of disputes concerning statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Mangum v. Md. State Bd. of Censors, </em>273 Md. 176, 192, 328 A.2d 283, 292 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The ultimate goal in construing and applying a statute is to \u201cdiscern the actual intent of the [Legislature in enacting it.\u201d <em>Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 443-44, 903 A.2d 388, 395 (2006). When the Court can ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the verbiage, the Court need not delve deeper. <em>See Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Danner, </em>388 Md. 649, 659, 882 A.2d 271, 277 (2005) (quoting <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998)) (\u201cWhen the plain meaning is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with the broad purposes of the legislation and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry ordinarily is at an end\u201d). Notwithstanding the outcome of a plain-meaning analysis, however, \u201c[i]n the interest of completeness ... we may look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.\u201d <em>Kramer v.

Plain meaning of \u00a7 5-202</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">This is the Court\u2019s first opportunity to construe the phrase \u201cpetition in insolvency.\u201d This language underwent a series of cosmetic enhancements over the two centuries since the original enactment of the tolling provision. In 1814\u2014the tolling provision\u2019s inception\u2014the statute provided that \u201cthe time intervening between the petitioning of any of <em>said debtors </em>and the time that any of said petitions may be dismissed, shall not be computed on any plea of limitation.... \u201d Chapter 122, \u00a7 3 of the Acts of 1814 (emphasis added). The use of the adjective \u201csaid\u201d refers to Chapter 122, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1814, which provided, \u201c[t]hat no petition for the benefit of the original act for the benefit of sundry <em>insolvent debtors\u201d; </em>thus, even at its inception, the tolling provision was triggered by the filing of the functional equivalent of a \u201cpetition in insolvency.\u201d The language underwent its first change when appearing in the Maryland Code of 1860. This codification changed the word \u201csaid\u201d to \u201cinsolvent,\u201d but did not change the substantive meaning of the tolling provision. <em>See </em>Maryland Code of 1860, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Art. 57, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1973, the Legislature recodified Art. 57 \u00a7 9 as \u00a7 5-202 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, where the tolling provision remains.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Regarding the numerous recodifications of the statute in question,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">[r]ecodification of statutes is presumed to be for the purpose of clarity rather than change of meaning and, thus, even a change in the phraseology of a statute by a codification will not ordinarily modify the law unless the change is so radical and material that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law appears unmistakably from the language of the code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><em>Allen v.

Considering that, \u201cwhen the [Legislature acts, it \u2018is presumed to be aware of its own enactments\u2019 \u201d, <em>Md. State Highway Admin. v.

Its silence, however, informs us that the Legislature was content with the definition as codified in the Commercial Law Article.

The next step in our analysis, then, is determining whether the filing of a modern-day federal bankruptcy petition falls within this definition. If so, \u00a7 5-202 operates to toll the statute of limitations; if not, Dr. Ali should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>It seems to us incontrovertible that the filing of a Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy petition is a petition by one in relation to his or her inability to pay off his or her debts in full.

Numerous modern legal dictionaries (i.e. those published after the proliferation of federal bankruptcy proceedings) have included expressly the words \u201cinsolvent\u201d or \u201cinsolvency\u201d when defining \u201cbankruptcy.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em>Rapalje and Lawrence\u2019s Law Dictionary 111 (3rd ed.2002) (Bankruptcy is the \u201cname given to a variety of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, having for their main object the distribution of the property of an insolvent person____\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 156 (8th ed.2004) (\u201cA statutory procedure by which a (usu[ally] insolvent) debtor obtains financial relief____\u201d);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary 123 (3rd ed.1969) (\u201cThe law whereunder an insolvent debtor may bring all his assets ... and have them administered____\u201d); Modern Dictionary for the Legal Profession 75-76 (3d ed.1996) (\u201cBusiness or personal insolvency regulated by federal law....\u201d). Simply put, people who are able to pay off their debts in full do not file for bankruptcy because they will receive no relief. <em>See </em>Emily Kadens, <em>The Last Bankrupt Hanged: Balancing Incentives in the Development of Bankruptcy Law, </em>59 Duke L.J. 1229, 1232 (2010) (\u201cIn modern bankruptcy ... th[e] assistance has come to be viewed as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tradeoff that the debtor makes to be freed of the burden of unpayable debts.\u201d). Therefore, modern-day bankruptcy proceedings are understood commonly as those instituted by insolvents relating to allegedly unpayable debts, thus falling squarely within \u00a7 5-202\u2019s definition of \u201cpetition in insolvency.\u201d As such, a plain-meaning analysis of the phrase \u201cpetition in insolvency\u201d compels the conclusion that the filing of a federal bankruptcy petition operates to toll Maryland\u2019s generally-applicable three-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">B.

A survey of the statutory context and legislative purpose underlying \u00a7 5-202 ratifies and confirms our conclusion that the filing of a federal bankruptcy petition constitutes a \u201cpetition in insolvency.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>At one time, the terms \u201cbankruptcy\u201d and \u201cinsolvency\u201d referred to two entirely different systems of debt liquidation. <em>See Ali v.

At the time our relevant tolling provision was enacted, however, \u201cthere was no clear line of demarcation between bankruptcy and insolvency as there had been in England.\u201d <em>Ali, </em>188 Md.App. at 278, 981 A.2d at 764; <em>see Cont'l Ill.

Therefore, the Legislature presumably intended for \u00a7 5-202 to apply to what was once segmented into \u201cbankruptcy\u201d and \u201cinsolvency\u201d proceedings, and to what is now predominantly under the purview of federal bankruptcy law. <em>See </em>Francis Hillard, A Treatise on the Law op Bankruptcy and Insolvency 14 (2d ed.2003) (\u201cThese State [insolvency] laws were apparently coextensive, in all their purposes and effects, with a general bankruptcy law.\u201d). Of course, if federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>bankruptcy law does not cover currently what was swept up formerly in Maryland\u2019s insolvency laws, there would have been no reason to repeal most of our state insolvency laws on the grounds of preemption. <em>See </em>Revisor\u2019s Note to Chapter 49, \u00a7 3 of the Acts of 1975; <em>Stellwagen v. Clum, </em>245 U.S. 605, 613, 38 S.Ct. 215, 217, 62 L.Ed. 507, 511 (1918) (\u201c[S]tate laws are suspended ... to the extent of actual conflict with the system provided by the Bankruptcy Act of Congress____\u201d). Thus, it is clear that, in 1814, at \u00a7 5-202\u2019s predecessor\u2019s inception, the Maryland Legislature intended the tolling provision to apply to what is now covered by federal bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See Kindley v. Governor of Md., </em>289 Md. 620, 625, 426 A.2d 908, 911 (1981) (noting that \u201claws are addressed to the future,\u201d and, as such, \u201c[w]here ... a statute is phrased in broad general terms, it suggests that the Legislature intended that the provision to be capable of encompassing circumstances and situations which did not exist at the time of the enactment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Also buttressing the conclusion that a federal bankruptcy petition is a \u201cpetition in insolvency\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5-202 is the fact that Petitioner\u2019s reading of the tolling provision\u2014if we were to favor it\u2014would undermine the legislative purpose in enacting (and recodifying) the provision. We agree with the intermediate appellate court that, like 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108, Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 5-202 was enacted \u201cto address the public\u2019s complaint that debtors manipulated the bankruptcy and insolvency processes to avoid paying creditors by entering bankruptcy, waiting for the statute of limitations to expire, and subsequently dismissing the bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d <em>Ali, </em>188 Md.App. at 283-84, 981 A.2d at 767; <em>see </em>John L.

Because the Legislature has repealed most of Maryland\u2019s insolvency laws, if \u00a7 5-202 is read to only apply to state insolvency laws (or their scant remains), the tolling provision\u2014reenacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>and/or recodified in 1814, 1860, and 1973\u2014and its accompanying policies preventing debtor abuse, would be rendered largely meaningless. Accordingly, we refuse to give \u00a7 5-202 such a reading. <em>See Blake v.

Pulsifer, </em>749 A.2d 153 (Me.2000). In <em>Pulsifer, </em>the City of Saco assessed nearly $20,000 in property taxes on Pulsifer\u2019s property over a two-year period. <em>Pulsifer, </em>749 A.2d at 154. Thereafter, Pulsifer filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maine, at which time 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)\u2019s automatic stay took effect. <em>Id. </em>Because the City did not protect its interest by filing a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court, it did not receive a distribution pursuant to the order discharging Pulsifer\u2019s prebankruptcy debts. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the City filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking payment of the property taxes, which the court dismissed. <em>Id. </em>The Superior Court held that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations, explaining that 14 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 866 (2009)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\u2014argued here by Petitioner to be \u00a7 5-202\u2019s Maine analog, and which tolls the statute of limitations during \u201cthe time of the pendency of his insolvency proceedings\u201d\u2014did not apply to toll the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>The Maine Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal ultimately, explaining that there exists no \u201cauthority for importing modern language and modern concepts into this century-old piece of legislation.\u201d <em>Pulsifer, </em>749 A.2d at 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">To the extent that <em>Pulsifer </em>is on point, of course, we are not bound by its holding or its rationale, and would reject its reasoning, if it came to that. <em>See Bozman v. Bozman, </em>376 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Md. 461, 490, 830 A.2d 450, 467 (2003) (\u201c[Decisions of our sister jurisdictions are not binding on this Court and ought not dictate the course of jurisprudence in the State of Maryland.\u201d). There are, however, a few poignant differences between the Maine statute and the one in the present case. For one, the court in <em>Pulsifer </em>noted that its tolling provision only applies when: \u201c(1) a creditor with a claim against the debtor has \u2018proven\u2019 that his debts are recoverable, and (2) the debtor has been \u2018adjudged an insolvent debtor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pulsifer, </em>749 A.2d at 155. Noting that there were no such requirements under the current federal system, the court in <em>Pulsifer </em>adjudged Maine\u2019s tolling provision was inconsistent with federal bankruptcy law. <em>See id. </em>In Maryland, however, neither proving recoverable debts nor being adjudged insolvent are prerequisites to the application of \u00a7 5-202, and, in this sense, our tolling provision is entirely consistent with federal bankruptcy law. Furthermore, the court in <em>Pulsifer </em>noted that it was left with no guidance as to the tolling period; that is, it was \u201cleft to speculate at whether the statute should be tolled during the entire proceeding, or just during the automatic stay, while creditors\u2019 rights to sue are actually hindered.\u201d <em>Pulsifer, </em>749 A.2d at 156. The Maryland statute, however, is entirely clear; the tolling period commences upon the filing of the petition, and it is terminated at the dismissal of that petition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-202. That is, \u201c[ujnlike the Maine statute, we can apply our statute without rewriting it.\u201d <em>Ali, </em>188 Md.App. at 289, 981 A.2d at 771. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Pulsifer </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">For the reasons stated, we conclude that the plain-meaning, legislative history, and the legislative purpose of \u00a7 5-202 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article mandate the conclusion that a federal bankruptcy petition constitutes a \u201cpetition in insolvency.\u201d Therefore, \u00a7 5-202 operated to toll any applicable statute of limitations from the time the debtor (Dr. Ali) filed his federal bankruptcy petition until the time that petition was dismissed.

The intermediate appellate court, however, refused to entertain this argument, considering it was not made before the Circuit Court. CIT, having filed no cross-petition for certiorari regarding our colleagues\u2019 declination to reach this contention, and considering our disposition of Ali\u2019s appeal, there is no need for us to consider whether the statute of limitations on a specialty would be applicable to the facts in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b)(1) provides, in pertinent part, that, \"on request of a party in interest, and after notice and a hearing, absent unusual circumstances specifically identified by the court that establish that the requested conversion or dismissal is not in the best interests of creditors and the estate, the court shall convert a case under this chapter ... to a case under Chapter 7 ... or dismiss a case under this chapter, whichever is in the best interests of creditors and the estate, if the movant establishes cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">.

The historical context traced by the intermediate appellate court may be germane to a future case, and so we urge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>interested persons to refer to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in this case for that historical perspective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">. Maine\u2019s tolling provision provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cif a person is adjudged an insolvent debtor after a cause of action has accrued against him, and such cause of action is one provable in insolvency, the time of the pendency of his insolvency proceedings shall not be taken as a part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.\u201d 14 MeRev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 866 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\">. Thus, we disagree with Petitioner\u2019s contention that the statute of limitations began to run again on 3 September 2003, the date on which the automatic stay was lifted. While it is true that, at that point, CIT could have filed suit against Dr. Ali, \u00a7 5-202 is clear that the limitations period is tolled until the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition. Therefore, the limitations period resumed running on 12 July 2006\u2014the date the bankruptcy court dismissed Dr. Ali\u2019s bankruptcy petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
