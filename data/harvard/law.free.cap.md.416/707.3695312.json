In so doing, we are faced with the following questions on certiorari, <em>Hashmi v. Bennett, </em>412 Md. 494, 988 A.2d 1008 (2010), which we have renumbered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>I.

Hashmi, M.D., and The Good Samaritan Hospital of Maryland, Inc., in connection with the death of twenty-seven year old Adrian Tyree Bennett from septic shock. Subsequently, on November 16, 2005, by a First Amended Complaint and Election for Jury Trial, Respondents joined Roman Kostrubiak, M.D. as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The Bennetts asserted that the health care providers failed to diagnose and appropriately treat Adrian\u2019s methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>9. At all times hereinafter set forth, the Defendant, Roman Kostrubiak, M.D., (hereinafter \u201cKostrubiak\u201d) was an agent and/or apparent agent, servant, or employee of Defendants, Emergency Physician Associates, P.C., and The Good Samaritan Hospital of Maryland, Inc.

At all times hereinafter set forth, the Defendant, Shoaib Hashmi, M.D., (hereinafter \u201cHashmi\u201d) was an agent and/or apparent agent, servant, or employee of the Defendant, Good Samaritan Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">11. On or about April 22, 2003, at approximately, 3:15 p.m., twenty-seven year old Adrian Bennett presented to the Good Samaritan Hospital with a chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, generalized weakness and a bump on the head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">14. At or about 7:30 p.m., Defendant, Kostrubiak discharged Adrian from the emergency room and admitted him to the hospital under the service of Defendant, Hashmi. At that time, pneumonia and gastroenteritis were on his differential diagnosis. Defendant Kostrubiak ordered Adrian Bennett to be placed on respiratory isolation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">15. At or about 2:30 a.m., Adrian Bennett was transferred to the medical floor of the hospital. Defendant Hashmi was Adrian\u2019s attending physician at the time. Defendant Hash-mi failed to recognize Adrian\u2019s progressive septic state and treat same on the night of April 22 and through the morning of April 23, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">16. At or about 4:00 a.m. on April 23, Adrian Bennett was administered a dose of Unasyn. On or about 10 a.m. on April 23, Adrian Bennett was administered his first dose of Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">17. Periodically, throughout the early morning hours of April 23, 2003, Adrian was seen by the nurses. During this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>time, Adrian continued to demonstrate signs of progressive sepsis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">18. The nurses called a resident physician, Dr. Sahi, at approximately 4 a.m. concerning Adrian\u2019s then-condition. Dr. Sahi prescribed Ambien in response to the call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">19. The nurses did not call any health care provider from 7:30 p.m. on April 22 until 4 a.m. on April 23.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">20. At or around 9:30 a.m., Adrian received medical attention for his sepsis (from medical physicians) for the first time. By this time, Adrian was suffering from severe septic shock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">21. At or about 12:45 p.m., Adrian Bennett was pronounced dead after several rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">The Bennetts alleged that Dr. Kostrubiak negligently misdiagnosed and mistreated Adrian\u2019s infection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">23. The Defendant, Roman Kostrubiak, M.D., was negligent and careless in the following respects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">a. failed to properly and timely diagnose Adrian Bennett\u2019s infection in the ER;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">b. failed to adequately treat Adrian Bennett\u2019s infection in the ER;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-13\">c. failed to call in appropriate and timely consults;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-14\">d. failed to have Adrian Bennett admitted to the ICU;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-15\">e. failed to order appropriate studies; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-16\">f. was otherwise negligent and careless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">The Bennetts further alleged that Dr. Hashmi breached applicable standards of care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-18\">24. The Defendant, Shoaib Hashmi, M.D. was negligent and careless in the following respects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-19\">a. failed to properly and timely diagnose Adrian Bennett\u2019s septic state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-20\">b. failed to timely and adequately treat Adrian Bennett\u2019s septic state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-21\">c. failed to call in appropriate consults;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>d. failed to timely assess Adrian Bennett;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">e. failed to order appropriate studies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">f. failed to place Adrian Bennett in the ICU; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">g. was otherwise negligent and careless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Finally, the Bennetts alleged that Good Samaritan Hospital failed to timely diagnose and adequately treat Adrian\u2019s infection and sepsis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">25. The Defendant, Good Samaritan Hospital, was negligent and careless in the following respects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">a. failed to timely and adequately monitor and assess Adrian Bennett on the evening of April 22 and throughout the early morning of April 23;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">b. failed to timely call appropriate physicians for medical assistance on April 22 and April 23;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">c. failed to appropriately respond to nursing calls which were made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">d. failed to properly and timely diagnose Adrian Bennett\u2019s infection and septic state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-13\">e. failed to timely and adequately treat Adrian Bennett\u2019s infection and septic state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-14\">f. failed to call in appropriate consults;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-15\">g. failed to order appropriate tests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-16\">h. failed to timely recommend transfer to the critical care unit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-17\">i. failed to timely assess Adrian Bennett; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-18\">j. was otherwise negligent and careless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-19\">Dr. Kostrubiak along with Emergency Physician Associates of Maryland answered, as did Good Samaritan Hospital, generally denying liability, and asserting affirmative defenses including contributory negligence and assumption of risk. Dr. Hashmi also answered, generally denying liability and asserting contributory negligence and assumption of risk as affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>On October 10, 2006, the complaints against Dr. Kostrubiak and Emergency Physician Associates of Maryland, as well as Good Samaritan Hospital, were dismissed with prejudice as a result of separate settlements,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in accordance with Rule 2-506(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Bennetts executed a \u201cJoint Tortfeasor Release,\u201d discharging all claims against Emergency Physician Associates of Maryland and its employee, Dr. Kostrubiak, in exchange for $400,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The Good Samaritan \u201cSettlement Agreement and Release,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at issue in the present case, provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">RECITALS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">A.

The claim was waived out of Health Claims Arbitration and, on or about September 8, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint, Case No. 24-C-05-008202 OT in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (the \u201cComplaint\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>B.

The [tjerm \u201cReleased Party\u201d does not include Shoaib Hashmi, M.D., the non-settling Defendant or any other Defendants who may have entered into separate Settlement Agreements or Releases with the Releasing Parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">SECTION IY</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">\n<em>Other Claims</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">1. If a lawsuit is filed or a claim otherwise made, including claims already made, by the <em>Releasing Parties </em>against any other person, firm, professional association or corporation other than a released party released under this Settlement Agreement, the <em>Releasing Parties </em>hereby irrevocably consent that said claims against any party not released by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Settlement Agreement shall be reduced to the extent of the pro rata shares of the <em>Released Party </em>or the amount paid for this Settlement Agreement, whichever is greater, pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors [sic] Act (codified in Maryland Code Annotated, Cts. &amp; Jud.

(2002 Repl.Vol.)[) ], that such reduction shall occur whether or not any or all of the parties released under this Settlement Agreement are determined to be joint tortfeasors with the parties not so released, and that this Settlement Agreement may be introduced into evidence before any tribunal by any party in order to establish consent to the reduction pursuant to that Act. For purposes of this paragraph, the Released Party shall be deemed to be a Joint Tortfeasor, jointly and severally liable to the Undersigned, to the same extent as if the Released Party has been adjudicated to be a Joint Tortfeasor by a final judgment of a court of record after trial on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Dr. Hashmi, however, did not settle, nor did he file any third-party claim alleging that another party\u2019s negligence contributed to Adrian\u2019s death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During the one-week trial that ensued regarding the claims against him, moreover, Dr. Hash-mi did not implicate any other Good Samaritan Hospital employee or any one else as responsible for Adrian\u2019s allegedly deficient care and subsequent death. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Bennetts, and the verdict sheet provided as follows, regarding Dr. Hashmi\u2019s liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">1. Did Plaintiffs prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Hashmi was negligent in the course of his care of Adrian Bennett?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>YES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">If you answered \u201cNO\u201d to Question 1, STOP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">If you answered \u201cYES\u201d to Question 1, GO TO Question 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">2. Did Plaintiff prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Hashmi\u2019s negligence in the course of his care of Adrian Bennett was a cause of Mr. Bennett\u2019s injuries and death on April 23, 2003?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">YES</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Judgment was entered on the verdict against Dr. Hashmi in the amount of $2,295,000, although he, thereafter, filed a \u201cMotion for Remittitur or to Reduce the Verdict,\u201d asserting that the total verdict exceeded the statutory cap on noneconomic damages established in Section 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1973, 2006 RepLVol.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He also filed a \u201cSupplemental Memorandum in Support of Motion to Reduce Verdict,\u201d claiming entitlement to an additional reduction, pursuant to the Maryland Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In this regard, he asserted that he was entitled to contribution under the Act, not only from Emergency Physician Associates of Maryland and Dr. Kostrubiak, as well as Good Samaritan Hospital, but also from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>\u201c[t]hree distinct actors employed by Good Samaritan Hospital,\u201d namely (1) Dr. Hina Sahi, a hospital resident;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (2) Nurse Kathleen Bosse, a hospital floor nurse;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (3) an unidenti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>fied emergency room nurse, Nurse A.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The Bennetts resisted the reduction by three more \u201cshares\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by countering that the alleged joint tort-feasors, Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A, \u201cwere never named as defendants, never admitted liability to Plaintiffs, and never were found liable to Plaintiffs by a court or jury\u201d and posited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>that the clear and unambiguous language of the Good Samaritan Release contemplated only one joint tort-feasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">After a hearing, Judge Kaye A. Allison reduced the judgment to $1,795,000, pursuant to the statutory cap on noneconomic damages set forth in Section 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. With respect to the issue of increasing the contribution Dr. Hashmi was to receive from the three alleged joint tort-feasors, Judge Allison determined that the $1.7 million verdict would be divided among Emergency Physician Associates along with Dr. Kostrubiak, Good Samaritan Hospital, as well as Dr. Hashmi, for three shares rather than five shares, calculated on the basis of the three Good Samaritan employees, Dr. Kostrubiak along with Emergency Physician Associates, and Dr. Hashmi. Accordingly, judgment was entered against Dr. Hashmi in the amount of $598,333.33, representing his one-third joint tort-feasor share.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Dr. Hashmi appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and our colleagues on the intermediate appellate court affirmed in a reported opinion, <em>Hashmi v. Bennett, </em>188 Md.App. 434, 982 A.2d 818 (2009), reasoning that the language of the Good Samaritan Release clearly and unambiguously identified Good Samaritan Hospital as the joint tort-feasor and that \u201cDr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A, as non-parties to the settlement agreement, could not attain joint tortfeasor status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451, 982 A.2d at 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">When multiple tort-feasors cause harm to an injured party, the issue arises as to whether one of them may be held liable for all of the negligence, or whether each tort-feasor may individually be held responsible in a proportionate or equal manner for the injury. The right of contribution among negligent joint tort-feasors was not recognized at common law, so that a single tort-feasor could bear the entirety of the loss sustained by the injured party. 1 Stuart M. Speiser, Charles F. Krause, <em>&amp; </em>Alfred W. Gans, The American Law of Torts \u00a7 3:15 (2003); <em>see also </em>William L. Prosser, Law of Torts 305-07 (4th ed.1971). The right of \u201ccontribution,\u201d in contrast, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>enables a tort-feasor \u201cto collect from joint tortfeasors when\u2014 and to the extent that\u2014the tortfeasor has paid more than his or her proportionate share to the injured party.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 378 <em>(9th </em>ed.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The common law rule endured criticism for foisting the entire obligation on one tort-feasor, rather than \u201cachieving equal or proportionate distribution of the common burden,\u201d and was abrogated in many states, including Maryland, by the enactment of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1939. Unif. Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act, Prefatory Note, 12 U.L.A. 196 (2008). The Act was developed to promote \u201csome common policy\u201d to legislatively establish contribution among joint tortfeasors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Section 3-1401 of the Act defines \u201cjoint tort-feasors\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">(c) <em>Joint </em>tort-feasors.\u2014\u201cJoint tort-feasors\u201d means two or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Section 3-1402 codifies the right of contribution among joint tort-feasors, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014The right of contribution exists among joint tort-feasors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">(b) <em>Discharge of liability or payment of </em>share.\u2014A joint tort-feasor is not entitled to a money judgment for contribution until the joint tort-feasor has by payment discharged the common liability or has paid more than a pro rata share of the common liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">Section 3-1403 abrogates the prior rule, in which the recovery of a judgment against one joint tort-feasor discharged any other joint tort-feasors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-12\">The recovery of a judgment by the injured person against one joint tort-feasor does not discharge the other joint tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Section 3-1404 describes the effect of a release on nonsettling joint tort-feasors, namely reducing the claim either \u201cin the amount of the consideration paid\u201d or the \u201cproportion by which the release provides\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tort-feasors unless the release so provides, but it reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Section 3-1405 states that a release of one joint tort-feasor may extinguish the right of contribution, so long as the release provides for a reduction in any recovery by the injured party of the pro rata share of the released tort-feasor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor does not relieve the joint tort-feasor from liability to make contribution to another joint tort-feasor unless the release:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">(1) Is given before the right of the other tort-feasor to secure a money judgment for contribution has accrued; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">(2) Provides for a reduction, to the extent of the pro rata share of the released tort-feasor, of the injured person\u2019s damages recoverable against all other tort-feasors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">In the context of these contribution statutory provisions, Dr. Hashmi, not a party to the Good Samaritan Release, claims that the Release language is ambiguous, because it refers to multiple hospital employees and agents in defining \u201cReleased Party\u201d or \u201cReleasee.\u201d As a result, Dr. Hashmi contends that the Release actually refers to three distinct joint tort-feasors, namely Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A. The Bennetts, who were parties to the Release, counter that the Release unambiguously refers to Good Samaritan Hospital as \u201ca Joint Tortfeasor\u201d and that Dr. Hashmi \u201cnever proved (or even attempted to prove) ... that any specific Good Samaritan agents were separate individual joint tortfeasors, i.e. were negligent and caused Mr. Bennett\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>In construing the Good Samaritan Release, we resort to principles of contract interpretation. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Cook, </em>386 Md. 468, 496, 872 A.2d 969, 985 (2005). The principle of the objective interpretation of contracts governs, <em>Clancy v. King, </em>405 Md. 541, 557, 954 A.2d 1092, 1101 (2008), quoting <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 16, 919 A.2d 700, 710 (2007), so that if a release is clear and unambiguous, \u201cthere is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>386 Md. at 496, 872 A.2d at 985 (citation omitted). \u201cUnder the objective law of contract interpretation, the court will give force and effect to the words of the contract without regard to what the parties to the contract thought it meant or what they intended it to mean.\u201d <em>Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 507, 784 A.2d 1086, 1095 (2001). Our task when interpreting a contract is to \u201c[determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated.\u201d <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 436, 727 A.2d 358, 363 (1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Dr. Hashmi emphasizes that the definition of \u201cReleased Party\u201d or \u201cReleasee\u201d in Section I encompasses all hospital employees and agents, with the exception of himself, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">The term <em>\u201cReleased Party\u201d or \u201cReleasee\u201d </em>includes Good Samaritan Hospital of Maryland, Inc., and any partner, agent (actual or apparent), servant, employee, consultant, staff, or representative of the above named individual and entity, and its successors, predecessors, affiliates, principals, heirs, devisees, executors, assigns and insurers as well as all attending, resident or consulting physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, therapists, aides, technicians, or other health care providers. The [t]erm \u201cReleased Party\u201d does not include Shoaib Hashmi, M.D., the non-settling Defendant or any other Defendants who may have entered into separate Settlement Agreements or Releases with the Releasing Parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>As a result, he contends, the Release language is ambiguous regarding whether a single joint tort-feasor share or multiple shares for Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A are included.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In contrast, the Bennetts highlight the language of Section IV of the Release, which identifies Good Samaritan Hospital as \u201ca Joint Tortfeasor,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">If a lawsuit is filed or a claim otherwise made, including claims already made, by the <em>Releasing Parties </em>against any other person, firm, professional association or corporation other than a released party released under this Settlement Agreement, the <em>Releasing Parties </em>hereby irrevocably consent that said claims against any party not released by this Settlement Agreement shall be reduced to the extent of the pro rata shares of the <em>Released Party </em>or the amount paid for this Settlement Agreement, whichever is greater, pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors [sic] Act (codified in Maryland Code Annotated, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art. \u00a7 3-1401, et seq. (2002 Repl.Vol.)[) ] .... For purposes of this paragraph, the Released Party shall be deemed to be a Joint Tortfeasor, jointly and severally liable to the Undersigned, to the same extent as if the Released Party has been adjudicated to be a Joint Tortfeasor by a final judgment of a court of record after trial on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">It is true that Section I defines \u201cReleased Party\u201d or \u201cReleasee\u201d globally, releasing all employees and agents of Good Samaritan Hospital, with the exception of Dr. Hashmi. Section TV, however, identifies Good Samaritan Hospital, the \u201cReleased Party\u201d as \u201ca Joint Tortfeasor,\u201d such that the Release both broadly encompasses hospital employees and agents, while nevertheless representing one joint tort-feasor share.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Our interpretation comports with that of our colleagues on the intermediate appellate court, who determined that the Release clearly and unambiguously identifies Good Samaritan Hospital only as \u201ca joint tort-feasor.\u201d As the Court of Special Appeals aptly noted, \u201can agreement could only determine joint tort-feasor status of one who was a party thereto,\u201d 188 Md.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>App. at 451, 982 A.2d at 828, quoting <em>Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 371, 749 A.2d 174, 189 (2000), and only the Bennetts and Good Samaritan Hospital were parties to the Release. Thus, we decline to embrace Dr. Hashmi\u2019s tortured analysis, as the Release contains no admission or other statement that Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, or Nurse A are deemed to be joint tort-feasors.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Even if we were to determine that the Good Samaritan Release was ambiguous, we would not countenance the separate, post-trial proceeding Dr. Hashmi proposes, in which he suggests that the proffer of evidence in a separate post-judgment judicial proceeding against Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A, who are not parties to the action, would be sufficient to establish their status as joint tort-feasors in order to reduce his contribution to the adjudicated verdict.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> None of the three Good Samaritan employees was named as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>defendant in the original action, nor did Dr. Hashmi join them as third-party defendants pursuant to Rule 2-332(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">(\u0430) Defendant\u2019s claim against third party. A defendant, as a third-party plaintiff, may cause a summons and complaint, together with a copy of all pleadings, scheduling notices, court orders, and other papers previously filed in the action, to be served upon a person not previously a party to the action who is or may be liable to the defendant for all or part of a plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant. A person so served becomes a third-party defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Rather than pursue a \u201cjudicial determination\u201d countenanced by our Rules, Dr. Hashmi, in an effort to increase the number of joint tort-feasor shares, thereby reducing his share of the judgment, seeks to demonstrate that Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A were also negligent in a collateral, post-judgment proceeding, without Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse and Nurse A being notified or even necessarily being present or defending.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">[\u0431] Never has this Court, or as far as we can tell, any other court, permitted this type of \u201cjudicial determination\u201d of joint tort-feasor status, without their having been joined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>original defendants or as third parties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rather, in <em>Owens-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number><em>Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633 (1992), we determined that only a party to an action may be deemed a \u201cjoint tort-feasor.\u201d In that case, Louis L. Dickerson and William L. Zenobia filed separate complaints seeking damages for injuries resulting from asbestos exposure against a number of manufacturers and installers of products containing asbestos, and the complaints were consolidated for purposes of trial and appeal. A jury awarded Mr. Dickerson $1.3 million in compensatory damages and Mr. Zenobia $1.2 million in compensatory damages. Pursuant to a stipulation, each defendant was deemed to have cross-claimed for contribution and indemnity against all other defendants. Raymark, Inc., an asbestos manufacturer, however, was not a party to the <em>Zenobia </em>case or the cross-claim stipulation in <em>Zenobia, </em>and had settled with Mr. Dickerson and Mr. Zenobia before trial. Anchor Packing Co., a defendant in the <em>Zenobia </em>case, sought indemnity from Raymark, asserting that Raymark was Anchor\u2019s primary source of asbestos containing products.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The trial judge granted defendants\u2019 cross-claims against all settling defendants, including Raymark, in the <em>Dickerson </em>and <em>Zenobia </em>cases. As a result, the compensatory damages verdicts were reduced proportionally in light of the releases between the plaintiffs and the settling defendants. In addition, the trial judge held that Anchor Packing was entitled to indemnity against Raymark in the <em>Zenobia </em>case. Thus, because of Mr. Zenobia\u2019s settlement and release of Raymark, the trial judge struck the jury\u2019s award against Anchor.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">We reversed with respect to both claims. Regarding the <em>Dickerson </em>case, we reasoned that, because Raymark was named as a defendant in Mr. Dickerson\u2019s original complaint, the cross-claim stipulation included cross-claims against Ray-mark for contribution. We determined, nevertheless, that the trial judge erred, \u201cbecause there was insufficient evidence to find that Raymark was a joint tort-feasor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475, 601 A.2d at 660. We emphasized that \u201c[n]o evidence was present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ed against Raymark at the trial,\u201d such that the nonsettling defendants had not met their burden of demonstrating Ray-mark\u2019s joint tort-feasor status. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We further held, in the <em>Zenobia </em>case, that, because Ray-mark was never named as a defendant, or impleaded as a third-party defendant pursuant to Rule 2-322, \u201c[t]he trial court could not exercise jurisdiction to grant a cross-claim against Raymark.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 601 A.2d at 660. In so holding, we noted that Raymark was deprived of notice in contradiction with Rule 2-322 requiring service, upon a person not previously a party to the action, of a summons, the complaint, and all pleadings and motions previously filed in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Here, as in the <em>Dickerson </em>case, Dr. Hashmi failed to present any evidence at trial against the three Good Samaritan Hospital employees. Moreover, as in the <em>Zenobia </em>case, Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A were never named as defendants or impleaded by Dr. Hashmi as third-party defendants pursuant to Rule 2-322. As a result, our precedent does not comport with Dr. Hashmi\u2019s last-ditch effort to reduce his share of the judgment by seeking an adjudication of joint tortfeasor status of Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A, who have not received notice or had an opportunity to defend. <em>See also Porter Hayden Co. v. Bullinger, </em>350 Md. 452, 471-72, 713 A.2d 962, 971 (1998) (reasoning that a default judgment entered on an asbestos manufacturer\u2019s third-party claim against a third-party defendant constituted a determination of liability, such that the third-party defendant should be considered a joint tort-feasor under the Act); <em>Lerman v. Heeman, </em>347 Md. 439, 446, 701 A.2d 426, 430 (1997) (determining that a jury verdict had pronounced Dr. Lerman and Dr. Heeman, defendants in a medical malpractice action, to be \u201cjoint tort-feasors,\u201d such that Dr. Heeman could seek contribution from his co-defendant, because he had paid more than his pro rata share of the judgment); <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v.

Mueller, </em>307 Md. 350, 355, 513 A.2d 915, 918 (1986) (determining that settling co-defendants who remained in case and were found not to be liable were volunteers regarding their payments to plaintiffs, and nonsettling defendant who was found liable was not entitled to a reduction of the judgment awarded against it); <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 621-22, 133 A.2d 428, 432-33 (1957) (granting summary judgment in favor of settling third-party defendant was inappropriate, because the question of his negligence had yet to be determined); <em>Collier v. Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc., </em>86 Md.App. 38, 43-44, 585 A.2d 256, 259 (1991) (recognizing in an asbestos claim a general pre-trial order in which each of the defendants was deemed to have filed cross-claims for contribution against all other defendants); <em>Loh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>47 Md.App. 110, 127, 422 A.2d 16, 26 (1980) (determining summary judgment in favor of grocery store and food producer was improper, despite settlement by injured party with food producer, because the producer specifically denied liability and thus, \u201cthere ha[d] been no determination of liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In so holding, we also find persuasive <em>Washington v. Washington Hospital Center, </em>579 A.2d 177 (D.C.1990), in which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals was faced with an analogous scenario. In that case, a jury returned a verdict against Washington Hospital Center in connection with the improper administration of anesthesia, causing a patient to sustain severe brain damage. <em>Id. </em>at 180. Washington Hospital Center sought a reduction of the verdict, asserting that the other two alleged tort-feasors, the anesthesiologist, Dr. Walker, and the nurse-anesthetist, Nurse Adland, executed settlement agreements with the patient. <em>Id. </em>at 185. The court determined that the Hospital\u2019s \u201cfailure to keep that issue in the case by asserting a claim for contribution\u2014either through a cross-claim or by a special jury verdict request\u2014preclude[d] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>application of a <em>pro rata </em>credit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186. The court emphasized that the Hospital could reasonably have been expected to \u201c \u2018safeguard any legitimate claim it might have to lessen the burden of a plaintiffs verdict\u2019 by asserting a cross-claim for contribution ... or an equivalent request for a determination by the jury of the settling defendants\u2019 negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187-88, quoting <em>Hall v. General Motors Corp., </em>647 F.2d 175, 184 (1980). Although the District of Columbia has not adopted the Uniform Contribution Among Joint TortFeasors Act and relies instead on contribution as an equitable remedy, <em>George Washington University v. Bier, </em>946 A.2d 372, 375 (D.C.2008), we nevertheless find appropriate the notion that only a party to the action may be deemed a \u201cjoint tortfeasor.\u201d <em>See Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 473-75, 601 A.2d 633, 659-660 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In this case, Dr. Hashmi could have pursued a claim against any other alleged joint tort-feasors, other than those named in the original complaint, by filing a third-party complaint pursuant to Rule 2-332 and by seeking a special verdict, rather than by asserting the efficacy of a post hoc proceeding in which only he would proffer.

Wilkinson, </em>5 So.3d 726 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009), as support for the notion that the negligence of Dr. Sahi, Nurse Bosse, and Nurse A may be \"judicially determined\u201d in a post-trial proceeding. In <em>Wilkinson, </em>an injured patient filed a medical malpractice claim against University Medical Center (\u201cUMC\u201d) and Florida Board of Regents (\"FBOR\u201d) regarding a misdiagnosis of her life-threatening heart condition. <em>Id. </em>at 728-29. UMC filed a third-party complaint against StarMed Staffing, Inc. (\"StarMed\u201d), alleging that it was liable for any negligence attributable to its nurse. Prior to trial, UMC and FBOR entered into settlement and release agreements. In UMC's contribution action against StarMed, the trial court determined that UMC was entitled to a rebuttable presumption of negligence and that the negligence of FBOR was irrelevant in portioning liability. The Florida appellate court reversed, reasoning that the court should have considered the \"entire liability\u201d of the alleged joint tort-feasors, such that the negligence of FBOR had to be considered. <em>Id. </em>at 731. <em>Wilkinson </em>is distinguishable from the present case, however, because FBOR, UMC, and StarMed were all parties to the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b759-5\">. Moreover, when the General Assembly first enacted the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, in Chapter 344 of the Maryland Laws of 1941, then Section 27, entitled \"Procedure and Practice,\u201d specifically governed third-party claims and cross-claims among joint tort feasors, stating, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">(a) Before answering, a defendant seeking contribution in a tort action may move ex parte or, after answering, on notice to the plaintiff, for leave as a third-party plaintiff to serve a summons and pleading upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable as a joint tortfeasor to him or to the plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff's claim against him. If the motion is granted and the summons and pleading are served, the person so served, hereinafter call the third-party defendant, shall make his defense to the claim of the plaintiff and to the third-party claim in the same manner as defenses are made by an original defendant to an original pleading. ... A third-party defendant may proceed under this section against any person not a party to the action who is or may be liable as a joint tortfeasor to him or to the third-party plaintiff for all or part of the claim made in the action against the third-party defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">(c) A pleader may either (a) state as a cross-claim against a co-party any claim that the co-party is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant; or (b) move for judgment for contribution against any other joint judgment debtor, where in a single action a judgment has been entered against joint tortfeasors one of whom has discharged the judgment by payment or has paid more than his pro rata share thereof....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">As a result, the <em>1941 </em>Act contained a provision dealing with the purely procedural issue of third-party practice in connection with the determination of \u201cjoint tort-feasor\u201d status. <em>See </em>Wendell D. Allen, <em>Joint Tortfeasors: Contribution, Indemnity and Procedure, </em>Paper read before the Barristers Club of Baltimore, Mar. 30, 1948. In fact, prior to 1947, third-party practice was available only to joint tort-feasors. <em>See </em>Section 27 of Article 50, Maryland Code (1947 Supp.); <em>see also Cotham v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>260 Md. 556, 566, 273 A.2d 115, 120 (1971). In 1947, the Court of Appeals adopted \"General Rules of Practice and Procedure,\u201d including Rule 4 of Section III entitled \"Joinder of Parties and Claims,\u201d Maryland Code (1947 Supp.), which relevantly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">(a) <em>Motion by Defendant. </em>Where the defendant in any action claims that a person not a party to the action is or may be liable to him for all or part of the plaintiff's claim against him, he may move for leave to serve a summons and claim upon such person as a third party....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOv\">Former Rule 4 was codified in 1956 as Rule 315 of the Maryland Rules, the precursor to present Rule 2-332, governing third-party practice. Meanwhile, in 1957, then Section 26 of Article 50, Maryland Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ers 1), the procedural provision of the Act, was repealed by Section 1 of Chapter 399 of the Maryland Laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
