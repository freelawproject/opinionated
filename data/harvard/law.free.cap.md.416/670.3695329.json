Accordingly, we shall reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">This case arises out of the shooting death of petitioner\u2019s fiance\u00e9, Dana Drake, in Baltimore City sometime around 3:00 a.m. on February 21,1998. Ms. Drake was shot to death with a .22 caliber gun in a common area of her apartment building, after having returned from a social event at the local Teamsters Union Hall. About ninety minutes after witnesses reported hearing gunshots, petitioner called the police to report Ms. Drake\u2019s shooting. Petitioner met Baltimore Police officer Richard Gibson at a payphone, and led him to the murder scene. He told the officer that he and Ms. Drake had been romantically involved, but that she had a new boyfriend, and that he had recently threatened to kill her. Soon after reporting Ms. Drake\u2019s death to the police, petitioner came under suspicion for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">On March 16, 1998, the Grand Jury for Baltimore City indicted petitioner for the crimes of first-degree murder, using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and carrying a handgun, in connection with Ms. Drake\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Brenda O\u2019Carroll, who lived on the first floor of Ms. Drake\u2019s building, was a key prosecution witness at petitioner\u2019s 1999 murder trial. At trial, Ms. O\u2019Carroll testified in substance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">[O\u2019Carroll]: I heard what\u2014it sounded like two shots outside my building. Then the front door opened and someone came in and then the door opened upstairs and then the door opened again and somebody was coming downstairs, and then I heard the young man having words, but I couldn\u2019t make out what either were saying to each other because I was in my hallway area and my bedroom and my living room and dining area is between.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>[Prosecutor]: Now, did you hear the voices before or after the shots?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">[O\u2019Carroll]: After the first set of shots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">[Prosecutor]: Okay. So you heard shots outside the building area, you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Yea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">[Prosecutor]: Then you heard the voices?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Yea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">[Prosecutor]: And then you heard shots from where? [O\u2019Carroll]: The hallway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">[Prosecutor]: How many did you hear from the hallway? [O\u2019Carroll]: One, she was knocking on my door. I was in my bedroom and she tapped very, very, very faintly as\u2014 almost as if she didn\u2019t really want to wake me up but she tapped. I heard her. I live alone and it\u2019s quiet in the building and you just hear, you know. I should have opened the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">[Prosecutor]: Did there come a time when you opened the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">[Prosecutor]: When was that? How long after you heard the last shots did you open the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-14\">[O\u2019Carroll]: About fifteen minutes, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-15\">[Prosecutor]: Okay. And what, if anything, did you see when you opened the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-16\">[O\u2019Carroll]: She was sitting on the third step from the bottom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-17\">[Prosecutor]: Okay. Now after you heard these shots, Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-18\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Yea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-19\">[Prosecutor]:\u2014did you ever see anyone\u2014did you see Mr. Williams any time after that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-20\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Yea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>[Prosecutor]:\u2014after that night? You did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">[Prosecutor]: When?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">[O\u2019Carroll]: I saw him. He parked his car on the right hand side of\u2014that would be Marjorie, and then he ran\u2014he jumped in his car. He pulled it back onto the parking lot and then he rode out like Speedy Gonzales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">[Prosecutor]: When was this, Ms. O\u2019Carroll?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">[O\u2019Carroll]: This is just before I opened the door and saw her on the steps with her head on the side dead. There was blood at my door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">When defense counsel cross-examined Ms. O\u2019Carroll, the following relevant testimony was elicited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">[Defense counsel]: And the one shot that you hear inside of the building, what else do you hear between those shots? [O\u2019Carroll]: Words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">[Defense counsel]: Okay. And what words did you hear? [O\u2019Carroll]: I couldn\u2019t make out. It was an argument. I didn\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s what I said. I did not hear the words. [Defense counsel]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Alright. But I looked. His car was parked on the other side of the street at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">[Defense counsel]: Let me ask you this, ma\u2019am, and I really don\u2019t mean to be personal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-16\">[Defense counsel]: But your left hand\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-17\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-18\">[Defense counsel]:\u2014is swollen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-19\">[O\u2019Carroll]: I have cancer. My breast was removed. [Defense counsel]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-20\">[O\u2019Carroll]: And the lymph nodes, so that\u2019s fluid. It\u2019s bigger than my other hand, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>[Defense counsel]: And you indicated that you told the homicide detectives just what you said here today, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">[O\u2019Carroll]: No, when I found out that he was for him [sic], I immediately stopped talking, told him to leave my house. [Defense counsel]: But that was after you told him\u2014\u201cI mean, [I\u2019m] for real, [petitioner] ain\u2019t a nice person, and then he got that on him and I hope they just get all of the juice on his ass and go ahead and fry him, that\u2019s all\u201d? [O\u2019Carroll]: Yes, I said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">[Defense counsel]: You said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">[Defense counsel]: But what I\u2019m talking about is, did you tell the homicide detectives, the Police Department of Baltimore City, did you tell them what you have said here today? [O\u2019Carroll]: Yea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">[Defense counsel]: And you told them that between the shots, two shots outside, somebody comes, you hear argument, now that is inside the foyer area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">[Defense counsel]: Okay. And then you hear somebody go upstairs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-13\">[Defense counsel]: Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-14\">[O\u2019Carroll]: She went up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-15\">[Defense counsel]: How do you know she went up? [O\u2019Carroll]: Because she came in first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-16\">[Defense counsel]: How do you know that, you were in your bedroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-17\">[O\u2019Carroll]: He shot\u2014she parked her car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-18\">[Defense counsel]: She parked her car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-19\">[O\u2019Carroll]: He saw her. He was right behind her. He pulled his car over on this side. He shot at her going into the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>[Defense counsel]: Okay. Now I\u2019m understanding you. And you see all of this, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">[O\u2019Carroll]: I heard the shots. I saw the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">[Defense counsel]: Now, you saw him get out of the car? [O\u2019Carroll]: Yea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">[Defense counsel]: And he started chasing her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Yea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">[Defense counsel]: And then he started shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Yea, two shots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">[Defense counsel]: Now, you have windows in your bedroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">[O\u2019Carroll]: Uh-huh, but they would be in the back. But my kitchen can\u2014I can see Marjorie. My bedroom window too, actually. I can see Marjorie, but I get more of a view on Marjorie from my kitchen and my living room windows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">[Defense counsel]: What did you\u2014after the muffled gunshot, what did you see him do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">[O\u2019Carroll]: He got in his car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-15\">[Defense counsel]: And what does he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-16\">[O\u2019Carroll]: He backed out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-17\">[Defense counsel]: Alright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-18\">[O\u2019Carroll]: And he went out on Marjorie Lane.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">A second witness, Shannond Fair, was in the vicinity of the shooting and testified at petitioner\u2019s 1999 trial. Mr. Fair stated that he lived in an apartment building across the street from the scene of the shooting, and that he heard gunshots, looked out of his second-story window and saw a man, dressed in black, running up Marjorie Lane. He did not observe the man\u2019s face, and consequently was unable to identify the suspect precisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Also at petitioner\u2019s 1999 trial, the State offered evidence that petitioner, while in jail, confessed to having murdered Ms. Drake to Sean Williams (hereinafter \u201cS. Williams\u201d). S. Williams was incarcerated for possession of a controlled dangerous substance, and was housed in a cell adjacent to petitioner\u2019s cell. Unbeknownst to petitioner, S. Williams was a police informant. Indeed, for approximately ten years, S. Williams had served as a registered police informant, and had participated in the prosecution of several crimes before petitioner\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">At petitioner\u2019s 1999 trial, S. Williams testified that petitioner spelled out the details of the crime over two to three days while they were imprisoned together. He testified that petitioner admitted to having taken out a life insurance policy on Ms. Drake, and that he had killed her, because he was \u201clike $100,000 in debt.\u201d He said that petitioner told him he had purchased a .22 caliber handgun, and had given it to his cousin for disposal after Ms. Drake\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The State did not disclose to the defense before petitioner\u2019s first trial that S. Williams was a paid police informant, or that he was seeking a sentence reduction. Although S. Williams\u2019s identity as an informant was known to at least one member of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, the assistant State\u2019s attorney responsible for prosecuting petitioner\u2019s case, was not informed. S. Williams represented that in testifying he was acting \u201cout of the goodness of his heart,\u201d and because he did not like violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In addition to the two crime scene witnesses and the police informant testimony, in petitioner\u2019s 1999 trial the State offered evidence as to petitioner\u2019s motive to kill Ms. Drake. Prosecutors showed that petitioner had purchased a life insurance policy with a spousal rider, within two years before Ms. Drake\u2019s murder. The policy provided that if Ms. Drake were to die, petitioner would receive $100,000 in proceeds. The State also showed that petitioner was over $90,000 in debt. Finally, the State called a gun dealer, Charles Frank, who testified that he had delivered a .22 caliber handgun to peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>tioner on February 15, 1998, less than a week before Ms. Drake\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The jury convicted petitioner of all three charges on February 10, 1999. The court sentenced him on the murder conviction to a term of incarceration of life, and on the handgun violation, to a term of incarceration of twenty years, to be served consecutively. Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed his conviction in an unreported opinion. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>No. 765, Sept. Term, 1999, filed March 23, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief on May 24, 2001, alleging that the State had violated the precepts of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by failing to disclose material impeachment evidence concerning S. Williams. The Circuit Court denied relief, ruling that petitioner\u2019s conviction was not obtained in violation of the <em>Brady </em>doctrine. In particular, the court explained that it would be improper to impose on the State a duty to disclose information held by State agents who had never participated in the prosecution of the case. The Circuit Court further denied a motion by petitioner to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Petitioner filed an application for leave to appeal from the denial of post-conviction relief, which the Court of Special Appeals granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for a new trial. <em>Williams v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 200, 831 A.2d 501 (2003). The Court of Special Appeals held that the State violated <em>Brady </em>by withholding material information, and in particular, that the fact that S. Williams was a paid police informant and was seeking a sentence reduction should have been disclosed to petitioner. The holding of the Court of Special Appeals can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">\u201c[T]here is no question but that [S.] Williams, a key witness at the murder trial, was a paid police informant who had received leniency on criminal offenses because of his status as an informant; wrote approximately nine letters to Judge Schwait looking for a reduction of his sentence because, <em>inter alia, </em>he was going to testify in two murder cases for the State; and lied at appellant\u2019s trial about his motives for testifying against appellant, who he said, had confessed to him that he had killed his girlfriend. At least one Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, Gary Shenker, knew that Williams was a paid police informant who had received not only money, but also, a stet in the case against him for theft of the police cruiser, in exchange for information in various narcotics cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">[I]n the present case, Williams\u2019s testimony that appellant confessed to the murder of Ms. Drake was the only direct evidence, other than Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s apparently confused version of events, linking appellant to the crime. As the post conviction court found, there was no forensic evidence linking appellant to the crime scene and no direct evidence was found linking appellant to the crime as a result of the search of appellant\u2019s car or home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Accordingly, we hold ... \u2018that the taint of the <em>Brady </em>suppression matters on this record so undermines our confidence in the murder conviction that a new trial is in order.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><em>Id </em>at 222-27, 831 A.2d at 513-16 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The State filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which this Court granted. <em>State v. Williams, </em>378 Md. 617, 837 A.2d 928 (2003). The primary question presented was whether the State\u2019s <em>Brady </em>disclosure obligations applied when the exculpatory information in question was known to one prosecutor in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, but not to the prosecutor responsible for prosecuting the ease. We answered the question in the affirmative. Chief Judge Bell, writing for the Court, explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u2018We hold that by referring only to the \u2018State\u2019s Attorney and staff members,\u2019 without any restriction, and then including \u2018any others,\u2019 restricted to those with a direct present or past involvement with the particular action, Rule 4r-263(g)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] draws a distinction between the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and those outside that Office who are on the prosecution team. The latter category falls within the <em>Brady </em>rule only if those persons have or have had involvement with the action at issue or regularly reports to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. No such limitation applies to the attorneys and staff in that Office. As to them, the <em>Brady </em>obligation extends to material and information in their possession. Thus, where, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the information regarding S. Williams\u2019s status as an informant was known to another attorney in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, the Rule compels its disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\"><em>State v. Williams, </em>392 Md. 194, 209-10, 896 A.2d 973, 982 (2006). We then reiterated the duty of the State to discover and disclose evidence concerning the credibility of its witnesses, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201cWhen the core of the State\u2019s argument relies on the testimony of an essential witness, the State has a duty to discover anything, and everything, that concerns that witness\u2019s credibility and, thus, potential for impeachment. The State admits that, under <em>Giglio [v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) ], when the reliability of a witness is determinative of guilt or innocence, nondisclosure of such evidence falls within <em>Brady. </em>In that case, where the entire State\u2019s case relied upon the credibility of the testimony of a key State witness, the Supreme Court held that \u2018evidence of any understanding or agreement as to a future prosecution would be relevant to his credibility.\u2019 405 U.S. at 154-155, 92 S.Ct. at 766, 31 L.Ed.2d at 108. <em>See also Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 41, 702 A.2d 699, 710 (1997) (\u2018The prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose applies to any understanding or agreement between the witness and the State\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 210-11, 896 A.2d at 982. We affirmed the Court of Special Appeals in granting petitioner relief in the form of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">By the time petitioner\u2019s new trial commenced in March, 2007, Brenda O\u2019Carroll had died. Her death took on increased significance because of the revelation, after her death, of statements she had made to the police about her vision and which, petitioner argues, affected her 1999 testimony. Specifically, Baltimore City Detective Darryl Massey disclosed shortly before the second trial, and well after Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s death, that she had described herself to him as \u201clegally blind\u201d during the course of the investigation leading up to petitioner\u2019s 1999 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statement emerged for the first time on February 22, 2007, at a pretrial hearing in connection with petitioner\u2019s second trial in which petitioner had moved to suppress statements by petitioner to S. Williams.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the hearing, Det. Massey testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>[Prosecutor]: And did [Ms. O\u2019Carroll] give a description of anyone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">Det. Massey: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">[Prosecutor]: Okay. Did she say that she saw anyone running, like at the scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">Det. Massey: She mentioned hearing, hearing things. Part of her sickness, she was blind, whether it was legally, or\u2014 she was blind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">[Defense Counsel]: If you remember before we broke up for lunch, you testified both on direct and on cross, in regards to Brenda 0\u2019[Carroll], that she gave no description of anyone and then you said the witness was blind. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">Det. Massey: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Did you base your conclusion that the witness was blind based on something that she told you or your observation of her when you interviewed her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">Det. Massey: Both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">[Defense Counsel]: Both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-13\">Det. Massey: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\">[Defense Counsel]: So she told you she was blind\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-15\">Det. Massey: Legally. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-16\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014and she looked blind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-17\">Det. Massey: Her demeanor was consistent with someone who may have a sight imparity, sure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-18\">Petitioner moved to exclude O\u2019Carroll\u2019s videotaped testimony from evidence in his second trial. The Circuit Court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-19\">\u201cWhile I\u2019m going to deny the relief that you\u2019ve requested, I am going to grant you some relief, and that is this. I watched her testimony and there\u2019s really no evidence on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>tape that she suffers from any disability and she makes statements about things that she sees that are accurate, such as the color and model of the car and that sort of thing. So one wonders if she was actually disabled visually, how she\u2019d be able to do that ... Whether there\u2019s an issue of her vision was only introduced much later by Detective Massey in these proceedings. I think that I\u2019m going to permit [defense counsel] to question him about that and I\u2019m going to allow as an exception under the residual exception provisions of Maryland Rule 5-803 as hearsay. If [defense counsel] wants to supplement that record in any way, he\u2019s able to get ahold of medical records or anything else, I\u2019ll allow that in as part of the record and I\u2019ll allow him to argue to the jury that they have to consider her observations in light of whatever evidence he can establish that she had impaired vision. But, I\u2019m not prepared to exclude her testimony, because I don\u2019t think the record establishes what the extent of her vision was. I don\u2019t think that being legally blind means that you\u2019re entirely blind, I think it means you meet some minimal standard of impairment that may allow you to have benefits. But none of us have in the record before us any evidence as to what that standard is, and I\u2019m not prepared to exclude her testimony or redact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The Court went on to admonish the State for its nondisclosure, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cI\u2019m not happy about what happened here. I happen to be of the view that <em>Brady </em>extends the obligation to all the agents of the State ... I don\u2019t know why any police officer, if he had information that an eyewitness was blind, wouldn\u2019t bring it immediately to the attention of everybody----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">While the court viewed the State as culpable for the untimely disclosure of Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statements, the court crafted a remedy short of excluding her testimony. The court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel] had pressed the court ... concerning Detective Massey\u2019s testimony that Ms. O\u2019Carroll suffered from legal blindness for a finding with respect to whether or not it constituted a <em>Brady </em>violation or discovery violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>under the Maryland rules and I want to put the following on record: The court finds that technically Detective Massey\u2019s failure to advise anyone of Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statement concerning her legal blindness must be charged to the State because he is an agent of the State and it is the State\u2019s responsibility to make inquiry of its agents of matters going to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment, and this includes impeachment of the State\u2019s witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">The court in response to defendant\u2019s Motion for Appropriate Relief has fashioned what it believes to be appropriate relief under the difficult circumstances that the witness in question has died before she could be examined concerning her vision impairments----Under the court\u2019s ruling he will be permitted to put the issue before the jury and allow them to assess Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s testimony in light of her demeanor on the stand and this out-of-court remark about her visual limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In accordance with its ruling, the trial court permitted the State to play the entire videotaped testimony of Ms. O\u2019Carroll from petitioner\u2019s first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">On April 2, 2007, petitioner was convicted again of first-degree murder, use of a handgun in commission of a crime of violence, and carrying a handgun in connection with the death of Ms. Drake. The Circuit Court sentenced him on the murder conviction to a term of incarceration of life imprisonment, and five years, consecutive, on the handgun violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the Circuit Court erred in admitting a videotape of the testimony of Brenda O\u2019Carroll.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Williams v. State, </em>183 Md.App. 517, 962 A.2d 440 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The intermediate appellate court affirmed petitioner\u2019s second conviction, holding that even if the State\u2019s failure to disclose Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s visual impairment could be characterized initially as <em>Brady </em>information, the information had been disclosed to petitioner over one month before the second trial, and therefore, any <em>Brady </em>violation had been cured. <em>Williams, </em>183 Md.App. at 527, 962 A.2d at 445. The Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cMs. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s assertion that she was \u2018legally blind\u2019 was not kept \u2018hidden\u2019 but was actually disclosed by Detective Sergeant Massey well in advance of appellant\u2019s second trial. Consequently, although the concealment of that evidence was arguably a <em>Brady </em>violation at the time of the first trial, it was no longer a <em>Brady </em>issue at the time of the second. In short, the <em>Brady </em>problem as to this piece of evidence was resolved by the granting of the second trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 526, 962 A.2d at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The court then analyzed the use of Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s testimony under the rules governing the admissibility of prior recorded testimony prescribed in Maryland Rule 5\u2014804(b)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court noted the Rule\u2019s precept that former testimony is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness, so long as the party against whom the testimony is now offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony on cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 962 A.2d at 446. The court held that the testimony was admitted properly under Rule 5\u2014804(b)(1). <em>See id. </em>at 533, 962 A.2d at 449. The court described its rationale as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201cAt his first trial, appellant had good reason to question Ms. O\u2019Carroll about her eyesight, given that, as Shannond Fair put it, it was \u201cpitch dark\u201d outside at the time of the murder and Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s complicated health history. As to that history, the defense was alerted early on that O\u2019Carroll had significant medical problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">[T]hat appellant\u2019s counsel chose not to question her at all about her eyesight does not alter the fact that he had a motive to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 530-31, 962 A.2d at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with this Court, presenting the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">\u201c1. Did the trial court err in admitting the prior testimony of Brenda O\u2019Carroll, the State\u2019s key eyewitness who died before Petitioner\u2019s second trial, where the prosecution withheld evidence that O\u2019Carroll was \u2018legally blind,\u2019 thereby denying Petitioner a fair opportunity to cross-examine her, in violation of the Confrontation Clause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">2. Given the prosecution\u2019s multiple <em>Brady </em>violations that severely and irreparably prejudiced Petitioner, did the trial court err by refusing to dismiss his indictment -with prejudice?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">We granted Certiorari to consider the above issues. <em>Williams v. State, </em>408 Md. 149, 968 A.2d 1064 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">This case involves several Maryland rules, evidentiary considerations and constitutional issues. The rules implicated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>this case are Maryland Rules 4-263<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Rule 5\u2014804(b)(1). Petitioner\u2019s arguments implicate also the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Petitioner raises two issues in this appeal. First, he argues that the trial court erred in admitting the prior testimony of Ms. O\u2019Carroll and thereby denied him a fair opportunity to cross-examine her, in violation of the Confrontation Clause to the United States Constitution. Second, he maintains that given the State\u2019s multiple <em>Brady: </em>violations, (the first being the information regarding the jailhouse informant, and the second being the failure to disclose Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statement about her eyesight), that the trial court erred by refusing to dismiss the indictment with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Overarching the State\u2019s responses to all of petitioner\u2019s arguments is the State\u2019s position that there was no <em>Brady </em>violation in this second trial because the State made petitioner aware of O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statements before the second trial. As a fall back argument, the State asserts that even if this Court finds a <em>Brady </em>violation, the Circuit Court exercised its discretion properly in fashioning a remedy that did not exclude O\u2019Carroll\u2019s testimony at the second trial. Relying on <em>Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 500, 499 A.2d 1261, 1268 (1985), the State points out that \u201c[t]he question of whether any sanction is to be imposed for a discovery violation, and if so what sanction, is in the first instance committed to the discretion of the trial judge, and ... the exercise of that discretion includes evaluating whether the violation prejudiced the defendant.\u201d Finally, as to the <em>Brady </em>violation issue, the State argues that the court exercised its discretion properly in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment as a sanction for \u201cmultiple\u201d <em>Brady </em>violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">As to petitioner\u2019s confrontation argument, the State maintains that the trial court did not err in permitting O\u2019Carroll\u2019s prior recorded testimony to be played in its entirety to the jury at the second trial because petitioner had both an opportunity and similar motive to fully cross-examine Ms. O\u2019Carroll at the first trial, and hence, the admission of the evidence at the second trial did not violate his right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">We address first petitioner\u2019s argument that the State\u2019s conduct in failing to disclose Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statement before the first trial constituted a <em>Brady </em>violation and that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment with prejudice. The trial judge seemed to find, implicitly, that there was a <em>Brady </em>violation, although he did not say so explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">This case and the <em>Brady </em>issue come before this Court in an unusual posture, because it may well be that the State\u2019s failure before the first trial to tell petitioner that Ms. O\u2019Carroll told the detective she was legally blind may have violated the precepts of <em>Brady. </em>Significantly, however, the State <em>did </em>tell petitioner this information before the second trial and therefore, petitioner was aware of the witness\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">It is beyond cavil that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); <em>Diallo v. State, </em>413 Md. 678, 704, 994 A.2d 820, 835 (2010). The cases are legion, however, that \u201c[ejvidence <em>known to the defendant </em>or his counsel, that is disclosed, even if during trial, is not considered suppressed as that term is used in <em>Brady </em>[.]\u201d <em>State v. Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 621 A.2d 728, 747 (1993); <em>see also United States v. Presser, </em>844 F.2d 1275, 1283 (6th Cir.1988) (stating that \u201c[s]o long as a defendant is given impeachment material, even exculpatory impeachment material, in time for use at trial, we fail to see how the Constitution is violated.\u201d); <em>United States v. Vap, </em>852 F.2d 1249, 1256 (10th Cir.1988) (stating that <em>\u201cBrady </em>is not violated when the <em>Brady </em>material is available to [a defendant] during trial.\u201d). Thus, <em>Brady </em>offers no relief when the defendant knew of the facts before trial. <em>Yearby v. State, </em>414 Md. 708, 724, 997 A.2d 144, 153 (2010) (stating \u201c[i]f the defendant has actual or constructive knowledge of the allegedly withheld exculpatory information, there cannot be a <em>Brady </em>violation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>In <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1948, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999), the United States Supreme Court discussed the confusion that has developed around the characterization of <em>Brady </em>materials, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">\u201cThus the term <em>\u2018Brady </em>violation\u2019 is sometimes used to refer to any breach of the broad obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence\u2014that is, to any suppression of so-called <em>\u2018Brady </em>material\u2019\u2014although, strictly speaking, there is never a real <em>\u2018Brady </em>violation\u2019 unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict. There are three components of a true <em>Brady </em>violation: The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APV\">In order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, petitioner must prove that the State suppressed favorable evidence. Here, the videotapes were disclosed before the second trial, and hence, for purposes of this second trial, the evidence is considered not to have been suppressed, even though it should have been given to petitioner earlier. <em>See, e.g., Bielanski v. County of Kane, </em>550 F.3d 632, 645 (7th Cir.2008) (stating that <em>\u201cBrady </em>evidence can be handed over on the eve of trial or even during trial so long as the defendant is able to use it to his or her advantage[, although] purposely withholding exculpatory or impeaching evidence until the last moment would be a risky and ethically questionable practice for government agents to undertake ____\u201d); <em>United States v. Benes, </em>28 F.3d 555, 560 (6th Cir.1994) (stating that <em>\u201cBrady </em>generally does not apply to delayed disclosure of exculpatory information, but only to complete failure to disclose.\u201d); <em>United States v. Baxter, </em>492 F.2d 150, 174 (9th Cir.1973) (stating that \u201cthere was no complete suppression\u201d where favorable evidence was disclosed untimely); <em>White v. State, </em>816 A.2d 776, 778 (Del.2003) (finding no <em>Brady </em>violation where materials were disclosed a week prior to the trial, and \u201c[d]efense counsel ... neither asked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>a continuance nor objected at trial.\u201d); <em>State v. Daniels, </em>13 Conn.App. 133, 534 A.2d 1253, 1255 (1987) (holding that there was no suppression for <em>Brady </em>purposes where the defendant elicited the exculpatory evidence by cross-examining a State\u2019s witness). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was no <em>Brady </em>violation. Because there was no <em>Brady </em>violation, petitioner\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment because of multiple <em>Brady </em>violation fails.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">There is no question here, however, that there was a \u201clate disclosure\u201d of the O\u2019Carroll information. There was certainly a violation of the discovery rules and obligations upon the State, which according to petitioner, prejudiced him because he did not have the information when he cross-examined Ms. O\u2019Carroll and the trial court then admitted the videotaped testimony in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The State has the obligation, under the Maryland Rules, as well as the Constitution, without any request by the defense, to provide to the defense all exculpatory material which would negate the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment as to the offense charged. Md. Rule 4-263 requires the State to disclose <em>Brady </em>information as part of discovery. <em>See Yearby v. State, </em>414 Md. at 720 n. 8, 997 A.2d at 151 n. 8 (stating that \u201cRule 4-263 thus govern[s] all disclosure of evidence by the State to a criminal defendant in the circuit courts, including that mandated by <em>Brady, </em>as well as that mandated only by rule.\u201d). At the time of petitioner\u2019s trial, Rule 4-263 stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">(a) Disclosure without request. Without the necessity of a request, the State\u2019s Attorney shall furnish to the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>(1) Any material or information tending to negate or mitigate the guilt or punishment of the defendant as to the offense charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">(2) Any relevant material or information regarding: (A) specific searches and seizures, wire taps or eavesdropping, (B) the acquisition of statements made by the defendant to a State agent that the State intends to use at a hearing or trial, and (C) pretrial identification of the defendant by a witness for the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The Rule required disclosure of the covered information within twenty-five days after the earlier appearance of counsel or defendant\u2019s first appearance before the court pursuant to Rule 4-213. Md. Rule 4-263(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">As to petitioner\u2019s 1999 trial, Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statement was never disclosed before or during the proceedings. Petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>argument in this context would have been well taken. As to petitioner\u2019s second trial, defense counsel entered his appearance on August 23 of 2006; the information at issue was not disclosed until February 22, 2007. This far exceeded the 25-day period prescribed in the Rule. As the trial judge noted correctly, this delay in disclosing the information, even though known only to the police detective and not to the State\u2019s Attorney, is charged properly to the State.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Rule 4-263(g). Thus, to the extent that the State was required to disclose Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statement to Det. Massey, the State violated its discovery obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Rule 4-263(a) required that the State disclose any material or information tending to negate or mitigate the guilt of the defendant. Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statement falls into the category of information tending to negate the guilt of the defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>therefore was included among the State\u2019s required disclosures. This Court has emphasized that as to the State\u2019s disclosure obligations \u201c[tjhere is no distinction between exculpatory evidence and impeachment evidence.\u201d <em>Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 37, 702 A.2d 699, 708 (1997), <em>citing United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). In <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 234, 596 A.2d 1024, 1039 (1991), construing the version of Rule 4-263(a) applicable to petitioner\u2019s case, we noted that \u201c[cjlearly, if the witness had made prior inconsistent statements to the police and the State\u2019s Attorney had been aware of it, an obligation to produce this information may have existed.\u201d <em>See also Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 725, 569 A.2d 1254, 1264 (1990) (stating that \u201cif the State is aware of prior inconsistent statements made by a witness to a police officer, it may have an obligation to produce this information under the duty to furnish exculpatory evidence. Maryland Rule 4-263(a)(l).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The State\u2019s hurdle has not been fully satisfied with a resolution of the <em>Brady </em>issue, or the discovery issue. Because Ms. O\u2019Carroll was deceased at the time of the second trial, the videotape of her former testimony was hearsay. Petitioner argues that her testimony should not have been admitted into evidence as violative of his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Maryland rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We do not address petitioner\u2019s constitutional argument because we can resolve this case on Maryland evidentiary grounds. This Court ordinarily adheres to the principle that a constitutional issue should not be decided where the case can be disposed of properly on other grounds. <em>See Myer v. State, </em>403 Md. 463, 475, 943 A.2d 615, 621-22 (2008); <em>Smith v. State, </em>399 Md. 565, 570 n. 4, 924 A.2d 1175, 1178 (2007); <em>McCarter v. State, </em>363 Md. 705, 712, 770 A.2d 195, 199 (2001). So strong is the interest in avoiding the unnecessary determination of constitutional questions that it \u201cconstitute^ one of the few exceptions to the general rule that an issue must be raised in the petition for certiorari, cross-petition, or Order of the Court.\u201d <em>Myer, </em>403 Md. at 475, 943 A.2d at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Two questions arise: Because Ms. O\u2019Carroll is unavailable to testify, is the evidence or any part of it admissible because it is hearsay, and, even if it is, what is the appropriate sanction for a discovery violation?</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Maryland Rule 5-801(c) defines \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Rule 5-802 provides that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided ... hearsay is not admissible.\u201d The Rules provide exceptions to this blanket hearsay prohibition, allowing the admission of hearsay under prescribed circumstances. One such exception is for former testimony. <em>See </em>Rule 5-804(b)(1). The Rule provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201cTestimony given as a witness in any action or proceeding [is admissible despite the Rule 5-802 prohibition on hearsay] if the party against whom the testimony is now offered ... had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The State argues that Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s testimony was admissible as an exception to the prohibition against hearsay because it was prior recorded testimony, received at an occasion where petitioner had the opportunity and similar motive to cross-examine her at the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">As set forth in Rule 5-804(b)(l), the requirement that a party have had an opportunity to develop the testimony \u201cis generally satisfied when the defense [was] given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose [the] infirmities [of the testimony] through cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. Salim, </em>855 F.2d 944, 954 (2d Cir.1988) (internal quotation and citation omitted). A motive to develop testimony is sufficiently similar for purposes of Rule 804(b)(1) when the party now opposing the testimony would have had, at the time the testimony was given, \u201can interest of substantially similar intensity to prove (or disprove) the same side of a substantially similar issue\u201d now before the court. <em>United States v. Carneglia, </em>256 F.R.D. 366, quoting <em>United States v. DiNapoli, </em>8 F.3d 909, 914-15 (2d Cir.1993). Professors Stephen A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Saltzburg, Daniel J. Capra, and Michael M. Martin, the Commentary to Federal Rule of Evidence 804,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> explains similar motive to develop testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">\u201cSuch testimony is defined as that given by a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, or during the taking of a deposition, under circumstances such that the party against whom the testimony is now offered (or that party\u2019s predecessor in interest in a civil case) had an opportunity and similar motive to that which would exist at the time the testimony is offered, to develop testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">The touchstone of admissibility is a similar motive to develop the testimony on the part of the nonoffering party (or a predecessor in interest in a civil case). The way to determine whether or not motives are similar is to look at the issues and the context in which the opportunity for examination previously arose, and compare that to the issues and context in which the testimony is currently proffered. The similar motive inquiry is essentially a hypothetical one: is the motive to develop the testimony at the prior time similar to the motive that would exist if the declarant were produced (which of course he is not) at the current trial or hearing?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We hold that although petitioner may have had an opportunity to cross-examine Ms. O\u2019Carroll at the first trial, it was not an adequate one, because he had not been informed that Ms. O\u2019Carroll was \u201clegally blind,\u201d or at least considered herself to be so. As such, we cannot say that her testimony with regard to what she said she saw was reliable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>petitioner had the incentive to question the witness\u2019 perception, without knowing her statement to the detective, he would have had no reason to believe that she was \u201clegally blind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In the alternative, the State argues that even though the trial court found that the State failed to timely disclose the \u201clegally blind\u201d statement to petitioner, the trial court fashioned an appropriate remedy for the untimely disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The decision as to which remedy or sanction to impose generally rests within the broad discretion of the trial court. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>397 Md. 557, 570, 919 A.2d 49, 57 (2007). At the time of petitioner\u2019s second trial, the discovery rule governing criminal cases, Rule 4-263(i), provided as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201cIf at any time during the proceedings the court finds that a party has failed to comply with this Rule or an order issued pursuant to this Rule, the court may ... strike the testimony to which the undisclosed matter relates, grant a reasonable continuance, ... grant a mistrial, or enter any other order appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Ordinarily, a court will \u201cimpose the least severe sanction that is consistent with the purpose of the discovery rules.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>397 Md. at 571, 919 A.2d at 58. This Court has explained that in remedying a discovery violation, the court should weigh (1) the reasons why the disclosure was not made; (2) the existence and amount of any prejudice to the opposing party; (3) the feasibility of curing any prejudice ...; and (4) any other relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570-71, 919 A.2d at 57-58; <em>see also Taliaferro v. State, </em>295 Md. 376, 390-91, 456 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>29, 37 (1983) (enumerating similar factors and stating that the factors \u201cdo not lend themselves to a compartmental analysis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">We hold that the remedy that Circuit Court devised at petitioner\u2019s second trial was inadequate to mitigate the prejudice arising from Det. Massey\u2019s nondisclosure of Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s vision issues, and constituted an abuse of discretion. We focus on the existence of prejudice and the feasibility of curing the prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Petitioner was prejudiced significantly by the State\u2019s nondisclosure of Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statements about her vision, and he was prejudiced equally in his second trial when her recorded testimony was played for the jury. Ms. O\u2019Carroll was the sole eyewitness identifying petitioner as Ms. Drake\u2019s shooter. She testified at petitioner\u2019s first trial to seeing petitioner chase Ms. Drake into her apartment building, fire a gun at her, and drive off in his car. Petitioner was deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine the only eyewitness identifying him about the quality of her vision, inquiring into what she meant when she described herself as \u201clegally blind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In sum, even though there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of the State, the State did not comply with its discovery obligations under Rule 4-263 when it failed to apprise petitioner of Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s statement to Det. Massey drawing into question her visual acuity, because this significant information tended \u201cto negate or mitigate the guilt ... of the defendant as to the offense charged.\u201d Petitioner was prejudiced at his second trial when O\u2019Carroll\u2019s videotaped testimony was allowed into evidence without restriction. The Circuit Court\u2019s remedy of allowing the introduction of any available medical records as well as Det. Massey\u2019s testimony about her vision, was inadequate to mitigate the prejudice petitioner suffered at his second trial. On remand, if the State wishes to introduce portions of the previously recorded testimony, the trial court should redact any portion which relates to what she might have seen or testimony dependent upon her vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

For me, the following portions of the record are of dispositive consequence to the issue of whether petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to impeach Ms. O\u2019Carroll at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The opening statement of petitioner\u2019s trial counsel included the following comments about Ms. O\u2019Carroll:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">Now, when you hear the testimony of Brenda O\u2019Carroll, the direct and the cross-examination, listen carefully because it will be internally inconsistent. At the very end of her direct examination, and not until that point, and watch it carefully as to whether or not even the Prosecutor seemed surprised, she says that she saw Mr. Williams running from the scene and jumping into a red Corvette right after the last shot was fired. She also testifies inexplicably, that the car was parked on Marjorie Lane, that the man that did the shooting was chasing Dana Drake and fired two shots. And that after everything was over, the man had left the scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that she said was Tony Williams, got into a parked car of the parking lot of the apartment complex, not on Marjorie Lane. Which you would infer means that somehow magically, whoever did this shooting, moved a car during a three to five minute event. Couldn\u2019t happen I submit to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">What else did she say that won\u2019t add up? She was interviewed after this incident by an investigator for a previous defense attorney in this case. And she told him flat out, this was [a] month later, that she saw nobody leave the scene, nobody. She also told Detective Massey, the evidence will show, and he will testify in this case, that she said in an interview on the day of the shooting that she was legally blind. And Detective Massey will also testify that he surmised as much from her mannerisms. That never came out on the prior testimony. You will not hear that on either direct examination in the previous proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">The evidence will show that Brenda [O\u2019Carroll] never told Detective Massey who will testify, any law enforcement official on the date of the incident, that she saw Tony Williams either during the incident or leaving the scene. Magically one year later, after all of these statements were she never identified anybody, she magically appears in Court and testifies on direct examination that she saw Tony Williams running from the scene and jump into a red Corvette in the parking lot. I ask you to use your commonsense, just like the State stressed.

Which they studiously stayed away from in their Closing Argument, in their opening remarks. Brenda [O\u2019Carroll] and Shaw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Williams. First, Brenda [O\u2019Carroll]. As it now turns out, based on Michael Morgan, Detective Massey, Detective Harrant, she saw nothing of relevance on the morning of February 21, 1998. And she may have heard something, but we now know that her testimony at both the first trial and her videotaped testimony that you saw is wrong, simply not correct. Why? Anything she claimed at trial she saw is contradicted by her physical condition, legally blind, and the fact that she never admitted it to either Massey, Harrant, or Defense investigator Morgan. That she saw the Defendant that morning run out, or in the apartment, or drive away in a red Corvette.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">There\u2019s something else then that\u2019s important. Which is the bias that she had against Tony Williams. You take a look at her testimony and her statement, what did she say? She admitted to Mr. Morgan that everything she said about the Defendant was a hunch or a gut feeling. That\u2019s what she though[t], hunch or a gut feeling. You heard the words from her on cross examination by Mr. Brown; I hope that man fries. Was actually this; I hope they just all get all the juice on his ass and go ahead and fry him, that\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">And of course if the Defendant was guilty of domestic abuse on Dana Drake as is the inference from her statements and her testimony on the videotape, why was Dana Drake still engaged to the Defendant on February 21? Huh? If he was beating on her regularly. On to of that, no evidence of any domestic complaints to the police introduced by the State in this case of Tony Williams against Dana Drake. Second, her testimony as to the shot pattern and the sequence makes no sense at all and is contradicted by Shannond Fair. She says two shots followed by 10 minutes and one shot. According to her testimony, the killer would hang around 10 minutes after two shots were fired almost guaranteeing he might get caught? And then fire one more shot makes no sense at all. Her testimony at trial, after him running out the front door and jumping into a red Corvette. That assume that if it was Tony Williams, that he would be stupid enough, be wrapped of any intelligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>that he would park his red Corvette in the handicapped block or in the parking lot and commit the crime and run right out and do it. But of course, which is contradicted by her own testimony isn\u2019t it, do you remember what she said on the tape? Which is physically impossible. He\u2019s running, chasing her, she sees the car over on Marjorie Lane, she hears voices and argument, she then hears a shot, she then sees the Defendant leave and he ran out and jumped into a car in the parking lot. So that somehow during this argument and during this shooting the Defendant moved his car? It doesn\u2019t add up. And of course all of that is flatly contradicted by Shannond Fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">She contradicted herself on direct at trial. This is on Direct. Unfortunately [the attorney representing petitioner in the first trial] didn\u2019t pick up on it. On direct she said, page 211, 2/3/99, question, this is by [ ] the prosecutor; did you see anyone in the hallway that evening or that early morning hours other than Ms. Drake? Answer; no. This directly contradicts what she later testified that she saw the Defendant leave the building, jump into the red Corvette and leave. She also said that she saw, or heard, two shots while the Defendant was chasing her, and then one shot later. Now, if that\u2019s the case, why wouldn\u2019t two cartridges be recovered from outside this apartment building somewhere in either the grass, the sidewalk, or in the street? No cartridges introduced into evidence from outside the building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">On the basis of the above quoted portions of the record, I am persuaded that the relief fashioned by the Circuit Court, which is entirely consistent with the provisions of Md. Rules 5-616(b)(4) and 5-806(a), <em>did </em>provide petitioner with a full and fair opportunity to attack the credibility of Ms. O\u2019Carroll by introducing extrinsic evidence of weaknesses in her capacity to see what she claimed to have seen. Under these circumstances, rather than hold that petitioner is entitled to a new trial at which \u201cthe trial court should redact any portion [of Ms. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s prior testimony] which related to what she might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>have seen or testimony dependent upon her vision,\u201d I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Judge RODOWSKY has authorized me to state that he joins this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
