In addition to the Board, the General Assembly created the State Retirement Agency (\u201cthe Agency\u201d), as an agency of the Board, \u201cto carry out the administrative duties of the several systems\u201d within the SRPS. Maryland Code (2004 RepLVol., 2007 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 21-117, 21-119 of the State Personnel &amp; Pensions Article (\u201cSPP\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the time period relevant to this case, membership in the EPS was available to, among others, \u201cregular employee[s] whose compensation is provided by State appropriation or paid from State funds\u201d and \u201cappointed or elected official!\u00bb of the State,\u201d and membership in the JRS was available to, among others, judges on the Maryland Court of Appeals, the Court of Special Appeals, the county circuit courts, and the district courts, as well as commissioners of the State Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cWCC\u201d). <em>See </em>SPP \u00a7\u00a7 23-201(a), 27-201. Appellant, Elizabeth Madeline Carven, instituted this case after the death of her husband, Arthur Frank Carven, III, to contest the denial of his application for JRS membership while he served as a WCC commissioner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">From 1979 until 1987, Commissioner Carven served as an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County. In 1987, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Commissioner Carven was appointed to the Governor\u2019s office to serve as the Executive Assistant for Public Safety, and he later served as Assistant Attorney General for the Maryland Department of the Environment until his retirement on January 1, 1996. At that time, Commissioner Carven had accrued 16 years and 6 months of service credit, qualifying him to receive retirement benefits through the EPS. After retiring, Commissioner .Carven practiced law in the private sector until he was appointed County Attorney for Harford County in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">As County Attorney, Commissioner Carven\u2019s income exceeded the EPS earnings limitation, and, consequently, his retirement allowance ceased. The Agency notified Commissioner Carven that he was ineligible to earn additional service credit as County Attorney even though Harford County was a participating employer within the SRPS.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Commissioner Carven served as County Attorney for five and a half years until he was appointed to the WCC in 2004. As indicated above, commissioners on the WCC are generally eligible for membership in the JRS. When Commissioner Carven notified the SRPS of his employment with the WCC, however, the Agency informed him that he remained subject to an earnings limitation that prevented him from collecting his retirement allowance. The Agency also notified him that he could not become a member of the JRS because he was an EPS retiree, and retirees of the EPS were ineligible to rejoin any State system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>On May 6, 2004, Commissioner Carven wrote to the Board chairman requesting \u201cassistance\u201d in reference to his \u201cnew position as a Workers\u2019 Compensation Commissioner and entry into the [JRS].\u201d Commissioner Carven argued that the Agency\u2019s position was \u201cunfair, inequitable, and erroneous\u201d because the prohibition on re-enrollment in a system was meant to prevent employees from earning service credit in the same system from which they were already receiving a retirement allowance, and EPS retirees participating in the JRS would earn service credit in a system entirely separate from the system from which they had been receiving their retirement allowance. In support of his position, Commissioner Carven cited various statutory provisions and an Attorney General\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In a letter dated May 24, 2004, the executive director of the Agency responded to Commissioner Carven\u2019s letter, informing him that EPS retirees \u201care not permitted to rejoin any State system if they are reemployed by the State, including the [JRS].\u201d After explaining the statutory and legal grounds for the Agency\u2019s decision, the executive director noted that Commissioner Carven could \u201crequest an administrative appeal of this action by submitting a Petition for Hearing to [him] in the format required under COMAR 22.03.04.07\u201d and that Commissioner Carven \u201cmust submit a petition for hearing within 180 days of the date of [the] letter.\u201d The letter also stated that, if Commissioner Carven failed \u201cto submit a petition for hearing within 180 days of [the] letter, [he would] not have any further right to appeal [the] matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Rather than request an administrative appeal, however, Commissioner Carven sought a legislative remedy. On July 7, 2005, Delegate Kevin Kelly, on Commissioner Carven\u2019s behalf, wrote to Robert A. Zarnoch, then Counsel to the General Assembly,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requesting an opinion as to whether a \u201cCommis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>sioner [could] voluntarily forgo his service allowance during his term on the [WCC] and thereafter receive creditable service in the [JRS] during his term on the Commission.\u201d On September 14, 2005, Robert N. McDonald, Chief Counsel of Opinions and Advice in the Attorney General\u2019s Office, responded in a letter to Delegate Kelly that \u201cthe Commissioner may not voluntarily give up his service retirement allowance under EPS in order to earn creditable service in the JRS during his term with the Commission.\u201d McDonald further advised Delegate Kelly that, \u201c[t]o rectify the situation, it would be necessary to obtain corrective legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Commissioner Carven attempted to secure the passage of such legislation in two legislative sessions, but was unsuccessful. On February 3, 2005, Senate President Thomas V. \u201cMike\u201d Miller, Jr., introduced Senate Bill 419, which would allow EPS retirees \u201cwho are appointed as members of the [WCC] to receive service credit in the [JRS] while receiving a service retirement allowance from the [EPS].\u201d S.B. 419, 420th Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess., (Md.2005). The bill did not pass. On March 19, 2006, Delegate Kelly introduced similar legislation, House Bill 1738, that would allow retirees of EPS to \u201crepay certain benefits ... to the Board of Trustees\u201d and require the Board \u201cto suspend the retirement allowance\u201d of retirees of the EPS while allowing those retirees to \u201creceive a normal service retirement benefit from the [JRS].\u201d H.B. 1738, 421st Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess., (Md.2006). That legislation also failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">On June 17, 2006, Commissioner Carven completed a written application for JRS enrollment, and, on September 7, 2006, after Commissioner Carven\u2019s death, Mrs. Carven received a letter from the SRPS informing her that, under Maryland law, Commissioner Carven was ineligible for membership in the JRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\n<em>The Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">On January 12, 2007, Mrs. Carven, as Commissioner Carven\u2019s sole heir and the beneficiary designated in his JRS membership application, filed a petition for an administrative hearing pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>MAR\u201d) 22.03.04.07.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On February 12, 2007, the Agency\u2019s executive director notified Mrs. Carven that he was recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>mending that the Board issue a summary decision denying her request. The Agency based its decision, in part, on Commissioner Carven\u2019s failure to request a hearing within 180 days of the May 2004 letter notifying Commissioner Carven of his ineligibility for membership in the JRS and apprizing him of the time limit to submit a petition for a hearing. The letter further explained the Agency\u2019s position that the re-employment rules for retirees of the EPS prohibit retirees from earning further credits toward retirement while re-employed with any participating employer. In a letter dated April 28, 2007, the Board notified Mrs. Carven of its decision to adopt the Agency\u2019s recommendation and deny her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">On May 7, 2007, Mrs. Carven filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Harford County. On November 27, 2007, that court transferred the case to the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Court for Baltimore County because the judges of the Circuit Court for Harford County had recused themselves from the case. After a hearing on April 30, 2008, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County issued a memorandum opinion and order dated October 31, 2008, reversing the Board\u2019s determination that Carven\u2019s petition for a hearing was untimely but upholding the Board\u2019s decision to deny the membership application.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The court, relying on COMAR 22.03.04.06B, which provides that \u201c[a] petition for a hearing shall be filed within 180 days of the date that a claimant is given notice of an Agency action,\u201d and COMAR 22.03.04.02B(2), which defines a claimant as \u201ca participant or a participating employer that has filed a request for a hearing,\u201d found that Commissioner Carven was not subject to the time limitation at the time he received the May 2004 letter. The court reasoned that, because Commissioner Carven had not yet formally applied for membership in the JRS when he received the letter, he did not fall within the COMAR definition of \u201cclaimant\u201d at that time. Additionally, citing COMAR 22.03.04.02B(5), which defines a hearing as \u201ca contested case hearing as defined by the Administrative Procedure Act [ (\u201cAPA\u201d) ],\u201d and the APA, which defines, in relevant part, a contested case as \u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine ... a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing,\u201d \u00a7 10-202(d) of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), the court further found that Commissioner Carven\u2019s efforts to resolve the eligibility dispute were informal and did not rise to the level of a contested case as required by COMAR\u2019s definition of a hearing. Accordingly, the Circuit Court found that the petition for a hearing was not time barred because Commissioner Carven was not subject to the 180-day time limitation until after he submitted a written application for JRS membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">As to whether Commissioner Carven was barred from membership in the JRS based on his status as an EPS retiree, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. Relying on SPP \u00a7 23-407(e), which provides that \u201c[a]n individual who is receiving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>service retirement allowance or a vested allowance and who is reemployed by a participating employer may not receive creditable service or eligibility service during the period of reemployment,\u201d the court determined that Commissioner Carven was ineligible for JRS membership because he was an EPS retiree reemployed at a participating employer, the WCC, and sought reenrollment in another State system, the JRS. <em>See </em>\u00a7 23-407(e) (establishing the earnings and service credit limitations for reemployed retirees).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On November 13, 2008, Mrs. Carven timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and on November 21, 2008, the SRPS noted a cross-appeal to that same court. Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>consideration by that court, this Court granted certiorari. <em>Carven v. State Retirement &amp; Pension Sys., </em>409 Md. 46, 972 A.2d 861 (2009). The parties present three questions for our consideration; however, because Mrs. Carven and the SRPS seek review of a common issue, the issues before us are two:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (1) whether the Board properly determined that Mrs. Carven\u2019s petition for a hearing was time barred because she failed to file her petition -within 180 days of the Agency\u2019s May 2004 letter notifying Commissioner Carven that he was ineligible for JRS membership and (2) whether the Board properly determined that under SPP \u00a7 23-407(e) Commissioner Carven was ineligible for JRS membership based on his status as an EPS retiree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">We hold that the Board properly determined that Mrs. Carven\u2019s petition for a hearing was time barred under CO-MAR 22.0.04.06B. Consequently, we shall not reach the merits of the Board\u2019s decision denying Commissioner Carven\u2019s JRS membership eligibility based on his status as an EPS retiree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We have mentioned that COMAR 22.03.04.06B provides that \u201c[a] petition for a hearing shall be filed within 180 days of the date that a claimant is given notice of an Agency action pursuant to State Government Article, \u00a7 10-207[.]\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>determine whether Mrs. Carven\u2019s petition for a hearing was time barred under COMAR 22.03.04.06B we must consider under what circumstances an individual qualifies as a \u201cclaimant\u201d who has received \u201cnotice of an Agency action\u201d as contemplated by that regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The SRPS argues that Mrs. Carven\u2019s petition for a hearing was untimely because the Agency\u2019s May 2004 letter constituted notice of its administrative action, which triggered the 180-day time limitation established by COMAR 22.03.04.06B. The SRPS asserts that the letter conformed to SG \u00a7 10-207(b), which prescribes the contents of a notice of agency action. Consequently, to request a hearing on that action, Commissioner Carven was obligated to conform to the time limitation indicated in the letter. The SRPS contests the Circuit Court\u2019s determination that Commissioner Carven was not a \u201cclaimant\u201d when he received the May 2004 letter because he had not filed a formal membership application. The SRPS contends that Commissioner Carven was a \u201cclaimant\u201d because JRS membership is mandatory. In support, the SRPS cites SPP \u00a7 27-201, which provides that WCC commissioners are members of the JRS, and construes that provision to mean that membership is not contingent on submission of a membership application. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The SRPS submits, instead, that the membership application described in the JRS handbook is merely a tool that the SRPS uses \u201cto obtain (1) basic personal information needed to establish a retirement account, (2) proof of birth, and (3) a beneficiary designation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The SRPS further argues that the JRS benefits handbook merely \u201cprovides a summary of the features and benefits of [the] retirement plan\u201d and, \u201c[i]f there are any questions of interpretation, the provisions of the State Personnel and Pensions Article will control to resolve them.\u201d The SRPS asserts that, under the applicable statutory provisions, employee and employer contributions are not contingent on submission of a completed membership application and, instead, commence automatically upon an individual\u2019s employment in a JRS-eligible position. The SRPS further contends that its statutory mandate does not grant the SRPS the authority to condition membership upon completion of a membership application.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In response, Mrs. Carven argues that she timely petitioned for a hearing because her husband was not a \u201cclaimant\u201d until he submitted a written application for JRS membership in 2006 and she filed a petition for a hearing within 180 days of receiving the Agency\u2019s notice denying the written application. Mrs. Carven relies on COMAR 22.03.04.02B(2), which defines a \u201cclaimant\u201d as \u201ca participant or a participating employer that has filed a request for a hearing.\u201d Mrs. Carven asserts that Commissioner Carven\u2019s initial efforts to enroll in the JRS, consisting of an \u201cinformal discussion\u201d with an SRPS employee and the May 6, 2004 letter to the Board chairman requesting \u201cassistance\u201d and an \u201copportunity to informally meet with the Department,\u201d did not satisfy the JRS formal membership application requirements and, thus, Commissioner Carven was not a \u201cparticipant\u201d as contemplated by COMAR when he received the May 2004 letter. Mrs. Carven further argues that, because Commissioner Carven was not a \u201cparticipant,\u201d he was not a \u201cclaimant\u201d as defined in COMAR 22.03.04.02B(2). In that regard, Mrs. Carven contends that, despite the letter\u2019s indication otherwise, Commissioner Carven had no right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>request a hearing at the time because he had not yet \u201csatisfied the procedural requirements necessary\u201d for JRS membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Alternatively, Mrs. Carven argues that, because under CO-MAR 22.03.04.02B(2) a \u201cclaimant\u201d must have filed a request for a hearing and COMAR 22.03.04.02B(5) defines a hearing as \u201ca contested case hearing\u201d as defined under SG \u00a7 10-202, Commissioner Carven was not subject to the time limitation unless he requested a hearing related to a \u201ccontested case\u201d as defined by statute. SG \u00a7 10-202(d) defines a contested case as \u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine: (i) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required ... to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing[.]\u201d Because Commissioner Carven had not formally applied for JRS membership when he received the Agency\u2019s May 2004 letter, Mrs. Carven contends that Commissioner Carven had no \u201c \u2018right,\u2019 \u2018statutory entitlement,\u2019 or \u2018privilege\u2019 \u201d that could be determined by an agency proceeding at that time and, thus, the 180-day time limitation was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">An agency decision based on regulatory and statutory interpretation is a conclusion of law. <em>See Adventist Health Care, Inc. v. Md. Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 121, 896 A.2d 320, 331 (2006). \u201c[E]ven when reviewing an agency\u2019s legal conclusions, an appellate court must respect the agency\u2019s expertise in its field.\u201d <em>Crofton Convalescent Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>413 Md. 201, 215, 991 A.2d 1257, 1265 (2010). When an agency interprets its own regulations or the statute the agency was created to administer, we are especially mindful of that agency\u2019s expertise in its field. <em>See Adventist Health Care, </em>392 Md. at 119, 896 A.2d at 330 (\u201cAdministrative agencies possess an \u2018expertise\u2019 and, thus, have a greater ability to evaluate and determine the matters and issues that regularly arise, or can be expected to be presented, in the field in which they operate or in connection with the statute that they administer.\u201d); <em>Md.

To interpret an unambiguous statute or regulation, we must read the words as they appear. \u201cWe neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Newell, </em>407 Md. at 640-41, 967 A.2d at 766 (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cIf the meaning of the plain language is ambiguous or unclear,\u201d however, \u201cto discern legislative intent, we look to the legislative history, prior case law, the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based, and the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641, 967 A.2d. at 766 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">As stated above, COMAR 22.03.04.06B provides that \u201c[a] petition for hearing shall be filed within 180 days of the date that a claimant is given notice of an Agency action[.]\u201d The regulation appears in COMAR Title 22 \u201cState Retirement and Pension System,\u201d Subtitle 3 \u201cBoard of Trustees,\u201d Chapter 4 \u201cProcedures for Hearings by or for the Board of Trustees.\u201d COMAR 22.03.04.02B(2) defines \u201cclaimant\u201d as \u201ca participant or a participating employer that <em>has filed, a request </em>for a hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The SRPS correctly points out, however, that within that same chapter, the regulations refer to a \u201cclaimant\u201d as someone who <em>may </em>request a hearing but has not yet done so. For example, COMAR 22.03.04.06B provides that a \u201cclaimant\u201d shall file a petition for a hearing within 180 days of receiving \u201cnotice of an Agency action.\u201d In that context, the \u201cclaimant\u201d has yet to file for a hearing, but the regulation refers to the aggrieved party as a \u201cclaimant.\u201d Likewise, COMAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>22.03.04.07A provides that, \u201c[i]n a contested case, a claimant may request a hearing by submitting a petition for a hearing ... within the time limitations specified in Regulation .06B of this chapter.\u201d Again, \u201cclaimant\u201d refers to an aggrieved party who has yet to request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">To limit the definition of \u201cclaimant\u201d as it appears in these regulations to a participant or participating employer who has filed a request for a hearing would yield a nonsensical result. COMAR 22.03.04.07A essentially would authorize a participant who already has filed a request for a hearing to \u201crequest a hearing by submitting a petition for a hearing[.]\u201d This Court has often stated that, \u201c[i]n construing a statute, we seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v.

Thus, we do not construe COMAR 22.03.04.06B to apply only to participants or participating employers who have filed a request for a hearing. We retain and apply to COMAR 22.03.04.06B, however, the portion of the COMAR definition of \u201cclaimant\u201d establishing that the right to a Board hearing must be asserted by a \u201cparticipant\u201d or \u201cparticipating employer.\u201d <em>See </em>COMAR 22.03.04.02B(2) (defining \u201cclaimant\u201d as \u201ca participant or a participating employer that has filed a request for a hearing\u201d); <em>State v.

Thus, to interpret \u201cclaimant\u201d as it appears in COMAR 22.03.04.06B we refer to the other regulations within that chapter and related statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">As a point of reference, it bears repeating the relevant regulation: \u201cA petition for hearing shall be filed within 180 days of the date that a claimant is given notice of an Agency action[.]\u201d COMAR 22.03.04.06B. As stated above, the Board has defined the term \u201chearing\u201d as \u201ca contested case hearing as defined by the Administrative Procedure Act, State Government Article, Title 10, Subtitle 2, Annotated Code of Maryland [ (\u201cAPA\u201d) ].\u201d COMAR 22.03.04.02B(5).

Accordingly, we construe \u201cclaimant\u201d as it appears in COMAR 22.03.04.06B to apply to a \u201cparticipant\u201d or \u201cparticipating employer,\u201d who, upon receiving notice of an Agency action, has a statutory, regulatory, or constitutional right to \u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine ... a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege.\u201d SG \u00a7 10\u2014202(d); <em>see also Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v.

That right must come from another source such as a statute, a regulation, or due process principles.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>We now must decide whether Mrs. Carven\u2019s petition for a hearing was time barred under COMAR 22.03.04.06B as we have just construed it. For the purposes of COMAR 22.03.04.06B, Commissioner Carven was a \u201cparticipant\u201d when he received the Agency\u2019s May 2004 letter informing him that he was ineligible for JRS enrollment. SPP \u00a7 20-101(cc) defines \u201cparticipant\u201d as \u201ca beneficiary, designated beneficiary, former member, member, or retiree who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from the several systems.\u201d Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Commissioner Carven was not a \u201cmember\u201d when he received the letter, he was a retiree who \u201cmay [have] become eligible to receive a benefit of <em>any type </em>from the several systems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Although we have determined that Commissioner Carven was a \u201cparticipant\u201d when he received the letter, we still must address whether at that time he had a right to \u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine ... a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege.... \u201d <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-202(d). The Circuit Court found, and Mrs. Carven agrees, that Commissioner Carven could not have petitioned for a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing at that time because he was not a member and therefore had no \u201cright, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege\u201d to be determined in a hearing before the Board. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>Commissioner Carven\u2019s membership in the JRS was a mandatory condition of employment that commenced when he began his post as a commissioner. <em>See </em>SPP \u00a7 27-201 (providing that \u201ca member of the [WCC]\u201d is a member of the JRS); <em>see also </em>JRS Benefits Handbook (\u201cYour membership in the Judges\u2019 Retirement System is mandatory.\u201d). COMAR enrollment regulations distinguish enrollment, which is contingent on the submission of an application, from membership. <em>See </em>COMAR 22.01.12.01, 22.01.12.02 (requiring participating employers to enroll employees who are members \u201cof the State System as a condition of employment within 30 days from the first day of employment\u201d and establishing that enrollment consists of submitting, in part, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>application for membership); <em>see also </em>COMAR 22.01.12.03 (imposing penalties on participating employers who do not timely enroll members of the \u201cState system as a condition of employment\u201d). As such, Commissioner Carven had a statutory entitlement to JRS membership as soon as he began serving as a commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Given that Commissioner Carven had such an entitlement at the time he received the Agency\u2019s May 2004 letter, we now consider whether the dispute related to that entitlement rose to the level of a \u201ccontested case.\u201d \u201c[I]t is the nature of the dispute, rather than the stage of the proceedings, that determines whether or not a matter is a contested case.\u201d <em>Modular Closet Sys., Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>315 Md. 438, 444, 554 A.2d 1221, 1223 (1989). Specifically, a contested case exists when \u201cthe nature of the dispute entitles the parties to a hearing to determine their rights and duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 554 A.2d at 1224. A party\u2019s entitlement to a hearing depends on whether the acting agency\u2019s decision was sufficiently final and immediately affected the party\u2019s rights or property. <em>See id. </em>at 442-44, 447-48, 554 A.2d at 1223-24, 1225 (noting that after an agency completes its informal inquiry, if any, and issues a decision that entitles the affected individual to an eventual hearing, the dispute may become a \u201ccontested case\u201d); <em>Albert v. Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>209 Md. 27, 37-38, 120 A.2d 346, 350-51 (1956) (explaining that when an agency directly applies policy or discretion to a specific individual, and \u201cits acts are particular and immediate ..., the person whose rights or property may be affected by the action is entitled to notice and [a] hearing\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Again, whether Commissioner Carven submitted a membership application is not determinative of whether he had a right to a hearing. Instead, we consider whether the Agency\u2019s letter communicated a final decision of the matter and whether that decision immediately affected Commissioner Carven\u2019s entitlement. Even though he had not filed an application, the Agency nevertheless decided the matter conclusively. The SRPS informed Commissioner Carven twice\u2014once orally and once in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>writing\u2014that he was ineligible for membership and based its decision on grounds unrelated to Commissioner Carven\u2019s failure to file a membership application or any information that would be contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that the decision was preliminary or establishes a basis upon which Commissioner Carven could have reasonably believed the decision was preliminary or pending the submission of his membership application. The letter expressly stated that, \u201cas a retiree of the EPS, you are prohibited from earning any service credit in the JRS for your current service as a Commissioner\u201d and referred to the Agency\u2019s decision as \u201cthe result\u201d of the dispute. The letter also clearly stated that the director trusted that he had \u201cfully explained why [Commissioner Carven] [was] not eligible to accrue any service credit in the Judges\u2019 Retirement System\u201d and immediately thereafter informed Commissioner Carven of his right to appeal \u201cthis action.\u201d Additionally, and most importantly, the letter conformed to the APA\u2019s notice requirements by stating the issues involved, listing the statutory sections upon which the decision was based, and, as mentioned, advising Commissioner Carven of his opportunity to request an administrative appeal. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-207(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">These same facts undermine Mrs. Carven\u2019s contention that the \u201cinformal\u201d nature of Commissioner Carven\u2019s efforts prior to receiving the May 2004 letter rendered the Agency\u2019s decision preliminary or something less than an \u201cAgency action.\u201d The Agency\u2019s letter, in no uncertain terms, informed Commissioner Carven of the decision and just as clearly apprized him of his right to appeal \u201cthe action.\u201d Hence, regardless of Commissioner Carven\u2019s intent or belief about the informal nature of his inquiry prior to receiving that letter, he could not reasonably have believed after receiving the letter that the Agency\u2019s decision was merely advisory or preliminary, pending additional action on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">As to the immediacy of the impact of the Agency\u2019s decision, we agree with the Board\u2019s determination that the impact was sufficient to entitle Commissioner Carven to a hearing. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>decision precluded him from earning service credit while serving on the WCC and prevented the WCC from collecting member contributions for his future benefit. Given that Commissioner Carven was serving on the commission when he received the letter, and that his JRS membership had been denied orally even before receiving the letter, the effect could not have been more immediate.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">For these reasons, we agree with the Board that, when Commissioner Carven received the Agency\u2019s May 2004 letter informing him that he was ineligible for JRS membership, the \u201cnature of the dispute\u201d was such that Commissioner Carven\u2019s entitlement had been denied finally, effective immediately, thereby granting Commissioner Carven a right to appeal that decision by petitioning for a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-207(a), (b)(4) (requiring an agency to \u201cgive reasonable notice\u201d of an agency action and to inform the recipient that he or she \u201cmay have an opportunity to request a hearing\u201d); COMAR 22.08.04.07 (establishing procedures through which a \u201cclaimant\u201d in a contested case may request a hearing); <em>State Retirement &amp; Pension Sys. v. Thompson, </em>368 Md. 53, 63-64, 792 A.2d 277, 283-84 (2002) (noting that the SRPS is required to give notice of its actions and afford an opportunity for a hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In turn, we hold that, because Commissioner Carven was a \u201cparticipant\u201d who possessed a statutory entitlement when he received the Agency\u2019s May 2004 letter and the nature of the dispute at that time was such that he was entitled to a hearing, Commissioner Carven was a \u201cclaimant\u201d for the purposes of the time limitation set forth in COMAR 22.03.04.06B. We further hold that, because, as stated above, the Agency\u2019s letter conformed to the APA notice requirements, that letter constituted notice of an Agency action as contemplated by COMAR 22.03.04.06B, and the 180-day time limitation ran as of the date of that letter. Accordingly, we shall affirm the Board\u2019s denial of Mrs. Carven\u2019s petition for an administrative hearing on the ground that her petition was time barred under COMAR 22.03.04.06B.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court on the ground that the Board properly determined that Mrs. Carveris petition for a hearing was time barred under COMAR 22.03.04.06B. We therefore remand the case to that court with directions to dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO DISMISS THE ACTION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT/CROSS-APPELLEE.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">BELL, C.J., HARRELL and MURPHY, JJ., Dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-12\">.

In response, SRPS Executive Director, R. Dean Kenderline, advised Petitioner that he would recommend that the Board of Trustees issue a summary decision and deny the requested relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1. In his letter, Kenderline explained that he believed the petition was untimely because it was not submitted within one hundred eighty (180) days of the May 24, 2004 letter from SRPS [to Commissioner Carven, her deceased husband].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">In support of his finding that the petition was untimely, Kenderline cited COMAR 22.03.04.06[ (B) ]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">(B) Time Limitations. A petition for a hearing shall be filed within 180 days of the date that a claimant is given notice of an agency action pursuant to State Government Article, Section 10-207, Annotated Code of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u201cClaimant\u201d is defined as a <em>participant \u201cwho has </em>filed a request for hearing.\u201d \u201cHearing\u201d is defined as \u201ca contested case hearing____\u201d A \u201ccontested case\u201d is defined as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">... a proceeding before an agency to determine: (I) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">The various actions taken by [Commissioner] Carven to resolve the eligibility issue before he submitted his application for JRS membership were preliminary and informal. As a result, the one hundred eighty (180) day time period did not begin to run from the date of the May 6, 2004 letter as Respondent contends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">Since [Commissioner] Carven did not apply for a membership in JRS until June 17, 2006, he was not a \u201cclaimant\u201d within the meaning of the aforementioned regulation. As a result, [he] had no \u201cright, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege\u201d to challenge his denial of JRS membership until after the September 7, 2006 \u201crejection\u201d letter. Thus, Kenderline and the Board erred in concluding that [Mrs.] Carven\u2019s request for hearing was time barred. [Mrs.] Carven was not subject to the one hundred eighty (180) day time limitation as of the May 24, 2004 letter from SRPS providing notice of Agency action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">(Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">I agree with that analysis. Because the ambiguous CO-MAR regulation at issue applies to a remedial statute, the regulation should be liberally construed in favor of the claimant. In my opinion, if the Board actually thought that the Executive Director\u2019s May 24, 2004 response was providing Commissioner Carven with \u201cnotice of Agency action,\u201d that correspondence should have expressly advised him about both his right to petition for a hearing and the time limitation on that right.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, I have no doubt whatsoever that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Commissioner Carven had filed a petition for hearing as soon as he received the Executive Director\u2019s May 24, 2004 response, the Board would have denied the petition as \u201cpremature.\u201d I would therefore hold that there is no merit in the argument that Mrs. Carven\u2019s Petition was filed too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">In addition to rejecting the Board\u2019s \u201ctime barred\u201d argument, this Court should proceed to apply the <em>current </em>version of SPP \u00a7 28-408 to the merits of Mrs. Carven\u2019s claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">Maryland consistently has followed the rule that \u201can appellate court is bound to decide a case according to existing laws, even though a judgment rightful when rendered by the court below should be reversed as a consequence,\u201d as Judge Markell, for the Court, repeated in <em>Woman\u2019s Club v. State Tax Comm., </em>195 Md. 16, 19 [, 72 A.2d 742, 743 (1950) ] (or, it may be noted, even when a judgment wrong when rendered is made right by the change in the law). See also for this proposition that a change in the law after a decision below and before final decision by the appellate Court will be applied by that Court unless vested or accrued substantive rights would be disturbed or unless the legislature shows a contrary intent, <em>Keller v. State, </em>12 Md. 322 [(1858)]; <em>Day v. Day, 22 </em>Md. 530 [(1865)]; <em>Gordy v. Prince, </em>175 Md. 688 [, 7 A.2d 611 (1939) ]; <em>Cockerham v.

Shaffer, </em>191 Md. 342 [, 62 A.2d 346 (1948) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\"><em>Yorkdale v. Powell, </em>237 Md. 121, 124, 205 A.2d 269, 270 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Rather than remand this ease to the Circuit Court \u201cwith directions to dismiss the action,\u201d this Court should reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court, and remand with directions that the Circuit Court reverse the decision of the Board and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>remand Mrs. Carven\u2019s claim to the Board for a computation of the benefits to which she is entitled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge HARRELL have authorized me to state that they join this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\">. Because of the understandable confusion over the issue of whether a particular letter written by a bureaucrat does or does not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u201cnotice of agency action,\u201d <em>\u201cthere oughta be a law </em>\u201d requiring that, when an agency provides what it considers to be a \u201cnotice of action\u201d to a person who is required to challenge the agency\u2019s action within a limited period of time, the notice must expressly advise the recipient of any time limitation on the recipient\u2019s right to challenge the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-16\">.
