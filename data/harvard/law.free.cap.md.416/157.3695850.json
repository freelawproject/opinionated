Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 8-401 to 8-417 of the Correctional Services Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, we are asked to determine whether the Circuit Court for Cecil County correctly interpreted the IAD to require dismissal of the criminal charges against Appellee, Caleb Micha Pair, on the ground that Appellant, the State of Maryland (\u201cthe State\u201d), failed to comply with the 180-day speedy trial period set forth in the IAD. The State appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari before briefing and argument in that court. For the following reasons, we affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The IAD, to which Maryland became a signatory in 1965, is a congressionally sanctioned compact among forty-eight states, the Federal Government, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. Drafted in 1956 by the Council of State Governments, the IAD has its origins in a report by a group of federal, state, and private entities (the \u201cJoint Committee on Detainers\u201d) highlighting the significant problems arising from the use of detainers. The IAD is based on a legislative finding that \u201c \u2018charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 351, 98 S.Ct. 1834, 56 L.Ed.2d 329 (1978) (quoting Article I of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>IAD, found at \u00a7 8-403). The Supreme Court explained in <em>Carchman v. Nash:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">The inmate who has a detainer against him is filled with anxiety and apprehension and frequently does not respond to a training program. He often must be kept in close custody, which bars him from treatment such as trustyships, moderations of custody and opportunity for transfer to farms and work camps. In many jurisdictions he is not eligible for parole; there is little hope for his release after an optimum period of training and treatment, when he is ready for return to society with an excellent possibility that he will not offend again. Instead, he often becomes embittered with continued institutionalization and the objective of the correctional system is defeated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">473 U.S. 716, 720, 105 S.Ct. 3401, 87 L.Ed.2d 516 (1985) (quoting Council of State Governments, Suggested State Legislation, Program for 1957, p. 74 (1956)). <em>See also generally </em>Christopher D. Serf, <em>Federal Habeas Corpus Review of Non-constitutional Errors: The Cognizability of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, </em>83 Colum. L.Rev. 975, 978 (1983) (summarizing the significant hardships that detainers imposed upon prisoners prior to enactment of the IAD).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The IAD consists of nine articles, the first of which sets forth its policy and purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this Agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this Agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Article-1 (\u00a7 8-403). In short, the purpose of the IAD is to facilitate speedy disposition of charges underlying detainers.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The IAD sets forth two procedures designed to effectuate its purpose. First, Article IV of the IAD (\u00a7 8-406) \u201cenables a participating State to gain custody of a prisoner incarcerated in another jurisdiction, in order to try him on criminal charges[,]\u201d <em>Reed v. Farley, </em>512 U.S. 339, 341, 114 S.Ct. 2291, 129 L.Ed.2d 277 (1994), and, second, Article III (\u00a7 8-405) \u201cgives a prisoner incarcerated in one State the right to demand the speedy disposition of any untried indictment, information or complaint that is the basis of a detainer lodged against him by another State[,]\u201d <em>Carchman, </em>473 U.S. at 718-19, 105 S.Ct. 3401 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The present case involves a prisoner\u2019s request, pursuant to \u00a7 8-405, for a speedy disposition of outstanding charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The interstate transfer process begins when the \u201creceiving\u201d state lodges a detainer with the warden \u201cor other official\u201d of the institution where the prisoner in question is currently imprisoned, in what is referred to as the custodial or \u201csending\u201d state. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8-405(b). The warden or other authority in the sending state is then obligated to inform the inmate of the detainer\u2019s source and contents, and of the inmate\u2019s right, under the IAD, to request final disposition of the charges on which the detainer is based. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8-405(c). ,</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">To exercise the right of speedy disposition, the inmate must file a request for IAD relief with the warden, who must forward the request to appropriate authorities in the receiving state. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8-405(d). This document operates as a request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>by the prisoner for final disposition of all untried charges underlying the detainer and is deemed to be a waiver of extradition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8-405(d); <em>Mauro, </em>436 U.S. at 351, 98 S.Ct. 1834.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Once the receiving state receives the request,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the IAD requires that jurisdiction to bring the prisoner to trial within 180 days, unless one of two provisions of the IAD is invoked. The first of these provides that a court in the receiving state may issue a continuance \u201cfor good cause shown in open court,\u201d so long as the continuance is \u201cnecessary and reasonable\u201d and \u201cthe prisoner or the prisoner\u2019s counsel [is] present.\u201d \u00a7 8-405(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The second provides that the 180-day requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201cshall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is <em>unable to stand trial, </em>as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.\u201d \u00a7 8-408(a) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If neither of these tolling provisions is properly invoked, then the receiving state\u2019s failure to comply with the 180-day provision requires dismissal of the charges, with prejudice. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8-407(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Because the purpose of the IAD is to help effectuate the rehabilitative process for those who are incarcerated, it applies only to individuals who have \u201centered upon a term of imprisonment.\u201d \u00a7 8-405(a). As we shall discuss in more detail, <em>infra, </em>the IAD has been interpreted not to apply to individuals in pre-trial confinement who are awaiting the disposition of charges brought by the state in which they are detained. <em>See, e.g., Painter v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 1, 17, 848 A.2d 692, 701 (2004) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Appellee was convicted of robbery by a Delaware state court in August 2005, and began serving the sentence for that crime at a correctional facility in that state. Just over one month after the Delaware robbery conviction, Appellee was indicted in the Circuit Court for Cecil County, Maryland, on an unrelated charge of armed robbery. On May 18, 2006, the State lodged a detainer with the proper authority in Delaware, a signatory to the IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Appellee timely filed a request under the IAD for disposition of the charges. The State received that request on July 26, 2007, and offered to take temporary custody of Appellee until final disposition of the charges. On September 6, 2007, Delaware refused the offer because, meanwhile, Delaware had charged Appellee with assault and related offenses arising out of a March 2007 incident allegedly involving Appellee and a correctional officer at the institution where Appellee was housed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The following day, September 7, 2007, an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Cecil County filed in the Circuit Court for Cecil County a motion for continuance of trial on the Maryland charges until resolution of the pending Delaware charges. We have mentioned that the IAD requires continuances to be granted upon \u201cgood cause shown in open court, the prisoner or the prisoner\u2019s counsel being present!.]\u201d \u00a7 8-405(a). The Circuit Court granted the motion four days later, without conducting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">On May 6, 2008, Appellee was acquitted of all the Delaware charges. Delaware, however, did not inform the Cecil County State\u2019s Attorney Office of the acquittal. Indeed, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office did not learn of the outcome of the Delaware proceedings until July 24, 2008, when it received Appellee\u2019s second request for IAD relief. Following that, the State accepted temporary custody of Appellee and set a trial date of October 15, 2008, for disposition of the pending Maryland charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>On that date, Appellee, represented by counsel, filed a motion to dismiss the charges, citing the State\u2019s failure to prosecute him within 180 days of July 26, 2007, the date on which the State received his initial request. Appellee argued that, although Delaware had informed the State that it was unwilling to send Appellee to Maryland for trial, Delaware\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s request for temporary transfer did not abrogate the State\u2019s responsibilities under the IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The State offered three arguments in opposition to the motion to dismiss. The State argued that Appellee\u2019s incarceration in Delaware constituted what the State described as \u201cpretrial confinement awaiting disposition of [his] charge,\u201d so the IAD, and consequently its 180-day requirement, did not apply. The State also argued that the continuance the Circuit Court granted in September 2007 tolled the 180-day period for the duration of the time leading up to Appellee\u2019s temporary transfer to Maryland on July 24, 2008. Finally, the State argued that, even if the continuance did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 8-405, the 180-day time period nonetheless was tolled from September 6, 2007 (the date Maryland learned of Delaware\u2019s refusal to transfer Appellee) until Appellee\u2019s transfer to Maryland on July 24, 2008, because, pursuant to \u00a7 8-408(a), Appellee was \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d in Maryland during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The Circuit Court (the Honorable Dexter M. Thompson, Jr. presiding) heard the motion to dismiss. The court rejected each of the State\u2019s arguments and, agreeing with Appellee that Maryland had violated the 180-day provision of the IAD, dismissed the charges with prejudice. The court reasoned that \u201cthe IAD definitely applies\u201d to Appellee because, when Maryland lodged the detainer, Appellee met the condition of the IAD that he had \u201centered upon a term of imprisonment\u201d in Delaware, even though, for some period of time thereafter, he was also awaiting trial on the new Delaware assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The court also found no merit in the State\u2019s argument that the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of the State\u2019s September 7, 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>request for continuance tolled the 180-day clock. The court ruled that the continuance was without effect because it was obtained without compliance with the IAD requirement of a hearing in open court, with Appellee or his counsel present.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The court then turned to the State\u2019s contention that Appellee had been \u201cunable to stand trial,\u201d under \u00a7 8-408(a), on the Maryland charges because of Delaware\u2019s refusal to send him during the pendency of the Delaware assault charges. The court divided into four time periods the 447 days between the time Appellee requested disposition of the Maryland charges and the scheduled trial date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">(1) the 42 days between July 26, 2007, when Maryland received Appellee\u2019s initial IAD request, and September 6, 2007, when Delaware informed Maryland that it would not send him to Maryland for trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">(2) the 243 days between September 6, 2007, and May 6, 2008, when Appellee was acquitted of the new charges in Delaware;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">(3) the 79 days between May 6, 2008, and July 24, 2008, when Maryland learned of the acquittal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">(4) the 83 days between July 24, 2008, and October 15, 2008, the scheduled trial date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">The court found no tolling dining the first period (42 days). The court found tolling during the second period (243 days) because \u201cDelaware refused to send [Appellee] to Maryland\u201d pending disposition of the Delaware charges. The court disagreed with the State, however, that such tolling continued beyond May 6, 2008, the date on which Appellee was acquitted of those charges. Rather, the court reasoned, the 180-day clock resumed on that day and ran for 79 days through July 24, 2008, the day the State learned about the acquittal (the third period), and continued for another 83 days to the scheduled trial date of October 15, 2008 (the fourth period), which, when added to the 42 days at the outset, created a total delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>of 204 days. Because the total non-tolled time exceeded 180 days, the court concluded that dismissal of the indictment was required by the terms of \u00a7 8\u2014407(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The State noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On September 14, 2009, before briefing and argument in that court, we granted a writ of certiorari, <em>State v. Pair, </em>410 Md. 559, 979 A.2d 707 (2009), to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">Did the circuit court err in dismissing the charges on the basis of violation of the 180-day period of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers where the trial court failed to toll the 180-day period as required after Delaware refused to transfer [Appellee] and [Appellee] was unable to stand trial in Maryland as a result?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The propriety of the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of the charges hinges on whether that court correctly interpreted and applied the IAD to the facts before it. As the facts are not in dispute, we have only to decide whether the court was legally correct in its interpretation of the law. <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175, 184 (2006). In doing so, we must examine the provisions of the IAD with the goal of ascertaining the legislative intent, by resorting first to the plain language of the law. <em>Thanner v. Balt. County, </em>414 Md. 265, 277, 995 A.2d 257, 264 (2010). We strive to avoid constructions that are inconsistent with common sense or render any of the statutory language nugatory or surplusage. <em>Lonaconing Trap Club, Inc. v. Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t, </em>410 Md. 326, 339, 978 A.2d 702, 709 (2009). If the language is ambiguous because it is susceptible to more than one equally reasonable construction, we look to legislative intent to resolve the ambiguity. <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 477, 842 A.2d 743, 746 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The IAD is a congressionally sanctioned compact, and as a federal law is subject to federal construction. <em>Cuyler v. Adams, </em>449 U.S. 433, 442, 101 S.Ct. 703, 66 L.Ed.2d 641 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>(1981). Therefore, we defer to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of it. Moreover, by its express terms, the IAD \u201cshall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes.\u201d \u00a7 8-411.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We turn first to the State\u2019s argument that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that the IAD applies to the facts of this case. In the State\u2019s view, the IAD does not apply because, in terms of IAD law, Appellee was not serving \u201ca term of imprisonment\u201d in Delaware, but was instead in \u201cpretrial status\u201d in that state due to the pending Delaware charges. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AUb\">We have said that the IAD requires that a prisoner subject to a detainer must \u201cha[ve] entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state,\u201d \u00a7 8-405(a), at the time the detainer was lodged, in order to invoke the speedy trial provision of the IAD. We also have mentioned that courts have consistently construed that language to mean that the IAD does not apply to a prisoner in pre-trial confinement. <em>Painter, </em>157 Md.App. at 17, 848 A.2d at 701. <em>See United States v. Currier, </em>836 F.2d 11, 16 (1st Cir.1987) (the IAD applies \u201cexclusively to prisoners who are actually serving their sentences, and not to pretrial detainees\u201d); <em>accord United States v. Wilson, </em>27 F.3d 1126, 1130 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 976, 115 S.Ct. 452, 130 L.Ed.2d 361 (1994); <em>United States v. Muniz, </em>1 F.3d 1018, 1025-26 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1002, 114 S.Ct. 575, 126 L.Ed.2d 474 (1993); <em>United States v.

Hargrove, </em>273 Kan. 314, 45 P.3d 376, 383, <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 982, 123 S.Ct. 452, 154 L.Ed.2d 345 (2002); <em>State v. Reed, </em>266 Neb. 641, 668 N.W.2d 245, 251-52 (2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1154, 124 S.Ct. 1158, 157 L.Ed.2d 1051 (2004). We agree with the Painter Court\u2019s assessment of the \u201centered upon a term of imprisonment\u201d limitation on the applicability of the IAD:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>[This] limitation is consistent with the point of the Agreement---- [T]he purpose of the IAD is to minimize the adverse impact of a foreign prosecution on rehabilitative programs of the confining jurisdiction. As a pretrial detainee has little or no interest in any of the rehabilitative programs of the institution[ ] in which he is being temporarily detained pending trial, there is no basis to justify invoking the IAD.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">157 Md.App. at 17, 848 A.2d at 701 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">It is undisputed that, when the State lodged the detainer, Appellee, then serving the sentence imposed upon his August 2005 robbery conviction, had \u201centered upon a term of imprisonment\u201d in Delaware. The State\u2019s insistence that, for purposes of the IAD, Appellee was in pre-trial detention in Delaware confuses the basis for Delaware\u2019s incarceration of Appellee in the first place (the 2005 conviction) with Delaware\u2019s reason for subsequently refusing to send him to Maryland (the pendency of the new assault charges). Moreover, even if the language of \u00a7 8-405(a) supports the State\u2019s argument, which it does not, the argument is undermined by a critical fact: Appellee could not have been in pre-trial detention at the time the State filed the detainer because the incident that formed the basis of the new Delaware charges occurred ten months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Beyond that, the State\u2019s argument subverts the purpose of the IAD, which is avoidance of interruption of the rehabilitative efforts on the inmate\u2019s behalf in the sending state. The pendency of the Delaware charges does not change the fact that before, while, and after the charges were pending, Appellee was serving a term of imprisonment on the 2005 Delaware conviction. Appellee therefore maintained throughout his confinement in Delaware a continued interest in his rehabilitation and in avoiding any adverse consequences on the conditions of his confinement that may have been precipitated by the detainer. <em>See United States v. Roy, </em>771 F.2d 54, 58 (2d Cir.1985) (holding that a prisoner who was serving a sentence on a Connecticut conviction could invoke the protections of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>IAD in response to a federal detainer because \u201c[t]he fact that additional Connecticut charges were pending against him did not diminish his interests in his rehabilitation and in avoiding the adverse consequences on the conditions of his confinement caused by the filing of a detainer\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1110, 106 S.Ct. 1520, 89 L.Ed.2d 918 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We therefore hold that Appellee was serving \u201ca term of imprisonment\u201d in a Delaware state correctional institution within the meaning of the IAD, notwithstanding that, for a period of time during that incarceration, he also faced pending Delaware charges. The IAD therefore applies to Appellee, and he is entitled to the speedy trial protections afforded by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We now consider whether the Circuit Court properly concluded that the State violated the 180-day speedy trial provision of the IAD. There is no question that a total of 447 days elapsed between July 26, 2007, the date on which Maryland received Appellee\u2019s initial request for speedy disposition of the charges and October 15, 2008, the scheduled trial date. The question is whether enough of that 447-day period, if any portion of it at all, was tolled so as to bring the State into compliance with the 180-day requirement of the IAD. The parties do not dispute the four-period breakdown used by the Circuit Court in addressing this issue, and we adopt it as we consider the State\u2019s challenge to the legal correctness of the court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The State concedes that the Circuit Court correctly concluded that the 180-day period began to run on July 26, 2007, and ran for 42 days until September 6, 2007, when Delaware informed Maryland that Appellee could not be transferred because of the by-then pending charges in Delaware. We agree with the State that the court correctly charged that first 42-day period against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The State, looking next to the fourth period, further concedes that the court correctly determined that the 83 days from July 24, 2008, when Maryland received notice from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Appellee of his acquittal of the assault, until the October 15 scheduled trial date count against the State in the 180-day calculation. Again, we agree with the State that the court correctly analyzed that time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The parties dispute the effect upon the 180-day calculus of the second and third time periods. The second period, totaling 243 days, ran from September 6, 2007, when Delaware notified Maryland of its refusal to send Appellee to Maryland before disposition of the Delaware charges, through May 6, 2008, the date on which Appellee was acquitted of those charges. The Circuit Court concluded that the 180-day period was tolled for those 243 days because, during that time, Appellee was \u201cunable to stand trial,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 8-408(a). The State, not surprisingly, agrees with the court\u2019s conclusion, arguing that it is consistent with a proper construction of the term \u201cunable to stand trial.\u201d Appellee disagrees, arguing that only the six days during which he was being tried on the Delaware charges was he \u201cunable to stand\u201d trial in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As for the 79 days of the third period, that is, the time between Appellee\u2019s acquittal on May 6, 2008, and July 24, 2008, the day the State learned of it, the Circuit Court concluded that the 180-day time period was not tolled because the IAD places on the State the responsibility to bring Appellee to trial, \u201ceven though the State of Maryland might not have done anything wrong.\u201d The State challenges this analysis, arguing that it should not be penalized for Delaware\u2019s failure to alert Maryland officials that Appellee had been acquitted. Appellee responds that the Circuit Court correctly decided that this third, 79-day period should be charged against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The parties\u2019 arguments therefore reduce to the following: By the State\u2019s reasoning, the 180-day speedy trial clock was tolled for all of both the second period (243 days) and the third period (79 days) because for all of that time Appellee was \u201cunable to stand trial.\u201d Therefore, only 125 days of the total period (447 days) count in the speedy trial calculus, resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>in no violation of the 180-day requirement as of October 15, 2008, the date on which the Circuit Court wrongly, in the State\u2019s view, dismissed the charges. By Appellee\u2019s reasoning, only six days (the days of the Delaware assault trial) were tolled because for only those days was he unable to stand trial in Maryland, resulting in a 441-day delay in bringing him to trial on the Maryland charges, thereby violating the IAD. The Circuit Court, as we have seen, disagreed with both parties and concluded that only during the second, 243-day period was Appellee unable to stand trial, resulting in a delay of 204 days in bringing Appellee to trial in Maryland, thereby violating the IAD and requiring dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We, like the parties and the Circuit Court, view the outcome of this appeal as ultimately turning on the meaning of the phrase \u201cunable to stand trial,\u201d as it is employed in the IAD. For the reasons we next discuss, we agree with the Circuit Court that Appellee was \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d in Maryland only for the 243-day period during which the assault charges were pending against him in Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The parties have not directed us to a Maryland appellate decision construing the phrase \u201cunable to stand trial,\u201d and we have found none. In construing that phrase, however, we do not write on a clean slate. Our research discloses that, with the apparent exception of the Fifth Circuit, all of the federal and state courts that have addressed this issue in reported decisions have held, albeit through slightly different analyses, that a prisoner who desires a speedy disposition of a detainer is \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d on the charges underlying the detainer whenever such unavailability can be attributed to \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cadministrative\u201d reasons, such as, in the present case, the pendency of charges in the sending jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits interpret the term \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d by reference to the analogous tolling provision contained in the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h) (2008), which tolls the 180-day speedy trial require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ment in various circumstances, including \u201cdelay resulting from trial with respect to other charges against the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Those courts reason that the Speedy Trial Act and the LAD have the same purpose and should therefore be construed <em>in pan materia. See United States v. Collins, </em>90 F.3d 1420, 1427 (9th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Cephas, </em>937 F.2d 816, 819 (2d Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1037, 112 S.Ct. 884, 116 L.Ed.2d 788 (1992); <em>United States v. Odom, </em>674 F.2d 228, 231-32 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1125, 102 S.Ct. 2946, 73 L.Ed.2d 1341 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The Seventh and Eighth Circuits simply toll the 180-day period while the prisoner is \u201clegally or administratively\u201d unavailable. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>564 F.3d 1351, 1354 (8th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Roy, </em>830 F.2d 628, 635 (7th Cir.1987); <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1068, 108 S.Ct. 1033, 98 L.Ed.2d 997 (1988). Particularly pertinent here, the Eighth Circuit has held that a prisoner is \u201clegally or administratively\u201d unavailable to be sent elsewhere to stand trial on a detainer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>for as long as the prisoner is involved in court proceedings in the sending jurisdiction. <em>See Young v. Mabry, </em>596 F.2d 339, 343 (8th Cir.) (holding that the time the defendant was in federal custody awaiting trial on federal charges was properly excluded in determining, under the IAD, whether the defendant was brought to trial on the state charges on which the defendant had requested speedy disposition), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 853, 100 S.Ct. 107, 62 L.Ed.2d 69 (1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Insofar as we can discern, the Fifth Circuit is alone among the federal courts that have spoken on the subject, by interpreting the \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d proviso as applying only to prisoners who are physically or mentally incapacitated. <em>See Birdwell v. Skeen, </em>983 F.2d 1332, 1341 (5th Cir.1993) (construing the phrase \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d to mean only a physical or mental inability, which does not include the delay attendant to the processing of pre-trial motions).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Like the federal courts, our sister state courts employ various analyses for determining when an inmate is \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d due to out-of-jurisdiction charges. Yet, all conclude, like most of the federal courts we have identified, that the standard for inability to stand trial is one akin to \u201clegal or administrative\u201d unavailability, which includes the unavailability to stand trial in the receiving state until pending charges in the sending state are resolved. <em>See Johnson v. Comm\u2019r of Corr., </em>60 Conn.App. 1, 758 A.2d 442, 450-51 (2000) (affirming the denial of a Connecticut prisoner\u2019s petition to quash a Massachusetts detainer because, until the prisoner\u2019s charges were resolved in Connecticut, he was \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d in Massachusetts, thereby tolling the 180-day requirement); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>State v. Wood, </em>241 N.W.2d 8, 14 (Iowa 1976) (prisoner unable to stand trial in Iowa during pendency of proceedings in Kansas); <em>State v. Binn, </em>208 N.J.Super. 443, 506 A.2d 67, 69-70 (App.Div.1986) (prisoner unable to stand trial in New Jersey because of the legitimate claim of New York to hold him to dispose of the remaining New York charges); <em>People v. Vrlaku, </em>134 A.D.2d 105, 523 N.Y.S.2d 143 (N.Y.App.Div.1988) (tolling properly applied while prisoner awaited federal drug charges in federal detention facility); <em>aff'd, </em>73 N.Y.2d 800, 537 N.Y.S.2d 24, 533 N.E.2d 1053 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Like the majority of our sister federal and state courts, we construe the \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d language of \u00a7 8-408(a) to include the time during which the sending jurisdiction is actively prosecuting the inmate on current and pending charges. This construction is consistent with a practical commonsense interpretation of \u00a7 8-408(a), and with the purpose clause of the IAD, which explains the necessity for \u201ccooperative procedures\u201d among the states, <em>see </em>\u00a7 8-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">We reject Appellee\u2019s suggestion that Maryland had the responsibility to persuade Delaware to send Appellee to Maryland while he was awaiting resolution of the Delaware charges. Although the IAD requires that the sending state \u201cshall offer to deliver temporary custody of [a] prisoner\u201d to the receiving state, \u00a7 8-407(a), the IAD does not require the sending state to transfer a prisoner who faces pending charges in that state. We therefore are in accord with the cases cited above that the IAD is not designed to deprive the sending state of its right to resolve pending charges in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Applying this construction of \u00a7 8-408(a) to the present case, we hold that the 180-day speedy trial period of the IAD was properly tolled for all of the 243 days during which Appellee awaited disposition of the Delaware assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Finally, we must decide whether the State is correct that Appellee also was \u201cunable to stand trial\u201d on the Maryland charges during the 79 days between the date on which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>acquitted on the Delaware charges and the date on which Maryland learned, through Appellee, of the acquittal. The Circuit Court decided that this period should not count as a time when Appellee was unable to stand trial, and Appellee, of course, concurs. Once again we agree with the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Courts have routinely stressed that the IAD is remedial in nature and should be liberally construed in favor of the prisoner against whom the detainer is lodged. <em>See United States ex rel. Esola v. Groomes, </em>520 F.2d 830, 836 (3d Cir.1975); <em>State v. Sassoon, </em>240 Ga. 745, 242 S.E.2d 121, 122-23 (1978); <em>People v. Christensen, </em>102 Ill.2d 321, 80 Ill.Dec. 302, 465 N.E.2d 93, 96 (1984); <em>Commonwealth v. Thurston, </em>834 A.2d 595, 599 (Pa.Super.Ct.2003). It is also understood that \u201c[t]he burden of compliance with the procedural requirements of the IAD rests upon the party states and their agents; the prisoner, who is to benefit by this statute, is not to be held accountable for official administrative errors which deprive him of that benefit.\u201d <em>Pittman v. State, </em>301 A.2d 509, 514 (Del.1973). Moreover, \u201c[u]nreasonable time delays caused by the custodial state do not toll the statutory [180-day] period.\u201d <em>Short v. State, </em>205 P.3d 195, 200 (Wyo.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Pittman, </em>the Delaware Supreme Court addressed whether the receiving state must be charged for delays attributable to the sending state. In that case, the trial court refused to dismiss the Delaware charges against the prisoner even though Delaware had failed to bring the prisoner to trial within 180 days of his request for IAD relief. Delaware argued that the delay was caused by Maryland\u2019s failure to abide by the IAD by not forwarding Pittman\u2019s request for IAD relief to the relevant Delaware official, and that \u201cthe mistakes of the Maryland officials should not frustrate Delaware\u2019s timely attempt to bring accused felons to trial.\u201d 301 A.2d at 512. The Delaware Supreme Court reversed, holding that the IAD required dismissal of the charges. The court explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">[i]f, ... as the State urges, we should strictly construe this statute, we must do so in favor of the prisoner because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the State, through its agents and its control of the procedural aspects of the IAD, controls the only ultimate guarantee of performance for the benefit of the prisoner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">.... It would be a gross violation of the spirit of the IAD if we were to penalize Pittman for the neglect of the [Delaware] Attorney General\u2019s office or the mistake of the Maryland official. The purpose of the Act is to enable a prisoner in another state to compel prompt trial of a criminal charge in Delaware without awaiting his release in the other state. That purpose is completely destroyed if state officials fail to perform the duties imposed upon them by the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 513. To conclude otherwise,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An5\">not only misreads the purpose [of the IAD], but effectively emasculates it as well. The Legislature enacted no specific requirement that a prisoner, for whose benefit the IAD was enacted, be apprised of the technical aspects of the law. Indeed, the Legislature has placed one, and only one burden on the prisoner, that is, to ask the prison official who has custody over him to prepare and send the forms to the jurisdiction from which a detainer is lodged against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adp\"><em>Id. </em>at 512-13. <em>See Nelms v. State, </em>532 S.W.2d 923, 926-27 (Tenn.1976) (noting that \u201c[the defendant] should not be charged with the responsibility of insuring [sic] that his captors have complied with provisions of the law when he has no control over their activities. By placing the burden of insuring [sic] compliance on the two states involved, the defendant is less likely to become the victim of their contributory inaction\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord State v. Ferguson, </em>41 Ohio App.3d 306, 535 N.E.2d 708, 713-14 (1987) (discussing with favor <em>Pittman </em>and <em>Nelms, </em>and concluding that \u201cthe sending state\u2019s failure to inform the receiving state of the accused\u2019s whereabouts or offer temporary custody does not justify the receiving state\u2019s inability to bring the accused to trial within one hundred eighty days\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">We agree with the reasoning underpinning the decisions in <em>Pittman, Nelms </em>and <em>Ferguson, </em>which leads us readily to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>conclude that Appellee was <em>not </em>\u201cunable to stand trial\u201d in Maryland within the meaning of the IAD during the 79 days between his acquittal in Delaware and Maryland\u2019s learning of that fact. We therefore hold that the Circuit Court correctly ruled that the 180-day speedy trial period in the IAD was not tolled during the 79 days that followed Appellee\u2019s acquittal of the Delaware charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In sum, the 42 days that elapsed following receipt by the appropriate Maryland authorities of Appellee\u2019s request for speedy disposition of the Maryland charges, added to the 79 days between Appellee\u2019s acquittal of the Delaware charges and Maryland\u2019s learning of it, and to the subsequent 88 days leading to up to Appellee\u2019s scheduled trial date of October 15, 2008, results in 204 non-tolled days. Because the delay exceeded 180 days, the Circuit Court did not err in dismissing the indictment, with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY CECIL COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Judge MURPHY joins the judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\">.

The IAD does not define \"detainer.\u201d We have described a detainer as \"a notification filed with the institution in which a prisoner is serving a sentence, advising that he is wanted to face pending criminal charges in another jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>State, </em>344 Md. 97, 108, 685 A.2d 441, 446 (1996) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">. Section 8-416 states that the 180-day time period does not begin until the appropriate court and the appropriate State\u2019s Attorney or other authorized person \"actually receive!]\u201d the prisoner\u2019s request. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">As to any request by an individual confined in another party state for trial in this State, written notice may not be deemed to have been delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of this State in accordance with \u00a7 8-405(a) (Article III (a) of the Agreement) of this subtitle and notification may not be deemed to have been given in accordance with \u00a7 8-A05(d) or \u00a7 8-406(b) of this subtitle (Article III (d) and Article IV (b) of the Agreement) until the notice or notification is actually received by the appropriate court and the appropriate State\u2019s Attorney of this State, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s deputy or assistant, or any other person empowered to receive mail on behalf of the State\u2019s Attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Maryland may well be the only party state to have added a provision of this sort to its IAD. In any event, the Supreme Court has interpreted the \"caused to be delivered\u201d phrase in \u00a7 8-405(a) of the IAD to commence the running of the 180-day period upon receipt of the prisoner\u2019s request for a speedy disposition of the charges that are the subject of the detainer. <em>Fex v.
