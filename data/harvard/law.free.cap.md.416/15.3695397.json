Petitioner was claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, and the judge was concerned that the self-damning affidavit submitted by Petitioner\u2019s previous OPD trial counsel was the product of coercion. While exercising her official duties in unrelated matters, the judge had learned of an internal OPD assessment program in which Baltimore County OPD juvenile lawyers were evaluated with the potential for adverse employment consequences. One of Petitioner\u2019s post-delinquency counsel was an investigator for the program and Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel may have been among those under evaluation. For these reasons, the judge struck the affidavit of trial counsel because there was an insufficient \u201cChinese Wall\u201d separating Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel from his post-delinquency attorney. The issues in this appeal arise from that decision, as well as the judge\u2019s later refusal to recuse herself, and her denial of Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Vacate his delinquency adjudication. We shall affirm in part, and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Following investigations into two intentionally set fires at a Baltimore County apartment building, the State of Maryland filed a delinquency petition against Petitioner Elrieh S. alleging that he had engaged in two acts of first-degree arson. An apartment tenant had identified Elrieh as one of two males seen standing over burning papers that generated the second fire. Elrieh was arrested, advised of his rights under <em>Miranda, </em>and then interviewed. During the interrogation, Elrich provided detectives with a statement in which he admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>to being present at the scene of both fires, and to lighting the second one himself (\u201cElrich\u2019s statement\u201d). Elrich also repeatedly claimed that he was seventeen years old, but a review of his criminal records revealed that he was only fourteen, a fact that was later confirmed by his guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">At the juvenile proceedings, Elrich was represented by an Assistant Public Defender assigned to the Baltimore County district office of OPD (hereinafter referred to as \u201cdelinquency counsel\u201d or \u201cprevious counsel\u201d). On the day of the hearing, Elrich\u2019s delinquency counsel received a copy of the court ordered psychological evaluation of Elrich (\u201cthe Report\u201d), which indicated that Elrich\u2019s cognitive abilities may be \u201csignificantly below\u201d normal. Elrich\u2019s delinquency counsel understood that the Report \u201chad particularly significant relevance to the voluntariness of Elrich\u2019s statement to police, which [would] affect[] the statement\u2019s admissibility at trial.\u201d The Report was submitted to the court, but, for reasons unknown, delinquency counsel did not use it at the hearing to attack the validity of Elrich\u2019s statement. For example, she did not argue to the court that the statement was tainted by Elrich\u2019s diminished capacity. Furthermore, she did not seek to suppress Elrich\u2019s statement, even though she believed that it was \u201cthe only substantive piece of evidence connecting [Elrich] to the arson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Elrich plead not delinquent to all charges. The parties agreed to a stipulated statement of facts in front of the Juvenile Master, and the following was articulated to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">[O]n July 25, 2007, Detective Hughes responded to [the apartment building] at 1:15 a.m. ... [He] responded there as a result of a fire in the building. Upon arrival there, Detective Hughes met with a Fire Investigator Slagle, and Investigator Slagle conducted an origin and cause investigation of the fire scene. He determined the fire was intentionally set. Unknown persons at that time had pried open the mailbox in the lobby of the building. Once the box was opened, the individual applied open flame to the available combustible materials which appeared to include various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>papers and mails from inside the mailboxes. The fire caused scorching to the paint on the wall and to the mailbox where the papers were found. On July 25th, 2007 at approximately 9:40 a.m., ... Detective Hughes was requested to respond to a second fire call at the same apartment building. At that time, Investigator Leidner responded to the scene and conducted a second origin and cause investigation. The inspector determined the second fire to be an intentional act as well. This fire involved newspaper advertisements left on the floor of the lobby of that building. The fire was reported by a tenant in the building, Mr. Edward Boutchyard. He reported seeing two male subjects bent down on the floor in the area of below the mailbox. He investigated and found that the papers were on fire. The witness took the papers outside and stamped out the fire with his foot prior to reporting it. As a result of the call to 911, Officer Nesbitt arrived on the scene and located the two subjects observed by the witness. Officer Nesbitt placed these subjects under arrest and transported them to Precinct 11---- Detective Hughes met with [Elrich], and advised him of his rights per Miranda.... [Elrich] ... agreed to give a statement to Detective Hughes. During the written oral statement, Elrich admitted to being present at the scene of both fires. When describing the fire, the second fire that was at approximately 9:30 in that morning, he at first denied any involvement even though he admitted he was in the building. After a short conversation, however, Elrich admitted that he had lit the fire because he was bored----Elrich [also] talked about being present at the fire, the first fire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The court accepted the facts and found Elrich delinquent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It placed Elrich into supervised detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Four months after his delinquency hearing, Elrich filed a motion to vacate his delinquency finding on the grounds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>his counsel was ineffective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At this juncture, Elrich was represented by the Chief Attorney (hereinafter referred to as \u201cmotions counsel\u201d or \u201ccurrent counsel\u201d) of OPD\u2019s Juvenile Protection Division (\u201cJPD\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Elrich alleged that previous counsel failed to adequately inform him of the nature of the charges, the consequences of a delinquency finding, the strength of the State\u2019s case, his right to a fair and impartial trial in which the State must prove the substance of its petition beyond a reasonable doubt, his ability to contest the Master\u2019s order, his right to suppress certain information, and his right not to testify at trial. Attached to the motion was a signed affidavit by Elrich\u2019s delinquency counsel (\u201cthe Affidavit\u201d), who averred to, among other failures in her representation, \u201cfailing] to zealously advise [Elrich] of the likelihood of success if the statement had been suppressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The parties appeared on the motion before the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, sitting as a juvenile court. During the hearing, Elrich was represented by both his motions counsel and Marc DeSimone, an Assistant Public Defender assigned to OPD\u2019s Appellate Division.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Elrich\u2019s delinquency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>counsel was also present at the hearing, not in a representative capacity, but instead as a witness subpoenaed by the State. Before the parties reached the merits, however, the judge expressed skepticism about the circumstances surrounding the OPD\u2019s acquisition of the Affidavit, and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">THE COURT: I, quite frankly, am troubled by the fact that someone who is in essence a supervisor has filed a\u2014 obtained an affidavit from somebody under their supervision of the nature of the affidavit that was filed in this case. I think that there is an ethical and conflict issue that I am raising because it is of concern to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">[Motions Counsel]: I can clear up the Court\u2019s misinformation about the fact that I am not [delinquency counsel\u2019s] supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">THE COURT: I\u2019m aware of that but it was also my understanding from discussions within your office that there was a court watch of sorts where you and others came around and evaluated performance of lawyers in Baltimore County and that as a result of that, certain things happened within the Baltimore County office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">[Motions Counsel]: That your Honor has that knowledge means that someone from my office has had ex parte communications with the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">THE COURT: No. I have that knowledge actually by talking to the public defender on other issues unrelated to this case who talked about the supervision project that was done, so I didn\u2019t have ex parte communications about this case. I, quite frankly, am troubled that you would say that I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">But I did have communication with your office where it was described to me that there was a supervision project, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>court watch of sorts. As a result of that, various things happened. One of the things in that discussion were concerns about certain cases that people watched and evaluated. From the description that was provided to me in that context, this would appear to be one of those cases. So to then have an affidavit from the lawyer who was assigned done, presumably at the request of someone in your\u2014in the office, and filed, is troublesome to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">[Motions Counsel]: [W]e did not write that affidavit. We did not. In fact, I believe if the Court heard from [delinquency counsel], the Court would understand that we did write an affidavit. [Elrich\u2019s delinquency counsel] took exception with the affidavit that we wrote and she wrote her own. That is the affidavit that appears attached to the motion that was filed in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">THE COURT: It doesn\u2019t change the circumstances that you all are essentially post convicting your own lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">[Motions Counsel]: I am not sure I understand what the problem is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t see a conflict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">[Motions Counsel]: If your Honor is suggesting that [delinquency counsel] signed this affidavit because she was afraid she was going to lose her job or there was a threat of a removal from her job, there is absolutely no way that the Court can make that assumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">But to speak to whether or not the juvenile protection division should be filing these things, collateral is a division\u2014collateral review is a division of the same agency that we are with.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] They also file post conviction. That is their sole job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>THE COURT: But this was carefully set up so that this was supervised differently, monitored differently. There is this whole Chinese wall theory that surrounds that unit for precisely this reason. As far as I can tell it does not exist within your juvenile unit. There are enough people that are troubled on the adult side that you have this specter of one unit, same office post convicting another lawyer in the same unit of that office. But, for a lot of reasons that happened and there was a Chinese wall built so that these ethical issues wouldn\u2019t be problematic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">One of the things that is of concern to me is it doesn\u2019t seem to have even been contemplated in this circumstance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">[T]o me, if you think there is a problem, refer it out, have someone independent of you all take a look at the file, whatever they think is appropriate. Then you don\u2019t have this specter of your office, which does have some oversight and review function, getting affidavits from a lawyer who stands to be impacted by how you perceive her performance, how you perceive her cooperation, how you perceive the whole matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">(Footnote added). The court remained dissatisfied with current counsel\u2019s explanation of events and shortly thereafter called a recess to allow that attorney to determine how she would proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">When the case was recalled, DeSimone spoke to the court, contending that no conflict existed because the Public Defender\u2019s office is considered a \u201claw firm only on a county by county basis[,]\u201d meaning that there are separate chains of command and walls of separation between the county units and state units. Therefore, \u201c[a]n attorney in the Baltimore County office is not the same unit, is not within the conflict of the statewide unit.\u201d DeSimone also explained that his Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Unit is similar to the Collateral Review Division (\u201cCRD\u201d) in that it is separate from any of the county units and that its review of lawyers in those other units does not present any conflict. DeSimone offered to strike the affidavit and call Elrich\u2019s delinquency counsel to the witness stand to testify about the adequacy of her representation. His argument, however, did not allay the court\u2019s concerns, and it struck the Affidavit. The court further stated that it would hold the case open, but asked that it be \u201cpaneled to another lawyer[,]\u201d an attorney \u201cindependent of the office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Following the hearing, Elrich, still represented by his motions counsel, filed two motions in the Circuit Court: a Motion for Recusal and a Motion to Reconsider the ruling. In his Motion for Recusal, Elrich asserted that the court referred to several \u201cextrajudicial\u201d conversations, wherein it learned of the OPD\u2019s \u201ccourt watch\u201d program, which could lead a reasonable observer to question its impartiality. Thus, only the judge\u2019s recusal would avoid this appearance of impropriety. He alleged that the court\u2019s apparent prejudice and bias lead it to strike the Affidavit and order the case paneled out to an independent attorney without hearing any testimony or arguments on the merits of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In his Motion to Reconsider, Elrich asserted that the Circuit Court did not have the authority to order the OPD to panel the case to an independent attorney. Elrich also used the Motion to argue the merits of his request to vacate his delinquency finding. First, he contended that the two-count Petition charging Elrich for two identical counts of first-degree arsons occurring on the same day and at the same location violated his due process rights because there was no way that he could identify each count according to its related event. Elrich further contended that the facts as stipulated could not support any finding of arson because, at most, the fire scorched the mailbox and wall of the building. Arson requires that the building be actually burned; a mere scorching will not suffice. Finally, Elrich claimed ineffective assistance of counsel because his previous counsel did not challenge the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence to support a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>arson. Elrich requested a hearing for the parties to argue the merits of his Motion to Reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Thirty-five days after Elrich filed his motions, and nearly two months after the parties appeared before the Court on Elrich\u2019s original Motion to Vacate, the court denied Elrich\u2019s motions without an additional hearing. In its written opinion, the court explained that recusal was not warranted because it simply possessed a general awareness of the JPD\u2019s evaluation of attorneys in the OPD\u2019s Baltimore County Office, one that was not the result of any inappropriate ex parte communications. The court stated that it \u201chad no conversations concerning the specifics of this case or the Affidavit with members of the OPD before hearing this matter.\u201d It emphasized that to characterize every conversation with an attorney that is not related to any ongoing representation as an ex parte communication would \u201cseverely eompromise[ ]\u201d the \u201cCourt\u2019s ability to communicate with and accommodate any number of difficulties that arise in the daily juggle by OPD to meet staffing demands[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In refusing to reverse its earlier decision ordering OPD to panel the case to \u201coutside counsel[,]\u201d the court reiterated its previous statement that the JPD does not have the same separation functions in place as the CRD:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">Unlike the Collateral Review Division, where counsel enter their appearances in post-convictions and other occasional post-trial matters, and where the originally assigned OPD has no ongoing role in such proceedings, there is no clear demarcation for cases that involve JPD attorneys. In my experience in Baltimore County, many post-commitment matters continue to be handled by County OPD staff. In some instances, JPD staff become involved, enter their appearance, and assume all further representation. In still other instances, JPD have appeared before me in a role more akin to co-counsel in matters relating to placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC\">The Circuit Court also rejected the assertions made by motions counsel and DeSimone that JPD\u2019s evaluations of County attorneys had little, if any, effect on that attorney\u2019s job. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>observed that \u201c[fallowing the report from [the JPD] Baltimore County assessment, the head of the County juvenile unit was re-assigned.\u201d The judge acknowledged that any action taken as a result of a report is \u201cproperly and solely within the discretion of the Public Defender[,]\u201d but that the evidence indicated that JPD is not a separate division.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The court also decided to address Elrich\u2019s original Motion to Vacate in its opinion. Acknowledging that there was \u201cno clear authority authorizing the action\u201d sought by Elrich, it nevertheless recognized its power to vacate delinquency orders pursuant to the broad revisory powers granted in Maryland Rule 11-116, \u201cModification or Vacation of Order.\u201d Looking at the merits, the court determined that if it were to grant the requested relief, \u201cthere would be a strong argument that retrial would be barred by the Double Jeopardy clause[,]\u201d and that it would not be in Elrich\u2019s best interest \u201cto simply terminate these proceedings with no further supervision or services.\u201d The court further reasoned that counsel never contended that Elrich was innocent of committing a delinquent act, but instead simply argued \u201cthat other counsel should have defended the merits more aggressively and/or mitigated the seriousness of the charge.\u201d It concluded that it would not be in Elrich\u2019s best interest to strike the delinquency finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Elrich appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and, in an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the Circuit Court. We granted Elrich\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari and the State\u2019s Cross-Petition<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to consider the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">(1) Whether a motion to vacate under Rule 11-116 is an Appealable Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">(2) [Whether Rule 11-116 is an available vehicle for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>(3) Whether the juvenile judge erred in faffing to recuse herself from further participation in this case after she made clear that her order, requiring the Office of the Public Defender to strike its appearance, was based upon opinions derived from out-of-court conversations with persons unrelated to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">(4) Whether a judge may order the Office of the Public Defender to strike its appearance in a case and provide a private \u201cpanel\u201d attorney to represent the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">(5) Whether the lower court erred in faffing to vacate [Elrich\u2019s] juvenile delinquency finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"At\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">In a juvenile delinquency matter, an appellate court will \u201creview the case on both the law and the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 8\u2014131(c). We review any conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>but apply the clearly erroneous standard to findings of fact. <em>See In re Anthony W., </em>388 Md. 251, 261, 879 A.2d 717, 722 (2005). We use the same evidentiary standard of review in juvenile delinquency proceedings as we apply in criminal cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoV\">Appellate review of the [trial] court\u2019s judgment on the evidence is limited to determining whether there is a sufficient evidentiary basis for the court\u2019s underlying factual findings. [T]he appropriate inquiry is not whether the reviewing court believes that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather, whether after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJC\"><em>Id. </em>at 261, 879 A.2d at 722 (quoting <em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. 371, 380, 681 A.2d 501, 505 (1996)). The hearing court\u2019s ultimate decision, however, will not be disturbed' unless \u201cthere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030, 1051 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\"><em>A. Rule 11-116 Motion to Vacate </em>As <em>An Appealable Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">On cross-petition, the State urges this Court to dismiss Elrich\u2019s appeal on the grounds that a ruling on a Rule 11-116 motion is not a final, appealable order. It contends that a Rule 11-116 ruling is not final because Elrich is not procedurally barred from continuing to make Rule 11-116 motions to the lower court while an appellate court is reviewing his original Rule 11-116 motion. Thus, the State contends, a ruling on any one of the subsequent motions could render his appeal moot. <em>See In re Julianna B., </em>407 Md. 657, 967 A.2d 776 (2009) (dismissing as moot an appeal from a circuit court denial of juvenile\u2019s Rule 11-116 motion to modify the terms of her commitment following the success of juvenile\u2019s subsequent Rule 11-116 motion requesting home visits). This Court, however, has expressly rejected this argument and considered the merits of an appeal from a Rule 11-116 ruling. In <em>In re Leslie M., </em>305 Md. 477, 505 A.2d 504 (1986), the State challenged the appealability of a motion under Rule 11-116\u2019s predecessor, Rule 916(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We characterized the Rule 916(a) motions as requests to vacate earlier delinquency orders and summarily denied the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 478, 505 A.2d at 505. Here, the Circuit Court considered Elrich\u2019s motion and rejected it in full. It is clear from the record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the court did not intend to take any further action on the motion, meaning that its order denying Elrich\u2019s motion is a final one. Accordingly, Elrich\u2019s case is properly before this court. We turn now to the merits of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\n<em>B. Authority To Adjudicate Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims Under Rule 11-116</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Elrich contends that the Circuit Court \u201crefused to recognize that [Elrich\u2019s] claims [of ineffective assistance of counsel] were a basis for relief under Maryland Rule 11-116.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A review of the record, however, defeats this argument. In its written opinion, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">\u201cThe Juvenile Causes article does not recognize what would typically be considered to be post-conviction relief. <em>However, Maryland Rule 11-116 grants the Court revisory power over delinquency orders. </em>The Court may modify <em>or </em>vacate such orders sua sponte or in response to a petition, and a hearing is required only in instances where the relief sought is for revocation of probation. In other instances the Court may grant or deny relief without a hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">(Emphasis added). The court then articulated the standard under the Rule for determining whether to modify or vacate an order, i.e. whether it is \u201cin the best interest of the child or the public[,]\u201d and proceeded to deny Elrich\u2019s motion on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the Circuit Court, \u201ceven in expressing doubt about the utilization of Rule 11-116 as a post-conviction vehicle, did just that.\u201d Thus, we reject Elrich\u2019s assertion and affirm the Court of Special Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">\n<em>C. Recusal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">Elrich next contends that the juvenile court judge was required to recuse herself because her earlier discussions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>then State Public Defender, Nancy Forster, regarding the OPD\u2019s internal review of its employees\u2019 performance constituted improper <em>extra-judicial </em>communications that destroyed the judge\u2019s impartiality. According to Elrich, the judge\u2019s bias was evident from her <em>sua sponte </em>challenge of the Affidavit. He alleges that the \u201cadversarial system was abandoned in favor of an inquisitorial one\u201d because, \u201cby raising the issue, supporting it with her own knowledge, and ruling upon the issue, [the judge] functionally occupied counsel table, the witness stand, and the bench at the same time.\u201d The State counters by arguing that not all knowledge acquired by a judge outside of the courtroom is impermissible \u201cextra-judicial\u201d knowledge, and that it would lead to preposterous results to require any judge who has learned of a potential ethical problem in an attorney\u2019s continued representation of a client to recuse herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Canon 3D of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct governs judicial recusal. <em>See </em>Cannon 3(D), Md. Rule 16-813. That section provides in relevant part: \u201cA judge shall recuse ... herself from a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including an instance when ... the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party\u2019s lawyer or extra-judicial knowledge of a disputed evidentiary fact concerning the proceeding.... \u201d <em>See id. </em>at Cannon 3(D)(1)(a) (emphasis in original). The official comment to Cannon 3D explains that \u201ca judge must recuse ... herself whenever the judge\u2019s impartiality might be reasonably questioned, regardless of whether any specific instances in 3D(1) apply.\u201d Yet, \u201c[t]here is a strong presumption in Maryland, and elsewhere, that judges are impartial participants in the legal process, whose duty to preside when qualified is as strong as their duty to refrain from presiding when not qualified.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shaw, </em>363 Md. 1, 11, 766 A.2d 1028, 1033 (2001). This Court has previously articulated the standard in recusal cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">The decision to recuse oneself ordinarily is discretionary and will not be overturned except for abuse. The party requesting recusal has a heavy burden to overcome the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>presumption of impartiality and must prove that the judge has a personal bias or prejudice against him or her or has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We have also said that a judge is not required to \u201ccompletely put out of his mind all that he had heard before in [the] case in order to be competent to sit.\u201d <em>Doering v. Fader, </em>316 Md. 351, 358, 558 A.2d 733, 737 (1989). \u201c[T]he alleged prejudice must result from an extrajudicial source and parties cannot attack a judge\u2019s impartiality on the basis of information and beliefs acquired while acting in his or her judicial capacity.\u201d <em>Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 77, 581 A.2d 1, 5 (1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Monaco, </em>852 F.2d 1143, 1147 (9th Cir.1988)). Even information learned outside of the present case, such as that \u201cacquired by the trial judge as a result of prior judicial proceedings involving codefendants[,]\u201d will not automatically necessitate exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 581 A.2d at 4. Moreover, a disqualifying prejudice cannot be definitively established simply from the exercise of related judicial functions. <em>See United States v. Haldeman, </em>559 F.2d 31, 133 n. 301 (D.C.Cir.1976) (holding that judge\u2019s prior supervision of grand jury matters did not warrant dismissal, despite the judge\u2019s discussion of \u201cprocedural matters with prosecutors before the indictment in [the] cases was returned[,]\u201d because \u201cthe discussions occurred as a part of his official duties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Here, the judge\u2019s knowledge of the OPD\u2019s supervision project stemmed from conversations she had with the State Public Defender and others on \u201cissues unrelated to [Elrich\u2019s] case[.]\u201d She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">... [A]s the judge in charge of the juvenile dockets in this County, I was certainly aware of ongoing observations of the juvenile docket that were conducted by the [JPD] of the OPD. Every judge and master who routinely hears delinquency cases in this County was aware of that fact. I meet regularly with various groups of delinquency case stakeholders, and the impact of the JPD review on the morale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>OPD staff was the subject of occasional comment in my presence on several occasions. However I had no conversations concerning the specifics of [Elrich\u2019s] case or the Affidavit with members of the OPD before hearing this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">... [T]he fact that a member of the bench has a conversation with an attorney that is not, in any way, related to any ongoing representation is not an ex parte communication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAT\">Elrich\u2019s motions counsel also acknowledged that the conversations were \u201cin connection with something else.\u201d There is nothing in the record to suggest that the judge had any specific knowledge as to whether Elrich\u2019s delinquency counsel had, herself, been the subject of a JPD evaluation or whether the rumored consequences of such assessments affected that attorney\u2019s decision to submit a self-condemning affidavit. In short, the judge did not have \u201cpersonal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceedings.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>363 Md. at 11, 766 A.2d at 1033.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We will not require the Circuit Court judge to recuse herself simply because, through the exercise of her judicial functions, she became generally aware of the JPD\u2019s ongoing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Additionally, the juvenile judge\u2019s knowledge of the OPD attorney evaluations did not relate to the issue of whether previous counsel actually provided effective assistance of counsel at Elrich\u2019s delinquency hearing, but rather led the judge to inquire on the record regarding a potential conflict and the voluntariness of the Affidavit. We have said that \u201c[t]rial judges are afforded broad discretion in the conduct of trials in such areas as the reception of evidence.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. Maryland, </em>352 Md. 146, 158, 721 A.2d 231, 237 (1998) (quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tion marks omitted). Moreover, \u201cthere is no question that the trial judge has broad discretion to control the conduct in his or her courtroom.... \u201d <em>Biglari v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 657, 674, 847 A.2d 1239, 1249 (2004). We believe that it was reasonable, in light of the possible conflict arising from OPD\u2019s supervision program, for the juvenile judge to be skeptical about of delinquency counsel\u2019s self-condemnation. More importantly, upon developing this skepticism about the attorneys\u2019 relationship, the court was required to raise the issue at Elrich\u2019s hearing in order to determine if that conflict existed and could be cured, or strike a potentially corrupt affidavit. <em>See Duvall v. State, </em>399 Md. 210, 234, 923 A.2d 81, 96 (2007) (holding that when the trial court is notified of a potential conflict and fails to take adequate steps to investigate the potential for conflict or requires conflicted representation, despite the conflict, <em>\u201creversal is automatic, </em>without a showing of prejudice of adverse effect upon representation.\u201d) (emphasis added). We will not allow tainted evidence or potentially unethical conduct to find shelter in the harbor of Cannon 3D.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">In sum, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that there is nothing in the record to support \u201ca conclusion that [the juvenile judge] learned, extra-judicially, any information that would have required her to recuse herself from the merits of Elrich\u2019s Motion to Vacate.\u201d Because Elrich did not meet his \u201cheavy burden\u201d of proof, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\n<em>D. Ordering Referral Of Case To Outside Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Elrich also challenges the validity of the order requiring OPD to panel the case to an outside attorney. He asserts that, in Section 6(f) of Article 27A (\u201cPublic Defender Act\u201d),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the General Assembly established only two situations in which a court may appoint counsel. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>(f) <em>Authority of courts to appoint counsel in certain situa</em>tions.\u2014Nothing in this article shall be construed to deprive any court mentioned in \u00a7 4(b)(2) of this article of its authority to appoint an attorney to represent an indigent person where there is a conflict in legal representation in a matter involving multiple defendants and one of the defendants is represented by or through the Office of the Public Defender, or where the Office of the Public Defender declines to provide representation to an indigent person entitled to representation under this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Clearly, Elrieh\u2019s situation does not fall into either one of the scenarios expressly provided for by Section 6(f). Yet, this does not mean that the Circuit Court lacked the authority to appoint counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">First, Elrich overlooks the nature of Section 6(f) as a limitation on the other provisions of the Public Defender Act. There is nothing contained in the section to preclude a court from appointing counsel in situations not enumerated in the statute. Rather, we have said that \u201cthe General Assembly provided in Art. 27 A, \u00a7 6(f), a clear oversight and corrective role for the courts in the ... appointed-counsel process.\u201d <em>Office of the Public Defender, et al. v. State, </em>413 Md. 411, 432, 993 A.2d 55, 68 (2010). Second, Elrich ignores a court\u2019s inherent power over the judicial process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">\u201cWe made the point with unmistakable clarity ... that the power generally to regulate matters regarding the profession and its practitioners, are reposed inherently in the judiciary, that the obligation of the judicial branch of government to monitor and manage its own house are not hollow proclamations of power, for the placement of this responsibility with the judiciary represents a recognition of the special, and to a degree unique relationship that has evolved over the years between the legal profession and the tribunals of justice it serves, and that, although the Legislature may act to aid the courts in the performance of their judicial functions, the judicial branch nonetheless retains the fundamental authority and responsibility to carry out its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>constitutionally required function, and aspect of which ... is the supervision of practicing lawyers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\"><em>Post v. Bregman, </em>349 Md. 142, 163, 707 A.2d 806, 816 (1998) (quotation marks and citations omitted). This power cannot be encroached upon by the legislative or executive branch. <em>See Wynn v. State, </em>388 Md. 423, 433, 879 A.2d 1097, 1103 (2005) (\u201cInherent authority provides courts the means both to employ the power and fulfill the functions granted expressly to the judiciary by the Maryland Constitution as well as to resist encroachments by the legislative and executive branches.\u201d). \u201cA judge must, of course, have the ability to control his or her courtroom, to assure that judicial proceedings are conducted fairly, efficiently, and with dignity and decorum.\u201d <em>Liner v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 381, 391, 489 A.2d 553, 558 (1985). \u201cAccordingly, the Circuit Court has the inherent power to appoint counsel to represent a petitioner when the court believes counsel would be necessary to further the interest of justice.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Arey v. State, </em>400 Md. 491, 509, 929 A.2d 501, 512 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In this case, the juvenile judge had a legitimate interest in determining whether the contents of the Affidavit regarding previous counsel\u2019s competency at Elrich\u2019s delinquency hearing was improperly influenced by current counsel\u2019s status as an attorney within the OPD who, the judge noted, could have a \u201csignificant impact on her employment, how she is perceived, how she is reviewed, how she is evaluated, her tenure.\u201d Furthermore, the juvenile judge was aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>that the lines of separation between the JPD and County OPD in connection with \u201cpost-commitment\u201d matters was not consistent or clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">In some instances, JPD staff become involved, enter their appearance, and assume all further representation. In still other instances, JPD have appeared before me in a role more akin to co-counsel in matters relating to placement. There is nothing remotely similar to the separation of function that exists with the Collateral Division in the manner in which the JPD has functioned in delinquency matters in the County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The Circuit Court had the inherent right to ensure that the evidence presented was accurate and not the product of coercion. Thus, \u201cto further the interest of justice,\u201d it had the discretion to strike the Affidavit and appoint new counsel to resolve the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The court, however, did not have the right to order that OPD panel the case to an attorney entirely independent of the office because its discretion to assign new counsel was limited to ameliorating the existing potential for coercion. We have recently held that the Public Defender Act does not exclude OPD staff from the pool of attorneys a court could appoint as counsel for an indigent. <em>See Office of the Public Defender, et al. v. State, </em>413 Md. 411, 432-433, 993 A.2d 55, 68 (2010) (\u201cArt.27A, \u00a7 6(f), contains no language indicating a legislative intent to prohibit the appointment of an attorney from the local OPD by a trial court to represent an individual that the court determines qualifies as indigent....\u201d); <em>see also Workman v. State, </em>413 Md. 475, 490, 993 A.2d 94, 103 (2010) (\u201c[T]he Circuit Court should have appointed directly an attorney from the local OPD as [defendant\u2019s] counsel[.]\u201d). Furthermore, as the juvenile court here recognized, a \u201cChinese Wall\u201d existed between the County OPD and the Collateral Review Division of the OPD, where CRD \u201ccounsel [would] enter their appearances in post-convictions and other occasional post-trial matters, and ... the originally assigned OPD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>[would then have] no ongoing role in such proceedings....\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Co-counsel, DeSimone,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> also explained to the court that the same \u201cclear demarcation\u201d existed between the County OPD staff and his Appellate Division. If true, Elrich\u2019s hearing could have continued uninterrupted and DeSimone\u2019s representation would have resolved the dilemma without the extra costs associated with paneling a case to outside counsel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Yet the court did not attempt to investigate whether the problem extended only to certain divisions within the OPD, leaving other divisions free of any taint. The interests of justice are not furthered by excluding OPD attorneys unnecessarily. Thus, the juvenile judge abused her discretion in summarily precluding all OPD staff from representing Elrich.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\n<em>E. Elrich\u2019s Juvenile Delinquency Finding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Finally, Elrich asks us to review, on the merits, his earlier delinquency finding. He contends that the lower court erred in denying his motion to vacate for two reasons, the first being that the \u201cState failed to introduce evidence sufficient to prove all requisite elements of the crime of Arson in the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Degree.\u201d According to Elrich, at most, he \u201cset fire to various objects within the building, but never \u2018set fire to\u2019 the building itself\u2019 and that a \u201c \u2018mere scorching\u2019 of the wall is, as a matter of law, insufficient to establish a burning.\u201d Alternatively, Elrich claims that the lower court \u201cerred in not addressing or resolving [his] claims of ineffective assistance [of counsel], and vacating the delinquency due to previous counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance.\u201d The State, on the other hand, presents several reasons why the lower court properly denied Elrich\u2019s request. First, the State asserts that Elrich\u2019s motion was no longer supported by \u201cany competent evidence\u201d once the lower court struck the Affidavit, and that even if the Affidavit had been admitted, it did not \u201cdefine how [Elrich] was at all prejudiced by the alleged misconduct of his attorney.\u201d Second, the State contends that Elrich is improperly attempting to litigate the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cin a collateral action rather than availing himself of his right to direct appeal.\u201d Finally, the State claims that Elrich engaged in first-degree arson, or at a minimum attempted first-degree arson, when he set fire to the papers inside the lobby mailbox. Thus, the lower court did not err in denying his motion to vacate because it properly determined that, either way, Elrich had committed \u201can act which would be a crime if committed by an adult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">When addressing the parties\u2019 specific arguments, we are mindful that \u201cthe General Assembly has enacted statutes carefully crafted to address the specific needs of adolescents and children.\u201d <em>In re Keith </em>W., 310 Md. 99, 106, 527 A.2d 35, 38 (1987). The Juvenile Causes Act, codified at Md.Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol., 2008 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 3-8A-01 <em>et. seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP.\u201d), \u201cgrant[s] jurisdiction in juvenile courts over young offenders and establishes] the process for treating them, to advance its purpose of rehabilitating the juveniles who have transgressed to ensure that they become useful and productive members of society.\u201d <em>Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 580, 598, 843 A.2d 915, 926 (2004). The Act is to \u201cbe liberally construed to effectuate [its] purposes.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-8A-02(b). Under the Act,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>juveniles who, in the absence of the juvenile justice system, would be prosecuted in, and punished by, the adult criminal justice system, are instead afforded supervision and treatment, with the aim to achieve rehabilitation. Thus, a juvenile found by the juvenile court to have committed a \u201cdelinquent act,\u201d that is, an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime, is adjudicated a delinquent; and in disposition, the court will fashion a plan of supervision, treatment, and rehabilitation appropriate to the juvenile and serving the rehabilitative goals of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>155 Md.App. at 598, 843 A.2d at 926. Accordingly, juvenile proceedings are civil, rather than criminal in nature. <em>See In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 69, 763 A.2d 136, 146 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Once a juvenile court has pronounced a child to be delinquent, the court\u2019s order may be reviewed on appeal, or by an action pursuant to Rule 11-116. The latter course may be initiated by a court on its own motion, or by the \u201cpetition of any party or other person, institution or agency having supervision or custody of [the juvenile].\u201d Md. Rule ll-116(b). As we indicated above, a juvenile court order may be modified or vacated if the court determines that such action is \u201cin the best interest of the child or the public.\u201d Md. Rule ll-116(a). When making this decision, the juvenile court has discretion whether to hold a hearing,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and even if it chooses to do so, the rules of evidence are relaxed. <em>See </em>Md. Rule ll-116(e) &amp; (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Here, the juvenile court proceeded with a hearing, recessed, and then months later, determined that \u201cno further hearing in this matter is warranted.\u201d It then denied Elrich\u2019s motion to vacate without deciding whether Elrich\u2019s delinquency counsel had, in fact, provided effective assistance of counsel. Instead, it predicated its decision on the belief that, if the court were to grant Elrich\u2019s requested relief, \u201cthere would be a strong argument that re-trial would be barred by the Double Jeopar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>dy clause.\u201d The Circuit Court reasoned that, while Elrich\u2019s motion attacked his counsel\u2019s failure to mitigate the seriousness of the charge against him, it never suggested that he was innocent of committing a delinquent act. Thus, it concluded, \u201c[i]t would not be in this child\u2019s best interests to simply terminate these proceedings with no further supervision or services.\u201d Nowhere in its opinion, however, did the court address whether the evidence was sufficient to show that Elrich had engaged in an act of arson or even attempted arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Without opining whether the evidence supported a finding that delinquency counsel was effective or that Elrich committed a delinquent act, we believe that the juvenile judge abused her discretion when she denied Elrich\u2019s motion without deciding either issue. Clearly the judge was aware that her primary consideration, according to Rule 11-116, was Elrich\u2019s best interest. We do not see, however, how her cursory denial of his motion facilitated that end. Elrich\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, if true, would cast enough doubt on his earlier delinquency proceedings to compromise the very foundation of his confinement. At the earlier hearing, the parties agreed to proceed on a set of stipulated facts, meaning that Elrich waived his right to \u201cconfront and cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses in his own defense, [or] to testify in his defense.\u201d Thus, delinquency counsel's failure to contest the voluntariness of Elrich\u2019s confession or the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence may have been a critical error.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Consequently, in the subsequent Rule 11-116 hearing, the critical error was the judge\u2019s decision not to investigate, at all, Elrich\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Upon striking the Affidavit, the court should have deferred decision until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>new counsel was appointed, or until it was satisfied that DeSimone\u2019s continued representation would not perpetuate the coercive circumstances. Once the court surmounted that obstacle, it should have determined whether Elrich had been denied his right to counsel. <em>Cf </em>Md. Rule ll-106(a) (\u201c[A juvenile] is entitled to be represented in all [juvenile court] proceedings ... by counsel retained by him, his parent, or appointed----\u201d); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (\u201c[T]he right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s assertion that the juvenile court properly rejected Elrich\u2019s motion because it determined that there was no evidence to suggest that Elrich was innocent of committing any delinquent act, even if he had not engaged in first-degree arson. If the charge underlying a juvenile\u2019s confinement is not proven, it is not appropriate or in the child\u2019s best interest to compound the error by requiring the child to remain in State custody. Ultimately, if the court believed that Elrich should remain under State supervision because he committed a delinquent act\u2014either first-degree arson or attempted first-degree arson\u2014it should have made some findings as to that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the juvenile court\u2019s failure to consider whether Elrich was denied effective representation or whether the evidence showed that he committed a delinquent act was contrary to Elrich\u2019s best interests, and thus, constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">We hold that the juvenile court\u2019s order denying Elrich\u2019s Rule 11-116 motion to vacate is a final, appealable order. As to the merits, the court appropriately recognized that Elrich\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims were a basis for relief under Rule 11-116. Furthermore, the juvenile judge\u2019s knowledge of the OPD\u2019s supervision program did not warrant her recusal from the case. The judge did err, however, in failing to consider whether Elrich had adequate representation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>whether the evidence against him supported the finding that he engaged in a delinquent act. Finally, while the court had the discretion to appoint new counsel where a possible conflict of interest existed, the court erred when it required the OPD to panel the case to outside counsel. On remand, the juvenile court shall provide the OPD with the opportunity to avoid the potentially coercive situation by assigning an attorney to Elrich\u2019s case who could not conceivably exercise any influence or control over his delinquency counsel\u2019s employment. The court should then make findings as to Elrich\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel and insufficiency of evidence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

Maryland Rule 916(a), the rule in effect at the time of <em>In re Leslie M. </em>305 Md. 477, 505 A.2d 504 (1986), is substantively identical to Maryland Rule 11-116, the rule relevant in this case. Rule 916(a) provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avj\">a. Revisory Power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">An order of the court may be modified or vacated if the court finds that action to be in the best interest of the child or the public, except in cases involving commitment of a child to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for placement in a State mental hospital. In cases involving such commitment the court shall proceed as provided in Rule 915.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-10\"><em>In re Leslie M, </em>305 Md. at 479 n. 1, 505 A.2d at 506 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b64-12\">. Both parties agree that Rule 11-116 is the appropriate vehicle through which those determined to be delinquent can raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The true dispute centers on whether the juvenile court judge understood this when rendering her judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">. Elrich incorrectly relies on <em>Smith v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 625, 498 A.2d 284 (1985) to support his argument that recusal was required. In <em>Smith, </em>the judge used his law clerk to investigate whether the defendant failed to appear for a drug screening because of her pregnancy or because of drug-related activity. <em>See id. </em>at 628-29, 498 A.2d at 285-86. There, unlike here, the judge endeavored to obtain extra-judicial information specific to a party in court by requiring his law clerk to contact the hospital and then testify as a witness. <em>See id. Smith, </em>however, is radically different from this case, where no such out-of-court investigation of the parties occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\">. On October 1, 2008, Section Article 27A was recodified as Title 16 of the Criminal Procedure Article. Because the events at issue in this case occurred on or before February 26, 2008, we will refer to the provisions of Article 27A, the version of the statute in effect at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">. Recently, this Court has addressed the issue of a judge\u2019s ability to appoint an OPD attorney following that office\u2019s erroneous denial of representation of an indigent defendant. Our opinions in <em>Workman v. State, </em>413 Md. 475, 993 A.2d 94 (2010), and <em>Office of the Public Defender, et al. v. State, </em>413 Md. 411, 993 A.2d 55 (2010), set forth the rule that \"the trial court, in carrying out its role as 'ultimate protector\u2019 of the Constitutional right to counsel, may appoint an attorney from the local OPD to represent the indigent individual unless an actual and unwaived or unwaivable conflict of interest would result thereby.\u201d <em>Office of the Public Defender, </em>413 Md. at 434, 993 A.2d at 69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">. The OPD asserts that the Collateral Review Division does not handle juvenile cases. That issue, however, is not before this Court for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\">. DeSimone entered his appearance the morning of the hearing and introduced himself to the court as appearing on Elrich's behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b72-9\">. In its November 2009 audit of the OPD, the General Assembly concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">... the cost of Maryland\u2019s public defender operation on a per case basis ($443) was the lowest and the cost per capita ($16) was among the lowest when compared to similar operations. When compared to the two other states with at least 100,000 cases opened per year, Maryland had significantly more attorneys on staff, and only used outside attorneys when necessary (for example, in cases in which a conflict of interest existed). This appears to result in a significantly lower cost per case in Maryland when compared to other states such as Massachusetts or Wisconsin that used outside attorneys for many more cases. In other words, paying private attorneys appears to result in higher per case costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Maryland General Assembly, Office of Legislative Audits, <em>Office of the Public Defender; Performance Audit Report </em>at 10 (November 2009) (available at http://www.ola.state.md.us/Resports/Performance/OPDPerf 09.pdf) (last visited September 17, 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">.

Additionally, delinquency counsel\u2019s alleged failure to advise Elrich of his right to except to the Master\u2019s findings may have adversely affected Elrich\u2019s ability to directly appeal his delinquency finding. Thus, contrary to the State's argument, if counsel\u2019s supposed incompetence foreclosed Elrich\u2019s ability to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on direct appeal, he may use his Rule 11-116 motion to contest the sufficiency of the evidence as part of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\">BELL, C.J., concurring in judgment only which GREENE and ELDRIDGE, JJ., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Among the rulings by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County at issue in this case is the correctness of its order that it be \u201cpaneled,\u201d by the Office of the Public Defender, to outside counsel. The majority, despite endorsing the court\u2019s decision to order removal of post-delinquency counsel, holds that order to be error. For the reasons detailed in <em>Office of the Public Defender v. State, </em>413 Md. 411, 437-474, 993 A.2d 55, 71-94 (2010) (Bell, C.J. Dissenting and Concurring) and <em>Workman v. State, </em>413 Md. 475, 490-491, 993 A.2d 94, 103 (2010) (Bell, C.J.
