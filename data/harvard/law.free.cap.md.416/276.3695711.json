(Retired, Specially Assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"AdG\">These two cases present the same issue concerning the certiorari jurisdiction of this Court, although the cases are otherwise unrelated. Since that jurisdictional issue is dispositive in this Court, and requires that the previously issued writ of certiorari in each case be dismissed, we shall consider the cases in a single opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The facts in each case pertinent to the jurisdictional issue are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">A. <em>Stachowski v. State</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">This case began in 2005 when Kenneth Martin Stachowski was charged in the District Court of Maryland, Somerset County, with theft under $500. The charge was based upon Staehowski\u2019s giving, in June 2005, a bad check in the amount of $182.86 to a company known as Somerset Well Drilling. Upon Stachowski\u2019s request for a jury trial, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Somerset County and was given case number 8089. Stachowski made full restitution to Somerset Well Drilling prior to the trial of the case in the Circuit Court. The case was called for trial in the Circuit Court for Somerset County on October 11, 2006. Stachowski waived a jury trial, pled guilty, and, after the prosecuting attorney recounted the factual basis for the guilty plea, Stachowski was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">At the same time that this trial of the bad check case took place, the Circuit Court also heard <em>de novo </em>appeals from the District Court in three violation of probation cases (Circuit Court case numbers 8150, 8151, and 8152). These three cases were factually and legally unrelated to the present bad check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>case except that Stachowski was also the defendant. Case numbers 8150, 8151, and 8152 were based upon three District Court prosecutions charging Stachowski with violations of Maryland\u2019s home improvement laws. The victims were Ruth Daniels, Darlene Wright, and Emma Daniels. At the conclusion of the District Court trials, Stachowski was found guilty of violating the home improvement laws, was placed on probation, and was ordered to make restitution to the three victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Stachowski did not appeal from the convictions in the District Court home improvement cases. Later, however, the District Court determined that Stachowski was in violation of probation because of his failure to make restitution to the three victims of the home improvement violations. Stachowski appealed to the Circuit Court from the District Court orders revoking probation. As previously indicated, these three appeals (numbers 8150, 8151, and 8152) were heard <em>de novo </em>along with the trial in the bad check case (number 8089). In case numbers 8150, 8151, and 8152, Stachowski testified that he was unable to make the restitution payments to the three victims because of numerous financial and legal problems which he and his family were facing. The circuit judge revoked probation in case numbers 8150, 8151, and 8152, and imposed sentences in those three cases as well as in the bad check case (number 8089), with portions of each sentence suspended in favor of periods of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The action of the Circuit Court which gave rise to the appellate proceedings in this Court was a restitution order which was part of the judgment in the bad check case (number 8089). Despite the fact that Stachowski had already made full restitution to the victim in the bad check case, the circuit judge required, as a condition of probation in case number 8089, that Stachowski also make restitution to the three victims in the home improvement appeals, case numbers 8150, 8151, and 8152. The judge stated (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201cIn all cases I\u2019m going to waive fines, costs and fees given the amount of restitution that\u2019s due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>\u201cIn 8150 the amount of restitution due is two thousand one-forty-two-eighty-five. The amount of restitution in 8151-that\u2019s to Darlene Wright\u2014two thousand one-forty-two-eighty-five. Ruth Daniels is eight thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven dollars. Restitution is ordered in both of those cases. Likewise in 8152 restitution in the amount of four thousand one hundred and fifty dollars is owed to Emma Daniels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\"><em>\u201cAs a condition of his probation in 8089 </em>he\u2019s to make restitution to those three victims in the amount of three hundred dollars per month beginning thirty days from the last\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201cDEFENSE ATTORNEY: The end of the first full calendar month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: The end of the first calendar month. He\u2019s allowed on work release.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">On November 9, 2006, Stachowski filed in the Court of Special Appeals applications for leave to appeal in the present bad check case (number 8089) as well as in the three home improvement appeals (numbers 8150, 8151, and 8152). Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-132, the Court of Special Appeals transferred the three home improvement cases to this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reason for the transfer was that the Court of Special Appeals has no jurisdiction to review decisions of the Circuit Courts where the Circuit Courts, in the exercise of their appellate jurisdiction, entertain appeals from final judgments of the District Court of Maryland. Further appellate review of Circuit Court decisions in such cases is exclusively by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>discretionary writ of certiorari issued by this Court. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 \u00a7 12-305 and 12-307(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">After the Court of Special Appeals transferred the three home improvement cases to this Court, Stachowski filed in this Court a \u201csupplemental\u201d certiorari petition, asking the Court to review the Circuit Court\u2019s judgments in the home improvement cases. This Court initially denied the certiorari petition, but, on motion for reconsideration, the Court on August 22, 2007, granted the petition and issued a writ of certiorari in the three home improvement cases. <em>Stachowski v. State, </em>400 Md. 647, 929 A.2d 890 (2007). Following briefing and argument, this Court on January 9, 2008, in an opinion by Judge Battaglia, dismissed the writ of certiorari. <em>Stachowski v. State, </em>403 Md. 1, 939 A.2d 158 (2008). The Court pointed out that the issue presented by Stachowski in his supplemental petition, which the Court had determined warranted the issuance of the writ of certiorari, was whether the Circuit Court \u201cerr[ed] in ordering restitution to three victims as a condition of probation in a fourth unrelated case in which no restitution was due.\u201d <em>Stachowski, </em>403 Md. at 9, 939 A.2d at 162-163. The Court then held the writ must be dismissed \u201cbecause the legality of the restitution order in the theft case is not before us\u201d (403 Md. at 10, 939 A.2d at 163), and \u201ca reversal of the Circuit Court orders in the home improvement cases ... would have no effect on the restitution order in the theft case\u201d (403 Md. at 12-13, 939 A.2d at 165). The dismissal of the writ of certiorari finally terminated appellate proceedings in the three home improvement cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">As earlier stated, Stachowski also filed in the Court of Special Appeals an application for leave to appeal in the present case, the bad check prosecution. The Court of Special Appeals on May 29, 2007, filed a one-sentence order denying the application. Stachowski filed a motion for reconsideration, and the Court of Special Appeals, in a brief order on May 13, 2008, recalled the May 29, 2007, order. Next, on May 28, 2008, the Court of Special Appeals, in another brief order signed only by the Chief Judge, granted the application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>leave to appeal, transferred the case to the regular appeal docket, set a briefing schedule, and scheduled the oral argument for the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 September 2009 session.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">By order dated July 23, 2008, this Court, on its own motion, ordered that a writ of certiorari should issue in the present case, established a briefing schedule, and set the oral argument for the November 2008 session of this Court. A writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals was issued by the Clerk of this Court on the same date. <em>Stachowski v. State, </em>405 Md. 348, 952 A.2d 224 (2008). It should be noted that, when the writ of certiorari was issued in the present case on July 23, 2008, this Court had disposed of the three home improvement cases more than six months earlier, on January 9, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The initial briefing and oral argument in this case addressed only one issue, the validity of the Circuit Court\u2019s restitution order. Subsequent to the initial oral argument, however, this Court noticed a jurisdictional issue which had not previously been raised by the parties or by the Court. Consequently, we issued an order directing the parties to file supplemental briefs, and reargue the case, on the issue of whether this Court has jurisdiction to decide the case on its merits in light of Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-202 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. That statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">\u201c\u00a7 12-202. Exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">A review by way of certiorari may not be granted by the Court of Appeals in a case or proceeding in which the Court of Special Appeals has denied or granted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">(1) Leave to prosecute an appeal in a post conviction proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">(2) Leave to appeal from a refusal to issue a writ of habeas corpus sought for the purpose of determining the right to bail or the appropriate amount of bail;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">(3) Leave to appeal in an inmate grievance commission proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>(4) Leave to appeal from a final judgment entered following a plea of guilty in a circuit court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">(5) Leave to appeal from an order of a circuit court revoking probation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The parties filed supplemental briefs, and the case was reargued on the same day as the reargument in <em>Stockstill v. State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">B. <em>Stockstill v. State</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">In September 1980, Wayne Stockstill was convicted, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, of first degree rape, first degree sexual offense, assault, and second degree rape. On December 12, 1980, the court imposed sentences of life imprisonment for first degree rape and first degree sexual offense, and twenty years imprisonment for second degree rape to run concurrently with the life sentences. The assault conviction was merged into the other convictions for purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">More than 20 years later, as a result of a proceeding under the Maryland Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 RepLVoL), \u00a7\u00a7 7-101 through 7-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County allowed Stockstill to file, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345, a belated motion for modification of his sentences. The motion for modification was filed and was granted. Stockstill\u2019s two life imprisonment sentences were made concurrent, with each sentence having all but forty years suspended, and with five years\u2019 supervised probation upon release. One of the conditions of the supervised probation was that Stockstill enroll in a program of the National Institute for the Study, Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Trauma, under the direction of Dr. Fred Berlin who was either a psychologist or a psychiatrist. Stockstill was paroled on May 12, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">In November 2006, however, Stockstill was charged both with violating conditions of parole and with violating conditions of probation. The charges were based upon Stockstill\u2019s admissions that he had smoked marijuana on one occasion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>had solicited a prostitute at three separate times, and had occasionally consumed alcoholic beverages. The admissions were first made during a polygraph examination taken at Dr. Berlin\u2019s direction. The polygraph examiner, without Dr. Berlin\u2019s or Stockstill\u2019s permission, gave the results to Stockstill\u2019s probation agent who later reviewed them with Stockstill. Stockstill made the same admissions to the probation agent during that review.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In January 2007, the Maryland Parole Commission found that Stockstill was not guilty of violating parole. Nevertheless, in February 2007, the Circuit Court found that Stockstill violated three conditions of probation. The Circuit Court ordered that his probation be revoked, and the court reinstated the previously suspended life sentences with credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Stockstill filed in the Court of Special Appeals a timely application for leave to appeal from the Circuit Court order revoking his probation. On September 25, 2007, in an order signed only by the Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals, that court granted the application for leave to appeal. The issue presented by Stockstill to the Court of Special Appeals was \u201c[wjhether the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment revoking [Stockstill\u2019s] probation should be vacated and probation reinstated because the revocation was based on evidence admitted in violation of the Maryland psychiatrist-patient privilege statute.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Prior to any Court of Special Appeals\u2019 action concerning the merits of Stockstill\u2019s appeal or disposing of the appeal, this Court on May 7, 2008, <em>sua sponte </em>issued a writ of certiorari and set the case for argument during the September 2008 session. <em>Stockstill v. State, </em>404 Md. 659, 948 A.2d 70 (2008). Like the <em>Stachowski </em>case, the initial briefing and oral argument in this Court dealt with a single issue relating to the merits of the case. That issue was whether Stockstill\u2019s proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tion was revoked based on evidence admitted in violation of the psychiatrist-patient privilege. Again, after briefing and argument, we noticed the same jurisdictional issue presented by the <em>Staehowski </em>case. We issued an order setting the case for reargument and directing the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issue of whether this Court can exercise jurisdiction in light of \u00a7 12-202 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. As previously indicated, this case and <em>Stachowski </em>were reargued on the same day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Although none of the parties raised a jurisdictional issue in these cases, this Court is obligated to address <em>sua sponte </em>the issue of whether we can exercise jurisdiction. Just recently this Court, in ordering the dismissal of a case, emphasized that \u201cwe must dismiss a case <em>sua sponte </em>on a finding that we do not have jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Miller &amp; Smith v. Casey PMN, </em>412 Md. 230, 240, 987 A.2d 1, 7 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">A case following a procedural path similar to that in the case at bar was <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor, </em>276 Md. 36, 343 A.2d 521 (1975). In <em>Shell, </em>neither party raised an issue concerning this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, but, while the case was pending in this Court, we issued an order requesting the parties, in briefs and oral argument, to address whether this Court could exercise jurisdiction over the merits of the appeal. After holding that we could not exercise jurisdiction, we transferred the case to a court having jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>e.g., </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a); <em>In re Nicole B., </em>410 Md. 33, 62, 976 A.2d 1039, 1056 (2009) (\u201c \u2018Where appellate jurisdiction is lacking, the appellate court will dismiss the appeal <em>sua sponte,\u2019 </em>\u201d quoting <em>Eastgate Associates v. Apper, </em>276 Md. 698, 701, 350 A.2d 661, 663 (1976)); <em>Wildwood Medical v. Montgomery County, </em>405 Md. 489, 494, 954 A.2d 457, 460 (2008); <em>Duffy v. Conaway, </em>295 Md. 242, 254, 455 A.2d 955, 961 (1983); <em>East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 458, 445 A.2d 343, 345 (1982); <em>Biro v. Schombert, </em>285 Md. 290, 293, 402 A.2d 71, 73 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Section 12-202 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article sets forth the following mandate (emphasis added): \u201cA review by way of certiorari may not be granted by the Court of Appeals in a case or proceeding in which the Court of Special Appeals has denied or granted\u201d leave to appeal in five categories of cases. The two categories applicable to the present cases are \u201c(4) Leave to appeal from a final judgment entered following a plea of guilty in a Circuit Court\u201d and \u201c(5) Leave to appeal from an order of a Circuit Court revoking probation.\u201d The <em>Stachowski </em>case falls into the fourth category, and the <em>Stockstill </em>case falls into the fifth category.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The State advances two alternative arguments in support of its position that the writs of certiorari should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. First, the State submits that \u00a7 12-202 is an extremely broad limitation upon this Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction, covering every case where appellate review in the Court of Special Appeals is by application for leave to appeal. Under this view, the Court would be totally deprived of subject matter jurisdiction in any case within the five \u201cleave to appeal\u201d categories set forth in \u00a7 12-202. The State relies upon a dissenting opinion which directly supports this construction of \u00a7 12-202, <em>Moss v. Director, </em>279 Md. 561, 569-572, 369 A.2d 1011, 1016-1017 (1977) (Orth, J., dissenting). Under this broad limitation upon our jurisdiction, the grounds for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Court of Special Appeals\u2019 order denying or granting leave to appeal, as well as any substantive action taken by the Court of Special Appeals simultaneously with or after an order granting leave to appeal, are all irrelevant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Alternatively, the State advances a narrower position, contending that \u00a7 12-202 deprives this Court of jurisdiction where the Court of Special Appeals simply denied or granted the application for leave to appeal \u201cwithout resolving or deciding any of the legal or factual merits of [the] application.\u201d (State\u2019s supplemental brief in <em>Stachowski </em>at 2). The State points out that, in the present cases, the \u201cCourt of Special Appeals reached no conclusions or decisions regarding the merits or outcome of [appellants\u2019] claim[s] on appeal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 11-12). Under either of the State\u2019s alternatives, this Court could not at this time exercise jurisdiction in the present cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Both appellants argue that this Court can exercise jurisdiction in these two cases because the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 orders did more than simply grant leave to appeal. The appellants rely upon the actions of the Court of Special Appeals placing the cases on the court\u2019s appeal docket. Thus, Stachowski argues (Stachowski\u2019s supplemental brief at 3-4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApZ\">\u201cHere, because the Court of Special Appeals transferred the case to the regular appeal docket on May 28, 2008, this Court properly obtained jurisdiction on July 23, 2008, when it ordered that a writ of certiorari issue to the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Stockstill makes the same argument, relying on the fact that \u201cthe Court of Special Appeals transferred the case to its regular appeal docket.\u201d (Stockstill\u2019s supplemental opening brief at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We reject the broad limitation upon our jurisdiction advanced by the State. Instead, we adhere to a long line of cases in this Court which essentially support the State\u2019s \u25a0alternative argument, under which the jurisdictional limitation is narrow. This Court has consistently construed \u00a7 12-202 as meaning \u201cthat the limitation upon this Court\u2019s jurisdiction set forth in \u00a7 12-202 ... relates only to the action of the Court of Special Appeals in granting or denying an application for leave to appeal.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 210, 438 A.2d 1301, 1305 (1981). The <em>Williams </em>opinion continued (292 Md. at 210-211, 438 A.2d at 1305, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\u201cExcept for the nonreviewability of that specific action [granting or denying the application for leave to appeal], we have jurisdiction over the type of cases listed in \u00a7 12-202 to the extent that such jurisdiction is conferred by \u00a7 12-201 or other statutory provisions. Therefore, in the present case, although we may not review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 exercise of discretion in granting the State\u2019s application for leave to appeal, <em>we are authorized to review that court\u2019s decision on the merits remanding the case to the trial court.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\"><em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>was an action under the Maryland Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act; accordingly, it was the type of action covered by subsection (1) of \u00a7 12-202. Williams had originally been convicted of second degree murder and assault with intent to murder, and the Circuit Court in the postconviction action awarded him a new trial on the ground that his right to be present at every stage of his criminal trial had been violated. The State filed in the Court of Special Appeals an application for leave to appeal. The intermediate appellate court, in a two-page opinion rendered by a panel of three judges, granted the State\u2019s application and summarily remanded the case to the Circuit Court for that court to determine whether Williams had waived his right to be present at his criminal trial. Williams filed a petition for a writ of certiorari which this Court granted. In its brief and at oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>argument in this Court, \u201c[t]he State argue[d] that we have no jurisdiction whatsoever to review any case arising under the Post Conviction Procedure Act....\u201d <em>Williams, </em>292 Md. at 205, 438 A.2d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Williams </em>initially reviewed the legislative history of \u00a7 12-202, pointing out that the statutory language prior to the 1974 re-codification in the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article read as follows (292 Md. at 206, 438 A.2d at 1303, emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201c <em>\u2018except no such </em>[certiorari] <em>petition shall be entertained by the Court of Appeals from the denying or granting by the Court of Special Appeals of an application for leave to prosecute an appeal in post conviction and ... </em>[other] <em>proceedings </em>and from the denying or granting by the Court of Special Appeals of a petition for review filed under \u00a7 21 of this article.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Thus, we pointed out in <em>Williams, </em>292 Md. at 207, 438 A.2d at 1303, that, under the above-quoted language, the \u201cexception related only to \u2018the denying or granting\u2019 of the leave to appeal application\u201d and,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201cfa]s the State concedes in its brief, if the Court of Special Appeals granted an application, this Court clearly was given authority <em>to review the merits of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The State\u2019s position in <em>Williams, </em>however, was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4c\">\u201cthe 1974 re-codification was intended to change the law and deprive this Court of jurisdiction to review the merits of a case after the Court of Special Appeals granted leave to appeal....\u201d (292 Md. at 208, 438 A.2d at 1304).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">This Court disagreed with the State\u2019s argument that the 1974 recodification, with its wording modification, changed the meaning and expanded the scope of the jurisdictional limitation in \u00a7 12-202. In holding that the statutory language had the same meaning after 1974 as it did before 1974, the <em>Williams </em>opinion chiefly relied upon the interpretation of \u00a7 12-202 reflected in this Court\u2019s cases after the 1974 recodifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>cation and upon the legislative acquiescence in that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The principal case relied upon in <em>Williams </em>was <em>Jourdan v. State, </em>275 Md. 495, 841 A.2d 388 (1975). <em>Jourdan </em>was a postconviction action in which the petitioner was challenging his criminal conviction on double jeopardy grounds. The Circuit Court in the postconviction action held that Jourdan was tried in violation of the double jeopardy prohibition, and that Jourdan was also denied the effective assistance of counsel. The Circuit Court set aside the conviction and sentence, and the State filed an application for leave to appeal. The Court of Special Appeals granted the State\u2019s application for leave to appeal, transferred the case to its regular appeal docket, and remanded the case to the Circuit Court. This Court granted Jourdan\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and reversed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. With regard to this Court\u2019s granting the certiorari petition, we held in <em>Jourdan </em>as follows (275 Md. at 506 n. 4, 341 A.2d at 394-395 n. 4, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cUnder Maryland Code (1974), \u00a7 12-202(1) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, this Court has no jurisdiction to review a decision of the Court of Special Appeals granting or denying leave to appeal in a post conviction proceeding. However, once the Court of Special Appeals grants leave to appeal in such a case and transfers the case to its appeal docket, the matter takes the posture of a regular appeal, and we do have jurisdiction under \u00a7 12-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article <em>to review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision </em>on the appeal itself.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN7\">The other case relied upon in <em>Williams </em>was <em>Moss v. Director, supra, </em>279 Md. 561, 369 A.2d 1011. <em>Moss </em>was a case under the Defective Delinquent Act, Maryland Code (1957, 1976 RepLVol.), Art. 31B, a statute which has since been repealed. Under that statute, appellate review ih the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Special Appeals was by a discretionary application for leave to appeal rather than by a statutory right to appeal, and the application for leave to appeal was included in \u00a7 12-202. In <em>Moss, </em>the Court of Special Appeals granted the application for leave to appeal, transferred the case to its appeal docket, and, after briefing and oral argument, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. This Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari and, after briefing and argument, reversed the judgments of both courts below. Judge Orth filed a dissenting opinion from the Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, maintaining that \u201cthere is no ambiguity whatsoever in the dictates of \u00a7 12-202\u201d and that the \u201cplain and certain language leaves nothing to be construed or interpreted.\u201d <em>Moss, </em>279 Md. at 570, 369 A.2d at 1016. In Judge Orth\u2019s view, the Court\u2019s prior opinion in <em>Jourdan v. State, supra, </em>was contrary to the language of the statute. Judge Orth\u2019s dissent did not discuss the legislative history of \u00a7 12-202 but was based entirely on his view of the statutory language. Despite the dissenting opinion, the six-judge majority in <em>Moss </em>had no problem exercising jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Turning again to <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>the <em>Williams </em>opinion pointed out that \u00a7 12-202 had been re-enacted with amendments twice since the opinion in <em>Jourdan v. State </em>was rendered. On neither occasion did the General Assembly change the interpretation of \u00a7 12-202 set forth in <em>Jourdan. </em>The Court in <em>Williams </em>continued (292 Md. at 210, 438 A.2d at 1305):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cThe General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation. <em>Harden v. Mass Transit Adm., </em>277 Md. 399, 406, 354 A.2d 817 (1976). This presumption is particularly strong whenever, after statutory language has been interpreted by this Court, the Legislature re-enacts the statute without changing in substance the language at issue. <em>Harbor Island Marina v. Calvert Co., </em>286 Md. 303, 322-323, 407 A.2d 738 (1979); <em>Director v. Cash, </em>269 Md. 331, 345, 305 A.2d 833 (1973) <em>cert. denied sub nom.

St. Dep\u2019t of Assess. &amp; T., </em>264 Md. 121, 132-133, 285 A.2d 593 (1972); <em>Stack v. Marney, </em>252 Md. 43, 49, 248 A.2d 880 (1969). Under these circumstances, it is particularly inappropriate to depart from the principle of stare decisis and overrule our prior interpretation of the statute. <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>282 Md. 641, 657-658, 387 A.2d 260 (1978). <em>See also Flood v. Kuhn, </em>407 U.S. 258, 92 S.Ct. 2099, 32 L.Ed.2d 728 (1972).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"><em>Williams, </em>decided in 1981, thus held that the General Assembly\u2019s acquiescence in this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-202 made it particularly inappropriate to depart from the principle of stare decisis and overrule our prior interpretation of \u00a7 12-202. During the twenty-nine years since <em>Williams, </em>this Court has in several cases reaffirmed the interpretation of \u00a7 12-202 set forth in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Jourdan, </em>and the General Assembly has continued to acquiesce in that interpretation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">A more recent opinion applying \u00a7 12-202 was <em>Grayson v. State, </em>354 Md. 1, 10-12, 728 A.2d 1280, 1284-1285 (1999), which involved two postconviction cases by separate petitioners. In one case, the Court of Special Appeals denied leave to appeal, and in the other case, the intermediate appellate court \u201cdismissed\u201d the application for leave to appeal. This Court granted certiorari petitions in both cases, and the State \u201csuggest[ed] that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decisions in these cases.\u201d <em>Grayson, </em>354 Md. at 10, 728 A.2d at 1284. This Court, after reviewing the <em>Williams, Moss, </em>and <em>Jourdan </em>cases, and pointing out that \u201c[t]he holding in <em>Williams </em>has been re-affirmed by us on several occasions\u201d (354 Md. at 11, 728 A.2d at 1285), rejected the State\u2019s suggestion. The Court explained (354 Md. at 12, 728 A.2d at 1285):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201cThe Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decisions in the two cases at bar were not simply discretionary determinations that there should be no appeals. Rather, the Court of Special Appeals decided the merits of an issue raised by both Grayson and Jackson, namely whether the instant petitions were allowable under Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(a)(2). Despite the insertion of the sentences stating that the applications for leave to appeal were denied, the intermediate appellate court did not simply exercise its discretionary authority not to entertain appeals. Instead, the Court of Special Appeals in both cases held that the post-conviction petitions were not allowable as a matter of law. <em>Compare McElroy v. State, supra, </em>329 Md. 136, 617 A.2d 1068, where the Court of Special Appeals held that post conviction relief was not allowable because the petitioners had waived their right to post conviction relief, and where this Court exercised certiorari jurisdiction and affirmed the decisions of the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\"><em>See also, e.g., Cianos v. State, </em>338 Md. 406, 407, 409, 659 A.2d 291, 292, 293 (1995) (emphasis added) (\u201c[A]n order granting or denying that application [for leave to appeal] is not reviewable by this Court by way of certiorari. We may grant certiorari, however, when the intermediate appellate court makes a <em>decision </em>on an application for leave to appeal.... \u201d * * * \u201cThe Court of Special Appeals ... denied the petitioners\u2019 application because it determined that the issues raised by the application were moot\u201d); <em>McElroy v. State, </em>329 Md. 136, 145, 617 A.2d 1068, 1073 (1993)(The Court of Special Appeals, in addition to granting the petitioner\u2019s application for leave to appeal, entered a final judgment terminating the case in that court on the ground that the petitioner had waived his right to bring the action); <em>Sherman v. State, </em>323 Md. 310, 311, 593 A.2d 670 (1991) (This Court, reaffirming <em>Williams, Moss, </em>and <em>Jourdan, </em>denied the certiorari petition for lack of jurisdiction, pointing out that \u201cthe Court of Special Appeals ha[d] simply denied [the] application for leave to appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The General Assembly has acquiesced in this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 12-202 for thirty-five years since the <em>Jourdan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>case was decided in 1975. If, in 1981, it was \u201cparticularly inappropriate to depart from the principle of stare decisis and overrule our prior interpretation of the statute\u201d <em>(Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. at 210, 438 A.2d at 1305), it would be even more inappropriate today. Accordingly, as we have done on numerous prior occasions, we reject the State\u2019s broad interpretation of \u00a7 12-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The appellants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 12-202 fares no better than the State\u2019s broad interpretation of the statute. The appellants\u2019 view of the statute is flatly inconsistent with this Court\u2019s opinions from the <em>Jourdan </em>case to the present. Moreover, their position renders half of the statute nugatory. Under the appellants\u2019 interpretation, \u00a7 12-202 would only apply to denials of leave to appeal, and would not apply to grants of leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Both appellants rely upon the fact that \u201cthe Court of Special Appeals transferred the case to the regular appeal docket\u201d as the jurisdictional basis authorizing this Court to issue writs of certiorari. (Stachowski\u2019s supplemental brief at 3^4; <em>see also </em>Stockstill\u2019s opening supplemental brief at 5). The chief decisional support for the appellants\u2019 theory is part of the passage from <em>Jourdan v. State, </em>275 Md. at 506 n. 4, 341 A.2d at 395-396 n. 4, quoted earlier in this opinion, stating that \u201conce the Court of Special Appeals grants leave to appeal ... <em>and transfers the case to its appeal docket, </em>the matter takes the posture of a regular appeal and <em>we do have jurisdiction </em>under \u00a7 12-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article to review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision on the appeal itself.\u201d (Emphasis added). The appellants also find support in similar language from the opinion in <em>Williams v. State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In their reliance upon the above-quoted passage from <em>Jourdan, </em>however, the appellants focus on the first part of the sentence, but they overlook the remainder of the same sentence which delineates the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 action over which we do have jurisdiction. The latter part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>sentence from <em>Jourdan </em>is that <em>\u201cwe do have jurisdiction </em>under \u00a7 12-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article <em>to review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 </em>decision on the appeal itself.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In all of the prior cases where the Court of Special Appeals granted or denied an application for leave to appeal, and where this Court exercised certiorari jurisdiction, the Court of Special Appeals had rendered a decision concerning the merits or viability of the appeal or the rights or status of a party. The appellants fail to cite a single example of this Court exercising certiorari jurisdiction in the absence of some sort of <em>decision </em>by the Court of Special Appeals going beyond the denial or grant of leave to appeal. Furthermore, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decisions in all of those prior cases were final judgments and terminated the cases in the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Thus, in <em>Grayson v. State, supra, </em>354 Md. at 12, 728 A.2d at 1285, in addition to dismissing the applications for leave to appeal, the Court of Special Appeals \u201cdecided the merits of an issue raised by both\u201d petitioners and held that the actions \u201cwere not allowable as a matter of law.\u201d In <em>Cianos v. State, supra, </em>338 Md. at 407-409, 659 A.2d at 293, the Court of Special Appeals, in denying the application for leave to appeal, also decided \u201cthat the issues raised by the application were moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In <em>McElroy v. State, supra, </em>329 Md. at 145, 617 A.2d at 1073, the Court of Special Appeals, in addition to granting the petitioner\u2019s application for leave to appeal, entered final judgment terminating the case in that court on the ground that the petitioner had waived his right to bring the action. <em>See also, e.g., Williams v. State, supra, </em>292 Md. at 204, 438 A.2d at 1302 (After granting an application for leave to appeal, the Court of Special Appeals decided the merits and remanded the case to the trial court); <em>Davis v. State, </em>285 Md. 19, 22, 400 A.2d 406, 407 (1979) (Following the grant of leave to appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore); <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 137, 395 A.2d 464, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>466 (1978)(The Court of Special Appeals granted leave to appeal and affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment); <em>Moss v. Director, supra, </em>279 Md. at 564, 369 A.2d at 1013 (The Court of Special Appeals granted leave to appeal and affirmed the judgment below); <em>Jourdan v. State, supra, </em>275 Md. at 505-506 and n. 4, 341 A.2d at 394-396 and n. 4 (Following its grant of an application for leave to appeal, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The entire foundation for the appellants\u2019 jurisdictional argument is the phrase in the <em>Jourdan </em>opinion referring to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 action granting leave to appeal and transferring the case to its appeal docket. To reiterate, the appellants take this language out of context, ignoring the remainder of the same sentence stating: \u201cand we do have jurisdiction ... to review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 <em>decision </em>on the appeal itself.\u201d <em>Jourdan, </em>275 Md. at 506 n. 4, 341 A.2d at 395-396 n. 4, emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In addition, this Court in <em>Williams </em>specifically addressed the matter of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 action in placing the case on its appeal docket, and we held that it had no significance with regard to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. At the conclusion of the jurisdictional discussion, the <em>Williams </em>opinion stated (292 Md. at 211 n. 3, 438 A.2d at 1305 n. 3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGH\">\u201cThere is one fact distinguishing this case from <em>Jourdan </em>and <em>Moss. </em>In those cases, after granting the applications for leave to appeal, the Court of Special Appeals transferred the cases to its appeal docket and thereafter rendered decisions on the merits. In the present case, the Court of Special Appeals did not transfer the case to its appeal docket. However, <em>this difference in the internal administrative practice of the Court of Special Appeals does not affect our jurisdiction </em>....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">A review of Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinions in cases involving grants of leave to appeal discloses that cases where briefs are to be filed and oral argument scheduled, such as <em>Jourdan v. State </em>and <em>Moss v. Director, </em>are placed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>appeal docket, whereas cases summarily disposed of, such as <em>Williams v. State, </em>are not. In <em>Williams, </em>the remand to the circuit court was in the same order as the grant of leave to appeal. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 practice regarding its appeal docket is a logical internal administrative practice, but it has no relevance whatsoever to the meaning, purpose or scope of \u00a7 12-202 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Finally, the appellants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 12-202 would never limit this Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction with respect to <em>grants </em>of leave to appeal. Whenever the Court of Special Appeals grants an application for leave to appeal, it will either summarily decide the case <em>(see, e.g., Williams v. </em>State) or it will place the case on its appeal docket <em>(see, e.g., Jourdan v. State). </em>The appellants agree, as this Court\u2019s opinions uniformly hold, that this Court has certiorari jurisdiction in cases where the Court of Special Appeals grants leave to appeal and summarily decides the merits or viability of the case or the rights or status of a party. The appellants also contend that this Court has certiorari jurisdiction in cases which the Court of Special Appeals grants leave to appeal and places on its appeal docket. All Court of Special Appeals\u2019 grants of leave to appeal fall into one or the other of these categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Consequently, under the appellants\u2019 view of the statute, this Court would always have certiorari jurisdiction when the Court of Special Appeals grants leave to appeal. The \u00a7 12-202 limitation upon this Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction would only apply to denials of leave to appeal. Section 12-202, however, expressly applies to \u201ca case or proceeding in which the Court of Special Appeals has denied <em>or granted ... </em>[ljeave to prosecute an appeal____\u201d Thus, the appellants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 12-202 renders the \u201cgrant\u201d portion of the statute nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">As Judge Harrell very recently pointed out for the Court in <em>McHale v. DCW Dutchship Island, </em>415 Md. 145, 999 A.2d 969 (2010), however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u201c[ajcceptance of the ... argument would render meaningless and nugatory the second clause of the section. \u2018We construe the [language of a statute] so as to give effect to each word so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u2019 <em>Foley v. K. Hovnanian at Kent Island, LLC, </em>410 Md. 128, 152, 978 A.2d 222, 237 (2009).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><em>See, e.g., Della Ratta v. Dyas, </em>414 Md. 556, 570, 996 A.2d 382 (2010) (\u201c[A] court should read a statute \u2018as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplus-age, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Addison v.

The statutory language and the opinions by this Court make it clear that this Court has certiorari jurisdiction over the types of cases set forth in \u00a7 12-202 only when the Court of Special Appeals rendered a <em>decision </em>on the merits or the viability of the appeal or the status or rights of a party.

The History ofCJP Section 12-202</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Importantly, the original form of Section 12-202 used very narrow language in limiting this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. The law, as enacted in 1966, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">[I]f it shall be made to appear to the Court of Appeals upon petition of any party, whether a defendant or the State, that a review is desirable and in the public interest, the Court of Appeals shall require, by certiorari or otherwise, any such case to be certified to the Court of Appeals for its review and determination, except no such petition shall be entertained by the Court of Appeals from the denying or granting by the Court of Special Appeals of an application for leave to prosecute an appeal in post conviction and defective delinquent proceedings and from the denying or granting by the Court of Special Appeals of a petition for review filed under \u00a7 21 of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Maryland Code (1957,1966 Cum.Supp.), Art. 5, \u00a7 21A (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">When Section 21A was recodified as CJP Section 12-202 in 1973, the Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Annotated Code stated that the recodification was \u201cmerely a rearrangement of present law\u201d for which \u201cno changes [were] made.\u201d The Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Annotated Code, <em>Report No. SB to the General Assembly of Maryland </em>at 3 (21 Sept. 1972) (hereafter \u201cReport No. 3B\u201d). Despite this reassurance to the legislators, the revision to the language of Section 12-202, enacted by Chapter 2 of the Acts of the First Special Session of 1973, included the following, revised language: \u201cNo review by way of certiorari may be granted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Court of Appeals in a case or proceeding in which the Court of Special Appeals has denied or granted\u201d leave to appeal. This change introduced an ambiguity because it used language suggesting a substantive change, and a more expansive scope for Section 12-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The Revisor only worsened this ambiguity when it commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">[T]he Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction at all to review cases in these categories. The present language refers in terms only to actions \u201cdenying or granting\u201d leave to appeal or a writ of certiorari; it does not expressly prohibit review of a decision rendered after certiorari, for example, has been granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">General Revisor\u2019s Note, Laws of Maryland, First Special Session of 1973, at 354 (emphasis added). This misinterpretation appears to be based on some unnamed conversation with a person associated with the Court of Appeals, perhaps the Clerk of Court, as it added the following rather unusual notation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">The revisor is informed that this view of the statute was adopted by the Court of Appeals when it withdrew its order granting certiorari in <em>Cherry v. State, 9 </em>Md.App. 416 [264 A.2d 887] (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\"><em>Id. </em>It appears that the author of the Revisor\u2019s Note thought that the 1973 \u201cclarifying\u201d changes in language were offered by the Recodification Commission in an attempt to follow what the Revisor perceived to be the understanding of the Court of Appeals, rather than some legislative will to change the Court\u2019s jurisdiction from that set forth in the previous version of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">I submit that the change made to Section 12-202 during recodification was an unorthodox attempt by the Revisor to incorporate into the plainly-worded statute an interpretation of that section expressed by someone associated with the Court of Appeals, but never stated in any opinion issued by this Court. The Revisor\u2019s unusual note cites as authority for this change, an order of the Court unaccompanied by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>opinion, which denied certiorari after originally granting it. The Revisor, in doing so, departs from the Governor\u2019s Commission\u2019s explicit statement that the amendment to the statute was a \u201cmer[e] rearrangement\u201d of the language without substantive change. <em>See </em>Report No. 3B. In a recent case we observed that, in the context of a recodification, the legislature, believing the Revisor\u2019s note to be accurate, may well follow it, even when it is erroneous. See <em>Parker v. State, </em>402 Md. 372, 393-394, 936 A.2d 862, 875 (2007).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">This was the stance we took when addressing the 1973 recodification to Section 12-202 in the decade after its enactment. This Court was first called upon to reconcile the 1973 changes to the language of the statute, with its limited purpose and this Court\u2019s otherwise expansive <em>certiorari </em>jurisdiction in <em>Jourdan v. State, </em>275 Md. 495, 341 A.2d 388 (1975). In <em>Jourdan, </em>we addressed the effect of Section 12-202 on our jurisdiction, but only in a footnote. There, the trial court set aside a criminal conviction, and the State applied to the CSA for leave to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 505, 341 A.2d at 394. In that case, like here, the CSA granted leave to appeal and transferred the ease to its regular appeals docket. <em>Id. </em>The CSA thereafter reversed the trial court decision, and we granted <em>certiorari </em>to review the decision on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 506, 341 A.2d at 394. On the subject of jurisdiction, we simply said in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Under Maryland Code (1974), \u00a7 12-202(1) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, this Court has no jurisdiction to review a decision of the Court of Special Appeals granting or denying leave to appeal in a post conviction proceeding. However, once the Court of Special Appeals grants leave to appeal in such a case and transfers the case to its appeal docket, the matter takes the posture of a regular appeal, and we do have jurisdiction under \u00a7 12-201[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article to review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision on the appeal itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 506 n. 4, 341 A.2d at 394-395 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The issue came up again two years later in <em>Moss v. Director, </em>279 Md. 561, 569, 369 A.2d 1011, 1016 (1977) (Orth, J., dissenting) when it was raised sua sponte by Judge Orth in his dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">To me, there is no ambiguity whatsoever in the dictates of \u00a7 12-202. The plain and certain language leaves nothing to be construed or interpreted. The sure legislative intent is clearly expressed in the command that \u201c[n]o review by way of certiorari may be granted by the Court of Appeals in a case or proceeding in which the Court of Special Appeals has denied or granted ...\u201d leave to appeal in any of the three specified proceedings, one of which is the proceeding here\u2014a defective delinquent proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">The Court of Appeals has acknowledged that it has no jurisdiction to review a decision of the Court of Special Appeals granting or denying leave to appeal under \u00a7 12-202 in a post conviction proceeding. <em>Jourdan v. State, </em>275 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>495, 506, n. 4, 341 A.2d 388 (1975), Smith, J. dissenting on other grounds. But the Court justified review, despite the provisions of the statute[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 570-571, 369 A.2d at 1016-1017. The Moss majority opinion did not respond to the dissent\u2019s jurisdictional argument, and simply made its ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Shortly after Moss, the leading case on this jurisdictional issue, <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 438 A.2d 1301 (1981), was written by Judge Eldridge. The Court in <em>Williams </em>declined to interpret Section 12-202 according to the recodified language, and instead confirmed <em>Jourdan\u2019s </em>narrow interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 208-11, 438 A.2d 1301, 1304-05. The appeal arose after a criminal defendant challenged his conviction under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, and the post-conviction trial court granted the defendant a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 438 A.2d at 1302. The CSA granted the State\u2019s request for leave to appeal and remanded to the trial court for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>Williams then sought writ of certiorari from this Court to appeal the remand, which we granted. <em>Id. </em>at 205, 438 A.2d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In rejecting the State\u2019s argument in Williams\u2014that Section 12-202 deprived this Court of jurisdiction to hear post-conviction cases at all<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2014our language was unmistakably clear in articulating the very limited scope of the jurisdictional restriction set forth in Section 12-202</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdMI\">[W]e reaffirm the holdings in <em>Jourdan </em>and <em>Moss </em>that the limitation upon this Court\u2019s jurisdiction set forth in \u00a7 12-202 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article relates only to the action of the Court of Special Appeals in granting or denying an application for leave to appeal. Except for the nonreviewability of that specific action, we have jurisdiction over the type of cases listed in \u00a7 12-202 to the extent that such jurisdiction is conferred by \u00a7 12-201 or other statutory provisions. Therefore, in the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>although we may not review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 exercise of discretion in granting the State\u2019s application for leave to appeal, we are authorized to review that court\u2019s decision on the merits remanding the case to the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_r\"><em>Id. </em>at 210-11, 438 A.2d at 1305 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">To support this departure from the language of the statute, Judge Eldridge relied on precedent and legislative acquiescence to judicial decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">The Legislature has re-enacted with amendments \u00a7 12-202 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article on two occasions since the <em>Jourdan </em>case was decided in July 1975. <em>See </em>Ch. 678, \u00a7 4, of the Acts of 1977 and Ch. 311, \u00a7 3, of the Acts of 1977. It has also amended the Post Conviction Procedure Act twice since 1975. <em>See </em>Ch. 678, \u00a7 1, of the Acts of 1977 and Ch. 472, \u00a7 6, of the Acts of 1976. On none of these occasions did the Legislature change the interpretation of those statutes set forth by this Court in <em>Jourdan.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">The General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation. This presumption is particularly strong whenever, after statutory language has been interpreted by this Court, the Legislature re-enacts the statute without changing in substance the language at issue. Under these circumstances, it is particularly inappropriate to depart from the principle of stare decisis and overrule our prior interpretation of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 209-10, 438 A.2d at 1305 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In subsequent cases involving Section 12-202, we applied the holdings of <em>Jourdan </em>and <em>Williams </em>to different factual circumstances, although never in a case involving Section 12-203 bypass jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Sherman v. State, </em>323 Md. 310, 311, 593 A.2d 670, 670 (1991) (holding that \u00a7 12-202 bars jurisdiction when the CSA has simply <em>denied </em>an application for leave to appeal in a post-conviction proceeding); <em>Cianos v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>State, </em>338 Md. 406, 407, 659 A.2d 291, 292 (1995) (holding that Section 12-202 does not apply where the Court of Special Appeals addresses the merits in a denial); <em>Grayson v. State, </em>354 Md. 1, 12, 728 A.2d 1280, 1285 (1999) (holding that 12-202 does not bar jurisdiction where the Court of Special Appeals decisions \u201cwere not simply discretionary determinations that there should be no appeals.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\n<em>2. The Majority\u2019s Holding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The majority, I submit, erroneously interprets this legislative history and line of cases to suggest that Section 12-202 limits our ability to review certain pending appeals on the merits. As justification for this discordant holding, the majority relies on two propositions: (1) that the <em>Jourdan-Williams </em>line of cases suggests that bypass jurisdiction should be limited, and (2) that the plain language of Section 12-202 must be interpreted to limit our jurisdiction in these cases. I disagree with both of these propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Rather than apply the clear rationale of <em>Williams </em>that Section 12-202 \u201crelates only to the action of the CSA in granting or denying an application for leave to appeal,\u201d the majority effectively limits the holdings of <em>Williams </em>and its progeny to their specific factual or procedural circumstances. First, the majority distinguishes a series of cases in which the petitioner <em>did </em>challenge the actual decision of the CSA to deny leave to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather than foreclosing our jurisdiction here, these cases simply apply the statutory rule that the Court of Appeals shall not review the grant or denial of an application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Second, the majority identifies a number of cases in which this Court reviewed the merits of a case after a CSA decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The majority concludes from these cases that a decision from the lower appellate court is a prerequisite to our review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The majority supports this holding with the following, aforementioned, language in <em>Jourdan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">Under Maryland Code (1974), \u00a7 12-202(1) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, this Court has no jurisdiction to review a decision of the Court of Special Appeals granting or denying leave to appeal in a post conviction proceeding. However, once the Court of Special Appeals grants leave to appeal in such a case and transfers the case to its appeal docket, the matter takes the posture of a regular appeal, and we do have jurisdiction under \u00a7 12-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article to review the <em>Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision on the appeal itself.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATp\">275 Md. at 506 n. 4, 341 A.2d at 394-95 n. 4 (emphasis added by majority). Again, the majority ignores the more important proposition from this quote in <em>Jourdan, </em>which is that after the CSA \u201ctransfers the case to its appeal docket, the matter takes the posture of a regular appeal.\u201d It is the case\u2019s status as a regular appeal that allowed us \u201cto review the [CSA\u2019s] decision!;,]\u201d and should allow us to exercise bypass <em>certiorari </em>here. The majority avoids this logical result by transforming the effect of the <em>Jourdan </em>rule in one case into a precondition in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The majority fails to support its interpretation of the <em>Jourdan-Williams </em>line of cases with any passage from those cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>even hinting that our bypass jurisdiction under Section 12-203 is so limited. Indeed, these cases do not even mention our bypass jurisdiction. The cases simply show instances in which we have elected to grant certiorari in the circumstance that the CSA has decided the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The majority\u2019s second rationale is a statutory construction theory. Relying on the adage that in interpreting a statute, we must always take care that \u201cno word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory\u201d, (Maj. Op. at 298, 6 A.3d at 919), the majority reasons that to allow these appeals would render superfluous Section 12-202\u2019s use of the word \u201cgranted.\u201d (Maj. Op. at 297, 6 A.3d at 919).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The familiar canon that \u201ca provision should not be construed so as to render it nugatory[,]\u201d <em>Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 548, 873 A.2d 1122, 1141 (2005), is merely a restatement of one of the principles of a \u201cplain language\u201d statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">In construing the plain language, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. Statutory text should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory. The plain language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation. Rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-9\"><em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576-577, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005) (emphasis added). The rule against rendering passages \u201cnugatory,\u201d like any canon of statutory construction, is not absolute. In the unusual case where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Legislature has not \u201cmeant what it said and said what it meant[,]\u201d then the correct interpretation of the Legislature\u2019s intent may render words or passages superfluous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">[WJhere words are found in a statute which appear to have been inserted through inadvertence or mistake, and which are incapable of any sensible meaning or are repugnant to the rest of the statute and tend to nullify it, and the statute is complete and sensible without them, they may be rejected as surplusage ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain from the entire statute the intention to be accomplished by the enactment. When that intention is clear it should be carried out, even though it may be necessary to strike out or insert certain words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">(Emphasis added). <em>Pressman v. State Tax Commission, </em>204 Md. 78, 88-90, 102 A.2d 821, 827-828 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">We have long recognized that the current form of Section 12-202 is the rare example where the statute\u2019s plain language does not accurately represent the legislature\u2019s intent. As this Court explained in <em>Williams, </em>and in the majority\u2019s opinion in this case, the legislature never intended to give the statute any other meaning than its old form. For this reason, this Court has repeatedly declined to give full import to the plain language of the recodified version of the statute. In two cases, this Court looked to the original version of the statute, which clearly only barred the \u201cgranting or denying.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>292 Md. at 208-11, 438 A.2d at 1304-05; <em>Grayson v. State, </em>354 Md. 1, 11, 728 A.2d 1280, 1285 (1999). The majority recognizes our long line of Section 12-202 jurisprudence, and acknowledges twenty-nine years of legislative acquiescence to our interpretation in <em>Williams. See </em>Maj. Op. at 292, 6 A.3d at 916, <em>citing </em>Chapter 295 of the Maryland Laws of 1983, Chapter 233 of the Maryland Laws of 1991. The majority, however, draws a choke-chain around the <em>Jourdanr-Williams </em>line of cases, and analyzes the statutory language anew.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Moreover, despite the majority\u2019s assertions that it is engaging in a \u201cplain language\u201d interpretation, the majority fails to even address the plain language of Section 12-203:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">If the Court of Appeals finds that review of the case described in \u00a7 12-201 of this subtitle is desirable and in the public interest, the Court of Appeals shall require by writ of certiorari that the case be certified to it for review and determination. The writ may issue before or after the Court of Special Appeals has rendered a decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). This statutory language makes it unmistakably clear that our bypass jurisdiction is coterminous with our jurisdiction to review a CSA decision on the merits under Section 12-201. The majority\u2019s attempt to wrench the two apart, based on the single word \u201cgranted\u201d in Section 12-202, ignores the interdependent nature of Sections 12-201,12-202, and 12-203, and the clearly expansive <em>certiorari </em>jurisdiction that the three sections give this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Even if we were to follow the majority\u2019s premise that we must give meaning to each word in the current form of Section 12-202, I still disagree that my interpretation would render part of the statute nugatory. While admittedly, under my view, this Court would \u201calways have [bypass] certiorari jurisdiction when the Court of Special Appeals grants leave to appeal,\u201d it does not follow that Section 12-202 would \u201capply only to denials of leave to appeal\u201d and thus contain irrelevant words. Section 12-202 still bars review of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s <em>actual decision </em>to grant leave to appeal. There are no recorded cases in which we have considered such an appeal, but the nonexistence of these cases does not mean that the \u201cgrant\u201d clause of Section 12-202 is nugatory. The State could request certiorari, arguing that the CSA abused its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>in granting a post-conviction defendant\u2019s request for leave to appeal. An inmate, who was successful in an inmate grievance proceeding, could appeal the CSA\u2019s decision to grant the warden\u2019s request for leave to appeal. A criminal defendant, having pled guilty and received a sentence, could apply for <em>certiorari </em>on the grounds that the CSA should not have granted the State\u2019s application for leave to appeal an illegal sentence. In any of these cases, the \u201cgranted\u201d part of Section 12-202 would preclude our issuing <em>certiorari; </em>indeed, we have never considered, in a written opinion, such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">My final problem with the majority\u2019s opinion is that it cannot be linked to any statutory purpose nor meaningful policy goal. The majority imposes a requirement here that this Court wait for a decision from the lower appellate court, even when this Court will likely issue <em>certiorari </em>after the decision. Yet, our bypass jurisdiction serves an obvious purpose: where a case is of pressing importance, we may address the case \"without waiting for a CSA decision. This process serves judicial economy and ensures more speedy justice in important cases. The majority\u2019s interpretation\u2014that we have bypass jurisdiction for any case pending in the CSA <em>except for </em>the five statutory categories of Section 12-202, supports no meaningful policy goals and is inconsistent with the well-defined legislative intent that this Court have expansive <em>certiorari </em>jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In conclusion, I submit that the primary purpose of Section 12-202 was to relieve this Court of jurisdiction to review the otherwise high volume of complaints by convicted criminals seeking post-conviction relief that the CSA should have accepted their appeals. In doing so, the statute freed the Court to perform its other work.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> I see no evidence of legislative intent to deprive the Court of its jurisdiction under Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>12-203 to exercise its bypass jurisdiction of these types of cases, when it deemed them to be of sufficient public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">For the above-stated reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Judges HARRELL and RODOWSKY authorize me to state that they join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">.
