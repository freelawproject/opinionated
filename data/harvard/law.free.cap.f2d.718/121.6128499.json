The damages awarded were for injuries inflicted by a pit bulldog owned by the Quezadas. The plaintiff appeals from the determination of the bankruptcy court, affirmed by the district court, that the debt was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-23\">The plaintiff Kelt contends that the debtors-bankrupts\u2019 conduct in harboring in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>crowded neighborhood a vicious dog, known to have previously bitten another person, resulted in a nondischargeable debt \u201cfor willful and malicious injury by the debtor.\u201d Section 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). We affirm, however, the holding that the mere harboring of a vicious dog, although it is permitted to escape negligently to cause injury, is not the deliberate and intentional conduct by the debtor required for nondischarge-ability of a debt for the resulting injury, as causing \u201cwillful and malicious injury by the debtor\u201d within the meaning of Section 523(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\">Under stipulated facts, the Quezadas maintained a vicious bulldog within their fenced premises, with knowledge that the dog had previously bitten a child. The dog escaped from the premises when Mrs. Que-zada opened the gate to allow Mr. Quezada to bring his truck into the yard. The dog attacked the four-year-old son of the plaintiff Kelt without provocation, causing injuries for which Kelt had obtained in state court a judgment of $8,400 as administrator of his child\u2019s estate. Other than their harboring of the animal and inadvertently permitting it to escape, no action or conduct by the Quezadas caused or contributed to the attack by the dog upon the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">For reasons to be noted, neither the Que-zadas\u2019 harboring of the pit bulldog within their fenced premises in a crowded neighborhood, nor their subsequent negligence in permitting the dog to escape so as to cause injury, constitutes the deliberate and intentional infliction of injury so as to make the debt therefor nondischargeable under Section 523(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">Prior to its repeal by the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, the predecessor provision in the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 had excepted from dischargeability \u201cliabilities for willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another.\u201d Section 17(a)(8), as amended, formerly 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(8). In <em>Tinker v. Colwell, </em>193 U.S. 472, 24 S.Ct. 505 (1904) the Supreme Court held nondis-chargeable under this provision a husband\u2019s recovery of damages in state court against the bankrupt-defendant for adultery committed with the plaintiff\u2019s consenting wife. Some courts subsequently interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale as providing that conduct entered into with reckless disregard for the rights of others that caused damage resulted in nondischargeable liability for \u201cwillful\u201d injury within the meaning of Section 17(a)(8).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Arguably, the harboring of a vicious dog in a crowded neighborhood could be regarded as harm-causing conduct entered into with reckless disregard for the injury it might cause to others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-10\">Nevertheless, by the replacement of the former Act\u2019s Section 17(a)(8) with the 1978 Code\u2019s Section 523(a)(6), Congress expressly intended to overrule legislatively the reckless-disregard test for nondischargeability. The new statutory language excepting from discharge a debt \u201cfor willful and malicious injury <em>by the debtor </em>to another,\u201d Section 523(a)(6) (emphasis added; being the wording added by the 1978 Code), was explicitly so explained. Both House and Senate reports on versions containing identical language insofar as the final enactment of the provision in Section 523(a)(6), explained that the statutory provision excepted from dischargeability debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor and that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap02\">Under this paragraph, \u201cwillful\u201d means deliberate or intentional. To the extent that <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>139 [193] U.S. 473 [24 S.Ct. 505, 48 L.Ed. 754] (1902), held that a less strict [in House version, \u201clooser\u201d for \u201cless strict\u201d] standard is intended, and to the extent that other cases have relied on <em>Tinker </em>to apply a \u201creckless disregard\u201d standard, they are overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 365 (1977) <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5968, 6320-21; S.Rep.

An injury of an entity or property may be a malicious injury within this provision if it was wrongful and without just cause or excessive, even in the absence of personal hatred, spite or ill-will. The word \u201cwillful\u201d means \u201cdeliberate or intentional\u201d, a deliberate and intentional act which necessarily leads to injury. Therefore, a wrongful act done intentionally, which necessarily produces harm and is without just cause or excuse, may constitute a willful and malicious injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">3 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 523.16 at 523-118 (15th ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">Under the present facts, no debt for \u201cwillful and malicious injury <em>by the debt- or\u201d, </em>Section 523(a)(6), is shown. The debtors Quezadas\u2019 intentional harboring of the vicious pit bulldog within their fence is not shown to be conduct intentionally exposing others to harm by the vicious dog. The negligence of the debtors in permitting the dog to escape when they opened the gate is not shown to be conduct designed to cause deliberate or intentional injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">We have found only isolated decisions addressing the issue before us. <em>In Matter of Sadwin, </em>15 B.R. 884 (D.C.M.D.Fla.1981), affirming 3 B.R. 581 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Fla.1980), as well as in <em>Matter of Cecko, </em>27 B.R. 26 (Bkrtcy.N.D.Ohio 1982), upon a similar analysis the courts reached the same conclusion as we have here, in rejecting claims of nondischargeability for injuries resulting from the harboring of a vicious dog. In <em>In Re Ri\u00f1es, </em>18 B.R. 666 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Ga.1982), however, the court concluded injury so caused was nondischargeable, based upon its determination that the 1978 Bankruptcy Code amendment was not intended to overrule the reckless-disregard standard for nondischargeability; for reasons earlier noted, we disagree with this rationale. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">We AFFIRM, finding as did the previous courts that the liability for injuries caused by a vicious dog negligently let loose are not excepted from dischargeability in bankruptcy as being a debt for \u201cwillful and malicious injury by the debtor\u201d within the meaning of Section 523(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">. Among these are three decisions by New York state courts, the only decisions cited to us by the plaintiff-creditor, that held nondischargeable under former Section 17(a)(8) a liability resulting from dog-bite based on mere harboring of it (i.e., in reckless disregard of the rights of others). <em>Yackel v. Nys, </em>258 App.Div. 318, 16 N.Y.S.2d 545 (App.Div.,1939); <em>Humphreys v. Heller, </em>157 Misc. 568, 283 N.Y.S. 915 (Sup.Ct. Bronx County, 1935); <em>Beam v. Karaim, </em>47 N.Y. S.2d 193 (Broome County Court, 1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1183-12\">. See the decisions cited in note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">. The plaintiff Kelt cites remarks in Congressional debate that final version of Section 523(a)(6) adopts the position taken by the House bill and rejects the Senate version. The plaintiff overlooks that this comment referred only to elimination of the phrase \u201cor conversion\u201d from the Senate version and adopts the House position that a \u201cwillful and malicious injury,\u201d i.e., the statutory language, covers a willful and malicious <em>conversion. </em>124 Cong. Rec.H. 11,095 (Sept. 28, 1978); S. 17412 (Oct. 6, 1978). Both houses were in agreement as to their version and intent as to what constituted a nondischargeable \u201cwillful and malicious injury by the debtor\u201d; their disagreement as to whether a conversion of that nature was or was not included within the term is, of course, immaterial to the present issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
