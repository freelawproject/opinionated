Wilma Sullivan did not stand for re-election on November 4, 1980, and accordingly she is no longer in office. John Sullivan was a declared candidate for the office held by Wilma Sullivan; he was elected and now serves as Supervisor of Elections for Leon County.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">Clifford Mason, a write-in candidate for the office of Supervisor of Elections for Leon County in the 1980 election, requested an advisory opinion pursuant to Fla.Stat. \u00a7 106.23(2) (1979), \u201cabout the Deputy Supervisor of Elections taking a leave of absence if he is a candidate.\u201d Mason\u2019s request made no mention of either appellant or of the office of Supervisor of Elections for Leon County. On October 23, 1980, the Division of Elections rendered an advisory opinion to Mason. The opinion made no reference to appellants or to the office of Supervisor of Elections for Leon County; nor did it state that it was legally binding or constituted final agency action as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-17\">Appellants sought judicial review of this advisory opinion in the Florida District Court of Appeal, First District. The court dismissed their petition for review, however, because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review such \u201can advisory opinion.\u201d Appellants then brought this suit on June 6, 1981, seeking a declaration that \u00a7 106.23(2) is invalid, both facially and as applied, under the fourteenth amendment. Appellants alleged that \u00a7 106.23(2) is unconstitutional because it does not provide notice to and a hearing for persons who might be affected by a Division of Elections\u2019 advisory opinion. Appellants also sought a permanent injunction precluding any enforcement of the advisory opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-18\">The district court dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint for want of jurisdiction because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>it failed \u201cto allege facts creating an actual controversy between the parties,\u201d but gave appellants leave to amend. Appellants amended their complaint, but the court again dismissed it, this time with prejudice, for want of a ease or controversy. The court entered judgment for the defendants and the Sullivans took this appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">A district court can grant declaratory relief only if there is \u201ca substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality between parties having adverse legal interests.\u201d <em>Wolfer v. Thaler, </em>525 F.2d 977, 979 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 975, 96 S.Ct. 2176, 48 L.Ed.2d 800 (1976). In addition, a court may not \u201cenjoin conduct which is neither threatened nor imminent.\u201d <em>Congress of Racial Equality v. Douglas, </em>318 F.2d 95, 100 (5th Cir.1963). We have carefully examined the allegations of appellants\u2019 amended complaint and the arguments on appeal, and cannot discern how there is any case or controversy here as to the validity of \u00a7 106.23(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
