When Mr. Burgess applied to the Houston Lighting and Power Company for connection of electric service at the new location, he learned that a city ordinance required that the wiring in the house meet current city building code specifications before the city would authorize connection of service. He also learned that it was the electric department\u2019s practice to require the owner of a relocated structure to hire a private electrical contractor to bring the building into compliance before a city electrical inspector would inspect the wiring. Burgess refused to do so, and consequently his home has been without electricity since the date of its relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Burgess filed a pro se complaint in federal district court against the city of Houston alleging that the city\u2019s refusal to authorize the connection of electric power to his house constituted an unreasonable seizure of his property and a denial of equal protection. He further alleged that a leak in the city\u2019s water line caused severe structural damage to his house. Subsequently, with the aid of counsel, Burgess filed several amendments to his complaint in which he claimed relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1988, 2000a-l to 2000a-3 and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Other claims by Burgess in his original complaint appear to have been abandoned in the later pleadings and on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">On motion of the city, the district court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim. Burgess thereafter filed a timely motion to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">I. <em>Delegation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">Appellant argues that the city\u2019s procedure whereby private licensed electricians inspect and determine compliance of electrical wiring in relocated houses is not authorized by city ordinance and thus constitutes an improper delegation of the city electrical inspector\u2019s duties. Texas jurisprudence is sparse on this subject. The general rule is that \u201cthe public powers of trusts devolved by law or charter upon the [city] council or governing body, to be exercised by it when and in such manner as it shall judge best, cannot be delegated to others.\u201d <em>Zachry v. City of San Antonio, </em>296 S.W.2d 299, 304 (Tex.Civ.App.1956), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>157 Tex. 551, 305 S.W.2d 558 (1957). It is also true that the discharge of duties which call for reason or discretion and which are regarded as part of the public trust cannot be delegated. <em>Horne Zoological Arena Co. v. City of Dallas, </em>45 S.W.2d 714, 715 (Tex. Civ.App.1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">Appellant\u2019s argument is spurious. Clearly the city\u2019s use of private electricians does not constitute the delegation of a public trust. The private electricians are licensed by the city and their work is subsequently inspected by a city inspector. <em>See </em>Schedule of Permits and Electrical Ordinances, Appendix, at 690, 699. Burgess makes no challenge to the constitutionality of the city ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">II. <em>Constitutional Right to Electricity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Appellant\u2019s averments in support of his civil rights\u2019 claim are confusing. He does not allege that he has a constitutionally protected property interest in receiving electricity. Instead, he maintains that he has a constitutional right to have a city electrical inspector make an initial inspection of his premises. According to Burgess, the electric department\u2019s refusal to conduct an initial inspection deprives him of electric service without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">\n<em>A. \u00a7 1983</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-18\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s dismissal of an action for failure to state a claim, the appellate court accepts as true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the factual allegations of appellant\u2019s complaint. <em>Marrero v. City of Hialeah, </em>625 F.2d 499, 502 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 913,101 S.Ct. 1353, 67 L.Ed.2d 337 (1981). In order to state a claim under \u00a7 1983, the complainant must allege facts showing that the conduct complained of was committed by one acting under color of state law and that this conduct deprived the complainant of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>See Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 535, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1912, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981). Municipalities may be sued under \u00a7 1983 when the conduct alleged to be unconstitutional \u201cimplements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers.\u201d <em>Monell v. New York City Dept, of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Local governments may also be sued for alleged constitutional deprivations caused by governmental custom. <em>Id., </em>436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Although Burgess has alleged facts showing that the conduct complained of was committed by one acting under color of State law, he has failed to set forth facts demonstrating the deprivation of a constitutionally protected right. The courts recognize that utility service is a necessity of modern life. <em>Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 18, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 1565, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978). Indeed, there is a constitutionally protected right to continued utility service. <em>See generally id.; Davis v. Weir, </em>497 F.2d 139 (5th Cir.1974); <em>Bradford v. Edelstein, </em>467 F.Supp. 1361 (S.D.Tex.1979). No authority has been discovered, however, for the proposition that there is a constitutional right to receive electric power when the applicant refuses to comply with reasonable administrative procedures. These are reasonable, as the trial judge expressly found. It is clear that Burgess\u2019s complaint, even given liberal construction, does not demonstrate the deprivation of a constitutionally-protected right.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\n<em>B. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In order to state a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, the complainant must allege facts demonstrating that the State has deprived him of a liberty or property interest without due process of law. <em>Marrero v. City of Hialeah, </em>625 F.2d at 519. Appellant\u2019s failure to demonstrate the deprivation of a constitutionally-protected interest obviates the need to determine whether he was afforded due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\n<em>C. Conspiracy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Burgess asserts broadly that the city electrical inspectors refused to inspect his house \u201cbecause they, themselves, are part of an established strong profession and they wish to help keep the public uninformed.\u201d This argument is meritless. Appellant has stated no set of facts demonstrating a conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">\n<em>D. \u00a7\u00a7 2000a-l to 2000a-8</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Burgess has stated no facts which show that the city of Houston discriminated against him or denied him equal protection because of his race, color, religion, or national origin. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000a-l to 2000a-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">III. <em>Tort Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Burgess argues that the damage to his property caused by a leak in a water line maintained by the city constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law. Although Burgess may have been deprived of property under color of state law, the deprivation did not occur because of an established state procedure or policy. <em>See Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. at 543,101 S.Ct. at 1917. Furthermore, an adequate state remedy existed under Texas law to redress the wrong. Suit is precluded under the Texas Tort Claims Act, 17 % Tex.Stat.Ann. art. 6252-19 \u00a7 18(a) (Vernon 1983), because the city was acting in its proprietary function in maintaining a water works system. <em>See Turvey v. City of Houston, </em>602 S.W.2d 517, 518 (Tex.1980). The Act, however, pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>serves a claimant\u2019s common law right to seek unlimited damages for the negligence of a municipality while performing a proprietary function. <em>Turvey v. City of Houston, </em>602 S.W.2d at 519. Appellant failed to pursue this avenue of relief. \u201c[T]he existence of an adequate state remedy to redress property damage inflicted by state officers avoids the conclusion that there has been any constitutional deprivation of property \u2018without due process of law....\u2019\u201d <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. at 542,101 S.Ct. at 1916, <em>quoting Bonner v. Coughlin, </em>517 F.2d 1311, 1319 (7th Cir.1975), <em>modified en banc, </em>545 F.2d 565 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 932, 98 S.Ct. 1507, 55 L.Ed.2d 529 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">It appears beyond doubt that Burgess can prove no set of facts in support of his claims which would entitle him to relief. <em>Carpenters Local Union 1846 v. Pratt-Farnsworth, </em>690 F.2d 489, 500 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
