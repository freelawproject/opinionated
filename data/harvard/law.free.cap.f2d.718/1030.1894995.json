That court held that a certificate of deposit (CD) constituted cash proceeds under Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 679.306(1) (West Supp.1983), and that therefore the appellees, Citicorp and Southeast Bank, had a continuing perfected security interest in the CD at issue, even though they were not in possession of the instrument. The district court\u2019s decision reversed the holding of the bankruptcy court, 19 Bankr. 871 (Bankr.S.B.Fla.1982), that the banks\u2019 security interest was unperfected. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-15\">The banks shared a perfected security interest in various of the debtors\u2019 assets, including general intangibles, as collateral for the debtors\u2019 indebtedness of approximately $3 million. Shortly before various of the debtors\u2019 creditors filed an involuntary petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, the debtors received a federal tax refund of approximately $1.3 million. The banks had been aware that the debtors would receive this money, although the banks did not know exactly when. Without the knowledge of the banks the debtors used this refund to purchase a CD of which the banks did not take possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-17\">In Florida security interests are governed by the Uniform Commercial Code. Under Florida law a perfected security interest in collateral continues in the proceeds generated by disposition of that collateral for at least 10 days. Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 679.306(3) (West Supp.1983). Continuation beyond the tenth day depends in part on how those proceeds are classified under Sec. 679.306. Section 679.306 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-18\">(1) \u201cProceeds\u201d includes whatever is received upon the sale, exchange, collection or other disposition of collateral or proceeds. Insurance payable by reason of loss or damage to the collateral is proceeds, except to the extent that it is payable to a person other than a party to the security agreement. Money, checks, deposit accounts, and the like are \u201ccash proceeds.\u201d All other proceeds are \u201cnon-cash proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-20\">(2) Except where this chapter otherwise provides, a security interest continues in collateral notwithstanding sale, exchange, or other disposition thereof unless the disposition was authorized by the secured party in the security agreement or otherwise, and also continues in any identifiable proceeds including collections received by the debtor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-21\">(3) The security interest in proceeds is a continuously perfected security interest if the interest in the original collateral was perfected, but it ceases to be a perfected security interest and becomes unperfected 10 days after receipt of the proceeds by the debtor unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>(a) A filed financing statement covers the original collateral and the proceeds are collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by filing in the office or offices where the financing statement has been filed and, if the proceeds are acquired with cash proceeds, the description of collateral in the financing statement indicates the types of property constituting the proceeds; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-4\">(b) A filed financing statement covers the original collateral and the proceeds are identifiable cash proceeds; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-5\">(c) The security interest in the proceeds is perfected before expiration of the 10-day period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-6\">Except as provided in this section, a security interest in proceeds can be perfected only by the methods or under the circumstances permitted in this chapter for original collateral of the same type.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">The district court held that CD\u2019s are cash proceeds within the meaning of Sec. 679.306(1), and that therefore the banks\u2019 security interest in the CD remained perfected under Sec. 679.306(3)(b). Because the court\u2019s decision was based on its interpretation of Florida law, we have the fullest scope of review; the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Florida statute is not shielded by any presumption of correctness. <em>See Universal Minerals, Inc. v. C.A. Hughes &amp; Co., </em>669 F.2d 98, 102 (3d Cir.1981); <em>see also International Horizons, Inc. v. Committee of Unsecured Creditors (In re International Horizons, Inc.), </em>689 F.2d 996, 1002-05 (11th Cir.1982) (engaging in de novo review of district court\u2019s decision on choice of law on review of bankruptcy court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-8\">Applying Sec. 679.306 to the present case, we find the banks had a temporarily perfected security interest in the CD for 10 days after it was acquired by the debtors. For that perfected security interest to continue, however, the banks had to fall within one of the three subsections of Fla.Stat. Ann. Sec. 679.306(3). The banks did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">Neither of the parties argues that the banks\u2019 security interest continued to be perfected under Sec. 679.306(3)(a) or (c). Rather the issue presented is whether the CD constituted \u201cidentifiable cash proceeds\u201d within the protection of Sec. 679.306(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-12\">Cash proceeds are defined in Sec. 679.-306(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-13\">Money, checks, deposit accounts, and the like are \u201ccash proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-14\">A CD is not a check or money. Likewise, a 1979 amendment to Fla.Stat.Ann.Sec. 679.-105(l)(e) (West Supp.1983) explicitly provides that the term \u201cdeposit account\u201d does not include CD\u2019s.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-15\">\u201cDeposit account\u201d means [something] other than an account evidenced by a certificate of deposit. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-16\">The 1979 amendment is particularly pertinent in the present case because the Sponsors\u2019 Notes to the amendment state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-17\">A definition of \u201cdeposit account\u201d has been added to facilitate references to such accounts <em>in the section on proceeds </em>(s. 679.306).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-18\">(emphasis added). The narrow question we must decide is whether, as the banks argue, CD\u2019s fall within the \u201cand the like\u201d language of Sec. 679.306(1). It defies common sense, however, to suggest that the Florida legislature added the amendment excluding CD\u2019s from the definition of deposit accounts (one of the specified types of cash proceeds), and referred the reader to the section on cash proceeds, only to intend that CD\u2019s be treated as cash proceeds in the catch-all clause \u201cand the like.\u201d The obvious legislative intent behind the amendment is that CD\u2019s are not cash proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-19\">The banks rely on <em>Citizens National Bank v. Bomstein, </em>374 So.2d 6 (Fla.1979), in support of their argument that CD\u2019s are \u201clike\u201d checks and therefore are cash proceeds. This reads too much into the <em>Bomstein </em>opinion. It held that a CD is an \u201cinstrument.\u201d While checks may be instruments, so are promissory notes and bills of exchange, Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 673.104(2) (West 1966 &amp; Supp. 1983), neither of which is listed under Sec. 679.306(1) as identifiable cash proceeds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Bomstein </em>did not compare CD\u2019s to checks as the banks imply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>The banks argue that the result reached here would be \u201cpreposterous,\u201d because it \u201cprovides an opportunity for a debtor to conceal proceeds of collateral from a secured creditor, to secretly convert that collateral into another form which requires perfection by taking possession, and then to effectively extinguish the right of that secured creditor by consciously withholding that collateral or keeping its existence a secret....\u201d Brief for Appellees at 18-19. This argument is misconceived. The Code gives secured creditors many methods of policing their debtors. By contractual agreement lenders may require their debtors to permit on-premises inspections of their books or they may insist that payments owed to the debtor by third parties must be sent directly to the lender. Fla. Stat.Ann. Sec. 679.502 (West Supp.1983). As Florida Steel points out, the banks might also have availed themselves of the Federal Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 203 (1976), <em>amended by </em>31 U.S. C.A. Sec. 3727 (West 1983), which permits creditors to obtain directly from the government sums of money, such as tax refunds, which are liquidated claims owed by the government to the debtor. <em>See, e.g., King v. Gilbert, </em>569 F.2d 398 (5th Cir.1978) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">Because the district court misconstrued Sec. 679.306, we reverse its judgment and remand to the district court with instructions to affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1126-10\">. Generally, to perfect a security interest in an instrument the secured party must take posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>sion of it. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat.Axin. Sec. 679.304 (West 1966 &amp; Supp.1983). The banks admit that they did not take possession of the CD.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">Under Sec. 679.306, checks represent a narrow departure from the general requirement of possession of instruments. That section provides that checks may be the object of a perfected security interest without possession when they are identifiable cash proceeds. Far from being \u201clike\u201d checks, however, CD\u2019s are similar to promissory notes. <em>Maxwell v. Agnew, </em>21 Fla. 154 (1884). In <em>Southview Corp. v. Kleberg First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>512 S.W.2d 817 (Tex.Civ.App.1974), the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-9\">The promissory note theory of certificate of deposit has been incorporated into the Code as illustrated by the definition of a certificate of deposit: \u201c[A] receipt of money with an engagement to repay it.\u201d ... Following this definition of certificate of deposit, the Code makes such definition applicable to other chapters which would necessarily include Chapter 9____ In its usual and ordinary form, a certificate of deposit contains the elements of a promissory note, rather than of a mere receipt, and in general has that legal effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 819-20 (citations omitted). For this reason as well, the banks\u2019 argument that CD\u2019s are like checks must fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
