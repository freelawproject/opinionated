The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed his conviction. Cox filed for habeas corpus in the district court, which adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation and denied the writ. Cox appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-26\">The district court did not err in accepting the state trial court\u2019s determination that Cox\u2019s confession was voluntary. Prior to trial the state court, following <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), held a hearing to determine the voluntariness of a written confession that Cox had signed. The state and Cox introduced conflicting testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding the confession. The trial court did not make specific findings of fact but apparently believed the state\u2019s witnesses over Cox\u2019s as it admitted the statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>In reviewing voluntariness this court will only reverse a finding of fact if it is clearly erroneous. <em>Jurek v. Estelle, </em>623 F.2d 929, 930 (5th Cir.1980) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1001, 101 S.Ct. 1709, 68 L.Ed.2d 203 (1981). At the same time we must undertake an independent examination of the entire record. <em>Id. </em>Upon such an examination, we find that the trial court\u2019s determination that the confession was voluntary was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">The trial court did not err in denying Cox funds to hire a sociological expert. Cox desired to challenge the array of the grand jury on the basis of systematic exclusion of adults aged 18 to 30. To make such a challenge Cox must show \u201c(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018distinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which jurys [sic] are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\u201d <em>Duren v. Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S.Ct. 664, 668, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979). Cox sought to employ a sociologist to prove that the young are an identifiable group. The young are not a distinctive group for purposes of jury venire. <em>See Hamling v. U.S., </em>418 U.S. 87, 137-38, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2917-18, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); <em>U.S. v. Kuhn, </em>441 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1971). Since the matter on which the expert was to testify was not an issue, the court\u2019s refusal to grant funds does not raise a constitutional claim. <em>See Pedredo v. Wainwright, </em>590 F.2d 1383, 1390-91 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 943, 100 S.Ct. 299, 62 L.Ed.2d 310 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">On voir dire defense counsel asked a venireperson whether the fact that her son-in-law was a security guard would have \u201cany bearing on your decision or cause any bias in this case at all?\u201d She stated \u201chuh-uh.\u201d Defense counsel, taking this response to be a negative, then sought to ask \u201c[w]ould you have any tendency whatsoever to believe the testimony of police officers or security guards over the testimony of any other witnesses?\u201d The trial court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the second question. The conduct of voir dire is within the discretion of the trial judge and is only error if there is an abuse of this discretion. <em>Ristaino </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 594-95, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 1020-21, 47 L.Ed.2d 258 (1976). The first question adequately addressed the potential juror\u2019s possible bias. There was no abuse of discretion in denying Cox\u2019s counsel the right to ask the follow-up question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">The court did not improperly limit defense\u2019s closing argument. The defense had shown slides recreating the scene of the crime for purposes of cross-examination only. They were not introduced into evidence. Before closing argument the trial court specifically instructed the defense not to refer to the slides. Counsel stated that this was acceptable. In his final argument defense counsel stated: \u201cyou saw Mr. Smith cross-examined ... relating to the scene ... and admit under oath . .. that he couldn\u2019t identify a person based on the reconstruction of that scene.\u201d The prosecution objected, and the court sustained the objection on the basis that the statement made reference to slides. This is essentially an evidentiary ruling. Federal habeas courts do not generally sit to correct erroneous evidentiary rulings by state courts unless the error produces fundamental unfairness. <em>DeBenedictis v. Wainwright, </em>674 F.2d 841, 843 (11th Cir.1982). Even if the court\u2019s ruling was erroneous, it did not result in fundamental unfairness, as it was a narrow ruling limited to matters not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
