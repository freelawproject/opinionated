ORTH, Jr., Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AOLI\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">This appeal revolves around the propriety of submitting to the trier of fact in an automobile accident case the allowance of punitive damages against a drinking driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Three cars were involved in the accident. One was driven by Lois Ann Lockett, the second by Charles Carroll Houck, and the third by Edward P. Nast. About 8:30 p.m. on 17 February 1984, Lockett was heading south in the southbound lane of York Road near its intersection with Lambourne Road in Baltimore County, Maryland. Nast was about 10 car lengths behind her. Houck was heading north in the right curb northbound lane of York Road, south of the Lockett car. Lockett tried to make a U-turn from the southbound lane of York Road, across the two northbound lanes, so as to be able to proceed north on York Road. She was unable to complete the turn and came to a stop facing the northbound curb. She began to back up so she could complete the turn. Houck continued north without braking or deviating from his course and collided with the right side of Lockett\u2019s car. Nast testified that when Lockett started to make her U-turn, Houck\u2019s car was about 300 feet away, but another witness, an off duty Baltimore City police officer, who was following Houck, estimated the distance between the Houck and Lockett cars to be 15 or 20 feet when he first observed them before the collision. He said: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201cIt had just started to drizzle,\u201d and suggested that Houck was unable to stop \u201cdue to the wet conditions on the roadway.\u201d Houck did not recall the details of the accident. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">[A]ll of a sudden instantly there was an automobile in front of me. I had no alternative. There was nothing I could do. It happened within a second to two seconds. I couldn\u2019t get out of the way of that car. I couldn\u2019t avoid it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">He did not know where the car he struck came from, in which direction it had been traveling (\u201cthe car was coming towards me,\u201d) or what part of the car he hit. He vaguely recalled hitting a second car. Houck\u2019s car careened off of Lockett\u2019s car into the southbound lane of York Road and struck Nast\u2019s car. Fortunately there were no fatalities, but there were personal injuries and property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Nast\u2019s fiancee, now his wife, was a passenger in his car. They entered suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Lockett and Houck. The trial judge did not permit the matter of punitive damages to go to the jury. The jury awarded compensatory damages to the Nasts against Lockett and Houck. The Nasts appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We certified the case to us on our own motion before decision by that court. The primary question is whether the trial court erred in keeping the matter of punitive damages from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u201cCompensatory damages are such as will compensate the injured party for the injury sustained, and nothing more; such as will simply make good or replace the loss caused by the wrong or injury.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 352 (5th ed. 1979). In other words, they are \u201cdamages awarded to a person as compensation, indemnity, or restitution for harm sustained by him.\u201d <em>Id. See McAlister v. Carl, </em>233 Md. 446, 451-457, 197 A.2d 140 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Punitive or exemplary damages are damages on an increased scale, awarded not as the measure of actual loss suffered but \u201cas punishment for outrageous conduct and to deter future transgressions.\u201d Black at 352.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Fid. &amp; Dep. Co., </em>283 Md. 228, 232, 389 A.2d 359 (1978); <em>General Motors Corp. v. Piskor, </em>281 Md. 627, 638, 381 A.2d 16 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We held in <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Parker, </em>265 Md. 631, 644, 291 A.2d 64 (1972), that there must be at least a showing of compensable injury, that is, an award of compensatory damages, before a recovery of punitive damages is allowed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, to support the allowance of punitive damages, the negligence of the defendant must be established and damages awarded the plaintiff to compensate him for the actual damages incurred by the negligent conduct of the defendant. What we say herein about punitive damages is within that frame of reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We start with the generally accepted rule that \u201cpunitive damages are not recovered as a matter of right, even though the facts of the case may be such as to make their allowance proper, but rather, that their allowance rests in the sound discretion of the [trier of fact, be it court or jury].\u201d Annot., Intoxication of Automobile Driver as Basis for Awarding Punitive Damages, 65 A.L.R.3d 656, 660-661 (1975). Whether the trier of fact is to be permitted to exercise that discretion is a matter of law for the trial court. In other words, the sufficiency of the evidence to submit the question of punitive damages to the trier of fact is a question of law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">If a court\u2019s ruling on any question of law is not right, it is wrong. When a ruling involves the exercise of discretion, the range within which a ruling may be right is equal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the permitted range of discretion. But the law gives no judge or court discretion to make a wrong ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><em>Boyd v. State, </em>22 Md.App. 539, 323 A.2d 684, Powers, J., dissenting at 554, 323 A.2d at 693, <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 738 (1974). So the question before us is whether the trial court here was right or wrong in keeping from the jury the matter of the allowance of punitive damages as to Lockett and as to Houck.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The basic rule for the entitlement of punitive or exemplary damages is that there be actual malice. That is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ari\">there must be an element of fraud, or malice, or evil intent, or oppression entering into and forming part of the wrongful act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\"><em>Philadelphia, W. &amp; B. R.R. Co. v. Hoeflich, </em>62 Md. 300, 307, 50 Amer.Rpt. 223 (1884), quoted in <em>Davis v. Gordon, </em>183 Md. 129, 133, 36 A.2d 699 (1944). The rule held fast in this State until our decision in <em>Smith v. Gray Concrete Pipe Co., </em>267 Md. 149, 297 A.2d 721 (1972). Until that time we had never approved an award of punitive damages in a motor vehicle case. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 297 A.2d 721. In <em>Smith, </em>however, we fashioned a standard for the allowance of punitive damages in such cases. We looked to the crime of manslaughter by automobile. The statute creating the crime, now codified in Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 388, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">Every person causing the death of another as the result of the driving ... of an automobile ... in a grossly negligent manner, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor to be known as \u201cmanslaughter by automobile \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">We observed that our decisions have interpreted this statute \u201cas requiring proof of gross negligence, which has been defined in this context as \u2018a wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u2019 \u201d 267 Md. at 167, 297 A.2d 721. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">We regard a \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for human life\u201d in the operation of a motor vehicle, with the known dangers and risks attendant to such conduct, as the legal equivalent of malice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 168, 297 A.2d 721. We considered it to be \u201ca standard which, although stopping just short of wilful or intentional injury, contemplates conduct which is of an extraordinary or outrageous character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But we found that it was \u201cboth a functional and definitive test which ... enjoys the virtue of having been frequently applied in this State [in automobile manslaughter cases].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">And if, as a test, it has been regarded as adequately stringent to serve as a basis for possible imprisonment, then, surely, there appears to be no valid reason for deeming it too liberal for imposing civil sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\"><em>Id. </em>We held \u201cthat it is the standard by which claims for exemplary damages arising out of motor vehicle operation are to be tested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We iterated the test in <em>H &amp; R Block, Inc. v. Testerman, </em>275 Md. 36, 47, 338 A.2d 48 (1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the test in a civil automobile accident action for the submission of the award of punitive damages to the trier of fact is the same as the test in a criminal prosecution of manslaughter by automobile for the submission of the question of the guilt of the accused to the trier of fact. In each case, as a matter of law, the evidence must be sufficient (in the former by a preponderance thereof, in the latter beyond a reasonable doubt) to establish that the defendant was grossly negligent, that is, that he had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life in the operation of an automobile. The legal threshold that must be crossed before the trier of fact is given discretion to award punitive damages is a stringent one. It deals with the state of mind of the defendant driver. If the driver intended death or injury, there is actual malice, and punitive damages may be awarded. If it cannot be shown that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>driver intended death or injury, but it can be shown that he or she had a reckless lack of concern for whether others might be killed or seriously injured, i.e. had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life, the law considers that to be the equivalent of intending the harm, and punitive damages may be awarded. Only conduct that is of an extraordinary or outrageous character will be sufficient to imply this state of mind, and thus suffice as the legal equivalent of actual malice. Simple negligence will not be sufficient\u2014 even reckless driving may not be enough. It is not reckless driving that allows punitive damages; it is the reckless disregard for human life. Reckless driving may be a strong indicator, but unless it is of an extraordinary or outrageous character, it will ordinarily not be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We did not have occasion in <em>Smith </em>to apply the test we enunciated therein. In that case the question of punitive damages in motor vehicle cases was certified to us by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia pursuant to Maryland\u2019s Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act and did not call for the application of the test to particular facts. Until the case we now decide, we have not had the opportunity to apply it. Now, we must determine whether Lockett and Houck were not merely negligent in the operation of their respective automobiles, as they have been found to be, but also grossly negligent, so as to embrace a wanton or reckless disregard for human life, thereby supplying the legal equivalent of actual malice. j-This determination must be made in the light of evidence adduced at the trial tending to show that Lockett and Houck had consumed alcoholic beverages shortly before their fortuitous meeting on York Road, and evidence regarding their condition as a result of their drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In Maryland it is a misdemeanor for a person to drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">1) intoxicated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">2) under the influence of alcohol;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>3) so far under the influence of any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that he cannot drive a vehicle safely;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">4) under the influence of any controlled dangerous substance, as statutorily defined, if the person is not entitled to use the controlled dangerous substance under the laws of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Maryland Code (1977, 1987 Repl. Yol.) \u00a7 21-902 of the Transportation Article (TR). It is also a misdemeanor known as \u201chomicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated\u201d when a person causes \u201cthe death of another as the result of the person\u2019s negligent driving ... of a motor vehicle while intoxicated____\u201d Md.Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 388A(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The legislature has provided guidance to aid the prosecution of all of these misdemeanors which involve drinking drivers. A chemical test of a driver\u2019s blood or breath may be administered under certain conditions for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of his blood. Maryland Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-302 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ). Except when the death of another person results from a motor vehicle accident, a person may not be compelled to submit to a chemical analysis, and no inference or presumption concerning either guilt or innocence arises because of the refusal to submit. CJ \u00a7 10-309(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to the middle of 1986, the fact of refusal to submit to chemical analysis was not admissible in evidence at the trial of a drinking driver. By Acts 1986, ch. 652, effective 1 July 1986, such evidence was made admissible. CJ \u00a7 10-309(a). \u201cThe evidence of the chemical analysis does not limit the introduction of other evidence bearing upon whether the defendant was intoxicated or whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>defendant was driving while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d CJ \u00a7 10-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In a proceeding in which a person is charged with homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated (Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 388A(b)) or with the misdemeanors created by TE \u00a7 21-902, the amount of alcohol in a person\u2019s breath or blood as shown by chemical analysis is admissible in evidence. Art. 27, \u00a7 388A(a); CJ \u00a7 10-307(a). The legislature has prescribed that the amount of alcohol in a person\u2019s breath or blood has the following effects. If, at the time of testing, there was in the person\u2019s blood by weight of alcohol</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">a) 0.13% or more, it shall be prima facie evidence that the person was intoxicated, subsection (e);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahx\">b) 0.08% or more, it shall be prima facie evidence that the person was driving while under the influence of alcohol, subsection (d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN6\">c) 0.01% or more, it shall be prima facie evidence that the person was driving with alcohol in his blood, subsection (f);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">d) 0.05% or less it shall be presumed that the person was not intoxicated and was not driving while under the influence of alcohol, subsection (b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">e) more than 0.05% but less than 0.08%, this fact may not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not intoxicated or was or was not driving while under the influence of alcohol, but this fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the person, subsection (c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">The declarations as to prima facie evidence and the presumptions set out in CJ \u00a7 10-307(b) through (f) apply only to criminal prosecutions. <em>State v. Loscomb, </em>291 Md. 424, 431, 435 A.2d 764 (1981). The trier of fact in a civil case may not apply the statutory presumptions. <em>Fouche v. Masters, </em>47 Md.App. 11, 21, 420 A.2d 1279 (1980), but may consider expert testimony concerning the effects produced by various levels of alcohol in the blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Thus it is that Maryland recognizes degrees of the effects of the consumption of alcohol by a drinking driver, and ties them to the percentage of volume by weight of alcohol in the blood. The amount of alcohol in the blood of a drinking driver is admissible in a civil action as well as in a criminal cause as evidence of the degree of the impairment of the driver\u2019s normal coordination, faculties, and abilities as a result of the consumption of alcohol. The legislature obviously deems that the impairment increases as the percentage of alcohol in the blood increases. In civil actions, however, unlike in criminal causes, the percentage of alcohol in the blood does not serve as prima facie evidence of the degree of impairment, nor does it give rise in any presumptions with regard to it. In other words, in civil actions the burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff to show by a preponderance of the evidence the degree of the defendant\u2019s impairment. We emphasize that in both civil actions and criminal causes, competent evidence other than the result of chemical analysis of the person\u2019s blood may be adduced to show the person\u2019s degree of impairment. CJ \u00a7 10-308. <em>See Major v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 590, 595, 358 A.2d 609 (1976). We believe that in Maryland the concept of \u201cintoxicated\u201d is the same in the civil and the criminal context and that the concept of \u201cunder the influence of alcohol\u201d is the same in the civil and the criminal context.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Lockett had been drinking at a bar in Towson between approximately 6:45 p.m. and 8:15 p.m. the day of the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>dent. At the hospital to which she was removed after the accident, a specimen of her blood was taken as was normally done in the treatment of persons with certain injuries. The specimen was not obtained pursuant to CJ \u00a7 10-302 with a view toward prosecution for drunken driving. Therefore, although the analysis of her blood was positive for the presence of ethyl alcohol, the toxicology report did not state the amount in terms of percentage by weight but by milligrams per deciliter. There were 96 milligrams per deciliter in Lockett\u2019s blood at the time the specimen was taken and the court found that this was the equivalent of 0.08 percent by weight. The opinion of an expert witness, made with a reasonable degree of scientific probability, in answer to a hypothetical question, was that at the time of the accident the amount of alcohol in Lockett\u2019s blood was \u201capproximately in the range of .11 to .12 percent [by weight].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No evidence was adduced from anyone in contact with Lockett after the accident\u2014police officers, paramedics, doctors, nurses, the Nasts or others who may have observed her\u2014with regard to her appearance, conduct, actions or other indicia of drunkenness.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The evidence as to the alcohol content of Lockett\u2019s blood was legally sufficient to sustain a finding by the jury that she was \u201cunder the influence of alcohol\u201d in the contemplation of the law of Maryland. It was not sufficient for a finding that she was \u201cintoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">At the time of the accident Houck and his brother were also coming from a bar in Towson. Houck denied that he was the driver of the car that struck the Lockett and Nast cars, and it was not until the following day that he admitted that he was in fact the driver. Houck refused to submit to a breathalyzer test and declined to let a blood specimen be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>taken at the hospital as was normally done as an aid in the treatment of his injuries. He denied that he had been drinking before the accident and claimed that he had not had a drink since the previous day. Although there was no chemical analysis of his breath or blood, there was ample credible evidence tending to belie these assertions, and tending to show that he had been consuming alcohol. Testimony by the investigating police officer who saw Houck at the scene and later at the hospital, a paramedic who attempted to treat him at the scene and transported him to the hospital, the medical doctor who treated him at the hospital, and the nurse who cared for him in the emergency room indicated that Houck was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The investigating police officer observed Houck standing beside his car at the scene of the accident. \u201cI noticed a slight sway and stagger ... and speaking with him, I noticed an odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath.\u201d His clothing was \u201cdisarranged.\u201d He was \u201cmush mouthed.\u201d His speech was \u201cslightly slurred.\u201d The officer saw Houck again in the hospital emergency room.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">At that point he was excited. He was fighting with hospital personnel, cocky, excited, combative. His speech was still slurred and mush mouthed. While standing around in the hospital a couple of times, he stood up, he swayed, wobbled, and he needed the support gurney and an odor of alcoholic beverage was noticed on his breath again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">A paramedic testified that he observed Houck in the driver\u2019s seat of the car at the scene of the accident. Another paramedic had placed a cervical collar on Houck. Houck was trying to remove the collar and was \u201cuncooperative.\u201d He appeared to be intoxicated\u2014he smelled of alcohol, had bloodshot eyes, all he could do was moan, \u201che could not converse.\u201d Houck refused to let the paramedics treat him. He repeatedly removed the collar. He was so \u201ccombative\u201d the paramedics could not place him on a \u201clong back board\u201d to support him in order to remove him to the ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The medical doctor who treated Houck at the hospital said that Houck was combative and uncooperative. He refused to have his lacerations sewed or be otherwise treated. The physician was of the opinion from his observations that Houck \u201cwas intoxicated and recovering from being intoxicated,\u201d that is slowly approaching sobriety, inasmuch as he was becoming more, alert and able to communicate more clearly as time went by.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Evidence was adduced by way of a deposition of a registered nurse certified in emergency nursing. She had extensive experience in observing intoxicated persons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She treated Houck at the hospital emergency room the night of the accident. She had noted on the emergency room chart \u201cstrong smell of alcohol, eyes bloodshot, speech slurred.\u201d He was just uncooperative. \u201c[H]e simply refused to let us take care of him.\u201d She observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Very few patients [with a laceration on the head] refuse to have care when they know that you are doing it in their best interest. Very few patients from the scene of an ambulance will refuse to have their head immobilized, very few refuse to have their blood drawn or have xrays____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">He was \u201chostile\u201d and \u201cbelligerent.\u201d His hygiene was not good and he was unkempt. According to the emergency room personnel there was no indication whatsoever that Houck's behavior was caused by trauma\u2014head injury or brain damage. There was no \u201cneurological deficit as in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>brain injury.\u201d In short, it is apparent that the considered opinion of all who had contact with Houck in the course of their duties after the accident was that he had consumed alcohol to the extent that his normal coordination, faculties, and physical and mental abilities were substantially and materially impaired\u2014more than merely reduced or weakened. Those who observed Houck were of the impression that he was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We believe that the extensive evidence as to Houck\u2019s demeanor, comportment, behavior, mien, actions, conduct, and appearance, and the odor of alcohol surrounding him, was legally sufficient to sustain a finding by the jury that he was \u201cintoxicated\u201d in the contemplation of the law of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The trial judge considered the evidence pertaining to the drinking of Lockett and Houck and found that it was sufficient to submit the case to the jury on the question of \u201cproximate cause of this accident among other things,\u201d as to \u201cthe compensatory damage aspects.\u201d But he had \u201ca serious problem sending it on punitive damages.\u201d He decided as a matter of law that the conduct of Lockett and Houck, even considering their drinking, did not amount to such a wanton or reckless disregard for human life as would permit him to submit the matter of punitive damages to the jury. The judge, therefore, granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the counts seeking punitive damages. The judge was right as to Lockett and wrong as to Houck.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">In submitting the case to the jury, the judge instructed it with respect to negligence and proximate cause. To assist the jury in its \u201cdetermination as to whether or not both defendants or either of them were negligent,\u201d the judge informed it that it \u201cmay consider\u201d certain traffic laws. The judge referred to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">1) TR \u00a7 21-301(c)(l)(i) proscribing a vehicle from crossing the centerline of a roadway divided into four or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>marked lanes for vehicular traffic and that provides for two-way movement of traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">2) TR \u00a7 21-604(b) prohibiting a person from turning a vehicle from a direct course or move it right or left on a roadway unless the movement can be made with reasonable safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">3) TR \u00a7 21-402(b) declaring that if the driver of a vehicle intends to turn to go in the opposite direction, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any approaching vehicle that is so near as to be an immediate danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">4) TR \u00a7 21-1102(a) prescribing that the driver of a vehicle may not back it unless the movement can be made safely and without interfering with other traffic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">It is apparent that the traffic laws to which the judge referred applied to Lockett\u2019s operation of her automobile. But the judge cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">Now, you are further instructed in this regard that if you should find that one of these rules of the road has been shown to have been violated that does not establish negligence in and of itself, but it may be considered by you as evidence of negligence along with all of the other evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The judge then turned to the evidence as to drinking by the defendants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">In addition, ladies and gentlemen, evidence of the consumption of alcohol to the extent that the faculties, coordination, and reactions of the persons in question are impaired may likewise be considered by you as evidence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">It is your function to decide from the facts presented to you whether or not either defendant had consumed alcohol prior to the accident and, if so, in what amount and whether or not the person\u2019s driving ability was impaired as a result of that consumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">This instruction related to both Houck and Lockett. The judge further instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Now, when the driver of a motor vehicle is faced with a sudden and real emergency which was not created by his or her own conduct, he must exercise reasonable care for his own safety and for the safety of others. The reasonableness of his actions must be measured by the standards of the acts of other drivers of ordinary skill and judgment faced with the same situation. He is not to be held to the same coolness or accuracy of judgment which is required of a person who has an ample opportunity to fully exercise his judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">This instruction apparently related to Houck. There was no exception to these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">As is obvious from the jury\u2019s verdicts and awards of damages, it found that each of Lockett and Houck were negligent and that the negligence was a proximate cause of the accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">As to Houck, we believe, as we have stated, that the evidence, by a preponderance thereof, was sufficient for the jury, exercising its function of weighing the evidence and determining the credibility of the witnesses, to find as a fact that he was driving while intoxicated. It was also legally sufficient for the jury to find that in the operation of his automobile, he created a sudden and real emergency by his own conduct, or, if not, that, in any event, he did not respond to the emergency he faced with the required care.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">As to Lockett, we believe, as we have stated, that the evidence, by a preponderance thereof, was sufficient for the jury, exercising its function of weighing the evidence and determining the credibility of the witnesses, to find as a fact that she was driving while under the influence of alcohol. It was also legally sufficient for the jury to find that she otherwise violated the law in the operation of her automobile by illegally crossing the centerline of the road, turning to the left, making a U-turn, and backing her automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">We have now arrived at the crux of this appeal. If the jury, considering all the circumstances, reached those factu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>al findings as to Houck and Lockett, would such findings be enough, as a matter of law, for it to conclude that Houck and Lockett, respectively, had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life in the operation of their automobiles? As we have seen, given the negligence of Houck and Lockett and the award of compensatory damages, the conclusion of the jury that they had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life would supply the legal malice necessary to elevate their negligence to gross negligence, and thereby support an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We think that in civil automobile accident cases involving a drinking driver whether the driver had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life, in the operation of an automobile, is to be tested by a sliding scale. As the degree of impairment by the voluntary consumption of alcohol increases, the need for other aggravating circumstances lessens, and vice versa. In other words, a high degree of impairment calls for other aggravating circumstances, if any at all, of a less serious nature. The less the degree of impairment, the more the other conduct of the drinking driver needs to be extraordinary and outrageous. The requisite state of mind may be inferred<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from at least two separate sets of circumstances. First, one may infer the driver\u2019s state of mind from the manner of operation of the motor vehicle. Outrageously dangerous driving permits an inference that the driver does not care whether he kills or severely injures someone else. Second, one may infer a reckless or wanton disregard for human life from the combined acts of voluntarily drinking until intoxicated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>then operating such a potentially dangerous instrumentality as an automobile. We have a caution, however, with our concept that negligent driving short of that which is so outrageously dangerous as to permit the requisite inference may be combined with evidence of drinking that does not amount to intoxication to produce a situation justifying the imposition of punitive damages. The two sets of circumstances are not always considered in a vacuum, wholly distinct one from the other. For example, when considering the conduct of the driver in the operation of a motor vehicle, the jury may find that consideration of the extent to which the driver had been drinking gives additional insight into the driver\u2019s probable state of mind. In that case, it is appropriate to add the fact of drinking to the mix of facts being considered. But we emphasize that what must not be forgotten is that the discretion to award punitive damages becomes available only when the combination of relevant facts demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the driver had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the requisite state of mind may be demonstrated by outrageously dangerous driving or driving after drinking to the point of being intoxicated, this does not mean that adding fifty percent of one to fifty percent of the other will also produce the requisite one hundred percent proof. The jury should be made aware that this would be improper. As we have seen, a driver who is guilty of one or more acts of negligence in the operation of his motor vehicle, but not to the point of outrageous or reckless conduct, and who had been drinking to the point of having his ordinary faculties somewhat impaired, but not to the point of being intoxicated, is not subject to punitive damages when, in fact, the evidence considered as a whole does not permit a rational inference that the driver had a reckless indifference for human life. In many cases, it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>drinking that produces the negligent driving. The cause may not simply be added to the effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In <em>Blackwell v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 547, 369 A.2d 153, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 728 (1977), the Court of Special Appeals reviewed the Maryland cases dealing with manslaughter by automobile. <em>Id. </em>at 560-566, 369 A.2d 153. As it read the opinions, \u201cthe only reason the appellate courts of Maryland have not permitted extreme intoxication to have raised simple negligence to gross negligence by express holding, is that no case has ever been before the Court where the evidence showed a state of inebriation that would sustain a verdict of driving while intoxicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561, 369 A.2d 153. The court believed, however, that the Court of Appeals foresaw, but did not foreclose that possibility, in <em>Thomas v. State, </em>206 Md. 49, 56-58, 109 A.2d 909 (1954). In <em>Blackwell </em>there was legally sufficient evidence for the trier of fact to find that Blackwell was intoxicated. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\"><em>But it was not his condition alone that evidenced his wanton and reckless disregard for his fellow humans. That he coupled such insobriety with driving an automobile on a public highway made his conduct culpable. </em>It is common knowledge that an automobile is a dangerous instrumentality, and we notice that fact judicially. Motor vehicles cause more deaths in time of peace than do any other manmade device. <em>When appellant voluntarily, if not intentionally, drank himself into a state wherein his nervous system was numbed, adversely affecting his reflexes, coordination, discretion and judgment, to drive an automobile thereafter itself constituted a wanton or reckless disregard for human life.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">34 Md.App. at 565, 369 A.2d 153 (emphasis added). The court pointed out that \u201c[t]o drive while simply under the influence [of alcohol]\u201d is a direct violation of the law. <em>Id. </em>And it rationalized that when one is intoxicated\u2014\u201cthe most extreme condition of insobriety recognized by law\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 566, 369 A.2d 153)\u2014one who drives thus incapacitated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>may be inferred to have disregarded human life both wantonly <em>and </em>recklessly. When death ensues, inferentially or directly attributable to a breach of a duty by [the driver], derived from his self-induced condition of intoxication, driving while [intoxicated] may be sufficient to raise the cause of death from simple negligence to gross negligence, as a factual determination to be made by the fact finder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 566, 369 A.2d 153 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In <em>Lloyd v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 167, 399 A.2d 932, <em>cert. denied, </em>285 Md. 732 (1979), a manslaughter by automobile case, the Court of Special Appeals read <em>Blackwell</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvZ\">as holding that \u201cextreme\u201d intoxication by itself may indicate a \u201cwanton or reckless disregard\u201d and therefore justify a finding of gross negligence. Under <em>Blackwell, </em>however, it is clear that such a finding is not automatic simply because there is evidence of intoxication. Rather, the issue must be determined by the fact-finder on a case by case basis. This holding cannot be said, as appellant contends, to equate intoxication with gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A74\">42 Md.App. at 170, 399 A.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In <em>Willis v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 65, 460 A.2d 1043 (1983), the Court of Special Appeals, quoting <em>Blackwell, </em>held in an automobile manslaughter case that Willis' \u201cdegree of sobriety [driving while intoxicated], as found by the jury, was sufficient [for the jury] to elevate simple negligence to gross negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 460 A.2d 1043.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We are not at odds with the opinions of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Blackwell, Lloyd, </em>and <em>Willis. </em>Of course a finding by the jury that Houck did not exercise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>requisite care when confronted with the emergency would not be enough in itself to show that he was grossly negligent. But, in the circumstances here, a finding by the jury that he was driving while intoxicated, would be sufficient for the jury to conclude that he had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life. Since the jury could so conclude, it follows that the circuit court was wrong in striking the counts seeking punitive damages from Houck, thereby keeping that issue from the consideration of the jury as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We have seen that the evidence as to Lockett was legally sufficient to establish that she was driving while under the influence of alcohol, but was not legally sufficient to show that she was intoxicated. The degree of her impairment, not having reached the level of intoxication, would not, without more, be sufficient to elevate her simple negligence to gross negligence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nor would the evidence as to her traffic law violations be legally sufficient in itself to show that she had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life. We have scanned the cases of this Court and of the Court of Special Appeals concerning automobile manslaughter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are satisfied from those cases that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>other conduct on Lockett\u2019s part of a more extraordinary and outrageous nature than the traffic laws which she may be found to have violated would have to be coupled with the fact that she was driving while under the influence of alcohol in order to elevate her negligence to gross negligence. It follows that, as a matter of law, the evidence with respect to Lockett was not sufficient to show that she entertained a wanton or reckless disregard for human life in the operation of her automobile leading to the accidents. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in striking the counts seeking punitive damages from her and in keeping that issue from the consideration of the jury as to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The \u201cVerdict Sheet\u201d returned by the jury read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">1) Do you find in favor of the Plaintiffs Edward Nast and Sandye Nast against the Defendant Lois Ann Lockett?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">2) Do you find in favor of the Plaintiffs Edward Nast and Sandye Nast against the Defendant Charles Carroll Houck?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The answer to both questions was \u201cYes.\u201d The Verdict Sheet continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">3) If your answer to either question number 1 or question number 2 is yes, what amount of damages do you award the Plaintiff Edward Nast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">4) If your answer to either question number 1 or question number 2 is yes, what amount of damages do you award the Plaintiff Sandye Nast?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">The answer to each question was $1,300. Judgments were entered in favor of Edward Nast for $1,300 and in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Sandye Nast for $1,300 and in favor of them for costs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We affirm the judgment against Lockett. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment against Houck. The effect of the court\u2019s error with respect to Houck is that the Nasts are entitled to have the matter of punitive damages as to Houck considered by a trier of facts. Therefore, we vacate the order of the trial court dismissing the counts seeking punitive damages against Houck. We remand the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for further proceedings limited to the issue of the allowance of punitive damages against Houck. We note that Houck does not suggest that the matter of compensatory damages be retried if there is a remand. He speaks in terms of \u201c[i]f this case is remanded for the trial on the issue of punitive damages____\u201d He seems to be content that the award for compensatory damages stand rather than take the chance that on retrial the amount will be increased. He is apparently unwilling to accept the challenge that what he apparently deems to be a bird in hand will be lost in the legal thicket. In any event, the matter of liability and compensatory damages has been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">As we have seen, Houck refused the request of the officer at the scene to take a breathalyzer test. At the hospital, he would not permit a blood specimen to be taken which was a normal hospital intake procedure for trauma patients. An analysis of the blood specimen would include the amount of alcohol in his blood. Before trial, Houck filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence as to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>refusals with respect to the breathalyzer test and the blood specimen. The court granted the motion. Several times during the trial the Nasts proffered evidence of Houck\u2019s refusals and each time the court refused to admit it. The Nasts claim that the refusal to admit the evidence was erroneous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In light of our holding with respect to punitive damages, we agree. A known amount of alcohol in a person\u2019s blood, although not giving rise to prima facie evidence or any presumption in a civil case, has strong probative value as to the degree of impairment of that person. The degree of impairment is relevant and material with respect to primary negligence and to punitive damages. Therefore, the refusal to permit a chemical analysis tends to show a person\u2019s state of mind. It does not give rise to a presumption but it enables a reasonable inference that the person was aware that he was not sober and thought that his coordination, faculties, and mental and physical abilities were impaired to some extent, at least. It tends to show that he was reluctant to have evidence pertaining to the actual extent of his impairment ascertained. In other words, his refusal suggests at least an unwillingness to face an issue of intoxication. <em>See Clay v. State, </em>211 Md. 577, 585, 128 A.2d 634 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">We believe that, in the circumstances here, the evidence that Houck refused to submit to a chemical analysis of the amount of alcohol in his blood was admissible.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Houck presented a motion in limine to exclude his driving record showing prior convictions for driving while intoxicated and while under the influence of alcohol. The court granted the motion. The Nasts claim that the court was wrong. We think that the court was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The Nasts\u2019 position is that the record of convictions was relevant to the jury\u2019s consideration of the punishment element of punitive damages and what amount thereof to impose. They equate it to the punishment stage of a criminal trial in which the sentencing judge may, after a verdict of guilty, consider prior offenses in assessing punishment. We do not find this reasoning to be persuasive. We think that the admission of this evidence could only unduly prejudice the jury in its deliberations even if the evidence was confined to the assessment of punitive damages. We agree with the trial judge that the evidence was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The discretion to award punitive damages is an awesome power to be granted in negligence cases only where egregious or outrageous circumstances require it. In many' automobile accident cases there will be evidence of negligence and evidence of drinking, but the facts will be a country mile away from the outrageous circumstances needed to justify consideration of punitive damages. The bench and bar should understand that the step we take today\u2014recognizing that one who drinks to the point of becoming intoxicated and then undertakes the operation of a motor vehicle may be found to have had a wanton disregard for human life\u2014is not an invitation to claim punitive damages in any case where negligence and drinking can be shown. The pleading requirement set forth in <em>Smith v. Gray Concrete Pipe Co., </em>267 Md. 149, 168, 297 A.2d 721 (1972), is fully applicable, and bald or conclusory allegations of \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for human life,\u201d or language of similar import, will not be sufficient. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Because claims for punitive damages made for purely tactical or settlement advantage will likely cause delays in an already burdened system, create potential problems with respect to representation of defendants, and cause considerable apprehension on the part of those against whom the claim is made, the sanctions contemplated by Maryland Rule 1-341 should be imposed where such claims are made in bad faith or without substantial justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">JUDGMENT AS TO LOIS ANN LOCKETT AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">JUDGMENT AS TO CHARLES CARROLL HOUCK AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART;</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES AS TO CHARLES CARROLL HOUCK PURSUANT TO THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANTS AND ONE-HALF BY APPELLEE CHARLES CARROLL HOUCK.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">. <em>See Shell Oil Co. v.
