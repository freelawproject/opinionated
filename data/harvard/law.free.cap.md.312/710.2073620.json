Clark, a domiciliary of Montgomery County, Maryland, died testate on May 19, 1986. On June 24, 1986, the will of Margaret Clark was admitted to probate and her daughter, Anne H. Strasburg, was appointed personal representative of the estate. On August 27, 1986, W. Edward Clark, the surviving spouse of Margaret Clark, who was not a beneficiary under the terms of the will, renounced the will and elected to take his statutory share under \u00a7 3-203.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the same day, Mr. Clark moved to have his name added to the List of Interested Persons. On September 19, 1986, the Orphans\u2019 Court for Montgomery County (Sanders, J.) ordered that the List of Interested Persons be amended to include Mr. Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">On June 10, 1987, Mr. Clark contested the accuracy of the appraisal and inventory of the estate pursuant to \u00a7 7-204.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>On June 15, 1987, the Orphans\u2019 Court (Miller, J.) denied Mr. Clark\u2019s petition concluding that Mr. Clark was not an interested person under \u00a7 l-101(g) and therefore had no standing to challenge the inventory and appraisal. Mr. Clark appealed the order to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari to that court on our own motion and we now reverse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Under \u00a7 l-101(g), an \u2018interested person\u2019 includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">\u201cAn heir even if the decedent dies testate, except that an heir of a testate decedent ceases to be an \u2018interested person\u2019 when the register has given notice pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2-210 or 5-403(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 l-101(g)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The personal representative insists that Mr. Clark is the heir of a testate decedent and therefore ceases to be an interested person after notice is given pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2-210 or 5-403. Mr. Clark counters that \u201c[t]he legislature could not possibly have meant to create the right to elect a statutory share and then deny the means to protect [that] right.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 12). He argues, among other things, that an electing spouse, as one who takes an intestate share of the estate, should be treated as an heir of an intestate decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">We begin by noting that an heir is defined as \u201ca person entitled to property of an intestate decedent pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3-101 through 3-110,\u201d \u00a7 l-101(f), and that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>surviving spouse is an heir as a person entitled to property of a intestate decedent pursuant to \u00a7 3-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The transfer of property from a decedent\u2019s estate generally takes one of two forms: intestate succession (by operation of law) or testate succession (by will). It is our view that the legislature regards an electing spouse as taking his or her share by intestate succession. The predecessor of \u00a7 3-203, enacted as part of the 1974 recodification of Maryland\u2019s probate law, states in pertinent part and with emphasis added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201cInstead of property left to him by will, the surviving spouse may elect to take the share which he might take <em>in intestacy under \u00a7 3-102.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">While we are aware that the present \u00a7 3-203 (set forth in footnote 2, <em>supra) </em>does not contain the underscored language, some of the companion provisions on spousal election, unchanged from 1974, refer to the elective share as an \u201cintestate share.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-207(a) (\u201cAn election to take an intestate share of an estate shall be in writing ... \u201d); \u00a7 3-208(a) (\u201cUpon the election of the surviving spouse to take his intestate share of the property of the decedent, [the surviving spouse takes no benefits under the will.]; \u00a7 3-208(b) (\u201cIf there is an election to take an intestate share, contribution to the payment of it shall be prorated ...\u201d). <em>Accord Gordon v. James, </em>86 Miss. 719, 742, 39 So. 18, 21 (1905) (When a widow elects a statutory share, \u201cin the eyes of the law, the decedent, so far as her rights are concerned, becomes an intestate.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Mr. Clark, as an electing spouse who takes an intestate share, should be treated as the heir of an intestate dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>dent. Accordingly, he is an interested person withing the meaning of \u00a7 l-101(g)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">ORDER OF THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

On September 15, 1986, the personal representative filed an opposition to Mr. Clark\u2019s spousal election and as grounds for the opposition alleged that Mr. Clark signed a waiver of his right to a spousal election in consideration of a simultaneous waiver by the decedent. A hearing on the opposition is set for June 21, 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b776-9\">. <em>Cf. </em>Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 1-201(20) (1983, 1988 Cum.Supp.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8K\">\" \u2018Interested person\u2019 includes heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries and any others having a property right in or claim against ... the estate of a decedent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aan\"><em>See also Tulsa v.
