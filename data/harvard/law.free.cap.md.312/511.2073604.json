This case presents an issue never before decided by this Court: whether a landowner has a cause of action against an adjoining landowner when trees, vines, roots, and other plants or plant debris from the adjoining landowner\u2019s property encroach upon and cause damage to the landowner\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The relevant facts are as follows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1978, the plaintiff Johnathan Melnick purchased a tract of land situated in the City of Baltimore, known as 900-920 East 25th Street. The Melnick property shares a common boundary with a railroad right-of-way owned by the defendant Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the Melnick property, near the common boundary, stands a large building used as a warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">At the time Melnick purchased this property, the building\u2019s roof was in poor condition, and Melnick subsequently replaced the roof. Since the roof replacement, Melnick has experienced constant clogged drains, standing water, roof deterioration and some water damage to stored merchandise. These problems result from leaves and limbs falling on his property from the Railroad\u2019s trees, and from vines and other plant life encroaching on his property from the Railroad\u2019s right of way. Melnick attempted to remedy this situation by cleaning the gutters on several occasions and cutting back the growth. He complains, however, that these attempts at \u201cself-help\u201d have been unsuccessful since the trees and vines have grown back and require constant maintenance. Melnick informed the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad of the damage to his building caused by the plants on the Railroad property.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Melnick brought this action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, seeking damages for the injury done to his property as a result of the branches and leaves falling from the Railroad\u2019s trees and the encroaching vines, shrubs, and other plant life from the adjacent property. Melnick\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>action was based on theories of trespass, negligence, and nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Following discovery the defendants moved for summary judgment contending that, as a matter of law, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had no duty to prevent harm to another\u2019s property caused by the encroachment of vegetation. Consequently, the defendants argued, Melnick is limited to self-help. Melnick, in opposing the motion, urged the circuit court to adopt a rule imposing upon the Railroad a duty to prevent encroachment of vegetation. The circuit court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, holding that the plaintiff is limited to a self-help remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Melnick appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed. <em>Melnick v. C.S.X. Corp., </em>68 Md.App. 107, 108, 510 A.2d 592, 592 (1986). The Court of Special Appeals held that, under the circumstances, Melnick had no cause of action against the adjoining landowner. The appellate court reasoned that the remedy of \u201cself-help\u201d is generally the most efficient way in which to prevent injury from occurring to property due to encroaching vegetation. 68 Md. App. at 116, 510 A.2d at 597. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, and we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The matter of a landowner\u2019s remedy for conditions on his property due to encroaching vegetation or falling plant debris from adjoining property has been the focus of many cases throughout the country, and various rules have developed to govern the situation. Courts uniformly hold that a landowner has a self-help remedy. Thus, the landowner has a right to cut encroaching branches, vines, and roots back to the property line. <em>See, e.g., Drummond v. Franck, </em>252 Ala. 474, 479, 41 So.2d 268, 273 (1949); <em>Cannon v. Dunn, </em>145 Ariz. 115, 116, 700 P.2d 502, 503 (Ct. of App. 1985); <em>Bonde v.

Bishop, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.2d at 5, 245 P.2d at 621; <em>Sterling v. Weinstein, supra, </em>75 A.2d at 148; <em>Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad Company et al. v.

In <em>Michalson v. Nutting, </em>275 Mass. 232, 175 N.E. 490 (1931), the plaintiffs brought suit seeking injunctive relief as well as damages for the harm caused by the roots of a poplar tree that had clogged plaintiffs\u2019 sewer and damaged the foundation of their house. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts reasoned that limiting the plaintiffs to self-help was the most efficient and most equitable way to resolve the problem. The court stated (275 Mass. at 234, 175 N.E. at 491):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201cHis remedy is in his own hands. The common sense of the common law has recognized that it is wiser to leave the individual to protect himself, if harm results to him from this exercise of another\u2019s right to use his property in a reasonable way, than to subject that other to the annoyance, and the public to the burden, of actions at law, which would be likely to be innumerable and, in many instances, purely vexatious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\"><em>See also, Ponte v. DaSilva, </em>388 Mass. 1008, 446 N.E.2d 77 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Several other courts have limited a landowner to a self-help remedy. In <em>Schwalbach v. Forest Lawn Memorial Park, </em>687 S.W.2d 551, 552 (Ky.App.1985), the court followed the \u201cMassachusetts Rule,\u201d noting that to impose liability \u201cfor damage resulting from the natural dropping of leaves and other ordinary debris would result in innumerable lawsuits and impose liability upon a landowner for the natural processes and cycles of trees.\u201d <em>See Richmond v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>General Engineering Enterprises Co., </em>454 So.2d 16, 17 (Fla.App.1984); <em>Bandy v. Bosie, </em>132 Ill.App.3d 832, 834, 87 Ill.Dec. 714, 716, 477 N.E.2d 840, 842 (1985); <em>Hasapopoulos v. Murphy, supra, </em>689 S.W.2d 118; <em>Cannon v. Neuberger, </em>1 Utah.2d 396, 399, 268 P.2d 425, 427 (1954). <em>See also, Langer v. Goode, </em>21 N.D. 462, 131 N.W. 258 (1911); <em>Gulf, C. &amp; S.F. Ry. Co. v. Oakes, </em>94 Tex. 155, 58 S.W. 999, 1001 (1900).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977) has adopted a rule which limits the landowner to self-help when the encroaching trees, plants, and vines are \u201cnatural.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 840. The Restatement, however, imposes a duty under certain circumstances upon an adjoining landowner to abate the condition when the encroaching vegetation is \u201cartificial,\u201d and subjects the adjoining landowner to liability for failure to abate the \u201cartificial condition.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 839.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Vegetation is deemed \u201cnatural\u201d when it is \u201cnot in any way the result of human activity.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 840, comment a. Illustration 4 under comment a provides an example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">\u201c4. A purchases and takes possession of land on which have been planted a number of eucalyptus trees near the boundary line of B\u2019s land. The roots of the eucalyptus trees grow into B\u2019s land, with the result that walnut trees growing thereon are stunted and otherwise damaged. Although A knows of this, he does not cut down the eucalyptus trees. A is subject to the rule stated in \u00a7 839, since the eucalyptus trees are not a natural condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Although a few states follow the Restatement Rule, most do not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In refusing to follow the Restatement Rule, a few courts have commented that the distinction between \u201cartificial\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d vegetation is unworkable, and should not control the question of a landowner\u2019s duty. For example, in <em>Sterling v. Weinstein, </em>75 A.2d 144 (D.C.1950), the District of Columbia refused to follow the Restatement, stating (75 A.2d at 147):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201c[W]e suspect that ... it would be difficult and perhaps impossible to determine if the trees are of natural growth. And again, we think it would often be difficult to ascertain whether a tree of natural growth might not be in part the result of human activity, such as cultivating, fertilizing, trimming, etc. The distinction between purely natural conditions and conditions which in some degree are the result of man\u2019s activity ... cannot reasonably be made in our jurisdiction which is almost entirely urban.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Similarly, the Pennsylvania court, in <em>Harvey v. Hansen, </em>299 Pa.Super. 474, 480-481, 445 A.2d 1228, 1231 (1982), criticized the. Restatement rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201cThe \u2018natural condition\u2019 standard for imposing or not imposing liability creates the anomalous situation of imposing liability on a landowner who improves and maintains his property while precluding liability of a neighboring landowner who allows the \u2018natural condition\u2019 of his property to run wild. Under this analysis, landowner A may plant hedges or bushes around the perimeter of his property and if they are allowed to become too thick or too tall so as to obstruct a motorist\u2019s vision of an intersection, he will be held liable. Landowner B, on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>hand, may neglect his property, allowing it to be overrun and overgrown with weeds, plants, grasses and other natural foilage, to an equal or greater detriment to passing motorists, but with no liability to himself. The distinction appears to be arbitrary at best.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><em>See also Sprecher v. Adamson Companies, </em>30 Cal.3d 358, 636 P.2d 1121, 178 Cal.Rptr. 783 (1981); <em>Hasapopoulos v. Murphy, supra, </em>689 S.W.2d at 119-120; <em>Barker v. Brown, </em>236 Pa.Super. 75, 340 A.2d 566 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">What has been called the \u201cVirginia Rule\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides that a landowner is limited to a self-help remedy unless the tree or plant is \u201cnoxious.\u201d <em>Smith v. Holt, </em>174 Va. 213, 5 S.E.2d 492 (1939). <em>See also Cannon v. Dunn, </em>145 Ariz. 115, 700 P.2d 502 (Ct. of App. 1985). In <em>Smith, </em>the Virginia Court held that if injury has been \u201cinflicted by the protrusion of roots from a noxious tree or plant onto the land of another, he has, after notice, a right of action at law,\u201d 5 S.E.2d at 495. Few states have followed this rule. Part of the reason may be the difficulty of determining exactly what is a \u201cnoxious\u201d tree or plant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The rule contended for by Melnick is the \u201cHawaiian Rule,\u201d based on the decision of the Hawaiian intermediate appellate court in <em>Whitesell v. Houlton, 2 </em>Hawaii App. 365, 632 P.2d 1077, 1079 (1981). This rule imposes liability upon the adjoining landowner if the trees, plants, roots, or vines cause \u201charm ... in ways other than by casting shade or dropping leaves, flowers, or fruit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Whitesell, supra, 2 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Hawaii App. 365, 632 P.2d 1077. Whether damages will be awarded depends on the extent and cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Among the various rules discussed, and in the absence of relevant statutory provisions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we agree with both courts-below that the Massachusetts Rule is preferable. As previously discussed, the Restatement and the Virginia rules depend upon distinctions which are vague, difficult to apply, and largely arbitrary. To some extent, this is also true of the Hawaiian approach urged by Melnick.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In addition, as pointed out by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Michalson v. Nutting, supra, </em>275 Mass. at 234, 175 N.E. at 491, to grant a landowner a cause of action every time tree branches, leaves, vines, shrubs, etc., encroach upon or fall on his property from his neighbor\u2019s property, might well spawn innumerable and vexatious lawsuits. We have gotten along very well in Maryland, for over 350 years, without authorizing legal actions of this type by neighbor against neighbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Moreover, we believe that it is undesirable to categorize living trees, plants, roots, or vines as a \u201cnuisances\u201d to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>abated. Consequently, we decline to impose liability upon an adjoining landowner for the \u201cnatural processes and cycles\u201d of trees, plants, roots, and vines. As the New York court stated in <em>Turner v. Coppola, supra, </em>102 Misc.2d at 1046, 424 N.Y.S.2d at 867: \u201cIndeed, such natural growth and shedding processes of trees are inherent ..., and to most people constitute a pleasurable reflection of seasonal changes.\u201d <em>See also Sterling v. Weinstein, supra, </em>75 A.2d at 147 (\u201coverhanging branches which merely cast shade or drop leaves on the land are not nuisances\u201d); <em>Hay v. Norwalk Lodge No. 730, B.P.O.E., </em>92 Ohio App. 14, 20, 109 N.E.2d 481, 484 (1951) (\u201cTo grow a tree is a natural act of the soil. It is not itself a dangerous instrumentality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In cases such as these, the landowner must assume responsibility for the care and preservation of his own property. Along with the benefits derived from property ownership come certain obligations. Proper maintenance of one\u2019s own property is one of these obligations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

While the CSX Corporation was also named as a defendant, the parties stipulated in the trial court that CSX does not own the right of way involved in this case, and that the real party in interest at all times pertinent to this litigation is the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">. While this Court has not previously discussed a landowner\u2019s self-help remedy with regard to encroaching vegetation or plant debris from adjoining property, we have implicitly recognized that a self-help remedy exists. In <em>Washington County v. Gaylor, </em>140 Md. 375, 117 A. 864 (1922), this Court held that the County as owner of a road had a duty under certain circumstances to cut a decayed tree limb which was encroaching from a tree on adjoining property and which was overhanging the County\u2019s road. If a landowner has a duty to exercise self-help under some circumstances, the landowner obviously has a self-help remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\">.

While not involved in this case, we note that there may be an exception to the Massachusetts Rule for dangerous dead trees. Several jurisdictions, which generally limit a landowner to a self-help remedy, do not appear to apply this limitation to dead trees. <em>See, e.g., Ponte v. DaSilva, </em>388 Mass. 1008, 1008, 446 N.E.2d 77, 78 (1983); <em>Kurtigian v. Worcester, </em>348 Mass. 284, 203 N.E.2d 692 (1965); <em>Schwalbach v. Forest Lawn Memorial Park, </em>687 S.W.2d 551, 552 (Ky.App.1983). Practical considerations may, under these circumstances, limit the effectiveness of the self-help remedy. Consequently, under certain circumstances, a duty might be imposed upon a landowner on whose property the dead tree stands to take reasonable steps to prevent injury to his neighbors or passersby. As the Kentucky court stated in <em>Schwalbach, supra, </em>687 S.W.2d at 552:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\"Although the landowner may have the right to cut back overhanging branches to the boundary line, in the case of a dead and dangerous tree, it may be more sensible to require the owner of the tree to remove it in its entirety, or be liable for damages. It would be futile to require the neighbor to remove a portion of the tree to the boundary line leaving the hazard of a large portion of the total tree to remain in a threatening position.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">For cases discussing this matter, <em>see Dudley v. Meadowbrook, </em>166 A.2d 743 (D.C.1961), <em>Cornett v. Agee, </em>143 Ga.App. 55, 237 S.E.2d 522 (1977); <em>Lemon v. Edwards, </em>344 S.W.2d 822 (Ky.1961); <em>Taylor v.
