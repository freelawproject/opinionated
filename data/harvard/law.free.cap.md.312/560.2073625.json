The issue is whether a trial judge may, over objection by the accused, consider in written report form the opinions as to the accused\u2019s competency expressed by psychiatrists who examined the accused pursuant to Md.Code (1982, 1987 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-104 of the Health-General Article (H-G). At the pretrial competency hearing in the instant matter the petitioner presented expert testimony that he was not competent to be tried. Under these circumstances the petitioner contends that H-G \u00a7 12-103(a) and constitutional procedural due process each bar trial court consideration of the written reports unless the State also produces the opining physicians in person as witnesses subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In May of 1985 a team of Prince George\u2019s County police officers executed a search warrant for marijuana at an apartment occupied by the petitioner, Sigismund Nathaniel Sangster (Sangster), who barricaded himself in the apartment\u2019s rear bedroom. Through the closed bedroom door Sangster fired shots which wounded two of the officers. The police responded by shooting through the door, thereby wounding Sangster. After approximately five hours Sangster emerged from the bedroom, was disarmed and taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">He was indicted on twenty-one counts, including four counts of assault with intent to murder. Defense counsel moved for a determination of whether Sangster was incompetent to stand trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sangster also, through counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>pleaded that when the alleged crimes were committed he was not criminally responsible by reason of insanity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit court ordered that Sangster be sent to Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center (Perkins) for competency and responsibility determinations. Sangster was admitted to Perkins on January 23, 1986. According to a forensic conference note dictated February 3, 1986, each of four psychiatrists concluded that Sangster was competent and responsible. That forensic conference note, signed by one of the participating staff psychiatrists, was sent under cover of a letter dated February 4, 1986, signed by the Superintendent of Perkins and by that same staff psychiatrist, to the circuit judge who had ordered the examination. The letter and conference note were filed on February 19, 1986, in the court clerk\u2019s file of original papers in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The trial on the merits of this case was set for February 24, 1986. Prior to that morning\u2019s proceedings on the record defense counsel had advised the court that he intended to produce expert testimony as to Sangster\u2019s incompetency. On the morning of trial a competency hearing was held at which a psychiatrist called by Sangster testified that the accused was incompetent. Sangster then took the stand and testified on direct and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>After the defense indicated that it had no further witnesses, the court asked the State if it had any witnesses. Thereupon the following exchange occurred which comprises the ruling under review in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: No, Your Honor, I don\u2019t have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">If you have a copy of the report from Clifton T. Perkins\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">THE COURT: I have it. It says that they are unanimously convinced that he understands the nature and the object of these proceedings, and he\u2019s able to assist in his own defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">MR. SLATKIN: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object to the Court\u2019s notice and reading of their evaluation. All we have is a one or two page conclusionary statement made by the doctors with no basis in facts. I certainly believe that an opportunity to cross-examine their conclusions is more than warranted in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">THE COURT: All right. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">MR. SLATKIN: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019m convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he does understand the nature and the object of these proceedings. And I\u2014and he\u2019s able to assist in his own defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">In a jury trial Sangster was found guilty on a number of the charges against him and was also found to be responsible. The various consecutive sentences imposed on Sangster total 111 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Sangster v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 456, 521 A.2d 811 (1987). On that appeal Sangster contended that the trial court had violated the mandate of H-G \u00a7 12-103(a) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-14\">(a) Hearing.\u2014If, before or during a trial, the defendant in a criminal case appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial, the court shall determine, on evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Sangster\u2019s point was that the report was not \u201cevidence presented on the record.\u201d Sangster further argued that, under <em>Jones v. State, </em>280 Md. 282, 372 A.2d 1064 (1977), the report from Perkins could <em>not </em>be considered by the trial judge in making his determination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Absent that foundation, he contended, the finding of competency was not supported by sufficient evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The Court of Special Appeals viewed Sangster\u2019s argument as claiming a denial of the right of confrontation and held that that right did not attach because a competency hearing \u201cis not a prosecutorial proceeding as contemplated by the State and Federal constitutions.\u201d 70 Md.App. at 469, 521 A.2d at 817. That court further held that, even if the right to confrontation had attached</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6qY\">appellant did not act to preserve those rights. If appellant wanted to cross-examine the physicians concerning the opinions they expressed in the hospital report, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>should have called them as witnesses. Having failed to do so, he waived his right to cross-examine them at the competency hearing. <em>[Id. </em>at 470, 521 A.2d at 817-18.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Sangster petitioned for certiorari which we issued. The petition presents the single question: \u201cDid the trial judge fail to determine competency upon evidence presented on the record?\u201d In his petition, in his brief and at oral argument Sangster eschews relying on a constitutional right of confrontation but he does submit that due process gave him a right to confront and cross-examine the physicians from Perkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In light of the way in which the objection arose at the competency hearing, the issue before us is a narrow one. Sangster objected to consideration of the content of the report from Perkins without an opportunity for the accused to cross-examine the opining experts. Consequently, the issue is whether the State is obliged to have the examining physicians available at a competency hearing in order to satisfy either a statutory or constitutional predicate for the court\u2019s use of the report in evaluating and ruling on competency. We shall consider the nonconstitutional issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Determining the meaning of \u201cevidence presented on the record\u201d in H-G \u00a7 12-103(a) requires consideration, in addition, of H-G \u00a7 12-104 which deals with the examination as to competence. The latter section, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">(a) <em>Examination </em>authorized.\u2014(1) For good cause and after giving the defendant an opportunity to be heard, the court may order the Department [of Health and Mental Hygiene] to examine the defendant to determine whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">(2) The court shall set and may change the conditions under which the examination is to be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>(d) <em>Report on </em>examination.\u2014(1) If a court orders an examination under this section, the Department shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">(i) Examine the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">(ii) Send a complete report of its findings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">1. To the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">2. To the State\u2019s Attorney;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5q\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">3. To the defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">(2) Unless there is a plea that the defendant was not criminally responsible under \u00a7 12-108 of this title, the defendant is entitled to have the report within 7 days after the court orders the examination. However, failure of the Department to send the complete report within that time is not, of itself, grounds for dismissal of the charges. On good cause shown, the court may extend the time for examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">(3) If the Department reports that, in its opinion, the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, the report shall state, in a complete supplementary opinion, whether, because of mental retardation or mental disorder, the defendant would be a danger to self or the person or property of another, if released.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">The General Assembly by statute can modify the common law hearsay rule and permit the introduction at competency proceedings of reports from the Department without requiring a testimonial foundation similar to that required for business records. If the court orders an examination by the Department, the Department sends the report directly to the court which ordered the examination. Thus, authenticity and reliability are as well ensured as in the admissibility of business records. <em>Cf. </em>Md.Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 10-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">The obvious purpose of the statutory scheme is to make available to a requesting court the expertise of the Department. The statute directs that the findings resulting from the application of that expertise are to be embodied in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>report. To achieve the legislative purpose the court must read the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Further, H-G \u00a7 12-104(d) requires that the Department submit the report concerning competency to (1) the court, (2) the State\u2019s Attorney and (3) the defense counsel. That was done in this case. Thus the statute itself ensures that the arbiter and the adversaries are equally informed of the report\u2019s content. In this way the statute makes the report \u201cevidence on the record\u201d for consideration at the competency hearing to the same extent as if the report were formally offered and marked as an exhibit at the hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">That the report, as a report, is \u201cevidence on the record\u201d is supported by decisions of the Court of Special Appeals under predecessor statutes. To demonstrate the pertinency of those decisions requires that we trace the history of the current statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Present H-G \u00a7 12-103 is part of a revision of Title 12 of the Health-General Article resulting from the work of The Governor\u2019s Task Force to Review the Defense of Insanity. That revision was enacted by Ch. 501 of the Acts of 1984. The task force comment to \u00a7 12-103 reflects that it replaces Md.Code (1982), H-G \u00a7 12-102 without substantive change.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Code (1982), H-G \u00a7 12-102(a), which likewise spoke of \u201cevidence presented on the record,\u201d was part of the new Health-General Article enacted by Ch. 21 of the Acts of 1982. The Revisor\u2019s Note to Code (1982), H-G \u00a7 12-102 states that \u201c[t]his section is new language derived without substantive change from the first, eighth, and ninth sentences of former Article 59, \u00a7 23.\u201d That note also advises that \u201c[i]n subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the former references to \u2018testimony\u2019 are deleted as unnecessary in light of the broad references to \u2018evidence\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Former Art. 59, \u00a7 23 in relevant part provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvD\">Whenever prior to or during the trial, any person charged with the commission of any crime shall appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the court, or be alleged to be incompetent to stand trial, by the defendant himself, the court shall determine upon testimony and evidence presented on the record whether such person is [incompetent]____ Whenever any defendant shall be referred to the Department of Mental Hygiene for an examination of his competency to stand trial under this section, he shall be examined and a full and complete report of findings shall be forwarded to the court having jurisdiction over the defendant, to the State\u2019s attorney and to counsel for the defendant within the time specified ... below. If the court after receiving testimony and evidence determines that the defendant is competent ... the trial shall commence as soon as practicable or, if already commenced, shall continue. [Md.Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Art. 59, \u00a7 23.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The above-quoted language was enacted by Ch. 709 of the Acts of 1967 which substantially revised provisions of Art. 59 when it was entitled \u201cLunatics and Insane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\"><em>Colbert v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 632, 308 A.2d 726, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 756 (1973) involved a competency issue which arose under the procedure enacted in 1967. Psychiatrists at Perkins had reported the accused to be competent. Before trial began defense counsel filed two motions, one asking for an \u201cindependent\u201d psychiatric examination and the other asking the court to conduct a hearing to ascertain competency. 18 Md.App. at 636-37, 308 A.2d at 729. These motions were supported by the report of an evaluation of the accused done by two Ph.D. psychologists. The trial court considered the written reports from Perkins and from the defense psychologists and denied both motions. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. In answer to a contention that there had been no \u201chearing\u201d on competency, that court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">The statute requires that the determination be made \u201cupon testimony and evidence presented on the record\u201d, but it does not require that such testimony and evidence be presented in a separate hearing, as appellant contends. We said in <em>Strawderman v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 689, 695, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>244 A.2d 888, 891 (1968), <em>cert. denied, 252 </em>Md. 733 (1969) ], \u201cOf course, in a jury trial, evidence with regard to it should be received out of the presence of the jury\u201d, but we did not say, nor do we now say, that a judge with no jury present is required to use any magic words to designate as a separate hearing the presentation to him of testimony and evidence for his determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial. It is sufficient if the testimony and evidence are on the record. <em>[Id. </em>at 640-41, 308 A.2d at 731.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">In <em>Rozzell v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 167, 174, 245 A.2d 917, 920-21 (1968), <em>cert. denied, 252 </em>Md. 732 (1969), the Court of Special Appeals, after stating that the trial court had followed the statutory procedure, reviewed in detail the procedure utilized in that case. It included consideration of the report, as such, of the chief clinical psychologist at Perkins who had examined the accused. In <em>Rozzell, </em>however, the Perkins psychiatrist who had examined the defendant was produced by the State and testified about competency. 5 Md.App. at 174-75, 295 A.2d at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Inasmuch as the <em>procedure </em>for determining competency has remained essentially unchanged since 1967, the legislative history of the 1967 enactment is also material to interpreting \u201cevidence on the record\u201d in present H-G \u00a7 12-103. Chapter 709 of the Acts of 1967 placed the provisions relevant here in former Art. 59, \u00a7 7. After providing for copies of the report to be forwarded to the court, to the prosecutor and to defense counsel, Ch. 709 in introductory bill form read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">If the court after receiving any other testimony and evidence determines that the defendant is competent to stand trial ... the trial shall commence____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">In the course of passage the words \u201cany other\u201d were stricken. In its introductory form the bill would clearly have been read to mean that the report constituted testimony and evidence and that the court could receive any other testimony and evidence. The striking of \u201cany other\u201d does not alter this meaning. After providing by statute for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>court ordered examination, a full and complete report of that examination and copies of the report to be furnished to the court and the parties, it is redundant to refer back to the report as evidence to be considered at a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The proposed revisions which resulted in Ch. 709 of the Acts of 1967 had been submitted to the Legislative Council by the then Commission on Criminal Law. <em>See </em>Legislative Council of Maryland, <em>Report to the General Assembly of 1967, </em>135-39; State of Maryland Commission on Criminal Law, <em>Report and Part I of Proposed Criminal Code, </em>vi-vii (1972). Files of the reporter to the Criminal Law Commission indicate that the deletion of \u201cany other\u201d was intended to eliminate any implication that the receipt of a report from the Department was a condition precedent or jurisdictional prerequisite for the circuit court to proceed to trial on the merits. That implication was contrary to <em>Hazel v. State, </em>226 Md. 254, 263, 173 A.2d 187, 191 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 1004, 82 S.Ct. 638, 7 L.Ed.2d 542 (1962). Thus today, under H-G \u00a7 12-103(a), if the defendant alleges incompetency, the court \u201cshall\u201d determine the issue, but under H-G \u00a7 12-104 the court \u201cmay\u201d order an examination and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Viewed solely from the textual standpoint, another possible interpretation of the striking of \u201cany other\u201d is that the deletion was intended to prevent considering the report at the hearing, absent compliance with the strict rules of evidence. This position is the precise one advocated by Sangster in the instant matter. The legislative history, however, clearly demonstrates that that position could have been adopted by the General Assembly in 1967, but was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The 1967 revisions to former Art. 59 were intended to eliminate the confusion in earlier statutes which had been revealed in <em>Rowe v. State, </em>234 Md. 295, 199 A.2d 785, <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 924, 85 S.Ct. 281, 13 L.Ed.2d 336 (1964). In a dissent by Judge Henderson, joined by Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e and Judge Hammond, the General Assembly was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>urged to take corrective action. 234 Md. at 322-23, 199 A.2d at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Responding to that request the Commission on Criminal Law and the Legislative Council considered the Model Penal Code, the Official Draft of which had been adopted by the American Law Institute on May 24,1962. The bill proposed by the Legislative Council used the Model Penal Code tests for responsibility and competency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The standard for competency proposed in Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.04 is the standard now found in H-G \u00a7 12-101(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In \u00a7 4.05 the Model Penal Code provides for a psychiatric examination and report to the court and to counsel for the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Section 4.06 of the Model Penal Code deals with the competency hearing. In relevant part it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">(1) When the defendant's fitness to proceed is drawn in question, the issue shall be determined by the Court. If neither the prosecuting attorney nor counsel for the defendant contests the finding of the report filed pursuant to Section 4.05, the Court may make the determination on the basis of such report. If the finding is contested, the Court shall hold a hearing on the issue. <em>If the report is received in evidence upon such hearing, the party who contests the finding thereof shall have the right to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>summon and to cross-examine the psychiarists who joined in the report and to offer evidence upon the issue. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The General Assembly chose not to adopt the procedure so clearly spelled out in the Model Penal Code. The result is that, if the court orders a report, that report, as a report, may be considered at the competency hearing as \u201cevidence on the record\u201d within the meaning of H-G \u00a7 12-103(a) without the person reporting being present.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Sangster also contends that due process guarantees him the right to exclude the Perkins report unless one, or perhaps all four, of that institution\u2019s examining physicians are made available by the State for cross-examination. The aspect of due process invoked here is the right to a fair trial. The failure of a state to observe procedures adequate to protect a defendant\u2019s right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial deprives a defendant of due process. <em>See Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975); <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">That the procedure employed here was adequate to protect Sangster\u2019s right not to be tried while incompetent may be demonstrated by comparison to the procedure employed in federal courts to deal with the competency issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">By the Act of September 7,1949, ch. 535, \u00a7 1, 63 Stat. 686 Congress enacted, <em>inter alia, </em>former Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244. \u201c[T]he bill was proposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States after long study by a conspicuously able committee, followed by consultation with federal district and circuit judges.\u201d <em>Greenwood v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 366, 373, 76 S.Ct. 410, 414, 100 L.Ed. 412, 418 (1956). That section in part provided that, upon a motion by the United States Attorney for a judicial determination of competency to stand trial</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2d\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>or upon a similar motion in behalf of the accused, or upon its own motion, the court shall cause the accused ... to be examined as to his mental condition by at least one qualified psychiatrist, who shall report to the court____ If the report of the psychiatrist indicates a state of present insanity or such mental incompetency in the accused, the court shall hold a hearing, upon due notice, at which evidence as to the mental condition of the accused may be submitted, including that of the reporting psychiatrist, and make a finding with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The statute did not specify the procedure to be followed when the psychiatrist reported to the court that the accused was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Federal courts generally held that no hearing at all was required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 if the accused were reported to be competent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>819 F.2d 605 (5th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 108 S.Ct. 726, 98 L.Ed.2d 675 (1988); <em>United States v.

In the <em>Veatch, Dunn, </em>and <em>Stern </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>there were other psychiatric opinions before the court indicating that the accused was not competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The federal statutes, including former \u00a7 4244, were amended by the Act of October 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2057 <em>et seq. </em>Present Title 18, \u00a7 4241(a) provides that the court shall grant a motion for a hearing to determine competency \u201cif there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be ... incompetent[.]\u201d The court may order a prehearing psychiatric examination. \u00a7 4241(b). The report of the examination is filed with the court and copies are provided to counsel for the person examined and to the attorney for the Government. \u00a7 4247(c). Subsection (d) of \u00a7 4247 addresses the hearing and in part provides that the person whose mental condition is the subject of the hearing \u201cshall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present evidence, to subpoena witnesses on his behalf, and to confront and cross-examine witnesses <em>who appear at the hearing.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The procedure under the 1984 federal statute was involved in <em>United States v. Williams, supra, </em>where the defendant\u2019s pretrial competency proceeding was governed by the old statute but a post-sentencing competency determination was governed by the new statute. At resentencing the defendant asked for a competency hearing but was denied his request. The defendant then submitted records and reports from a federal psychiatric facility to which he had been committed for evaluation to support his request for a competency hearing. The trial court read those records to reflect that the defendant either previously or presently had \u201cmental problems\u201d but concluded that there was no showing of reasonable cause to believe that the defendant did not understand the proceedings or was unable to assist counsel. The Fifth Circuit rejected the prisoner\u2019s post-conviction relief contention that the refusal to hold a hearing had violated procedural due process where the district court\u2019s factual finding based on the reports was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The United States Supreme Court has also recognized, in effect, that an evidentiary hearing is not a <em>per se </em>due process requirement for a finding of competency. In <em>Mag</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>gio v. Fulford, </em>462 U.S. 111, 103 S.Ct. 2261, 76 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983), a Louisiana prisoner contended in a federal habeas corpus proceeding that he had been denied rights recognized in <em>Pate v. Robinson, supra, </em>when the trial court refused to order a state financed competency inquiry despite the opinion of incompetency expressed by a psychiatrist who had interviewed the defendant for one hour on the day before the trial date. The trial court had based its conclusion of competency on its own observations of the accused, on its rejection of the principal factual predicate for the defense psychiatrist\u2019s opinion and on its belief that the request for a competency hearing was a subterfuge to obtain a last-minute postponement. The Supreme Court held, <em>per curiam, </em>that the conclusions of the Louisiana trial judge were fairly supported by the record and reversed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding that it could not \u201cwith the certitude befitting a federal court, affirm that Fulford possessed the mental competency to participate meaningfully in his trial.\u201d <em>Fulford v. Maggio, </em>692 F.2d 354, 361 (5th Cir.1982) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>the trial court heard the testimony of Sangster\u2019s psychiatrist. The court was able to evaluate his opinion not only in the light of Sangster\u2019s testimony and observed conduct, but also in light of the opinions expressed by the examining physicians at Perkins in their report. Sangster\u2019s counsel had been furnished a copy of the report. The defense could have subpoenaed one or more of the reporting physicians and cross-examined them concerning their conclusion that Sangster was competent. As the federal cases make plain, the fact that the trial court considered the opinions of the Perkins staff in report form does not, of itself, render the procedure inadequate to protect Sangster\u2019s fight not to be tried while incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Minimum due process guarantees are \u201clargely a function of the circumstances and the interests at stake.\u201d <em>Ford v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 399, 411, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 2603, 91 L.Ed.2d 335, 347 (1986) (opinion announcing judgment). Sangster\u2019s interest in not standing trial while incompetent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>affects only the timing of Sangster\u2019s trial, not the question of guilt or innocence. Even if a trial judge errs in a pretrial finding of competency, the error is not beyond correction. Under H-G \u00a7 12-103(c) a court may reconsider the issue of incompetency \u201c[a]t any time during the trial and before verdict____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The State is interested, both as a matter of justice and of economy, in not conducting criminal trials of incompetent persons. The State also has an interest in competency determinations not being wasteful to the taxpayers. Under Sangster\u2019s contention consideration by a court of written psychiatric reports requires, as a condition precedent, that the State have the reporting experts personally present in court in all cases in which there is no prior waiver of the claimed due process right. Nothing in the present Maryland statutes prevents one in Sangster\u2019s position from subpoenaing and cross-examining the reporting experts. Constitutional due process does not require more.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-10\">.

The balance of H-G \u00a7 12-103 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">(b) <em>Court action if defendant </em>competent.\u2014If, after receiving evidence, the court finds that the defendant is competent to stand trial, the trial shall begin as soon as practicable or, if already begun, shall continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">(c) <em>Reconsideration of </em>competency.\u2014At any time during the trial and before verdict, the court may reconsider the question of whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">. The problem presented in <em>Jones v. State </em>is not presented here. In <em>Jones </em>the trial court had considered certain psychological evaluations of the accused which were made while the accused was under the jurisdiction of juvenile authorities, some nine months prior to the competency determination. The trial court in <em>Jones </em>considered those reports in camera. They were never introduced into evidence nor were they filed in the court clerk\u2019s file of original papers. The evaluations in <em>Jones </em>were not presented to the court through the procedure specified in H-G Title 12 concerning a referral by the court of an accused for a competency evaluation and report back to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\">. Because we shall hold, <em>infra, </em>that the report was \u201cevidence presented on the record\" we have no occasion to consider the sufficiency of the evidence of competency without the report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\">. The better practice is to mark the report as an exhibit at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">. The explanation by the Legislative Council accompanying the bill in relevant part reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">This bill recommended by the Legislative Council is a result of the joint work of the Crimes Subcommittee of the Council and a Subcommittee of the Governor\u2019s Study Commission on Criminal Laws. The bill defines the tests for the criminal defenses of both insanity at the time of the commission of an offense and insanity at the time of trial. It also specifies certain procedures in connection with the defenses____ The test prepared by the bill is similar to the Model Penal Code Test as prepared by the American Law Institute. <em>[.Report to the General Assembly of 1967, </em>at 135 (italics omitted).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b634-12\">. Section 4.04 of the Model Penal Code reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">No person who as a result of mental disease or defect lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense shall be tried, convicted or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as such incapacity endures.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b639-8\">COLE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4S\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The real issue in this case is whether in a competency hearing a court may base its ultimate ruling on evidence which does not comply with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The majority opinion holds that a cursory, one page \u201cconference note\u201d prepared by a team of doctors from the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center constituted sufficient evidence on the record, in and of itself, to find the defendant competent to stand trial. Because I believe that the Perkins \u201creport\u201d did not meet the minimum evidentiary requirements set by statute, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The inadequacy of this report and its failure to comply with the statute were the basis of Sangster\u2019s objection. At the hearing, his counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object to the Court\u2019s notice and reading of their evaluation. All we have is a one or two page conclusionary [sic] statement made by the doctors with no basis in facts. I certainly believe that an opportunity to cross-examine their conclusions is more than warranted in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The majority is wrong in summarily dismissing the issue of whether Sangster\u2019s competency should have been determined on the basis of this particular report. The Court brushes aside this issue and focuses on whether the defense should have been allowed to cross-examine the Perkins doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">As I see it, the majority misses Sangster\u2019s point that the trial judge failed to determine competency upon \u201cevidence presented on the record,\u201d as required by Md.Code (1982, 1987 Cum.Supp.) Health-General Article \u00a7 12-104.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 23Unfor-tunately, the Court fails to grasp the import of that section, which requires filing of a complete report following the competency examination. This was not done and, consequently, Sangster\u2019s competency determination was not based upon \u201cevidence presented on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The majority relies heavily upon cases applying former Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 to \u201cdemonstrate[ ] by comparison\" that Sangster\u2019s right not to be tried while incompetent was adequately protected. However, unlike Health-General \u00a7 12-104, which calls for the court to be provided a <em>complete </em>competency examination report, \u00a7 4244 included no such specific mandate. The majority fails to discern this crucial distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Apparently desiring to avoid any substantive discussion of whether the statute has been complied with, the majority asserts in footnote three that no issue is presented as to whether the report constituted a \u201ccomplete report\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-104(d). The majority\u2019s rationale suffers from internal inconsistency. On the one hand, it recognizes the importance of compliance with \u00a7 12-104 in determining what qualifies as \u201cevidence presented on the record.\u201d On the other hand, it contends that whether the Perkins report was \u201ccomplete\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-104(d) is a non-issue. I believe that such an issue is presented and that its proper resolution is central to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">After recognizing that compliance with \u00a7 12-104 is a prerequisite to qualifying a proffered exhibit as \u201cevidence presented on the record,\u201d the majority contends that \u00a7 12-104(d) was complied with because the so-called report was forwarded to the trial court, the State\u2019s Attorney, and the defense counsel. The majority disregards \u00a7 12-104(d)\u2019s requirement that the report be \u201ccomplete.\u201d In my view, the Perkins report was far from a \u201ccomplete report\u201d and, consequently, \u00a7 12-104(d) was <em>not </em>complied with. The word \u201ccomplete\u201d is not merely adjectival but is a statutory requirement. In fact, as the legislative history makes clear, the General Assembly\u2019s intent was to require a <em>\u201cfull </em>and complete report.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We discussed the rationale behind such a requirement in <em>Raithel v. State, </em>280 Md. 291, 372 A.2d 1069 (1977). There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>we criticized the practice, in determining a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial, of placing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Ln\">a premium on a conclusory [psychiatric] opinion, which contributes little to the resolution of the difficult task confronting the trial judge. \u2018To the extent that psychiatric testimony is utilized, ... it should be descriptive of the defendant\u2019s condition rather than conclusory.\u2019 (Citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 303, 372 A.2d 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The Perkins synopsis considered by the trial court at Sangster\u2019s competency hearing suffered from the same shortcoming that we disapproved in <em>Raithel. </em>Following a superficial description of the defendant, the report set forth as follows a series of purely conclusory \u201cforensic opinions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzD\">FORENSIC OPINIONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">Dr. O\u2019Brien: Passive-Dependent Personality Disorder. Cannabis Abuse, by history. Competent and responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">Dr. Mokhtari: Passive-Dependent Personality Disorder. Cannabis Abuse, by history. Competent and responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">Dr. Fitzpatrick: Passive-Dependent Personality Disorder. Cannabis Abuse, by history. Competent and responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\">Dr. Rojas: Schizophrenic Disorder, Residual., Passive-Dependent Personality Disorder. Cannabis Abuse, by history. Competent and responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">FINAL OPINIONS: (1) Passive-Dependent Personality Disorder, (unanimous)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">(2) Cannabis Abuse, by history, (unanimous)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-13\">(3) Schizophrenic Disorder, Residual, (minority)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">The report concluded, without elaboration, that Sangster was able to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense. In the absence of any explanation or foundation for the above opinions, such as specific observations made and evaluative methods used, the report\u2019s bare-bones conclusions were of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>dubious value in determining competency. Lacking such information, the report failed in its essential purpose as a fact-finding tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The Perkins report stood in stark contrast to the testimony offered by Sangster\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Richard Epstein. Dr. Epstein testified on direct and cross-examination as to his medical training and experience in the psychiatric field, and provided a detailed factual foundation for his conclusion that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial. On the other hand, the Perkins report offered no such foundation for its bald assertions; moreover, it failed to set forth any particular training or experience which qualified these doctors to render expert opinions. Nevertheless, the majority gives its nod of approval to the trial court\u2019s consideration of the report merely because the judge requested the report\u2019s preparation and because it was filed with the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In summary, the Perkins memorandum did not constitute a \u201ccomplete report\u201d as required by statute. To the contrary, they were statements before the court unsupported by any case history information, psychiatric examination results, or analysis of any kind giving rise to the conclusions offered. Consequently, it did not qualify as \u201cevidence presented on the record\u201d and should not have been regarded by the trial judge as sufficient to support a finding of competence. In addition, given the Court\u2019s view that a competency report may be considered as evidence on the record even though the examining doctors are not made available for cross-examination, strict compliance with the statutory requirement of a full and complete report as an evidentiary prerequisite becomes all the more imperative. I believe the majority makes a grievous error in placing its imprimatur on such a slipshod response to a statutory procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">ADKINS, J., has authorized me to say that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">.
