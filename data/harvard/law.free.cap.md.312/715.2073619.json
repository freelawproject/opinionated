Vol.) \u00a7 4-401(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article should be heard de novo or on the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">Section 4-401(2) vests exclusive original civil jurisdiction in the District Court in \u201c[a]n action of replevin, regardless of the value of the thing in controversy.\u201d Section 12-401(d) provides, in pertinent part, that an appeal from a District Court judgment in a civil case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARz\">\u201cin which the amount in controversy exceeds $1,000 exclusive of interest, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees if attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable by law or contract, and in any case in which the parties so agree, ... shall be heard on the record made in the District Court. In every other case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>... an appeal shall be tried de novo.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In 1986, Eastern Publishing, Inc. (Eastern) instituted a replevin action in the District Court in Baltimore County to recover certain materials in the possession of Jender Printing (Jender). In particular, Eastern alleged that although it had never contracted with Jender, Jender had performed work in connection with the withheld materials and refused to return them until Eastern paid for Jender\u2019s services. Jender filed a counterclaim for $744 in the replevin action, the amount allegedly due for its services to Eastern.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The District Court granted Eastern\u2019s claim for restitution in the replevin action. It also awarded Jender $372 on its counterclaim. Eastern appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County from the judgment entered against it on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The circuit court (Turnbull, J.) affirmed the judgment in favor of Jender without a hearing and upon the record transmitted to it from the District Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Eastern subsequently filed a Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment, alleging that as the amount in controversy was less than $1,000, the appeal should have been heard de novo pursuant to \u00a7 12-401(d). In an order denying the motion, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>\u201cAccording to Section 4-401(2) ..., an action of Replevin, regardless of the value of the thing in controversy, lies with the District Court. Any appeal taken from such an action should necessarily be heard upon the record in the Circuit Court as the amount in controversy is not at issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">We granted certiorari to consider the significant issue involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">It is clear that the circuit court read the language of \u00a7 4-401(2), which vests exclusive original jurisdiction in the District Court in all replevin actions \u201cregardless of the value of the thing in controversy,\u201d to preclude the applicability on appeal of the \u201camount in controversy\u201d provision of \u00a7 12-401(d). In so concluding, we think the circuit court was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The statutory scheme provides that all replevin actions, irrespective of the value of the property in controversy, must originate in the District Court. Appellate review of final judgments of the District Court is explicitly provided for under \u00a7 12-401(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Burch v. State, </em>278 Md. 426, 428, 365 A.2d 577 (1976) (\u00a7 12-401(a) provides for right of appeal without qualification). Section 12-401(d) then sets forth the manner in which the appeal shall be heard, <em>i.e., </em>those civil claims of $1,000 or less are to be tried de novo, while those which exceed $1,000 are on the record. No exceptions or qualifications are made to this clear line of demarcation between de novo and on-the-record civil appeals. By its plain wording, \u00a7 4-401(2) relates only to the initial original jurisdiction of the District Court in replevin actions; it does not implicate the appellate process. This section does not, therefore, prescribe the mode of appeal to be taken in the circuit court, which is covered by an entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>different section, namely, \u00a7 12-401(d). Manifestly, the two sections, covered under different subtitles of the Courts Article, deal with different stages in the litigation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Recently, in <em>Harper v. State, </em>312 Md. 396, 540 A.2d 124 (1988), we discussed the nature of appeals from the District Court to the circuit court. There, the defendant had been denied his request for a trial de novo before a jury on appeal to the circuit court from a direct criminal contempt conviction. In reversing the circuit court, we found that under the plain language of \u00a7 12-401(d), and of \u00a7 12-401(e), which provides a right to a jury trial, the defendant was entitled to a de novo trial before a jury on his appeal. We thus rejected the State\u2019s argument that \u00a7 12-402, specifically providing for a right of appeal in contempt cases, rendered \u00a7 12-401(d) and (e) inapplicable. Assuming arguendo that \u00a7 12-402\u2019s provision for appeals in contempt cases, rather than \u00a7 12-401(a) governs such appeals, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">\u201cSections 12-401(a) and 12-402 deal with the <em>right </em>to appeal from the District Court, and \u00a7\u00a7 12\u2014401(d) and 12-401(e) deal with the <em>nature </em>of appeals from the District Court to the circuit courts____ There are no other statutory provisions setting forth the type of appeals from the District Court to the circuit courts. By their very terms, \u00a7\u00a7 12-401(d) and 12-401(e) govern the nature of all appeals from the District Court to the circuit courts. Section 12-401(d) broadly states that, except for certain civil cases and cases containing an agreement otherwise, \u2018in every other case, including a criminal case\u2019 the appeal from the District Court is to be de novo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">540 A.2d 127 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-8\"><em>See also Barbee v. Barbee, </em>311 Md. 620, 537 A.2d 224 (1988) (appeal from District Court to circuit court arising under the Domestic Violence Act required to be heard de novo when amount in controversy less than $1,000); <em>Purvis v. Forrest Street Apts., </em>286 Md. 398, 408 A.2d 388 (1979) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>(amount in controversy determines nature of appeal from District Court in landlord/tenant action).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We further noted in <em>Harper </em>that to construe \u00a7 12-401(d) and (e) to exclude criminal contempt cases would create an exception not intended by the legislature. The same would be true if we now removed replevin actions from the all-encompassing language of \u00a7 12-401(d). <em>See Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49 (1977) (courts should not construe statutes so as to \u201cinsert exceptions not made by the legislature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">As the nature of appeals from the District Court to the circuit court in replevin actions is governed by \u00a7 12-401(d) and not by \u00a7 4-401(2), and as Eastern has met the requisite jurisdictional amount, Eastern was entitled to a trial de novo on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
