I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The pertinent facts are as follows. Under Maryland\u2019s Road Tax on Motor Carriers Act, Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Yol., 1987 Cum.Supp.), Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 412-429, all motor carriers <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> operating commercial motor vehicles<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Maryland must pay certain taxes and fees to support the State\u2019s highway system. One provision of the Act, \u00a7 423(a), requires that, for fuel tax reporting purposes, motor carriers must register their vehicles on an annual basis with the State Comptroller. For each vehicle thus registered, carriers obtain an \u201cidentification marker,\u201d which must be displayed on the vehicle in accordance with the Comptroller\u2019s regulations. Carriers must purchase a marker for each motor vehicle which they wish to operate in Maryland between January 1 and December 31 of any given year. As a result, the vast majority of markers are purchased in the several months preceding the beginning of the new year; however, carriers might also have to obtain markers during the course of the calendar year if, for example, they purchase new motor vehicles or begin operating in Maryland for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The annual fee for an identification marker is $25.00 per vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This flat fee applies to all vehicles using Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>roads. Thus, \u00a7 423(a) takes no account of the actual mileage that any particular vehicle travels in the State.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The plaintiff American Trucking Associations, Inc. (A.T. A.), is a national organization of motor carriers. Along with two individual trucking companies, A.T.A. was certified by the circuit court as the class representative of \u201call non-Maryland interstate motor carriers\u201d that are subject to the marker tax established by \u00a7 423(a). On behalf of this class, A.T.A. maintains that, as applied to such carriers, \u00a7 423(a) violates the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The original defendants in this case are the state officials who are charged with the duty of collecting and administering the marker tax. In addition, because of their interest in receiving a percentage of the fees generated by \u00a7 423(a), 17 counties and Baltimore City have intervened as parties defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In 1984, in an action substantially identical to the instant case, this Court rejected A.T.A.\u2019s argument that \u00a7 423(a) unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce. <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. Goldstein, </em>301 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>372, 483 A.2d 47 (1984) <em>(Goldstein I). </em>In reaching that decision, we reasoned that \u00a7 423(a) applies equally to all carriers, regardless of whether their vehicles are registered in Maryland or elsewhere and regardless of whether they are engaged in interstate or intrastate commerce, <em>Goldstein I, supra, </em>301 Md. at 386, 483 A.2d at 54. Moreover, we remarked <em>(ibid.)'. </em>\u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 423(a) is not to protect local carriers against foreign competition; the purpose is to spread evenly among all commercial users the tax burden of supporting Maryland\u2019s highway system.\u201d A.T.A. had argued that \u00a7 423(a)\u2019s \u201cpractical effect\u201d is to discriminate against interstate carriers, who might tend to travel fewer miles in Maryland and thus pay a higher per-mile price for an identification marker than would intrastate carriers. In declining to accept this argument, we relied on a line of Supreme Court cases holding that flat taxes similar to \u00a7 423(a) do not violate the Commerce Clause. <em>See Capitol Greyhound Lines v. Brice, </em>339 U.S. 542, 70 S.Ct. 806, 94 L.Ed. 1053 (1950); <em>Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Board of Railroad Comm\u2019rs, </em>332 U.S. 495, 68 S.Ct. 167, 92 L.Ed. 99 (1947); <em>Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>295 U.S. 285, 55 S.Ct. 709, 79 L.Ed. 1439 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">On June 23, 1987, however, the Supreme Court overruled the above-cited flat tax cases and held that a Pennsylvania marker tax, which was somewhat similar to \u00a7 423(a), unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce. <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. Scheiner, </em>483 U.S.-, 107 S.Ct. 2829, 97 L.Ed.2d 226 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Scheiner </em>decision, A.T.A. filed this action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on July 1, 1987. A.T.A. sought a declaration that \u00a7 423(a) is unconstitutional, an injunction against future exaction of the marker fee, and refunds for identification markers purchased both before and after the date of <em>Scheiner. </em>A.T.A. has since relinquished any claim for fees paid before the date of <em>Scheiner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The defendants conceded that \u00a7 423(a) is unconstitutional. Nonetheless, they pointed out to the circuit court that, in reliance on <em>Goldstein I, </em>the State had calculated its budget for fiscal year 1988 with the expectation of receiving $12,-000,000 in marker fees. Consequently, they argued that, in order to avoid imposing substantial hardships on the State and its political subdivisions, the circuit court should not enjoin enforcement of \u00a7 423(a) until the beginning of fiscal year 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">On October 22, 1987, the court declared \u00a7 423(a) unconstitutional. In addition, however, the court accepted the defendants\u2019 claims of detrimental reliance on prior law. Consequently, the court permitted the defendants to continue collecting the marker tax through June 30, 1988, which was the last day of the fiscal year 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">As a result of the circuit court\u2019s decision, the defendants have been able to impose the $25.00 flat fee for all markers that were purchased for calendar year 1987, even if the tax was not paid until after <em>Scheiner, </em>and for the vast majority of identification markers that were purchased for calendar year 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">A.T.A. appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and, before further proceedings in that court, both parties petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. Because of the important issue presented, we granted the parties\u2019 petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">As previously indicated, the defendants do not dispute that, in light of <em>Scheiner, </em>\u00a7 423(a) unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce. This Court, however, would not hold a statute unconstitutional simply on the basis of a litigant\u2019s concession. Nevertheless, under the <em>Scheiner </em>majority\u2019s analysis of flat-rate highway taxes, it would seem clear that \u00a7 423(a) is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause. Although paying the marker tax affords both interstate and intrastate carriers the same privilege of operating to an unlimited extent on Maryland\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>highways, the <em>Scheiner </em>Court viewed this privilege as \u201cseveral times more valuable to\u201d intrastate carriers than to interstate carriers. 107 S.Ct. at 2847. Moreover, the Supreme Court made it clear that the $25 \u201cunapportioned\u201d marker fee is invalid <em>{ibid.), </em>and the Court overruled <em>(id. </em>at 2845-2847) the flat tax cases upon which <em>Goldstein I </em>had relied. <em>See also Scheiner, supra, </em>107 S.Ct. at 2841 n. 17.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, as recognized by the defendant state officials, <em>Scheiner </em>had the effect of invalidating \u00a7 423(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">As previously pointed out, A.T.A. has abandoned any refund claim for marker fees paid before the date of the <em>Scheiner </em>decision. Furthermore, the defendants agree that, if the circuit court erred in refusing to grant an immediate injunction against enforcement of \u00a7 423(a), the plaintiffs are entitled to refunds for all marker fees collected after the date of the <em>Scheiner </em>decision. Consequently, this case turns on the question of whether the circuit court acted correctly in delaying the effective date of its decision that \u00a7 423(a) was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In support of the circuit court\u2019s action, the defendants assert that A.T.A. seeks retroactive application of <em>Scheiner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>and that the circuit court correctly applied the applicable legal standards in concluding that <em>Scheiner </em>should receive only prospective effect. In our opinion, however, the defendants\u2019 argument evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the principles governing the prospective or retrospective effect of judicial decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In the overwhelming majority of cases, a judicial decision sets forth and applies the rule of law that existed both before and after the date of the decision. In this usual situation, \u201cwhere a decision has applied settled precedent to new and different factual situations, the decision always applies retroactively.\u201d <em>Potts v. State, </em>300 Md. 567, 577, 479 A.2d 1335 (1984). Thus, in the ordinary case, no issue of a \u201cprospective only\u201d application arises. <em>See, e.g., Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., </em>392 U.S. 481, 496, 88 S.Ct. 2224, 2233, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231 (1968); <em>Houghton v. County Com\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>307 Md. 216, 220-221, 513 A.2d 291 (1986), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">When, however, a court overrules a prior interpretation of a constitutional or statutory provision, and renders a new interpretation of the provision, the question arises as to whether the new ruling is to operate retroactively or prospectively only. Generally, in determining whether a new interpretation of a federal constitutional provision is to operate retrospectively, a court must assess the various factors set forth in <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), and its progeny. <em>See </em>the discussions in <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>275 Md. 689, 698-716 (majority opinion), 732-741 (dissenting opinion), 344 A.2d 80 (1975). <em>See also </em>L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 3-3, at 30-31 &amp; n. 26 (2d ed. 1988). We have essentially followed the teaching of <em>Linkletter v. Walker, supra, </em>in deciding whether a new interpretation of a Maryland constitutional provision, statute, or rule, should receive retrospective effect. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 336-338, 403 A.2d 356, 370-371 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Of course, when, under <em>Linkletter v. Walker, supra, Wiggins v. State, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Hicks, supra, </em>a new interpretation of a constitutional or legislative provision is to be given only prospective effect, a question arises as to what is meant by \u201cprospective.\u201d Generally, in these cases, a \u201cprospective application\u201d of a new interpretation of a constitutional provision, statute, or rule, has included the case before us and all other pending cases where the relevant question has been preserved for appellate review. <em>See, e.g., McClain v. State, </em>288 Md. 456, 470, 419 A.2d 369, 375 (1980). <em>See also Potts v. State, supra, </em>300 Md. at 576-583, 479 A.2d at 1340-1343; <em>State v. Hicks, supra, </em>285 Md. at 338, 403 A.2d at 371.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">But, regardless of what is meant by \u201cprospective\u201d and \u201cretroactive\u201d in the context of applying a judicial decision to events occurring before the decision, it is clear that, when a decision governs only operative events occurring after the date of the decision, the decision is being applied prospectively only.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">For purposes of a decision invalidating a tax statute, the operative event is not the formulation of a plan to spend future tax dollars; rather it is the actual imposition of tax liability. <em>See, e.g., Southern Pacific Co. v. Cochise County, </em>92 Ariz. 395, 406-407, 377 P.2d 770, 778-779 (1963); <em>Deltona Corporation v. Bailey, </em>336 So.2d 1163, 1165-1167 (Fla.1976); <em>Perkins v. County of Albemarle, </em>214 Va. 416, 200 S.E.2d 566 (1973); <em>National Can Corp. v. Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>Revenue, </em>109 Wash.2d 878, 749 P.2d 1286, 1287 (1988); <em>Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Rose, </em>350 S.E.2d 531, 536-537 (W.Va. 1986), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>481 U.S.--, 107 S.Ct. 1949, 95 L.Ed.2d 522 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Therefore, in determining whether A.T.A. in fact seeks retrospective application of <em>Scheiner, </em>it is irrelevant that state officials prepared the fiscal 1988 budget with the expectation that the State would receive future revenues under \u00a7 423(a). Instead, the relevant factor is that the tax liability imposed on the plaintiffs generally did not arise until approximately January 1, 1988, more than six months after the <em>Scheiner </em>decision. Consequently, in requesting an injunction against such future enforcement of the marker fee statute, the plaintiffs clearly did not seek retrospective relief in any recognized sense of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Nonetheless, the defendants rely on <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>411 U.S. 192, 93 S.Ct. 1463, 36 L.Ed.2d 151 (1973) <em>(Lemon II). </em>In that case, the Supreme Court decided not to apply retrospectively a prior decision in which it had invalidated a state statute authorizing reimbursements to private sectarian schools which provided secular educational services. <em>See Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971) <em>(Lemon I). </em>As a result of <em>Lemon II, </em>the state could reimburse the schools for secular services rendered before the date of the decision in <em>Lemon I, </em>even if the reimbursements were not actually made until after the date of that decision. Invoking <em>Lemon II, </em>the defendants in the case at bar argue (brief p. 30 n. 28):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6O\">\u201cJust as the schools in <em>Lemon I </em>performed services, with the expectation of payment, ... the State and its political subdivisions planned their budgets and programs, with the expectation that revenues would be received from Article 81, \u00a7 423(a), prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scheiner. </em>As the district court in <em>Lemon II </em>ordered that the schools receive their compensation for those services rendered before the Supreme Court struck down the statute in <em>Lemon I, </em>the circuit court below similarly ordered that the State be permitted to collect the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>revenues previously anticipated before <em>Scheiner </em>was decided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The defendants\u2019 emphasis on \u201cexpected\u201d or \u201canticipated\u201d payments is misplaced. In <em>Lemon II, </em>the expected payments were for obligations arising before <em>Lemon I, </em>based on services performed before <em>Lemon I. </em>In the instant case, however, the obligation to pay arose after the <em>Scheiner </em>decision. Mere \u201cexpectations\u201d alone cannot be the decisive factor as to whether a judicial decision operates retrospectively. Otherwise, a state could continue to collect a tax for years after it had been declared unconstitutional if the state had previously planned on receiving revenues from that tax over the course of several subsequent years.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Lemon II </em>simply chose not to apply its prior decision to destroy obligations\u2014the schools\u2019 claims for reimbursement\u2014that had accrued before the date of that decision. By contrast, a bar to the enforcement of \u00a7 423(a) after the date of <em>Scheiner </em>obviously does not threaten to destroy any tax obligations that accrued before the date of <em>Scheiner. </em>To reiterate, the obligation in this case did not occur until after the date of <em>Scheiner. </em>Consequently, <em>Lemon II </em>provides no support for the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>position.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, the defendants\u2019 reliance on that case would have been justified only if the Supreme Court had permitted the state to continue to reimburse private, sectarian schools for services provided <em>after </em>the date of <em>Lemon I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Similarly, the defendants\u2019 reliance upon <em>Ashland Oil Co. v. Rose, supra, </em>350 S.E.2d 531, is misplaced. While the West Virginia court in that case did order the payment of taxes after the United States Supreme Court had declared the relevant statute to be unconstitutional, the taxes at issue had been assessed before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Thus, as in <em>Lemon II, </em>the <em>Ashland Oil </em>court simply ruled that the statute\u2019s invalidity should not relate back to destroy obligations that arose before the Supreme Court had acted. As we have pointed out, however, A.T.A. does not now seek to avoid any obligation that predates <em>Schemer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Having failed to show that A.T.A. seeks retrospective relief, the defendants also argue that a number of courts have delayed the effective date of a decision when administrative difficulties or fiscal hardship would follow from giving the ruling immediate prospective effect. <em>See, e.g., Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 88, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 2880, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982); <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 143, 96 S.Ct. 612, 693, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976); <em>Brown v. Board of Educ., </em>349 U.S. 294, 300-301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955) <em>(Brown II). See also Salorio v. Glaser, </em>93 N.J. 447, 467-468, 461 A.2d 1100, 1111, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 993, 104 S.Ct. 486, 78 L.Ed.2d 682 (1983); <em>Hellerstein v. Assessor of Town of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Islip, </em>37 N.Y.2d 1, 14, 332 N.E.2d 279, 287, 371 N.Y.S.2d 388, 399 (1975), <em>modified, </em>39 N.Y.2d 920, 352 N.E.2d 593, 386 N.Y.S.2d 406 (1976); <em>Soo Line R. Co. v. State, </em>286 N.W.2d 459, 468 (N.D.1979); <em>Bond v. Burrows, </em>103 Wash. 2d 153, 164, 690 P.2d 1168, 1174 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In our view, however, such relief should be available only in the most extraordinary cases. This is evident from the fact that, in over 200 years that this Court has exercised jurisdiction under Maryland\u2019s Constitutions, we have never postponed, in the manner requested by the defendants, the prospective effect of a decision invalidating a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s cases also illustrate that, except in exceedingly rare and unusual circumstances, a court should not grant the relief sought by the defendants in the instant case. For example, in <em>Brown II, supra, </em>the Court devised the remedy to implement its landmark decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Educ., </em>347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), which held that racial segregation in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court recognized in <em>Brown II </em>that, as a practical matter, the states could not immediately accomplish the enormously complex task of desegregating their public educational systems. Consequently, the Court ordered that the process of desegregation should proceed \u201cwith all deliberate speed,\u201d 349 U.S. at 301, 75 S.Ct. at 757. As Justice Roger J. Traynor observed (Traynor, <em>Quo Vadis, Prospective Overruling: A Question of Judicial Responsibility, </em>28 Hast.L.J. 533, 545 (1977)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">\u201cThe extraordinary technique of the <em>Brown </em>decision, allowing an unspecified time for adjustment, was the only possible way of ensuring orderly transition from an old social order to a new. Millions of people were involved in the transition, and they could hardly be maneuvered at a moment\u2019s notice like small platoons of plaintiffs or defendants. There would be adjustments to make for those who had clamored for change as well as for those who had resisted it. Each group needed time to expand its familiar province and to learn to live in a wider world. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The judicial decision signaling the change was no simple decision weighing one individual\u2019s benefits or hardships against another\u2019s.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Decisions from state courts also show that a court should deny immediate implementation of a court decision only in the most unusual cases. For example, in <em>Hellerstein v. Assessor of Town of Islip, supra, 37 </em>N.Y.2d 1, 332 N.E.2d 279, 371 N.Y.S.2d 388, the Court of Appeals of New York held that, under New York law, all real property in that state had to be assessed at full value. Throughout the state, however, the widespread practice had been to make assessments at only a fraction of full value. Thus, the practical effect of the court\u2019s decision was to require the reassessment of virtually all real property in the state of New York. As a result, the court initially delayed the effective date of its decision for over 18 months, 37 N.Y.2d at 14, 332 N.E.2d at 287, 371 N.Y.S.2d at 399, and later granted an additional extension, <em>Hellerstein v. Assessor of Town of Islip, </em>39 N.Y.2d 920, 352 N.E.2d 593, 386 N.Y.S.2d 406 (1976). <em>See also Soo Line R. Co. v. State, supra, </em>286 N.W.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">No problems of implementation, comparable to those involved in <em>Brown II </em>or <em>Hellerstein, </em>exist in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The defendants chiefly rely on <em>Salorio v. Glaser, supra, </em>93 N.J. at 462, 461 A.2d at 1108, which held that a commuter tax on out-of-state residents (the ETT) violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. Although it issued its opinion on June 8, 1983, the court permitted the state to continue collecting the ETT until December 31, 1983. In reaching this decision, the court stated (93 N.J. at 467, 461 A.2d at 1111):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">\u201cWe are persuaded to fix a prospective date because of our concern for the fiscal and administrative problems that would be engendered if the State were compelled to surrender ETT receipts before the end of the fiscal year. The State should be afforded a reasonable period of time to devise alternative revenue raising methods, abandon or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>postpone transportation projects or consider some other suitable solutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We need not consider whether we would agree with the <em>Salorio </em>decision on similar facts. While in some rare and exceptional circumstances, like those in <em>Brown II </em>and <em>Hellerstein, </em>it may be appropriate to deny a litigant immediate prospective relief, the instant case is not a situation in which the circuit court should have done so. When measured against the consequences of the present case, it is apparent that a far greater amount of fiscal and administrative hardship has resulted from several of the prior decisions in which this Court invalidated revenue measures. Yet in none of those cases did this Court contemplate that its ruling should not take effect immediately. <em>See, e.g., Panitz v. Comptroller, </em>247 Md. 501, 232 A.2d 891 (1967); <em>McKeldin v. Steedman, </em>203 Md. 89, 98 A.2d 561 (1953). <em>See also Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Tax. Comm., </em>214 Md. 550, 136 A.2d 567 (1957).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">For example, <em>Panitz v. Comptroller, supra, </em>concerned a purported supplementary appropriations bill which adopted a graduated income tax and authorized the expenditure of some $98,000,000 of the revenues thereby raised. This Court held that the bill violated the Budget Amendment of the Maryland Constitution, Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(8), because it was not \u201c \u2018limited to some single work, object or purpose therein stated,\u2019 \u201d 247 Md. at 509, 232 A.2d at 895. The Court did not postpone the effective date of its decision, although, in evident recognition of the hardship that the decision would cause, the Court held that a special session of the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Assembly could appropriate the revenues. 247 Md. at 508, 232 A.2d at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In the present case, if the circuit court had immediately enjoined the enforcement of \u00a7 423(a), the defendants claim that the State would have lost at most $12,000,000.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the impact of this case is far smaller than that of <em>Panitz. </em>Moreover, if the impact of <em>Scheiner </em>were as great as the impact of <em>Panitz, </em>the remedy of a special legislative session would have been available.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Thus, in light of the foregoing, we hold that the circuit court erred in refusing to enter an immediate injunction against further enforcement of \u00a7 423(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

For a complete account of \u00a7 423(a)\u2019s history and underlying purposes, <em>see American Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. Goldstein, </em>301 Md. 372, 376-378, 483 A.2d 47, 49-50 (1984) <em>(Goldstein I).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-11\">. Fees collected under \u00a7 423(a) constitute \"highway user revenues\u201d within the meaning of Code (1977, 1987 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 8-403 of the Transportation Article. Under this section, the State must distribute 30% of such revenues to Baltimore City, the counties, and municipalities within the counties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\"><em>. </em>This case differs from <em>Scheiner </em>in one significant respect. Unlike \u00a7 423(a), the Pennsylvania marker tax literally applied only to vehicles registered in other states. Therefore, the economic burden of the Pennsylvania tax fell on non-residents. Consequently, the <em>Scheiner </em>Court concluded that the Pennsylvania tax discriminated against non-residents engaged in interstate commerce. <em>See </em>107 S.Ct. at 2839-2841.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">As noted above, however, \u00a7 423(a) applies to all vehicles, regardless of whether they are registered in Maryland or elsewhere. Thus, Maryland\u2019s marker tax does not seem to discriminate in favor of local carriers engaged in interstate commerce and against foreign carriers engaged in interstate commerce. Instead, because the tax is not apportioned according to the number of miles that any particular vehicle travels in the State, it may arguably benefit intrastate carriers at the expense of all interstate carriers. Because \u00a7 423(a) does not single out foreign carriers for disparate treatment, such \u201cdiscrimination\u201d exists against interstate carriers who have registered their vehicles in Maryland as well as interstate carriers registered elsewhere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">. To be distinguished from the cases involving a new interpretation of a constitutional provision, statute, or rule, are those in which this Court, in the exercise of its authority under Article 5 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, issues a ruling that changes the common law of Maryland. Ordinarily, except as to the parties before the court, such decisions are fully prospective. <em>See, e.g., Kelley v. R.G. Industries, Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 162, 497 A.2d 1143, 1162 (1985); <em>Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 275, 462 A.2d 506, 522 (1983); <em>Williams v.

It is true that, in denying refunds for taxes previously paid under an invalid statute, some courts have reasoned that the authorities were entitled to rely on prior law when they collected the tax and expended the revenues collected thereunder. <em>See, e.g., Gulesian </em>v. <em>Dade County School Board, </em>281 So.2d 325, 326 (Fla.1973); <em>Pellnat v.

These decisions, however, are entirely inapposite in this case because A.T.A. seeks only an injunction against future enforcement of \u00a7 423(a) and has abandoned any refund claim for taxes paid before the date of <em>Scheiner.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"><em>. </em>In fact, the very language of <em>Lemon II </em>refutes the defendants\u2019 argument. Writing for a plurality of the Court, Chief Justice Burger stated (411 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. at 1469, 36 L.Ed.2d 151): \u201c[T]he problem of the instant case is essentially one ... arising from enforcement of a state statute during the period before it had been declared unconstitutional.\u201d As pointed out above, however, planning to impose a tax is not the same as \u201cenforcing\u201d the tax obligation itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\">. In fact, for over a century, this Court has repeatedly recognized that, in the case of an illegal tax, the proper remedy, and indeed the only remedy if the General Assembly has not enacted a remedial statute, is for the taxpayer to obtain an injunction against collection of the tax. <em>See Wash. Sub. San. Comm\u2019n v. Mitchell &amp; Best, </em>303 Md. 544, 576-577, 495 A.2d 30, 46-47 (1985), and cases cited therein. Consequently, when a taxpayer seeks such an injunction, it would ordinarily seem most inappropriate for a court to delay the effective date of its ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\">. Although the amount of lost revenues is undisputed, the defendants\u2019 claims of resulting hardship appear overstated. Taxes collected under \u00a7 423(a) are statutorily dedicated to the Maryland Transportation Trust Fund, the assets of which are used to finance highway construction and maintenance projects, as well as other transportation projects. <em>Goldstein I, supra, </em>301 Md. at 376, 483 A.2d at 49-50. <em>See </em>Code (1977, 1987 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 3-216 of the Transportation Article; Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol., 1987 Cum.Supp.), Art. 81, \u00a7 412A. In the trial court, a state official conceded that the State expected the Transportation Trust Fund to receive $10,000,000 to $12,000,000 in unforeseen revenues from titling taxes. Obviously, this sum would offset most if not all of the losses attributable to the invalidation of \u00a7 423(a). Moreover, since the date of the circuit court\u2019s decision, it has become a matter of common knowledge that increased fuel tax revenues are likely to produce a surplus of over $100,000,000 in the Transportation Trust Fund. <em>See The Sun, </em>Baltimore, Dec. 19, 1987, at 12A. The defendants do not contest the accuracy of this figure. In view of this large surplus, however, it is difficult to conceive how the loss of marker taxes will threaten a single highway project that the State, before <em>Scheiner, </em>had planned to undertake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">. As mentioned earlier in this opinion, the plaintiffs also sought in the circuit court a refund of the marker fees paid after the date of the <em>Scheiner </em>decision. Furthermore, as earlier noted, the defendants have agreed that, if the circuit court erred in refusing to grant an immediate injunction against enforcement of \u00a7 423(a), the plaintiffs are entitled to refunds of all marker fees paid after <em>Scheiner. </em>In addition, we note that the period of limitations for administrative refunds of special taxes invalidly paid has not run. <em>See </em>Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 215. Finally, at the oral argument before us, counsel for the defendants expressly stated that, if the circuit court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>refusing an immediate injunction against enforcement of \u00a7 423(a), then \"refunds will be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Under these circumstances, we need not consider any of the possible legal issues concerning a claim for court-ordered refund of taxes paid under an unconstitutional statute. <em>See, </em>in this connection, <em>e.g., Nordheimer v. Montgomery County, </em>307 Md. 85, 97, 512 A.2d 379, 385 (1986); <em>Wash. Sub. San. Comm'n v. Mitchell &amp; Best, </em>303 Md. 544, 572, 495 A.2d 30, 44 (1985); <em>Vytar Associates v.
