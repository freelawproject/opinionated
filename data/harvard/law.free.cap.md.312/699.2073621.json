Although we cannot determine with precision whether the convictions of child abuse were sustained by the sexual offense convictions, that might have been the case. Faced with this sort of ambiguity, we shall reverse the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">We have two petitioners before us. One, Carol Nightingale (Nightingale), was tried in the Circuit Court for Carroll County on a six-count criminal information that charged him with second degree rape (Art. 27, \u00a7 463(a)(3)), incest (Art. 27, \u00a7 335), child abuse (Art. 27, \u00a7 35A), common law battery, perverted practice (Art. 27, \u00a7 554), and second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>degree sexual offense (Art. 27, \u00a7 464A(a)(3)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each crime was alleged to have been committed \u201con or about 1977 to 1982.\u201d The victim of each offense was named as his daughter, \u201ca child under 14 years of age, [Nightingale] being at least four years older than the victim____\u201d The daughter testified that on various occasions during the years in question her father had engaged in sexual activity with her, beginning with fondling and culminating with vaginal intercourse, fellatio, and cunnilingus. The court directed judgments of acquittal on the battery and perverted practices charges. The jury acquitted on the second degree rape and incest charges. It convicted Nightingale of child abuse and sexual offense in the second degree. He received two consecutive 15-year sentences. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>No. 1380, Sept. Term, 1986 (filed 18 May 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The second petitioner, Albert James Joseph Myers, Sr., (Myers), was tried in the Circuit Court for Frederick County on three consolidated criminal informations. Number 7317 charged him with second degree (Art. 27, \u00a7 464A(a)(8)), third degree (Art. 27, \u00a7 464B(a)(3)), and fourth degree (Art. 27, \u00a7 464C(a)(l)) sexual offense, and child abuse (Art. 27, \u00a7 35A). Each of these crimes was alleged to have been committed \u201cbetween November, 1983 through February, 1985\u201d on the person of his daughter, \u201cwho was then and there under fourteen ... years of age and the said ... Myers being four ... or more years older____\u201d Number 7819 charged Myers with child abuse and third and fourth degree sexual offenses \u201con or about August 3, 1985,\u201d the victim again being named as his daughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">At trial the daughter testified that Myers had engaged in sexual activity with her that included fondling, fellatio, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>anal intercourse. The 3 August 1985 charges involved a single incident in which, the daughter said, Myers had thrust his hand inside her panties and touched her vagina. The jury convicted Myers of all charges. He received four concurrent sentences under information No. 7317, the longest sentence being 20 years for second degree sexual offense. Under No. 7319 he received three concurrent sentences, the longest being 15 years for child abuse, with 10 years suspended. The No. 7319 sentences were made consecutive to those imposed in No. 7317. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. <em>Myers v. State, </em>No. 1513, Sept. Term, 1986 (filed 19 May 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The Public Defender filed a certiorari petition encompassing both cases and posing the question we have quoted at the outset of this opinion. We granted the petition. 310 Md. 567, 530 A.2d 742 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Nightingale and Myers argue that for double jeopardy purposes, their convictions and sentences for child abuse and sexual offenses cannot stand because the crimes are the same under the required evidence test of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), as applied by us in cases such as <em>State v. Frye, </em>283 Md. 709, 393 A.2d 1372 (1978), <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 373 A.2d 262 (1977), and <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 257, 353 A.2d 240 (1976). In the alternative, petitioners urge us to invoke the \u201crule of lenity\u201d we recently discussed in <em>Dillsworth v. State, </em>308 Md. 354, 519 A.2d 1269 (1987). The State insists that Nightingale and Myers are not entitled to the benefit of either rule. We need address only petitioners\u2019s first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in part, that no one shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb____\u201d It applies to the states. <em>Benton v. Maryland, 395 </em>U.S. 784, 787, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2058, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, 711 (1969). In the context of the case now before us, it protects against multiple convictions and sentences for the same offense. <em>Newton, </em>280 Md. at 263-265, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>373 A.2d at 264-265. Under \u201cboth federal double jeopardy principles and Maryland merger law, the test for determining the identity of offenses is the required evidence test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 373 A.2d at 266. This test we stated thus in <em>Newton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are not the same and do not merge. However, if only one offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, the offenses are deemed the same, and separate sentences for each offense are prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">280 Md. at 268, 373 A.2d at 266. We turn to the several offenses involved in this case in order to apply the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Article 27, \u00a7 35A, proscribes child abuse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The elements of this offense, in its broadest aspect, are that (1) an individual under the age of 18 (2) sustain physical injury or sexual abuse (3) at the hands of a parent or someone responsible for care, custody, or supervision of the victim. The sexual offenses, in their several degrees, are somewhat more complex. The second, third, and fourth degree offenses involved here (Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 464A(a)(3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 464B(a)(3),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>and 4640(a)(1),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> all have a common element: that the activity be for the sexual arousal, gratification or abuse of the actor or the victim. A sexual offense in the second degree (under \u00a7 464A(a)(3)) must involve a \u201csexual act\u201d as defined in the statute, and a specified age differential between actor and victim, <em>see </em>n. 4, <em>supra. </em>Second and third degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>offenses require \u201csexual contact\u201d as defined, and either an age differential (\u00a7 464B(a)(3)) or lack of consent (\u00a7 4640(a)(1)); <em>see </em>nn. 5 &amp; 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">It is apparent, then, that child abuse, taken in its broadest sense, involves certain elements <em>{e.g., </em>physical harm and a particular relationship between actor and victim) that none of the sexual offenses do. By the same token, each of the sexual offenses requires some elements <em>{e.g., </em>performance of a sexual act or sexual contact and sexual arousal or gratification) that child abuse does not. But the analysis does not end at this point. When a multi-purpose criminal statute is involved, we refine it by looking at the alternative elements relevant to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We took this approach in <em>Newton, supra, </em>in which we held that an underlying felony \u201cand murder committed in the perpetration of that felony constitute, under the required evidence test, double punishment for the same offense in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy clause.\u201d 280 Md. at 273-274, 373 A.2d at 269 [footnote omitted]. First degree murder may be committed in various ways, for example by a \u201cwilful, deliberate and premeditated killing\u201d (Art. 27, \u00a7 407) or by a killing committed during the commission of a felony enumerated in Article 27, \u00a7 410. There are other types of first degree murder as well. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 408-409. Commission of a felony is not an element of premeditated murder; killing is not an element of any of the \u00a7 410 felonies. Nevertheless, in <em>Newton </em>we looked to the alternative elements involved in the felony murder, and concluded that there was merger. <em>See also Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 694, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1439, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 725 (1980), and <em>Harris v. Oklahoma, </em>433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In <em>Thomas v. State, supra, </em>we employed the same sort of analysis. The issue there was whether Art. 27, \u00a7 349 and Art. 66V2, \u00a7 4-102 (now \u00a7 14-102 of the Transportation Article) involved the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. The latter section proscribed driving an automo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>bile without the owner\u2019s consent \u201cwith intent temporarily to deprive the owner of\u201d possession of the vehicle. The former made it a crime for a person to \u201center or [be] upon the premises of any other person ... [to] against the will and consent of said person ... wilfully take and carry away ... any ... vehicle____\u201d It was noted that \u00a7 349 in one aspect required \u201centry\u201d and could also apply to the taking of property other than motor vehicles, whereas \u00a7 4-102 required driving and applied only to motor vehicles. The offenses, the State argued, were not the same. We disagreed. Judge Eldridge, for the Court, noted that \u00a7 349\u2019s provisions were in the disjunctive. \u201cThe offense can be established either by showing an entry and a taking or by showing a taking of a vehicle from wherever it may be located.\u201d 277 Md. at 269, 353 A.2d at 247-248. Thus, despite differences in the statutes, under the circumstances of the case and for double jeopardy purposes, \u201cthe \u00a7 4-102 offense and the \u00a7 349 offense as charged in the indictment in this case are deemed to be the same\u201d because \u201cthe same evidence necessary to convict on the \u00a7 4-102 offense would always be sufficient to establish a \u00a7 349 offense such as alleged here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 353 A.2d at 248. <em>See also Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In <em>State v. Boozer, </em>304 Md. 98, 497 A.2d 1129 (1985), we recognized that Art. 27, \u00a7 464C was not a statute that created but a single offense; instead, it proscribes several different types of conduct, which may be treated as separate statutory offenses for double jeopardy purposes. The same is clearly true of the other sexual offense statutes, and of the child abuse statute. When, as here, a multi-purpose criminal statute is involved, the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4nc\">must construct from the alternative elements within the statute the particular formulation that applies to the case at hand. It should rid the statute of alternative elements that do not apply. It must, in other words, treat a multi-purpose statute written in the alternative as it would treat separate statutes. The theory behind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>analysis is that a criminal statute written in the alternative creates a separate offense for each alternative and should therefore be treated for double jeopardy purposes as separate statutes would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><em>Pandelli v. United States, </em>635 F.2d 533, 537 (6th Cir.1980) [footnote omitted]. If, when we look at the applicable alternative elements, a lesser offense in effect becomes one of the elements of another offense, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is met. It is met because, by virtue of that fact, all the elements of the lesser offense must be established to prove the other; only the other offense has any additional elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">So as far as child abuse is concerned, we can put aside any thought that these cases involve any aspect of child abuse based on physical harm or cruel physical treatment. At both Nightingale\u2019s and Myers\u2019s trials, the State\u2019s theory, as presented in opening statement, closing argument, and the court\u2019s instructions, was sexual child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">At both trials, the judge instructed on the elements of all offenses submitted to the jury. The Nightingale instructions, unlike those in Myers\u2019s case, included a direction to consider each charged offense separately. The Nightingale jury also was told that sexual child abuse \u201cmeans any act or acts involving sexual molestation or exploitation, including, but not limited to ... sexual offense in any degree____\u201d The prosecutor repeated that language during closing argument and later during his remarks pointed out that some of the fondling testified to by the daughter \u201cwould be sexual contact which would fall under the definition of sexual abuse.\u201d Moreover, the Nightingale jury sent a question to the judge, asking whether \u201ctouching, in the wrong places, alone, constitute^] child abuse as described in our instructions?\u201d The judge\u2019s answer to that question was, in effect, \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">The instructions to the Myers jury also noted that sexual child abuse included a \u201csexual offense in any degree.\u201d And the Myers prosecutor argued to the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>[C]hild abuse, in this instance, consists of sexual abuse. You will have to decide today whether or not the State has proven that there was sexual abuse committed by Mr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">Myers on his own daughter____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The evidence of that abuse, as recounted by the prosecutor, consisted of the evidence of the various sexual offenses with which Myers was charged. And in his final remarks, the prosecutor addressed by name only the crime of child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Under these circumstances, we believe that each jury could have found the defendant before it guilty of child abuse based solely on evidence of a sexual offense in some degree. If that were done, then the sexual offense became, in effect, a lesser included offense of sexual child abuse, and under the authorities we have cited, the offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes. Indeed, with respect to criminal information No. 7319 in Myers\u2019s case, the jury must have found a sexual offense as the basis of the child abuse verdict, because that information involved but a single incident of sexual contact. But as to the other charges against both defendants, they involved numbers of incidents over periods of time, some relatively minor, some not. With respect to them, a jury could have reached various decisions as to child abuse and sexual offenses, all of which were reflected in general verdicts of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The problem, then, is that we cannot tell whether these general verdicts of guilty were based on the use of sexual offenses as lesser included offenses (or elements) of child abuse, or whether the child abuse verdicts were based on other reasons (e.g., some sort of sexual molestation which the juries thought did not rise to the level of a sexual offense in any degree). In these circumstances we resolve the ambiguity in favor of the defendants and set aside the judgments on the sexual offense counts. <em>See Frye, </em>283 Md. at 723-725, 393 A.2d at 1379-1380 (unclear basis for verdict of first degree murder). <em>Also see, Leary v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 6, 31-32, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 1545-1546, 23 L.Ed.2d 57, 79 (1969) (\u201cIt has long been settled that when a case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>submitted to the jury on alternative theories the unconstitutionality of any of the theories requires that the conviction be set aside\u201d); and <em>Yates v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 312, 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1073, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356, 1371 (1957) (\u201cthe proper rule to be applied is that which requires a verdict to be set aside in cases where the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In <em>Jones v. State, </em>reported <em>sub nom. Frye v. State, </em>283 Md. 709, 724-725, 393 A.2d 1372, 1380 (1978), under circumstances somewhat similar to those now before us, we gave the State the option of retrying Jones on all charges. We directed that this be done under procedures that would eliminate uncertainty as to the basis for the jury\u2019s verdict. But that approach is not available to us here. In <em>Jones </em>we emphasized that \u201c[i]t was not in any manner the State\u2019s fault that ... instructions [that would have resulted in the elimination of uncertainty in the verdict] were not given.\u201d 283 Md. at 724, 393 A.2d at 1380. It was only under those circumstances that the State was permitted to elect to retry Jones on all charges. Those circumstances do not exist in the present cases. Despite the clear warning given by <em>Frye </em>and <em>Jones, </em>in neither of these cases did the State request appropriate instructions, or take any other action designed to assure that the basis for the jury\u2019s verdict was apparent and certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">We cannot say the State was not at fault, and we cannot, therefore, permit the option of new trials. The judgments on the several sex offenses (Art. 27, \u00a7 464A(a)(3) in Nightingale\u2019s case and Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 464A(a)(3), 464B(a)(3), and 4640(a)(1) in Myers\u2019s) must be vacated, and to the extent they failed to so direct, the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals must be reversed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>JUDGMENTS OP THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.
