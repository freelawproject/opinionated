By letter dated the next day the Department refused to allow the change of name for the following reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">The name WAVERLY, INC. is not available as it would be misleadingly similar to an existing Maryland limited partnership by the name of WAVERLY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Petitioner sued.

That legislation had been proposed by a commission chaired by Honorable William C. Walsh, a former judge of this Court. Under the revision a corporation\u2019s name could not \u201cbe the same as the name of any corporation of this State ... or so similar to any such name as to be misleading.\u201d Md.Code (1951), Art. 23, \u00a7 5(3). This provision, newly codified in the 1951 revision, embodied a restriction then \u201chandled by administrative practice.\u201d C.K. Bowie, Jr., <em>Explanatory Notes to the Commission \u2019s Report by the Reporter to the Revision Commission </em>(1951), reprinted in H. Bru\u00f1e, Jr., <em>Maryland Corporation Law and Practice, </em>677, 679 (rev. ed. 1953). \u201cThe purpose of the practice, and [of the 1951] statute, was doubtless to avoid confusion by the general public and also by the [Department\u2019s predecessor agency] in carrying out its administrative duties.\u201d <em>National Shoe Stores Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number><em>National Shoes of New York, Inc., </em>213 Md. 328, 335, 131 A.2d 909, 911-12 (1957). In the currently ongoing Maryland Code Revision Project the provision was brought forward as Md.Code (1975), CA \u00a7 2-106(b)(2). According <em>to </em>the Re-visor\u2019s Note to that Code section, \u201c[t]he only changes are in style.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">This prohibition was also found in \u00a7 8(c) of the Model Business Corporation Act (\u201cThe corporate name ... [sjhall not be the same as, or deceptively similar to, the name of any domestic corporation____\u201d). The comment to \u00a7 8 of the Model Act observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">Primarily the purpose of the name statutes is to protect the public against confusion between corporations; secondarily, their purpose is to protect the corporation against unfair competition. [1 Model Business Corp.Act Ann. 294 (2d ed. 1971).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">On December 11, 1981, the Department for the first time adopted regulations concerning name availability for corporations. Previously there could have been differences in the application of \u00a7 2-106(b)(2) between individual administrators and the possibility existed of \u201cshopping\u201d for a favorable interpretation. The regulations became effective January 7, 1982. <em>See </em>8:26 Md.Reg. 2106 <em>et seq. </em>(December 28, 1981). They are now codified as Md.Regs.Code tit. 18, \u00a7 .04.02.01 entitled, \u201cCriteria Used in Determining Acceptability of Corporate Name.\u201d Subsection C provides that \u201c[corporate names are the \u2018same\u2019 if a comparison of the names ... reveals no difference.\u201d Subsection D defines \u201cmisleadingly similar\u201d to mean that \u201cthere is an apparent difference, but the difference or differences are of such character that the names are likely to be confused by persons giving written communications concerning its name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The subsection of Reg. \u00a7 18.04.02.01 which bears most directly on the Department\u2019s position in the instant case is subsection E(l) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>A proposed corporate name is considered to be \u201cmisleadingly similar\u201d to a corporate name already on file if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">(1) The difference in the names consists in the use of different \u201cwords of incorporation\u201d (example: \u201cJones, Inc.\u201d is considered to be \u201cmisleadingly similar\u201d to \u201cJones Corporation\u201d).[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Following promulgation of Reg. \u00a7 18.04.02.01, the Department applied the statutory prohibition against identical or misleadingly similar corporate names by referring to a computer file of the names of corporations which were organized, qualified or registered in Maryland. Apparently relying on subsection E(l) of the regulation, the Department deleted the \u201cwords of incorporation,\u201d a/k/a the \u201ctails,\u201d from the true corporate names in the computer file. As illustrated in subsection E(l), if individuals sought to incorporate \u201cJones Corporation\u201d but there was a \u201cJones, Inc.\u201d currently on file, the Department compared the name requested, \u201cJones Corporation,\u201d without the tail to the existing \u201cJones, Inc.\u201d without the tail. Thus the comparison would be \u201cJones\u201d to \u201cJones,\u201d and the requested name would be rejected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>By statutes effective July 1, 1982, the General Assembly substantially revised the laws relating to limited partnerships. Ch. 801 of the Acts of 1981. This legislation, codified as CA Title 10, for the first time required that, in order to form a limited partnership, the certificate of limited partnership had to be filed with the Department. CA \u00a7 10-201(a). Under CA \u00a7 10-102(a)(4)(i) \u201c[t]he name of each limited partnership as set forth in its certificate ... [m]ay not be the same as or misleadingly similar to ... [t]he name of any corporation or limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of <em>Maryland____\u201d </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The July 1, 1982, legislation also amended portions of the general corporation law, including CA \u00a7 2-106(b)(2) which thereafter additionally prohibited the name of any corporation from being the same as or misleadingly similar to the name of any limited partnership, as therein specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Faced with additional responsibilities under Ch. 801 of the Acts of 1981, including comparing corporate names to names of limited partnerships, and vice versa, the Department promulgated at 9:14 Md.Reg. 1449 (July 9, 1982) and adopted at 9:19 Md.Reg. 1896 (September 17, 1982) a new regulation, codified as Md.Regs.Code tit. 18, \u00a7 .04.02.02, and entitled, \u201cCriteria Used in Determining Acceptability of Limited Partnership Name.\u201d It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\">A. The criteria set forth in COMAR 18.04.02.01 regarding corporate name availability shall also apply to limited partnerships filed with the Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">B. The words \u201cLimited Partnership\u201d shall be treated as \u201cwords of incorporation\u201d as described in Regulation .01E(1), above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Thus it came to pass that when the petitioner submitted the change of its name to \u201cWaverly, Inc.\u201d the Department deleted the word \u201cInc.\u201d It then entered its computer file where it found \u201cWaverly Limited Partnership\u201d with the words \u201cLimited Partnership\u201d deleted. When it compared \u201cWaverly\u201d to \u201cWaverly,\u201d the Department found the names to be \u201cmisleadingly similar\u201d and this lawsuit resulted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">It is clear that Md.Regs. \u00a7 18.04.02.01 and .02 are interpretative, as opposed to legislative, rules. Whereas legislative rules \u201creceive statutory force upon going into effect,\u201d interpretative rules \u201conly interpret the statute to guide the administrative agency in the performance of its duties until directed otherwise by decisions of the courts.\u201d <em>Comptroller v. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 234, 107 A.2d 93, 98. (1954). <em>See generally </em>2 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7:8 through 7:16 (2d ed. 1979). No statute expressly confers on the Department rule-making power with respect to the Department\u2019s functions under the Corporations and Associations Article. The source line in CO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>MAR for the \u201cName Availability\u201d regulations attributes authority to \u201cArticle 81, \u00a7 232, Annotated Code of Maryland\u201d (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol.). That section contained provisions respecting the jurisdiction, supervision, powers and duties of the Department as to taxation. As part of the Maryland Code Revision Project former \u00a7 232 of Art. 81 was repealed by Ch. 8 of the Acts of 1985 and the substance of the provisions transferred to Md.Code (1986), Tax-Property Article. <em>See </em>Tax-Property Article, Tables of Comparable Sections, at 450-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><em>Rockhill, supra, </em>involved an aspect of the Retail Sales Tax Act which classified as a retail sale a transaction involving charges for lodgings or accommodations regularly furnished to the public for consideration. The Comptroller by regulation interpreted that provision to mean that all rentals in resort areas for terms of four months or less were taxable. The assessment in <em>Rockhill </em>concerned rentals for less than four months of lodgings which were not regularly furnished to the public for consideration. The statute\u2019s requirement that the lodgings be \u201cregularly furnished\u201d was omitted in the regulation. This Court affirmed a judgment setting aside the assessment because the interpretation reflected in the regulation was inconsistent with the statute. And <em>see Baltimore v. William E. Koons, Inc., </em>270 Md. 231, 310 A.2d 813 (1973) (regulation prohibiting use of any unvented gas-fired space heater as a primary heating device conflicted with statute permitting the use of those heaters as primary heating devices, if \u201capproved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In the instant matter Reg. 18.04.02.02B suffers from a similar defect. CA \u00a7 2-106(a) requires that the name of a corporation \u201cindicate its corporate status.\u201d That requirement is satisfied by inclusion in the name of (1) \u201cCompany,\u201d if not preceded by \u201cand\u201d or by a symbol for \u201cand,\u201d (2) \u201cCorporation,\u201d (3) \u201cIncorporated,\u201d (4) \u201cLimited,\u201d or (5) an abbreviation of any one of the four terms. , Maryland corporation law has contained an analogous provision since at least Ch. 240 of the Acts of 1908, Sec. 3(b). It provided that \u201c[t]he name of the proposed corporation ... shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>always be such as to indicate that it is a corporation as distinguished from a natural person or a partnership.\u201d The purpose of the requirement is explained in the comment to 1 Model Business Corp.Act Ann. \u00a7 8, at 298 (2d ed. 1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxK\">In England a long tradition of general partnerships led to development of the requirement of a designation in the corporate name indicating limited liability on the part of the owners of the enterprise. This carried over in the various states in the form of requiring the corporate name to include or end with the terms \u201ccorporation\u201d or \u201cincorporated\u201d or abbreviations of similar import. Under present-day credit practices it is unlikely that reliance is placed upon the presence or absence of such a designation in a name, and the significance of the requirement in paragraph (a) [of the Model Act] is open to question. It is retained in the Model Act as a concession to a custom that is not burdensome.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">With respect to limited partnerships CA \u00a7 10-102(a)(l) requires that \u201c[t]he name of each limited partnership as set forth in its certificate ... contain without abbreviation the words \u2018limited partnership\u2019____\u201d The purpose of this requirement, like the one applicable to corporations, is to advise the public of the limited liability aspect of that business organization. By mandating that the name of a corporation indicate it is a corporation and that the name of a limited partnership indicate it is a limited partnership, the General Assembly has necessarily concluded that those designations in an organization\u2019s name have significance to members of the public dealing with one or the other form of business organization. Consequently, the Department\u2019s interpretative rule requiring comparisons between limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>partnerships and corporations to disregard the mandated portion of each entry\u2019s name conflicts with \u00a7\u00a7 2-106(a) and 10-102(a). Each statute is intended to distinguish the type of organization with which it deals from other types of organizations, as well as from individuals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The Department argues that the reading we give the statutes \u201cwould render the language of CA \u00a7 2-106(b)(2), as it relates to a comparison between corporate and limited partnership names, nugatory.\u201d Respondent\u2019s brief at 11. According to this argument, by including the required words when making the comparison, a corporation and a limited partnership could never have the \u201csame\u201d name. The Department\u2019s reasoning ignores the use of alternatives in CA \u00a7 2\u2014106(b)(2)(i): \u201cThe name of a corporation may not ... [bje the same as <em>or </em>misleadingly similar to ... [t]he name of any Maryland corporation <em>or </em>limited partnership____\u201d (Emphasis added). It is true that the principal applications of the \u00a7 2-106(b)(2) prohibition will be between corporations and the principal applications of the \u00a7 10-102(a)(4) prohibition will be between limited partnerships. Nevertheless, the reference to limited partnerships in the corporation statute and the reference to corporations in the limited partnership statute are not meaningless under our interpretation. For example, one way in which a corporation may satisfy the requirement of indicating its corporate status is to use the word \u201cLimited\u201d in its name. It is possible that the Department would have to compare \u201cABC Limited\u201d with \u201cABC Limited Partnership.\u201d In that situation the Department might well conclude that there is misleading similarity between the true, full names.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Because the comparison in the instant case should have been between \u201cWaverly, Inc.\u201d and \u201cWaverly Limited Partnership\u201d there was no misleading similarity and the Department should have allowed use of the name requested by petitioner. <em>See National Shoe Stores Co. v.

We are not here concerned with the comparison of a corporate name with another corporate name; nor are we concerned with the comparison of a limited partnership name with another limited partnership name. The rule stated above is limited to the comparison of a corporate name with the name of a limited partnership. Further, our opinion does not purport to affect the concerned entities\u2019 rights under the law of unfair competition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
