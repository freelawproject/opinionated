This theory was no more valid than the first theory. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-23\">The case was tried on the theory outlined in the pretrial order. Counsel, after trial and an adverse decision, was properly denied leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The doctrine of unseaworthiness does not extend to injuries caused by instrumentalities ashore having no connection with the vessel.
