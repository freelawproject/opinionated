Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S. 157, 88 S.Ct. 1994, 20 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1968); Total Telecable, Inc. v. FCC, 411 F.2d 639 (9th Cir. 1969); or Great Falls Community TV Cable Co., Inc. v. FCC, 416 F.2d 238 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-19\">The sole unresolved issue properly before us is whether the petition stated grounds for waiver of the non-duplication rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-20\">Petitioner\u2019s cable television system carries the signals of eight television stations to approximately three thousand subscribers in Port Angeles, Washington. The signals are those of four Seattle stations, including KIRO-TV, a CBS affiliate; KVOS-TV, a CBS affiliate in Bellingham, Washington; and three Canadian stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">Port Angeles lies within the predicted Grade A contour of KVOS-TV, the Bellingham CBS affiliate. KVOSTV requested full protection against same-day duplication of its programming on petitioner\u2019s system, and petitioner, in turn, sought a waiver of the rule from the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">We held in Total Telecable, Inc. v. FCC, <em>supra, </em>411 F.2d at 643, that a petition for waiver should show: \u201c(1) the <em>economic </em>effect of waiver on the local TV station * * * and (2) that in the petitioner\u2019s * * * case, nonduplication will have an unduly disruptive effect on its service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The present petition for waiver alleges that a range of mountains \u201cseverely impedes\u201d reception in Port Angeles of signals from stations in Seattle and other cities in the United States, but not those from KVOS-TV in Bellingham. It alleges that although Port Angeles is nearer Bellingham than Seattle in straight-line miles, it is nearer Seattle in terms of travel time and convenience; and, as a result, that the citizens of Port Angeles have \u201cbecome dependent upon Seattle in all regards.\u201d It asserts that Seattle advertisers, but not those in Bellingham, cater to the Port Angeles market; and that petitioner\u2019s CATV subscribers \u201cenjoy, desire and are dependent upon the signals from the Seattle stations; especially KIRO-TV.\u201d It alleges that compliance with the nonduplication rule would require petitioner to \u201cdelete substantial portions of the KIRO-TV programming; and, possibly, totally delete KIRO-TV from its system.\u201d Finally, the petition asserts that waiver of the rule \u201ccertainly\u201d would not prejudice KVOSTV, alleging that the non-network programming and advertising of KVOS-TV is aimed \u201cfor the most part\u201d at that station\u2019s Canadian audience, that published figures indicate that KVOS-TV reaches many more Canadian than United States homes, and that KVOS-TV\u2019s network base hourly rate is $300.00 \u201cwhereas its Class AA rate is $650.00, which is obviously attributable to KVOS-TV\u2019s substantial Canadian audience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The Commission denied the petition on two grounds. The first was that the allegations are conclusory and not supported by recitals of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The Commission requires that waiver petitions \u201cstate <em>fully and precisely all pertinent facts and considerations </em>relied upon to demonstrate the need for the relief requested and to support a determination that a grant of such relief would serve the public interest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 74.1109(c) (1) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Titusville Cable TV, Inc. v. United States, 404 F.2d 1187, 1190, 1192 (3d Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The justification for this requirement is clear. The Commission reasonably anticipated a deluge of waiver requests from the large number of formerly unregulated CATV systems to which the new rules applied. It therefore formulated summary procedures to permit \u201cexpeditious processing of such requests\u201d and announced that it would, \u201cwhere possible, promptly dispose of the matter on the basis of * * * written submissions.\u201d Second Report and Order, 2 F.C.C.2d 725, 764 (1966). This procedure could be made effective only by requiring a high degree of specificity in the written submissions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">As a survey of the petition in this case has shown, the allegations relevant to the critical issues are, for the most part, no more than bare, highly generalized assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Petitioner argues that the Commission could have ordered a further written submission or other proceedings to cure the defect, and this is undoubtedly true. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 74.1109(f). However, for reasons already stated, we think the Commission could properly require individual, petitioners to allege specific facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case for waiver in their initial written submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">The Commission rejected the petition on a second ground as well: namely, that it did not allege, even generally, a prima facie case for waiver. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>As the Commission stated, petitioner\u2019s allegations of injury to itself and to Port Angeles viewers \u201care not persuasive.\u201d Petitioner can continue to carry all of the non-network programming of KIRO-TV and the full schedules of the other three Seattle stations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since petitioner carries CBS network programs on the channel it allots to KVOS-TV, the only service which non-duplication withdraws from petitioner\u2019s subscribers is an unspecified amount of advertising by Seattle retailers which KIRO-TV transmits with these network programs. Thus a large majority of petitioner\u2019s Seattle programming, including the advertising by Seattle retailers which accompanies it, will still be available on petitioner\u2019s system. It is impossible to conclude that elimination of an unspecified but undoubtedly minor amount of Seattle advertising will substantially inconvenience Port Angeles viewers or unduly disrupt petitioner\u2019s CATV service.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Petitioner also failed to carry its burden of showing that waiver would not prejudice KVOS-TV. Petitioner\u2019s allegations suggest no more than that KVOSTV\u2019s American audience is substantially smaller than its Canadian audience and that the larger share of its income is dependent upon the existence of the latter. But as the Commission pointed out, the petition itself discloses that KVOS-TV\u2019s network base hourly rate is $300.00; and this rate depends entirely upon KVOSTV\u2019s American audience for the very programs which petitioner seeks to duplicate. It cannot be assumed that impairment of this source of income would not substantially affect KVOS-TV\u2019s net-profit position.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The Commission\u2019s order is affirmed. The interlocutory injunction heretofore entered is vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-14\">. In material part, the rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-15\">\u201cWhere a station i.s entitled to program exclusivity, the CATV system shall, upon the request of the station * * * refrain from duplicating any program broadcast by such station, on the same day as its broadcast by the station. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-26\">. For reasons similar to those involved in Great Falls Community TV Cable Co. v. FCC, 416 F.2d 238 (9th Cir. 1969), we decline to review the contentions in this case upon which the Commission \u201chas been afforded no opportunity to pass.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 405.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">. <em>Cf. </em>Rio Grande Family Radio Fellowship, Inc. v. FCC, 406 F.2d 664, 666 (D.C.Cir. 1968) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201cWhen an applicant seeks a waiver of a rule, it must plead with particularity the facts and circumstances which warrant such action. The Commission staff must process annually thousands of applications. It cannot be expected to do research for applicants or to probe the underlying engineering or economic data to see whether they will support a greater claim than that made by experts or counsel. If the Commission staff were required to assume such a burden, little or nothing would be accomplished.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\">. The record contains a suggestion that because KVOS-TV carries some NBO programming, petitioner may have to delete certain programs carried by NBC\u2019s Seattle affiliate KING-TV, but no point has been made of this possible limitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\">. Other contentions made in this court by petitioner on this issue were not presented to the Commission, and we do not consider them. <em>See </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\">. The Commission stated, in this connection, that duplication of KVOS-TV\u2019s programming would disrupt that station\u2019s audience in Port Angeles. Petitioner challenges this assertion as a finding of fact which is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. We do not so view it.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-18\">In both the First and Second Reports, the Commission made the general determination that unregulated CATV operations threatened to have \u201ca substantial negative effect upon station audiences.\u201d Second Report and Order, 2 F.C.C.2d at 737. <em>See also </em>First Report and Order, 38 F.C.C. 683, 710-11 (1965). Absent any support for a different conclusion in petitioner\u2019s waiver application, the Commission could reasonably assume that a condition it has found to be true generally would also obtain in Port Angeles. Indeed, petitioner\u2019s allegations regarding the strong appeal of KIROTV to Port Angeles viewers supports tlie Commission\u2019s assumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
