Coblentz, the appellant here. The ultimate facts are for the most part undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-20\">During the early morning hours of December 27, 1959, Edward Thomas Coblentz, a college student, was loitering or prowling around a Miami, Florida, motel owned and managed by Vincent Carbone. After observing Coblentz for a short period of time, Carbone, armed with a pistol, went out and confronted him. A brief scuffle ensued and Coblenz fled. Carbone chased him, yelled for him to stop, and according to his testimony, fired several shots in an attempt to frighten him. One of the bullets apparently ricocheted and struck Coblentz, fatally wounding him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-21\">In 1960 Ralph E. Coblentz, father of the deceased, filed actions against Car-bone in the state circuit court in Dade County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Carbone\u2019s insuror, American Surety Company of New York, defended the actions unsuccessfully and judgments totaling $70,000 were entered for the plaintiff. These judgments were subsequently reversed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and amended complaints were filed in June of 1962. American Surety filed answers to the amended complaints but subsequently concluded that it was not obligated to defend Carbone and withdrew from his defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Carbone retained other coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>sel and in December, 1964, a waiver of jury trial was entered together with a stipulation of facts and testimony signed by counsel for both parties. On the basis of these stipulations, the circuit court entered judgments for Coblentz totaling $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">Upon entry of the state court judgments, Coblentz procured the issuance of a writ of garnishment against American Surety. The garnishment action on grounds of diversity of citizenship, Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 1332, was removed from the state court to the court below. The district court determined that until amended or set aside, the state court judgments (which found Carbone negligent) were binding in the garnishment action. Accordingly, summary judgment was granted for Coblentz. A panel of this Court reversed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> pointing out that \u201cThe finding of negligence was based upon a stipulation of testimony between parties \u2014 the representative of the deceased and the insured \u2014 both of whom would strongly prefer a finding of negligence rather than intentional tort\u201d. The case was remanded so that the negligence \u2014 assault and battery issue could be properly litigated. The jury resolved this issue by a general verdict in favor of Mr. Coblentz, which under their instructions constituted a finding that the death of young Coblentz was not the result of an assault and battery. On post trial motions, the district court set the verdict aside and entered judgment for American Surety. Appellant argues that the court erred in entering the judgment n. o. v. We agree, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The trial court\u2019s charge to the jury with regard to assault and battery was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-6\">\u201cAn assault is a demonstration of an unlawful intent by one person to inflict immediate injury on the person of another person then present. That is an assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-7\">\u201cA battery is the intentional, unlawful use of force or violence on the person of another or any unlawful beating, or other wrongful physical violence or constraint inflicted on a person without his consent. Unlawful in that sense means <em>unlawfully, civilly or criminally. It does not 'make any difference.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">The trial court adapted this definition from O\u2019Brien v. Howell, Fla.1957, 92 So.2d 608, 63 A.L.R.2d 544, adding the word \u201cintentional\u201d inasmuch as the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>court indicated that \u201cintentional\u201d was implicit in the definition given in the charge in that case, op. cit., supra, at 610. The underscored language was objected to by appellant\u2019s counsel at trial but the objection is not raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">We must view appellant\u2019s objection to entry of the judgment n. o. v. in light of this Court\u2019s recent en banc decision in The Boeing Company v. Shipman, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 365. There, in a diversity case, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-11\">\u201cOn motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict the Court should consider all of the evidence \u2014 not just that evidence which supports the nonmover\u2019s case \u2014 but in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion. If the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting of the motions is proper. On the other hand, if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the motions should be denied, and the case submitted to the jury. A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury. The motions for directed verdict and judgment n. o. v. should not be decided by which side has the better of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>the case, nor should they be granted only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support a jury verdict. There must be a conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question. However, it is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of the facts, and not the Court, to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences, and determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d 411 F.2d 374.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">A perusal of the record convinces us that the entry of judgment n. o. v. violated <em>Boeing </em>standards. American Surety\u2019s defense to the garnishment action was that Carbone had committed an assault and battery, such conduct not being covered by the policy issued him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Carbone testified that he fired the shots into the ground and that he did not intend to shoot Coblentz. He indicated that he only meant to scare the victim, not wound or kill him. Expert testimony supported the appellant\u2019s theory that the fatal bullet ricocheted and struck young Coblentz, rather than striking him directly. American Surety produced an eyewitness who testified that Carbone pursued Coblentz down a sidewalk and fired his pistol \u201cat the man, to the side, high, low, just wildly\u201d. He also testified that Carbone threatened to kill Coblentz if he did not halt. Cross-examination revealed, however, that prior trial testimony given by this eyewitness did not include reference to any threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Given the Court\u2019s charge on assault and battery, the evidence presented at the trial was of such quality and weight that the jurors, in the exercise of impartial judgment, might reach varying conclusions as to the proper verdict. As there was a conflict in substantial evidence, a jury question was created and it was up to the jury as the traditional finder of facts to weigh the conflicting evidence and inferences and to determine the credibility of witnesses. Thus, the verdict of the jury should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">Additionally, we find it necessary to comment briefly upon another issue raised by the appellant. By the terms of its policy, American Surety promised \u201cto pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages * *- *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">The district judge, in setting aside the jury verdict, stated that the final judgments entered by the state court were not within the coverage of the insurance policy because they did not legally obligate the insured to pay any sum or sums of money. This conclusion was apparently based upon the final paragraph of the state court judgments, which provided in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-9\">\u201c * * * [I]n accordance with stipulation of the parties, that this judgment may only be satisfied from public liability insurance policies in force at the time of the incident complained of and this judgment is not satisfiable from nor [may it] be a lien upon any other assets of the defendant, Vincent Carbone\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\"> In Florida, as elsewhere, the duty of an insuror to defend its insured is continuing in nature. The existence of the obligation to defend arises and must be determined by the claims alleged by the pleadings in the suit, and not upon the insuror\u2019s evaluation of ultimate liability vel non. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Hodor, Fla.Ct.App. 1967, 200 So.2d 205; Burton v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co., 5 Cir. 1964, 335 F.2d 317; Ketona Chemical Corp. v. Globe Indemnity Company, 5 Cir. 1968, 404 F.2d 181. Based upon the pleadings in the state court suit, it is clear that American Surety was obligated to undertake Carbone\u2019s defense. Where either an indemnitor or liability insuror has notice of a proceeding against his indemnitee or insured, and is afforded an opportunity to appear and defend, a judgment rendered against the indemnitee or insured, in the absence of fraud or collusion, is conclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>against the indemnitor or insuror as to all material matters determined therein.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">Because American Surety refused to handle his defense, Carbone was left to his own resources. It was certainly in his best interest to consent to the entry of a judgment that could be satisfied only from public liability insurance policies covering him at the time of the incident rather than from his own personal assets. In this Erie situation, Florida law controls. We find no Florida cases in point but follow a clear line of authority well articulated by Nebraska courts. In Metcalf v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., 1964, 176 Neb. 468, 126 N.W.2d 471, the Nebraska Supreme Court was confronted with the same issue that is before us: An insured, left to his own resources when his liability insuror refused to assume his defense, consented to entry of a judgment for $4500 and costs, satisfiable only out of insurance policies covering him. In the resulting garnishment action the insurance company contended, as does American Surety in this case, that since the judgment did not legally obligate its insured to pay anything neither did it \u2014 nor could it \u2014 \u25a0 obligate his insuror to pay anything. The Court replied to this contention with a quote from an Iowa case, Fullerton v. United States Casualty Co., 184 Iowa 219, 167 N.W. 700, 6 A.L.R. 367, earlier cited with approval by the Nebraska court in Hawkeye Casualty Co. v. Stoker, 154 Neb. 466, 48 N.W.2d 623:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-5\">\u201cWe are cited to a clause of the contract to the effect that the right of the insured to maintain an action against the company is limited to cases of \u2018loss actually sustained and paid in money in satisfaction of a judgment after trial of the issue,\u2019 and it is said that the payment of Mrs. Jacobson by plaintiff was by way of a settlement, and not in satisfaction of a judgment. But this provision can avail the appellant nothing in this case. It repudiated its obligation to assume and carry the defense to final judgment, and, having abandoned the case, it left the assured at liberty to take up the defense and contest the claim to final judgment, or, if so advised, to make the most favorable settlement possible.\u201d <em>Metcalf </em>op. cit. at 476.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-9\">The record shows that Carbone\u2019s lawyer advised American Surety that he intended to pursue the procedure approved by the Nebraska Court in <em>Met-calf, </em>unless American Surety should choose to fulfill its obligation to defend Carbone. Having elected to leave Car-bone to his own defenses, American Surety could not later complain about the form of the judgment. \u201cIt is a well-settled principle that where a person is responsible over to another, either by \u25a0 operation of law or express contract, and he is duly notified of the pendency of the suit against the person to whom he is liable over, and full opportunity is afforded him to defend the action, the judgment, if obtained without fraud or collusion, will be conclusive against him, whether he appeared or not.\u201d 27 Am. Jur. Indemnity, \u00a7 35, p. 478. See also, 42 C.J.S. Indemnity \u00a7 32, p. 613; 50 C.J.S. Judgments \u00a7 811, p. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">The judgment on which this garnishment action is based was not tainted by fraud or collusion, and American Surety was given notice of the procedure that Carbone intended to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">Upon remand we direct the district court to reinstate the verdict of the jury and enter final judgment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">.
