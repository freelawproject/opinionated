Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). Because the search was incident to a valid arrest and not unreasonable in scope, there was no error in the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the incriminating evidence which was uncovered and used at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-21\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request for a fourth continuance, and the evidence was quite sufficient to submit the ease to the jury and to enable it to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
