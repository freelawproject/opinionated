BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">On cross motions for summary judgment the District Court upheld the Union and ordered enforcement of the Arbiter\u2019s decision granting reinstatement to the Grievant with back pay to commence about nine months after discharge and to run until reinstatement. The Employer appeals asserting that enforcement of the award would violate public policy of Texas and, even there, lead to a breach of the peace and most certainly a loss of that tranquility which should characterize the atmosphere of a good place to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-16\">What brings this about was not so much a violation of the common law of the shop \u2014 out of which the Arbiter\u2019s need and power jointly proceed \u2014 as it was the frailty of human nature and its affectionate nurture of just ordinary gossip. Indigenous to contemporary interest in things erotic, the specific subject of this gossip concerned the activities of two employees, one, naturally, a woman \u2014 a switchboard operator \u2014 the other a man \u2014 an outside installer-repairer. The complication was that the woman\u2019s husband was also an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-17\">According to the Employer, it discharged the Grievant because he started and spread rumors that the woman employee and the other employee had been engaged in an affair for some time. But after hearing oral testimony covering 360 pag\u00e9s, the Arbiter, a Law professor at Southern Methodist School of Law, saw the picture quite differently. As he saw things it all began on Friday, July 2. The Grievant and two other employees were in the test board room when a question came up about why it had taken the \u201cother man\u201d so long to get to a nearby small town for a work assignment. To this concern someone (not the Grievant) replied \u201cI can tell you why it took so long * * * He stopped at [the woman employee\u2019s] house.\u201d Not content with that, he went on to say that at some recent time he had seen this man park his truck in a neighbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ing carport and then walk to the woman employee\u2019s house. As we read the Arbiter\u2019s decision it was at this point that Grievant made his first contribution \u2014 a matter of fact statement that he too had seen a furtive-like parking of that same employee\u2019s truck and a walk to the woman employee\u2019s house. There was, to be sure, some conflicting testimony which tended to magnify the Grievant\u2019s participation and an interest in getting Employer to discipline or discharge, not the woman employee, but the \u201cother man\u201d who had quite a reputation as a local philanderer. Later that afternoon the Grievant and the woman employee encountered each other and discussed what was said among the three male employees earlier. During the following week the story apparently became a matter of central interest in this small Texas city. When the word got back to the husband \u2014 actually through his father\u2014 he precipitated a conference in a nearby city with Employer\u2019s personnel supervisor. He was accompanied, oddly enough, by the male employee accused of the misdeeds. In the investigation by Employer it is clear that Grievant did not make the full disclosure later given and credited. And the Arbiter emphasized in his findings that later in the day on Friday, July 2, and again on the following Monday, July 5, Grievant, in what were otherwise quite unprovocative, casual encounters with the woman employee, repeated to her the statement earlier made concerning her suspected conduct. The upshot was that Grievant was discharged for starting and circulating these rumors.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">But when the Arbiter got through with this inquiry about who said what about whom at what time, it turned out to be much like any back fence gossip\u2014 the story got better as it went along but in the beginning \u2014 and in fact \u2014 there was nothing to it. More important, as a problem in industrial \u2014 not domestic \u2014 relations the alleged instigator (Grievant) was found not to have started it, but rather his own \u201csin\u201d was in giving it a little currency when another brought it up initially and then in pressing the matter in wholly private, undisclosed conversations with the woman employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The Arbiter found that the \u201cwhole unpleasantness\u201d was not started by Grievant but that another employee \u201cstarted up the whole subject.\u201d Finding that Grievant spoke only to the two fellow employees in the initial discussion (and twice later privately with the woman employee), the Arbiter concluded emphatically that \u201cThere is no evidence that [Grievant] spoke of his suspicions to others in the exchange or in the [local] community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Moreover, Grievant had urged on the woman employee that \u201cthe matter * * * should be dropped.\u201d Grievant\u2019s undoing was his mistaken belief that he should try to protect the employee who first broached the subject and who was becoming the object of criticism by the woman, her husband, and the alleged paramour. The Arbiter then wrapped it all up in words which would do credit to the best of judges \u2014 elected, appointed, with limited or life tenure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">\u201cOn the whole case the Arbitrator does not think that [Grievant] should have been discharged. When he filed his grievance, he made known [the other employee\u2019s] primary role in starting the whole unpleasantness. The Arbitrator is persuaded by the testimony that [Grievant] trapped himself when he tried to protect [that employee]. While [Grievant] created unpleasantness for [the woman employee], there is no evidence that he spread rumors beyond the small circle of people involved in the several discussions on July 2 and 5. [Grievant] spoke unwisely and foolishly, but the Arbitrator does not believe that just and lawful cause existed for his outright discharge. [Grievant] conducted himself with quietness and dignity at the hearing. His previous record and seniority count for something in arguing against the extreme penalty in industrial relations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number> The Employer, having earlier lost on the issue of arbitrability,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as an almost automatic instinctive reflex to the adverse award on the merits, asserted the Gemini attack of lack of the Arbiter\u2019s \u201cauthority\u201d to decide as he did.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">More often than not \u2014 and certainly that is so here \u2014 this is a poor mask for a desire to have the court redeternfine the facts \u2014 even just a tiny bit- \u2014 or reach a legal conclusion on them as found or hoped for which differs from that of the eonsensually annointed judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">This is nothing new to us. In <em>Belo</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we phrased it this way. We \u201cmust recognize \u2014 indeed, discipline ourselves to make certain that we are conscious of it always \u2014 that if the controversy is one for grievance machinery and for resolution by an arbitrator whose decision is expressly to be final and binding, there is every likelihood that that chosen umpire may well make errors both of fact and law \u2014 that is errors in the eyes of Judges now having a narrowly circumscribed function.\u201d And nothing before or since<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *affords any real basis for apprehending that the Fifth Circuit has succumbed to this beguiling plea.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">With this approval all washes out. Recognizing that in some situations enforcement of a mandated arbitral award will be denied because it compels violation of law or conduct contrary to accepted public policy,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *we see no ground for denial on either basis on the findings as made. Nor is anything of significant substance added by the dubious effort to expand the \u201crecord\u201d by post-award affidavits proferred as a part of Employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment reflecting the convictions of the woman employee, her husband, the suspect and the manager that if Grievant is reinstated his presence would create personal tensions leading to a breach of the peace. Although hard for Employer to accept, the Arbiter has found against the accusation which led to discharge, that Grievant started and thereafter cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>culated false rumors about the woman employee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">That the Arbiter did find that Grievant ought not, along with his fellow workers, to have fallen prey to the lamentable frailty of giving a little credence to a rumor just loosened and ought not later to have added irritation by privately repeating the charges to the woman employee is a long, long way from upholding Employer\u2019s charges. In short, the Arbiter held that the facts did not warrant the discharge, and consequently it was not for a \u201cjust and lawful cause.\u201d Of course, under the board provisions for arbitration,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it was within the competence of the Arbiter<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to determine that while discharge was not merited, some discipline less awesome was in order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This he meted out by substantially postponing the commencement of back pay, thus making the Grievant bear a considerable loss himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Rejecting these attacks and the cases urged by Employer, we end this as we have others. \u201cThe arbiter was chosen to be the Judge. That Judge has spoken. There it ends.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANX\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\">.
