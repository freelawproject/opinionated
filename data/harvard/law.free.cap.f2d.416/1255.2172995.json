The conviction and orders denying two motions for a new trial were affirmed from the bench by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-13\">On this appeal appellant contends that the Government failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1964) by not turning over the \u201cDaily Attendance and Expense Sheet\u201d of the Government\u2019s witness, Agent Frank Selvaggi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-14\">The \u201cDaily Attendance and Expense Sheet\u201d is used solely for office administration. It is not the type of material contemplated by Section 3500.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-15\">Moreover the judge who originally convicted Smith, after a trial without a jury, denied Smith\u2019s \u00a7 2255 application, thus holding, in effect, that the document in question would not have influenced his initial determination of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-16\">Even if refusal to require production of the disputed document were in error it would be merely a defect in the trial correctable on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-17\">\u201cOnly when there has been a deprivation of rights so fundamental as to amount to a denial of a fair trial can the conviction and sentence be set aside under \u00a7 2255.\u201d United States v. Angelet, 255 F.2d 383, 384 (2d Cir. 1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
