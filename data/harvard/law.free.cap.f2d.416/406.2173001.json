When he did not do so, he was convicted of failing to report for and submit to induction, in violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a). He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year and one day.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-24\">The appellant argues that the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 451 et seq., was enacted in violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution and also that it abridges the Thirteenth Amendment by imposing involuntary servitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-25\">\u201cThe power of Congress to classify and conscript manpower for military service is \u2018beyond question\u2019 \u201d constitutional. United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 755-758, 68 S.Ct. 1294, 92 L.Ed. 1694 (1948); Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 38 S.Ct. 159, 62 L.Ed. 349 (1918). \u201cThe [Tenth] Amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,\u201d United States v. Darby Lumber Co., 312 U.S. 100, 124, 61 S.Ct. 451, 462, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941), and must yield when confronted with a necessary and proper exercise of an enumerated power granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>to Congress. A draft law is such an exercise of the power to raise armies contained in Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 12 of the Constitution. As the above cited cases make clear, it has also been established for 50 years that conscription into the armed forces does not violate the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
