The District Court for the Northern District of Florida awarded the Bank $57,130.70, plus attorney\u2019s fees of $5,713.00, and the defendant has appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">On April 10, 1962, plaintiff was insured by defendant under this Banker\u2019s Blanket Bond. The insurance purported to cover certain losses resulting from loans obtained by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-18\">In December 1961, the Bank had begun a series of loans to Jo Vonne M. Barnes which continued over a number of years. These were made on the strength of a program certificate of membership in the Dreyfus Investment Program, as well as two later \u201cDividend Reinvestment Advices\u201d and a \u201cConfirmation of Dividend Reinvested\u201d issued in 1964 and 1965 by the Bank of New York, as custodian for the Dreyfus Investment Program. The latter papers each stated the total shares held by the investor in the Program at the particular time. About $40,000 was loaned to Miss Barnes in 1964-1965 on the strength (at least in part) of these writings.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-19\">Upon completion of the loans, the Bank discovered that the \u201cAdvices\u201d and the \u201cConfirmation\u201d, issued in 1964 and 1965, had been falsified, and that, in fact, she then owned very few shares in the Program, far less than the face of those papers had indicated. After unsuccessful attempts to collect the amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>due, the Bank demanded reimbursement of its losses from USF&amp;G, but the defendant refused payment. It contends that the losses were not insured under the bond because not within any of its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The only issue before us is the liability of USF&amp;G under the bond. The parties are agreed that, if there is liability, the amounts granted below are correct. See footnote 1, <em>supra,. </em>Theoretically, since this is a diversity-of-citizenship case begun by the Florida Bank in a state court and removed to the District Court by the Maryland defendant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there is a conflict-of-laws problem as to whether Florida or Maryland law governs. But neither party has relied on the law of any particular jurisdiction, both have argued as if the question is one of general law, and there do not seem to be any Florida or Maryland cases which are at all close. We shall assume, accordingly, that the law of both of those states accords with the general law, as we find it to be. <em>Cf. </em>Fidelity Trust Co. v. American Surety Co. of New York, 268 F.2d 805, 807 (C.A. 3, 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The Bank invokes two parts of the bond \u2014 clause (D), entitled \u201cForgery or Alteration\u201d, and clause (E), headed \u201cSecurities\u201d. We hold that USF&amp;G is responsible under (E), and it is therefore unnecessary to consider (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Under (E),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the critical question is whether the altered \u201cAdvices\u201d and \u201cConfirmation\u201d fall within the phrase \u201cany securities, documents, or other written instruments\u201d. (It is in effect conceded that, if they are, the other stated conditions of (E) are met.) Two of the three writings are called \u201cDividend Reinvestment Advice\u201d; the other is a \u201cConfirmation of Dividend Reinvested\u201d. These are printed forms, headed by the legend \u201cThe Bank of New York, Custodian for the Dreyfus Investment Program Sponsored by the Dreyfus Corporation\u201d, and containing boxes to be filled in, showing in typing (among other things) the date the dividend was declared, the amount declared or received for the investor, the shares purchased for him, and the total shares then held by him. Attached to each paper are stubs for \u201cnext payments\u201d, if any are due, but in Miss Barnes\u2019 case these stubs showed the account as \u201cfully paid\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">USF&amp;G\u2019s point is that (E) covers only conventional securities (like stocks or bonds) or other documents or instruments which are accepted as in themselves documentary evidence of owner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ship of property \u2014 and that here the papers simply gave information to the investor and were not in themselves intrinsic evidence of her ownership of shares in the Dreyfus Investment Program.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Bank' responds that the general, unqualified terms \u201cdocuments, or other written instruments\u201d plainly have a wide coverage, and in context must at least blanket a written paper indicating or reflecting specific ownership of a security, or of rights of participation in assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Textual arguments can be made for both sides. For USF&amp;G, it is pointed out the clause is entitled \u201cSecurities\u201d, and, in the words of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, this \u201csuggests that clause (E) is dealing with \u2018securities and writings something like securities\u2019 and it speaks against an intention to encompass all writings or all formal writings.\u201d Rockland-Atlas National Bank v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Co., 338 Mass.. 730, 157 N.E.2d 239, 243 (1959). Also, the enumeration of the category of signers whose signatures may be forged can be thought to indicate only a \u201ctrue\u201d - instrument, <em>i. e., </em>a \u201cwriting, made and executed as the expression of some act, contract, or proceeding, as a deed, writ, etc.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Similarly, the words \u201cinstruments\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d are used restrietively in the latter part of (E), dealing with the guaranty or witnessing of signatures, and this tends to show that these terms likewise have a limited meaning in the earlier parts of (E). <em>Ibid. </em>These linguistic contentions are all aids to the claim that the information papers involved here were not \u201cdocuments\u201d or \u201cinstruments\u201d in the sense intended by clause (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">On the other hand, the Bank can say that the provision, by its enumeration, necessarily differentiates among \u201csecurities\u201d, \u201cdocuments\u201d and \u201cother written instruments\u201d, and must therefore cover more than \u201csecurities\u201d themselves; that \u201cdocuments\u201d and \u201cwritten instruments\u201d are very broad words, embracing, in ordinary speech, forms such as those involved there; and that there is nothing on the face of the bond to suggest that these broad words fail to cover, at least, formal writings declaring the ownership of securities or shares (even though these writings do not, in themselves, have \u201clegal efficacy\u201d to pass title).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">If the result is to be determined by these textual considerations alone, there is more to the Bank\u2019s position than USF&amp;G admits. In <em>Rockland-Atlas National Bank, supra, </em>on which appellant relies, recovery was refused where the insured participated in a loan on the strength of a balance sheet purportedly prepared by a certified public accountant from the records of the borrower, but in actuality false and not made by the accountant or with his authority. But that is quite a different case. A balance sheet gives an over-all view and does not ordinarily evidence or declare ownership of specific securities or participation rights. Moreover, it is a reflection of the general state of a business, not a writing \u201cmade and executed as the expression of some act, contract, or proceeding\u201d \u2014 the definition of \u201cinstrument\u201d accepted and used by the Massachusetts court. The writings here differed in both respects. They declared ownership of a specified number of shares in the Dreyfus Investment Program. And they can easily be said to have been written and given to the investor as an expression of the formal and operative act of the custodian (The Bank of New York) in reinvesting the investor\u2019s newly-received dividends in the Program\u2019s shares. Though the writings may have had no \u201clegal efficacy\u201d in and of themselves, they did express and reflect the custodian\u2019s act of purchasing additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>shares, and they did evidence the investor\u2019s ownership of a specific number of shares in the Dreyfus Program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">We think, however, that these textual arguments are not decisive but that the Bank should prevail because of the well settled principle of contract law that, where one party has no real power to affect the terms of the agreement, ambiguities will be interpreted against the drafter. Prudential Insurance Co. of America v. Barnes, 285 F.2d 299, 300 (C.A. 9, 1960); Hoffman v. Illinois National Casualty Co., 159 F.2d 564, 565 (C.A. 7, 1947); WPC Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 323 F.2d 874, 878-877, 163 Ct.Cl. 1, 6 (1963). This is especially true with respect to insurance contracts. <em>See </em>Aschenbrenner v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 292 U.S. 80, 84-85, 54 S.Ct. 590, 78 L.Ed. 1137 (1934). In the instant case there is no intimation in the record that plaintiff had any real freedom of choice or bargaining power to determine the terms of the bond. In fact, the cases cited by both USF&amp;G and the Bank tend to prove the contrary, since the clauses involved in past litigation were identical to those under scrutiny here. Liberty National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Louisville v. National Surety Corp., 330 F.2d 697 (C.A. 8, 1964); Fidelity Trust Co. v. American Surety Co. of New York, 268 F.2d 805 (C.A. 3, 1959); Snyder National Bank v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., 294 F.Supp. 500 (N.D.Tex.1968); First American State Bank v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 25 Wis.2d 190, 130 N.W.2d 824 (1964); Rockland-Atlas Nat\u2019l Bank of Boston v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., <em>supra, </em>338 Mass. 730, 157 N.E.2d 239 (1959) ; Union Banking Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 4 Ohio App.2d 397, 213 N.E.2d 191 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">USF&amp;G contends that the Banker\u2019s Blanket Bond was a joint effort of the Surety Association of America and the American Banker\u2019s Association, but plaintiff points out that there is no evidence that the Bank was a member of that organization. In any event, all that appellant claims is that the Banker\u2019s Association approved the final form of the bond, as revised in 1951. This is not the same as a true joint effort, with negotiation and give-and-take on both sides. Rather, it is like government form-contracts which are submitted for criticism to interested trade associations. Since the Federal Government reserves to itself the final word, the right to comment which has been accorded potential contractors does not prevent these standard forms from being construed against the Government in case of real ambiguity. See WPC Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>323 F.2d 874, 876-877, 163 Ct.Cl. 1, 6 (1963). In view of the obvious fact that a standard form contract was used here (\u201cBanker\u2019s Blanket Bond, Standard Form No. 24\u201d), it is incumbent upon the insurer to bear the burden of showing that the Bank was instrumental in drafting the agreement, or was adequately and actively represented in the negotiations. The record is barren of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">This principle that ambiguities in standard forms should be resolved against the drafter has been applied to clause (E) of this bond. Fidelity Trust Co. v. American Surety Co., 268 F.2d 805, 807 (C.A. 3, 1959); Union Banking Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 4 Ohio App.2d 397, 213 N.E.2d 191, 195-196 (1965); Snyder Nat\u2019l Bank v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., 294 F.Supp. 500, 503 (N.D.Tex.1968); <em>contra, </em>First Nat\u2019l Bank in Wichita v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., U.S.Dist.Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>D.Kansas, No. W-3093, decided September 29, 1965 (unreported).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the canon, the Bank\u2019s reading of \u201cdocuments or other written instruments\u201d in the present context \u2014 a reading which, as we have shown, may well be correct and is certainly reasonable \u2014 must be accepted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">USF&amp;G also contends that plaintiff\u2019s negligence in failing to investigate the authenticity of the advices\u201d should preclude it from recovery. There is no merit in this position. Clause (E) insures against losses suffered through loans or purchases by the insured made \u201cin good faith and in the course of business\u201d. There is no exclusion for an insured\u2019s negligence. Nor is there the slightest indication in the record that the Bank did not act in good faith. Ordinary negligence, without more, does not convert good faith into bad. Citizens Bank of Oregon v. American Ins. Co., 289 F.Supp. 211, 214 (D.Or.1968); First Nat\u2019l Bank of Crandon v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. of Baltimore, 150 Wis. 601, 137 N.W. 742, 745 (1912); <em>cf. </em>Aschenbrenner v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 292 U.S. 80, 86, 54 S.Ct. 590, 593, 78 L.Ed. 1137, 1141 (1934). Had negligence been intended as a good defense to payment for injuries covered by (E), it should have been set out in the agreement. Aschenbrenner v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 292 U.S. 80, 86, 54 S.Ct. 590, 593, 78 L.Ed. 1137, 1141 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-12\">. The, District Court\u2019s memorandum decision rejecting USB&amp;G\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint is reported at 274 F.Supp. 305. Thereafter tlie Bank moved for summary judgment which was granted, and the parties then agreed upon the amount of recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\">.

Appellant distinguishes these advices from the program certificate, originally-put up in 1961 by Miss Barnes as collateral. It is conceded that the certificate itself, if it had been altered or forged, would have been within clause (JD) because, in appellant\u2019s eyes, it was to be treated as if it were a stock certificate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b112-5\">. In Fidelity Trust Co. v. American Surety Co. of New York, 268 F.2d 805 (C:A. 3, 1959), paragraph (E) was held, without discussion, to cover duplicate invoices of the borrower evidencing an account receivable. In Snyder Nat\u2019l Bank v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., 294 F.Supp. 500 (N.D.Tex., 1968), the paper held covered by (E) was a false telegram, allegedly from a brokerage firm, stating that securities of the borrower had been sold and the check sent to the lending bank. Neither of these documents had any \u201clegal efficacy\u201d in and of itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\">. In First American State Bank v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 25 Wis.2d 190, 130 N.W.2d 824, 827 (1964), the Supreme Court of Wisconsin reserved the question whether (E) was intended \u201cto cover only those writings which have legal efficacy\u201d, but in an obvious hint that the matter was hardly free from doubt the opinion commended the problem \u201cto the attention of the draftsmen of the bond.\u201d Rockland-Atlas Nat\u2019l Bank v.
