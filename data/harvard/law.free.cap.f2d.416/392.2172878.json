The Board\u2019s wide discretion lies in the initial promulgation of rules and regulations, while the court exercises its duties in reviewing decisions involving application of the Board\u2019s rules.

Three witnesses testified on behalf of general counsel: one, a challenged voter who stood in front of the voting booth during the election, merely stated that <em>he </em>could not see into the booth so as to determine how any voter cast his ballot;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the other two were concerned only with absolving the union organizer from any election day misconduct in the area of the polling place. The Company\u2019s prima facie case of pre-election threats, sabotage, rumors, and of election day irregularities was largely uncontroverted by General Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The Trial Examiner, however, concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cIt cannot be said that in this case the conduct * * * during the election campaign period was of such an aggravated character as to create a general atmosphere of fear and reprisal rendering a free expression of choice of representatives impossible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">To reach this conclusion on the evidence presented necessitated (1) that the Trial Examiner eliminate from consideration part of the threats and all of the rumors, as well as the supervisor participation, by ruling that the Company failed to show such events occurred during the critical campaign period; (2) that he discount the various election day events, considering each in isolation, as resulting in \u201cbaseless fear\u201d; and (3) that he discredit the testimony of one employee found by the Board to have been threatened on three separate occasions, and thereby find that there was no evidence to establish that fear <em>actually </em>affected any vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The Board adopted, with substantial modifications,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the Trial Examiner. Notwithstanding its findings, the Board concluded that there was no basis for setting aside the election. The rationale underlying the determination was straight-forward:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-12\">\u201cWe are unable to conclude that these circumstances justify the conclusion that the requisite laboratory conditions for the conduct of a free election were not present. <em>Applying the test set forth by the Court, </em>as summarized above, <em>there is no evidence that any of the above factors resulted in subjective reactions which interfered with the vote of any employee other than Stegall, and his ballot could not affect the result.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-13\">\u201cThe Court expressed the view that if the entire atmosphere in which the election was held was tainted, it would be immaterial that the conduct creating that atmosphere-was not directly attributable to the Union. However, it seems apparent to us that the Court\u2019s opinion must be interpreted as dispensing with a showing of responsibility by one of the parties only where the conduct involved is <em>of so serious a nature </em>that it could only result in widespread confusion and fear of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>reprisal which would render impossible a rational, uncoerced choice by employees. <em>Here, the incidents which exceeded permissible bounds were merely the three involving Stegall and the coldroom employees, of which all were very limited in nature and only one was known to two other employees. </em>We do not think that this amount of misconduct was what the Court considered sufficient for the application of the criterion it stated. Accordingly, we adhere, for the reasons stated, to our prior holding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\u201cIn view of the above, we find that there is no basis for setting aside the election in this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Concerning the cumulative facts proved in the instant case and in the light of the \u201claboratory conditions\u201d standard and the express directions contained in our original decision on remand, the Board order is unsupportable on the record considered as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456. The Board, not the Courts, adopted as the measure of election fairness the \u201claboratory conditions\u201d standard and the <em>objective </em>(or inferential) conduct impact appraisal method.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This Court merely noted on remand that <em>subjective </em>evidence <em>may </em>carry the day as well. 379 F.2d at 244. The two evaluation methods are not mutually exclusive. This Court has previously held that, where the Board has \u201cpromulgated\u201d a standard governing conduct under the LMRA,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c(s)uch policies are controlling until the Board announces a change and its reasons for the change.\u201d Delta Drilling Co. v.

The NLRA \u00a7 8(a) (5), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (a) (5), refusal to bargain unfair labor practice case is virtually conceded <em>if </em>the Board\u2019s representation determination is upheld. In order to secure judicial review of the otherwise non-final NLRA \u00a7 9, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159, determination, however, the Company must refuse to bargain with the representative it considers incorrectly certified and then contest the consequent unfair labor practice cease- and-desist final order promulgated under authority of NLRA \u00a7 10, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160. <em>See generally </em>2 CCH Lab.

Seven such challenges were sustained on the basis of ineligibility to vote; 2 were never resolved, never opened, or never tabulated on the Regional Director\u2019s belief that they could not affect the election outcome. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c). However, the Company did not choose to make a ballot challenge case. Rather, it relies on allegations of \u201cspecific evidence of specific events from or about specific people,\u201d NLRB v. Douglas Co. Elect. Membership Corp., 5 Cir. 1966, 358 F.2d 125, 130, claiming that pre-election misconduct by union supporters and election day misconduct by tile union organizer, the union supporters, and the Board agent destroyed the requisite \u201claboratory conditions.\u201d General Shoe Corp., 1948, 77 N.L.R.B. 124, 127. The Regional Director conducted an ex parte administrative investigation, denied the Company objections, and certified the union (Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union, AFL-CIO) as exclusive bargaining agent. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c). The Company\u2019s request for Board review was summarily denied, without decision, on the theory that it raised \u201cno substantial issues warranting review.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.67(c). When the Company refused to bargain, unfair labor practice charges were filed. The Board and its Trial Examiner applied its rule that a representation question previously decided in a \u00a7 9 proceeding may not be relitigated in a subsequent unfair practice \u00a7 10 proceeding. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.67(f) ; <em>see </em>2 CCH Lab. Law Rep. U 3060.84. The election objections, thereupon, were foreclosed from consideration and the findings and cease-and-desist order stemming therefrom were the result of no more than ritualistic adherence to procedural formalities. We reviewed the election objections on the original Company petition for review and cross-petition for enforcement. NLRA \u00a7 10(e), (f), 29 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 160(e), (f). We denied enforcement after observing that \u201c[vjiewed cumulatively, we have no doubt that the employer\u2019s objections charge that the election was conducted in less than the laboratory conditions so often promised by the Board and required by the Courts.\u201d 379 F.2d at 244.

The rationale for such criticism has been concisely summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">\u201cIn evaluating <em>employer </em>conduct the Board has indicated that more stringent restrictions will be applied than in the case of union conduct, reasoning that an employer\u2019s statements to his employees are going to have a greater influence than if those same statements were made by a union because the employer controls future wages and working conditions and could more readily translate his statements into reality. (Citations omitted.) Management anti-union expressions are \u2018uttered in that locus of final authority\u2019 giving them more impact. General Shoe Corp., 97 NLRB 499, 502 (1951).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-11\"><em>See also </em>Samoff, NLRB Elections: Uncertainty or Certainty, 117 U.Pa.L.Rev. 228 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">We find it unnecessary and unwise to pass upon this issue since we review only the Board determination currently before us. It would seem to us, however, that the Board should apply a <em>single </em>standard against which it will measure the campaign conduct of <em>all </em>parties who might have interfered with employee free choice, weighing the conduct of each individual party according to the particular power he might possess. Such a test makes adequate allowance for setting aside an election whether, in a given context, either the employer or the union is the dominant party. Moreover, it permits an election to be set aside where neither is at fault, but where the Board agent or some outside party has interfered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b453-19\">. The Company objected to the following <em>pre-election </em>conduct: (1) participation in initial organizational efforts by a supervisor ; (2) threats to kill or beat two anti-union employees made by named union advocates in the presence of other employees of unknown persuasion; (3) sabotage (sugar in the fuel tank) of the truck driven by one of the two threatened union opponents; and (4) widespread circulation of rumors that a vote against the union would cost an employee his job \u201cif the union went through.\u201d The Company also objected to the following <em>eleetion-day </em>occurrences : (1) election location in the glass-front portion of the building, compared to a \u201cgoldfish bowl\u201d; (2) Board agent conduct in admitting the union organizer to the polling place after voting started, in leaving the polling place with him for several minutes, and in authorizing into the polling area a number of challenged voters who were permitted to await a turn to vote approximately three feet away from and in front of the booth instead of in line; (3) presence outside the polls of employees from another company, who, while on strike, had participated in the Home Town organizational campaign and who, on election day, parked 14 feet from the polls a vehicle with a \u201cvote yes\u201d sign in its window; and (4) electioneering by one of the challenged voters as he stood near the booth (all of the challenged voters were union advocates who had been validly fired, <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra) ; </em>(5) placement of the challenged voters in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>position in front of the booth in such a fashion that some employees feared their ballots would not be or were not secret.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">. Although there was evidence that one of the challenged voters made some sign to an employee who was waiting in the voting line, the substance of his conduct was never proven to constitute \u201celectioneering.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\">. Of course, his testimony does not altogether erase the possibility that one of his contemporaries standing three feet in front of the booth may have been able to see into the booth. Nor does his testimony neutralize the fact that, regardless of whether the challenged union supporters could <em>actually </em>see into the booth, the mere presence of these union adherents in a position potentially threatening ballot secrecy resulted in some apprehension on the part of uncommitted employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b454-15\">. In fact, the \u201cmodifications\u201d amounted to a departure from the Trial Examiner\u2019s findings of fact. The Board substituted its own narration of the facts which, in effect, conceded the validity of the Company allegations of pre-election threats and rumors and substantiated (except for the ballot secrecy objection) the accuracy of the Company\u2019s description of the election-day events. Hence, the findings of the Board virtually acknowledged the truth of the Company\u2019s allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\">. The inferential impact evaluation method was classically illustrated in a recent Board decision setting aside an election on the basis of supervisor contact with a mere 6 out of 730 potentially eligible worker-voters before an election in which the union was rejected by a 382-272 vote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\u201c(T)he restraining effect of coercive conduct is not limited to employees directly involved. Rather, the Board and courts have long recognized that employer interrogation and threats concerning union activity during a pre-election campaign are likely to receive prompt and wide circulation. Therefore, to evaluate properly the probable effect of conduct which is coercive in nature, the number of employees directly involved cannot serve as a determinative factor. The controlling factor here is whether the conduct involved tends to interfere with a free and uncoereed choice by the employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">International Mfg.
