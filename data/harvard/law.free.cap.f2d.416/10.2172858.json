Following exhaustive pre-trial discovery, the parties proceeded to a lengthy trial before the court, during which the judge even visited carbon black plants owned by the respective litigants. The district court held no infringement. Finding no error of law or clear error of fact in the holding, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\"> The legal principles .applicable to this suit are not in serious dispute. A process patent is one concerning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcM\">a mode of treatment of \u25a0 certain materials to produce a certain result. * * * [A process ]; is an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U.S. 780, 788, 24 L.Ed. 139 (1877). Such a patent protects the inventor from anyone\u2019s adopting his process, and, more importantly in our suit, from anyone\u2019s adopting a process that operates in substantially the same manner and under the same physical laws to produce the same result as that of the patented process. Kemart Corp. v. Printing Arts Research Laboratories, Inc., 201 F.2d 624, 629 (9th Cir. 1953). See Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 608, 70 S.Ct. 854, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950). This latter protection is provided by \u201cthe doctrine of equivalence\u201d, Spee-Flo Mfg. Corp. v. Binks Mfg. Co., 264 F.Supp. 542 (S.D.Tex.1967), aff\u2019d mem. 392 F.2d 585 (5 Cir. 1968), and the reason for allowing such protection is obvious. \u201c[T]he range of equivalence to be awarded a patent will depend on the circumstances,\u201d <em>Spee-Flo, supra, </em>at 545 of 264 F.Supp., and Phillips asks in this case that its patent be granted a broad range of equivalents, as it claims the patent is a valuable contribution to the carbon black art. There was evidence that, and the trial court found that Phillips\u2019 patent was \u201cnot a basic or pioneer patent;\u201d the judge therefore properly held that the patent was entitled only to a \u201cfair range of equivalents commensurate with [its] scope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-16\">Phillips was properly faced below with the burden of proving that the accused process is fairly equivalent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the patented process. In meeting that burden, Phillips offered much expert testimony to show the similarity of the two processes. Richardson countered with its own experts who testified to the differences in the processes. The trial court had to resolve the conflicting testimony in order to reach both his factual findings and his conclusion of no infringement. These findings are attacked here by Phillips. In reviewing questions of fact resolved by a district court, this Court must apply the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d test required by Rule 52(a) F.R.Civ.P., and discussed in Chaney v. City of Galveston, 368 F.2d 774, 776 (5th Cir. 1966), which applies as much to patents cases as to any others on appeal in the federal courts. American Seating Co. v. Southeastern Metals Co., 412 F.2d 756, 758 n. 5 (5th Cir. 1969). We now turn to Phillips\u2019 specific allegations of factfinding error.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The Court feels no need to detail all the complicated facts of this case, as was ably done by the court below in his careful and comprehensive opinion. For our purposes, it suffices to say that both the Phillips and Richardson methods for making high-quality carbon black entail the use of a long furnace in which a residue oil or \u201cfeedstock\u201d is burned into carbon black when its comes into contact with a \u201ccombustion mixture\u201d of extremely hot air and gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The district judge found that one of the distinctive characteristics of the Phillips process is the method in which the combustion mixture is injected into the furnace; namely, at an angle with the walls so that a swirling blanket of combustion gas is formed, which adheres to the side of the furnace by centrifugal force. The judge below found that \u201ctangential introduction, swirling movement or helical flow * * are essential steps in the [Phillips] process * * even though the patent claim allegedly violated \u2014 Claim 26\u2014 does not mention a particular method of injecting the combustion gas into the furnace. Although there could have been more evidence on this point, the judge below certainly could have concluded from the evidence that was introduced that tangential injection was a basic part of the Phillips process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *All but two of the patent\u2019s twenty-nine claims, for example, specifically mention tangential injection; moreover, all of Phillips\u2019 furnaces actually use tangential injection and, as the judge below stated, no evidence was introduced showing how the surrounding blanket of gas \u2014 which even Phillips\u2019 engineers admit is critical in the Phillips process \u2014 could be produced without the tangential injection. There was ample evidence that Richardson\u2019s injections were not tangential, spiraling, or helical, but rather were axial, and we cannot say that the judge was clearly erroneous in finding this an important difference between the two processes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Phillips next argues that the district judge erred in finding that there was no \u201cblanketing\u201d (surrounding of the feedstock by the combustion mixture) in Richardson\u2019s process, and since the blanketing of the feedstock by the hot combustion gases is a critical element in the Phillips process patent, Richardson should be found to have infringed. One of Phillips experts, a Dr. Helmers indeed testified that his interpretation of tests run on the Richardson furnace showed a blanketing action in the accused reactor; one of Richardson\u2019s experts, however, a Dr. Lewis, testified that his tests showed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>blanketing in the accused reactor. \u201cWhen there is a marked conflict among expert witnesses, the case is clearly one which calls for the application of Rule 52(a) of the Fed.R.Civ.Proc.\u201d American Seating Co. v. Southeastern Metals Co., 412 F.2d 756, 758 (5th Cir. 1969). We cannot say the district judge was clearly erroneous in finding that there was no blanketing in the Richardson process.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Phillips next complains of the district court\u2019s seizing upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 use of the phrase \u201cdelayed and controlled heating\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to characterize an essential part of the Phillips method of burning the feedstock into carbon black. Although appellant\u2019s counsel seem to fear they have hoisted their client on a petard of their own making, their fear is not justified; for, aside from the doubtful wisdom of this court\u2019s adopting a policy of punishing litigants for the mistakes of their lawyers, the phrase is neutral enough and does seem a felicitous one for describing precisely what happens to the feedstock in the Phillips furnace. Indeed, on the facts the phrase would have had to be coined had it not been supplied. Again, the issue on the record is whether or not to accept the appellant\u2019s or the appellee\u2019s experts\u2019 definitions of \u201cdelayed and controlled heating.\u201d Appellants in their brief admit that the question is simply a matter of degree, and in fact have earlier in the case distinguished the prior art by reference to the \u201crelative\u201d control and delay in heating the feedstock in the Phillips process. We defer to the district judge\u2019s finding that an essential part of Phillips\u2019 process is the delayed and controlled heating of the feedstock, and that Richardson\u2019s process, which uses a relatively instantaneous heating of the feedstock, is fundamentally different.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The last point seriously advanced by Phillips is that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that a choke zone in the Richardson furnace is a third chamber, rather than merely the entrance to the second chamber in a two-chamber reactor like Phillips\u2019 furnace. Phillips correctly states the law that patent infringers \u201cdo not avoid infringement of the method by varying the details of the apparatus by which they make use of it.\u201d Smith v. Snow, 294 U.S. 1, 20, 55 S.Ct. 279, 79 L.Ed. 721 (1935). Was the district judge incorrect, then, in saying that the Richardson choke zone \u201cserves to create the most fundamental difference between the processes in question by its effect on the heating, mixing and flow of the combustion products and feedstock?\u201d While, as the appellant argues, some choking action is undoubtedly involved in the Phillips process, or at least choking is not \u201ctotally inconsistent\u201d with the Phillips process, as the appellee would have us believe, there is ample evidence in the record to support the district judge\u2019s finding that <em>relatively, </em>the choke intensifies the complete mixing of the combustion gases with the feedstock, and whether or not the choke is a third chamber, breaks up the flow of the uniform \u201cblanket\u201d of combustion gas that seems so basic in the Phillips process.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">After a careful re-consideration of the lengthy record in this case we are not left with the impression that the district judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law \u2014 formulated over the six years this case was in the district court \u2014 are clearly erroneous, and we therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-6\">. Indeed there was evidence introduced below which strongly indicates that Phillips added Claim 26 \u2014 the only important claim in their patent which is not limited to tangential injection \u2014 in an unlawful attempt to broaden their claim to the prejudice of persons having intervening rights. 293 F.Supp. at 558 n. 2(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-11\">. The judge below ruled that even if tangential injection were not read into the Phillips process, the differences in the flow, mixing and heating of the feedstock in the two processes establishes no infringement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AIW\">. \u201cIn Phillips\u2019 tentative findings of fact and conclusions of law * * * Phillips proposed the following finding on the question of whether the Iiembert Patent Xo. 2,090,766 anticipated the patent in suit: \u2018 * * Thus this method [Rembert] involves instantaneous heating of the hydrocarbon as distinguished from the <em>delayed and controlled heating and mixing of the method of the patent in unit.\u2019 </em>\u201d 293 F.Supp. at 570 (emphasis on original).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
