Deakyne, a citizen of Pennsylvania, brought this action to recover damages caused by an alleged trespass by appellants, the Commissioners of Lewes, the Board of Public Works and others (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Town), when they caused a sewer line to be installed in 1962 under a roadway which traversed a parcel of land appellee then owned in Lewes. Deakyne claimed that the road was part of her property and that the sewer line interfered with possible commercial exploitation of the property as a marina, resulting in a decrease in its market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-25\">The key issue in this appeal is whether the district court erred in refusing to include in its charge to the jury an instruction on a Delaware stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which appellants now claim to constitute a complete legal defense to the alleged trespass. In order to better comprehend the ultimate basis for the lower court\u2019s refusal to charge on the statute, it is necessary to relate the course of the litigation by reference to the pleadings, the pretrial proceedings, and the trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">I. In paragraph 10 of their answer to the complaint, labeled \u201cAFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE,\u201d appellants asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">10. In or about the year 1937, the aforementioned Anglers Road was constructed by the Commissioners of the Town of Lewes with public funds as and for a public road and the same has been continuously in use as a public road from 1937 to the present and has at all times been maintained through the use of public funds as a public road. Appendix (App.) 7a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The district court recognized that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">While the answer did not expressly mention 17 Del.C. \u00a7 509, its language brought the defense within the terms of the statute. In effect, the answer pleaded the statute. 44 F.R. D. at 426.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">II. The original pretrial order of May 10, 1967, submitted by the parties, contained, <em>inter alia, </em>the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">ISSUES OF LAW TO BE LITIGATED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">1. May a municipality acquire title by adverse possession to a road ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">2. Was Anglers Road subject to an easement in the general public by virtue of a prescriptive right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap3\">(App. 24a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">III. During the pretrial conference conducted the same day, May 10, 1967, the following colloquy took place between the court and counsel for the Town:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-17\">THE COURT: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-18\">The defendant concedes that if plaintiff is right in its contention [\u201cthat as a matter of law a municipality cannot acquire title to land by adverse possession\u201d App. 20a], then the defense of adverse possession must fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-19\">Then I am going to talk about your second theory of defense. We have talked about adverse possession. Now what is your alternate theory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-20\">MR. RAYSOR: Your Honor, it is not really a legal defense by way of justifying the laying of the sewer line. As I say, it goes more to the question of damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-21\">THE COURT: Now, let me stop you here. Then you have simply one defense, and that is adverse possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-22\">MR. RAYSOR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-23\">THE COURT: All right. Put that down. The only defense to liability which the defendant asserts is that of adverse possession. * * * (App. 21a.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-25\">IV. As a result of the pretrial conference, a supplemental pretrial order was entered on the first day of the trial, May 15, 1967, providing, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-26\">I. AS TO THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-27\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-28\">D. The defendants assert title in the Town of Lewes as the only defense and, in spite of the claim of the plaintiff to record legal title, the Board of Public Works bases its right to construct the sewer under the bed of Anglers Road on the theory that when the sewer line was constructed, the Town of Lewes was the owner of Anglers Road where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>line was located by virtue of adverse possession arising from its open, notorious, exclusive and hostile exercise of dominion over the same under a claim of right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">E. The plaintiff asserts that as a matter of law, a municipality cannot acquire title to private land by adverse possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">F. The defendants concede that if a municipality cannot acquire title to private land by adverse possession, then the defense of adverse possession must fall. App. 28a-29a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The supplemental pretrial order stated further, under the caption \u201cAS TO DAMAGES\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">B. The defendants assert that the public acquired an easement over Anglers Road through twenty years uninterrupted use under a claim of right and that this prescriptive right would prevent interference by the plaintiff with Anglers Road under which the sewer line is laid. App. 29a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">V. During the second day of the trial, after the appellee had rested and the Town had begun to present its case, the court called counsel for the parties into conference in chambers when an objection was made to proffered testimony showing the use of public funds to maintain the road. App. 32a. At this conference the trial judge called to the attention of the parties the provisions of 17 Del.C. \u00a7 509,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> relating to the creation of public roads by public user and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">The trial judge indicated he was not certain what significance the statute had but that he thought \u201cit ought to be considered.\u201d Counsel for appellee countered that he was \u201cfamiliar with that act\u201d and that it \u201chas nothing to do with the situation at hand\u201d because it \u201cpertains to dedication, and most of the cases \u2014 I would say all the cases there are cases where a plot plan has been recorded and laid out, and so forth.\u201d (App. 33a-34a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">Counsel for the Town remained silent during this discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">VI. The trial then continued with the presentation of further' evidence by appellants, including testimony by present and former employees of the Town as to the public use and public maintenance of the road, the kind of evidence which would seem to fit the requisite elements of 17 Del.C. \u00a7 509. Appellee\u2019s counsel objected to the testimony, not expressly on the ground that it related to a different theory than adverse possession, but primarily because there was no showing of \u201ccorporate action\u201d on the part of the Town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>authorizing the maintenance of Anglers Road with public funds. (App. 33a, 47a-48a.) The other objection to this line of testimony was the reiteration of appellee\u2019s position that a public body may not constitutionally acquire private property by adverse possession. (App. 48a.) The testimony was admitted over appellee\u2019s objection. (Trial Transcript 257-258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">VII. At the close of the evidence, in the afternoon of May 17, 1967, the trial judge called counsel for the parties into chambers for a conference on the prayers, or instructions, to the jury. The court again queried counsel as to whether 17 Del.C. \u00a7 509 was relevant, and this time the trial judge appeared to take the lead in attempting to convince the parties that the statute was applicable to the facts here. (App. 54a-57a.) Appellee\u2019s counsel again claimed the statute was not applicable, contending that it required an initial dedicar tion, evidently meaning a dedication by the private owner of the land not formally accepted by the public body.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">This time counsel for the Town commented on the Act, replying to the trial judge that he knew of no reason why it should not be applied, and stating further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">I have intended to ask instruction on it, your Honor. I first had to get the evidence of the maintenance at public funds in. (App. 56a.) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATn\">The court then recessed the conference and asked the parties to research the question for later consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">After the conference resumed the same day, the trial judge informed counsel that he would charge on the statute, even setting forth the exact language he proposed to use after giving the text of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">If you find, members of the jury, that the portion of Marsh Road between Market Street and the Anglers Association Restaurant or the Anglers Restaurant has been used and maintained at the public charge for 20 years or more, you may find it to be a common highway. But if you fail to find that such road has been used and maintained at the public charge for 20 years or more, you may not find it to be a public highway. (App. 58a.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Counsel for appellee strenuously reiterated his position that the statute was inapplicable. For the first time, he argued that the Town was interjecting into the case a statutory defense and a new legal theory different from adverse possession. This began to sway the trial court in the opposite direction, because of the sole defense of adverse possession specified in the supplemental pretrial order and the failure of appellants to assert the statute specifically until the end of the trial. Counsel for the Town then proposed that the pleadings be amended to conform to the evidence, explaining that the statute was not pleaded sooner because counsel was not certain until after the entry of the supplemental pretrial order that he had a witness who could testify as to the public maintenance of Anglers Road.5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By the end of the May 17, 1967 conference, the trial judge had decided not to charge the jury on the statute. (App. 58a-71a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">On the following morning, appellants\u2019 counsel made a formal application \u201cto amend the answer to conform to the evidence by pleading the provisions of\u201d 17 Del.C. \u00a7 509. After further discussion between court and counsel, the motion for leave to amend was denied. (App. 72a-77a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">In the charge the court referred only to the principle of adverse possession as the Town\u2019s legal defense. (App. 78a-79a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>VIII. The jury rendered a' verdict for appellee in the amount of $16,000 in compensatory damages and $600 in punitive damages. (App. 80a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">IX. The Town moved for a new trial, claiming that the district court erred in refusing to permit an amendment to the pleadings to conform to the evidence. (App. 81a). The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The court declined to grant a new trial on the ground that the statement in the supplemental pretrial order that the Town\u2019s only defense would be adverse possession \u201cwas tantamount to an abandonment of the statutory defense which defendants had initially pleaded.\u201d 44 F.R.D. at 427.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The district court proceeded to explain that as a result of the Town\u2019s reticence in recognizing the applicability of the Delaware statute until after the end of the trial, coupled with the supplemental pretrial order entered on the first day of the trial, \u201c[i]t is reasonable to conclude, in light of this combination of circumstances, that the defendants relinquished or abandoned their right to plead the defense. * * * \u201d 44 F.R.D. at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">Although we are in sympathy with the lower court\u2019s probable exasperation at the Town counsel\u2019s<footnotemark>7a</footnotemark> belated recognition of the significance of the public road statute, for the reasons hereinafter set forth we believe that in the interest of justice<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the decision should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">Each time the trial judge suggested the applicability of 17 Del.C. \u00a7 509, counsel for appellee stalwartly claimed that the statute did not apply.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>argued that the statute related only to instances where there had been an actual dedication of a road followed by twenty years public user and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We have carefully examined all of the cases cited in support of this proposition by appellee and have made an independent search of the Delaware decisions dealing with the etablishment of public roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We have found no reported case which holds that 17 Del.C. \u00a7 509 applies only where there has been a prior dedication.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Some of the cases referred to by appellee conclude that where there is an attempted dedication not formally accepted by the public authorities, acceptance may be inferred from a specified period of public user. Kelly v. Phillips, 13 Del.Ch. 261, 118 A. 230 (1922); Reinhardt v. Chalfant, 12 Del.Ch. 214, 110 A. 663 (1920), aff\u2019d, 12 Del.Ch. 389, 113 A. 674 (1921). But this does not mean that the <em>statute </em>also requires an unaccepted dedication before its public user and maintenance provisions become operative. In our view the statutory language leads unambiguously to an opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-16\">Implicit in Biggs v. Wolfe, 40 Del.Ch. 212, 178 A.2d 482 (Del.Ch.1962), cited by both parties, is the conclusion that in the absence of dedication, a public road may be established by public user and maintenance under the foregoing statute. The court having determined in <em>Biggs </em>that there was insufficient evidence of the requisite public user, there was no need to go into the question of whether the element of maintenance for twenty years or more was present. 178 A.2d at 484. <em>See also </em>Reinhardt v. Chalfant, <em>supra, </em>110 A. at 666, which held that an earlier version of this statute \u201cdoes not apply to roads created by private dedication.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">As the district court recognized during one of the conferences in chambers, a fair reading of the statute demonstrates that the establishment of a public road by twenty years public user and maintenance is an alternative to the formal laying out of the road by dedication or otherwise and is not a requirement in addition to dedication. (App. 54a-56a.) In other words, under the statute public user and maintenance constitute a substitute for dedication.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Since we have determined that the statute under consideration offered the Town a sufficient legal defense to the charge of trespass, assuming the jury would have been satisfied that the necessary period of public user and public maintenance had been proven, the question remains whether appellants waived their right to resort to the statute by their reliance on adverse possession at pretrial and by their failure to assert the statute until the end of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">Even though paragraph 10 of appellants\u2019 original answer was sufficiently broad to raise the statute as a defense, the apparent abandonment of this defense at pretrial probably made it necessary for the Town, if it wished to resurrect this defense, to seek an amendment to the answer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>We believe that under the liberal policy which characterizes the allowance of amendments under F.R.C.P. 15(b),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the district court should have granted leave to amend here, and that it was error not to do so. It is true, as indicated by the district court in its opinion, 44 F.R.D. at 427, that under the language of the first part of Rule 15 (b) amendments to the pleadings to conform to the evidence may be made, or may be considered to have been made, \u201cwhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties.\u201d The court concluded that this portion of the Rule was inapplicable because counsel for appellee had objected to the testimony of the public maintenance of Anglers Road, although as previously indicated it is not entirely clear that the objection was predicated on the attempt to interject a new issue or theory of defense into the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">At any rate, the second part of Rule 15(b) <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> could have been, and, in our view, should have been invoked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">-* * * if evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be sub-served thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence. 28 U.S.C.A.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Professor Moore has succinctly summarized the purpose, effect and applicable standards of this portion of the Rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">The second portion of Rule 15(b) has to do with the situation that arises where there is objection to the introduction of evidence at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings. The court may permit the pleadings to be amended in its discretion, and amendment is to be freely allowed in order to aid in the presentation of the merits of the controversy, if the opposing party is not <em>actually </em>prejudiced. The party opposing the amendment should not succeed by arguing a technical change in the \u201ccause of action\u201d or \u201cdefense,\u201d since that merely means \u201clegal\u201d and not \u201cactual\u201d surprise. He must show that he would be prejudiced in maintaining his action or defense on the merits by the admission of the evidence. Even if he does show that he is not prepared, and could not have been expected, to meet the evidence offered, the court may still permit the amendment, and grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence. Normally a court should, in such a situation, permit the amendment and grant a continuance where the person seeking the amendment has been, and is, acting in good faith, since the court can assess costs against the party at fault. This done, the amendment is usually in furtherance of justice and therefore required by the rules.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> [Footnotes omitted.] 3 Moore, supra note 12 at j[ 15.14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao9\">We are not persuaded that appellee has shown such prejudice as to warrant a denial to the Town of the right to amend its answer, if such amendment is necessary, or to deny the Town\u2019s belated request for a charge on the statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Counsel for appellee obviously was fully aware of the statute and objected to its introduction into the case mainly on legal grounds. A continuance under Rule 15(b) would have enabled appellee to meet the evidence in support of the elements of 17 Del.C. \u00a7 509 presented by the Town. A new trial will afford appellee the same opportunity to challenge the public user and public maintenance of Anglers Road for the period required under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Appellee is prejudiced, of course, in that she gained a verdict which is now being reversed. But this is not the kind of prejudice contemplated by Rule 15(b).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Prejudice under the rule means undue difficulty in prosecuting a lawsuit as a result of a change of tactics or theories on the part of the other party.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We believe that any prejudice of this nature, even if present here, is minimal and may be readily relieved by the new trial to be afforded to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We should make it clear that we are not deciding that the evidence presented by the Town was sufficient to meet the requirements of 17 Del.C. \u00a7 509. We hold only that since appellants did present testimony to support a statutory defense the district court believed directly relevant, the Town should have been given the opportunity to plead the statute and the jury should have been instructed on its applicability, with proper protection to the rights of appellee to challenge the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">For the reasons heretofore set forth, the decision of the district court will be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-26\">.

Then the lawyers and the judge retired to the latter\u2019s chambers to discuss the matter. The ruling on the record, after they returned, sustained the objection to the testimony. Nothing more appears about an amendment. We think the case one where, if it was deemed necessary to amend, the plaintiffs should have been permitted to do so with a right to the defendant for a continuance if the change in the direction of the development subjected him to unfair surprise. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-20\">More recently, in Niedland v.

In a thoughtful article on Rule 15, Donnici, The Amendment of Pleadings \u2014 -A Study of the Operation of Judicial Discretion in the Federal Courts, 37 S.Cal.L.Rev. 529 (1964), the author concludes \u201cthat the element of delay is pertinent only to the extent that it combines with some extrinsic occurrence which brings about actual and significant prejudice to the opponent. It is the existence of such prejudice, not mere delay, which Federal Rule 15 establishes as a basis for denying the amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547-548. Professor Donnici points to the language of Judge Goodrich in Kerrigan\u2019s Estate v. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc., 199 F.2d 694, 696 (3d Cir. 1952), that \u201c[a]s a practical matter the only reason for not allowing an amendment is prejudice to the opposing party * <em>*</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b356-11\">ALDISERT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ai5\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">When this cause is remanded to the district court for a second trial on the merits, it will be for the sole reason that the trial judge abused his discretion. The trial judge will be hard put to understand where along the line he was guilty of this abuse. And so will I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">The action was an unsophisticated one brought by the plaintiff against the Town of Lewes for trespassing upon her land. The Town answered that it had acquired title to the land by adverse possession or, in the alternative, that no trespass had occurred because its presence on the land was for the purpose of improving the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">At the pre-trial conference, however, the Town clearly indicated that it intended to pursue \u201csimply one defense, and that is adverse possession.\u201d It was in this posture that the issue was joined for trial and evidence received. Notwithstanding this unequivocal election of one defense by the Town, the trial judge twice invited it to re-adopt its alternative line of defense during the trial, solicitously offering his observation that \u201cit ought to be considered.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>On both occasions, however, counsel for the Town remained silent, in direct contrast to the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the relevancy of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Finally, after the close of all the testimony, counsel for the Town announced his intention to \u201cask instruction\u201d on the thrice-rejected improvements defense, making formal application \u201cto amend the answer to conform to the evidence.\u201d The trial judge denied the request, stating in his later opinion denying a new trial that the defendant\u2019s conduct at pretrial and during the trial was \u201ctantamount to an abandonment of the statutory defense which defendants had initially pleaded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">On such a record, I find little room for serious consideration of the Town\u2019s claim that the trial judge abused his discretion. If there was any prejudice to the Town in the trial, it came from its own counsel table and not the bench. And neither this court nor the district court should interfere with the consequences of such a deliberate choice of trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">It is for this reason that I find it unnecessary to accord undue importance to the Town\u2019s strident argument that what will turn this case is whether the statutory law of Delaware was applicable under the testimony adduced at trial. After a scholarly discussion of this subject and the desirability of a liberal application of Federal Rule 15 (b), the majority conclude that \u201cwe are not deciding whether the evidence presented by the Town was sufficient to meet the requirements\u201d of the statute, but only that the statute was relevant, and the \u201cTown should have been given the opportunity to plead\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">There is a short answer to all this. The Town was given the opportunity to plead it. The Town did plead it. The Town then changed its mind, and took its chances throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The sole issue presented to this court is whether the trial judge abused his discretion in refusing to permit the Town to change its mind a second time. I do not consider such action an abuse of discretion. Gallon v. Lloyd-Thomas Co., 264 F.2d 821, 77 A.L.R.2d 417 (8 Cir. 1959); Hall v. National Supply Co., 270 F.2d 379 (5 Cir. 1959); Wilkins v.
