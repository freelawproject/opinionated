Stout v. Broom, 5th Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-16\">L2] Appellant is presently incarcerated in the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, having been convicted on his plea of guilty to three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1709, theft of mail by a postal employee. He was convicted and sentenced in the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. He has filed a petition for habeas corpus in the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. In this petition appellant alleges denial of due process in that his sentence is indeterminable owing to the confusion of the sentencing court. The district court dismissed the petition, stating that the proper remedy for appellant is a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, filed in the sentencing court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AqiE\">As the district court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-18\">\u201cA motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 is a substitute for writ of habeas corpus providing an exclusive remedy in the sentencing court for any errors occurring at or prior to sentencing, including construction of the sentence itself. United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205 [72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232] (1952); Birchfield v. United States, 296 F.2d 120 (5th Cir. 1961).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-19\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
