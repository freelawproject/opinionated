Eaton v. United States, 348 F.2d 919 (9th Cir. 1965). Section 2255 by its terms provides that \u201c[a] successive motion for similar relief\u201d need not be entertained. See Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-25\">However, his claim of inadequate representation due to counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>failure to subpoena an important witness has not yet been squarely met on the merits. See Eaton v. United States, 384 F.2d 235 (9th Cir. 1967). In his present motion he has, in our view, finally alleged facts warranting a hearing on this claim. The fact that his trial counsel requested the return of the subpoena unexecuted is not conclusive on this issue since his counsel\u2019s loyalty and competence have been placed in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
