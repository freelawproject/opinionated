Thus, it was wrong to be represented on the merits by one attorney for both. The district court found no conflict. No real conflict is suggested here, only speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">Appellant has presented this conflict of interest point to the California courts, but has never done so in a proper manner as required by state procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-19\">We therefore affirm on the ground that there has been no proper exhaustion of state remedies.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
