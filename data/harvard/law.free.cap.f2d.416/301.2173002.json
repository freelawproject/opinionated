Putnam, Judge, of appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss for improper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-20\">June 25, 1965, appellee executed a $463,000 note, payable to bearer, in monthly instalments. The note was secured by a real mortgage on appellee\u2019s apartment house in Lafayette, Louisiana. February 27, 1967, appellee filed this action against appellant in the District Court, alleging that the interest rate charged upon the loan was usurious and requesting judgment ordering appellant to refund all interest paid and declaring all future interest payments uncollectible. Initially, the action was dismissed for improper venue, the Court holding that, since the action was transitory, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 94<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> required that appellant, a national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>bank, be sued only in the county where it was \u201cestablished\u201d or \u201clocated,\u201d that is, Nassau County, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">With leave of Court, appellee filed an amended complaint. Therein appellee prayed that the mortgage note and the mortgage itself \u201c * * * be cancelled and erased from the public records of Lafayette Parish.\u201d In the alternative, appellee prayed that the mortgage and mortgage note be ordered reformed, to delete any encumbrance upon the immovable property with regard to the allegedly usurious interest charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Thereafter appellant renewed its motion to dismiss, for improper venue. Reversing its earlier action, the Court denied the motion, holding that the amended complaint stated a local action, making venue proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following the District Court\u2019s certification of the presence of a \u201c * * * controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion * * \u25a0* \u201d, etc., it issued its order for an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). A panel of this Court thereafter granted appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Under its well settled construction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 94<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires that a national bank, such as appellant here, must be sued upon a transitory action where it is \u201cestablished\u201d or is \u201clocated.\u201d As noted, however, in Casey v. Adams the Court held that the statute had no application to a local action. As the Court pointed out in <em>Casey, </em>\u201cLocal actions are in the nature of suits <em>in rem, </em>and are to be prosecuted where the thing on which they are founded is situated.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The sole issue here, then, is whether appellee, after amending its complaint as described, stated a local, rather than a transitory, action. Believing as we do, that the action here, at least in great measure, is a local one, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Appellant places its greatest reliance upon Michigan National Bank v. Robertson, <em>supra. </em>There the respondent had purchased house trailers in Nebraska, executing and delivering notes and lien instruments to a local dealer, who in turn negotiated them to petitioner, a national bank located in Michigan. Thereafter, that respondent had sued that petitioner in Nebraska State Court, alleging violation of the Nebraska Installment Loan Act, and challenging the validity of the documents involved in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">Urging application of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 94, the petitioner there contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the venue of the Court was improper; but the Nebraska Court rejected this contention, one of the reasons given being that the action was local rather than transitory.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the judgments. In answer to the argument that the local action exception, as carved out by <em>Casey, </em>was applicable, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-18\">\u201c * * * The applicable Nebraska venue statute on its face allows suit in more than one county and, in the case of foreign corporations such as petitioner, Nebraska Revised Statute \u00a7 25 \u2014 408 appears to permit suit in any county' where the defendant can be found. By its very nature, this is a considerably different kind of suit from the one to determine interests in property at its situs which was involved in Casey v. Adams. * * * \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">As we appreciate the applicable Louisiana venue statute, the action here could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>be brought in only one place, namely, the Parish where the mortgaged real property was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Article 80 of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure establishes mandatory venue for \u201can action to assert an interest in immovable property, or a right in, to, or against immovable property.\u201d Such an action \u201cshall be brought in the parish where the immovable property is situated.\u201d While we are able to find no Louisiana decisions directly in point,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we have little doubt that the action here, which by virtue of the amended complaint, seeks in major part to have a mortgage on immovable property in part \u201ccancelled and erased from the public records of Lafayette Parish,\u201d and seeks to have \u201cthe mortgage * * * ordered reformed,\u201d is an action \u201cto assert an interest in immovable property, or a right in, to, or against immovable property\u201d; hence, the action could be brought in but one Parish, and, in this diversity case, that would be the Lafayette Division of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Moreover, the effect of the remedy sought in <em>Casey </em>and the one claimed here virtually were the same. In <em>Casey, </em>complete cancellation and erasure of secured mortgages on immovable property was sought; here, although the action arose under circumstances not exactly the same as those in <em>Casey, </em>total or partial cancellation, reformation, and erasure of a mortgage on immovable local property is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">In Louisiana, unlike the situation in some commonlaw jurisdictions, 59 C.J.S. Mortgages \u00a7 1(2), where a mortgage is granted upon immovable property, title to the property remains in the mortgagor; and may be taken from him only upon a default on his part as to the terms of the mortgage or note paraphed therewith (identified together by a Notary Public, before whom the act of mortgage is executed) which would justify foreclosure proceedings to be followed by a public sale. La.Civil Code of 1870; Fidelity Credit Company v. Winkle, 251 La. 1, 202 So.2d 280 (1967); Thompson v. Calcasieu Trust <em>&amp; </em>Savings Bank, 140 La. 264, 72 So. 958 (1916); Gates v. Gaither, 46 La.Ann. 286, 15 So. 50 (1894). See gen\u00e9rally La.Code of Civil Procedure, Articles 2631-2754, 3741-3743.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-17\">We are unpersuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that appellee <em>could have </em>sued simply <em>in personam </em>upon the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>lying mortgage note, which would have rendered the action transitory rather than local.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What appellee <em>actually </em>did by its amended complaint, not what it <em>could </em>have done, must control proper characterization of the action. Although it may be said to be \u201cmixed,\u201d under Louisiana law concepts,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> no Solomonic split of the action\u2019s two prime components \u2014 (1) nullifying usury and (2) effecting reformation of the note <em>and </em>mortgage \u2014 can be effected. Each depends upon the other; and one of its primary effects, if appellee ultimately prevails, will be upon the real property subject to the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Nor are we at all shaken in our conclusion by appellant\u2019s argument, in the same vein, that we should look beyond the plain language of appellee\u2019s amended complaint which prays for total or partial cancellation and erasure of the <em>mortgage </em>and reformation of the <em>mortgage, </em>and view this action as one which seeks no more than cancellation of the underlying mortgage <em>note. </em>It is true, as appellant urges, that under Louisiana law, a mortgage is \u201caccessory\u201d to the primary obligation which the mortgage note evidences.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus when the \u201cprincipal debt is extinguished, the mortgage disappears with it.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But this does not mean that when a part of the primary obligation is extinguished, the mortgage vanishes from the public records affecting immovable property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nor does it mean that a mortgage-debtor cannot sue to cancel or reform a mortgage note and concurrently, as is the case here, to cancel and erase from the public records the mortgage in whole or in part. The two components of this action, so interwoven as they are, literally are inextricable from one another, and appellee\u2019s real rights under local law, as asserted here, are governed by Louisiana\u2019s procedural rules, which in this sense are both procedural and substantive, <em>i. e., </em>the procedural aspects involved are an essential part of appellee\u2019s substantive rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>For the reasons given, therefore, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"Art\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-13\">. \u201cActions and proceedings against any association under this chapter may be had in any district or Territorial court of the United States held within the district in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u25a0which such association may be established, or in any State, county, or municipal court in the county or city in which said association is located having jurisdiction in similar cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Casey v.

Looking, as we must, to tlie law of the forum state, see 1 Moore Federal Practice, \u00a7 0.142 [2.-1], at pp. 1455 et seq., particularly at p. 1461, fn. 40, we note that in Louisiana, a mortgage on immovable property is a \u201creal right.\u201d Article 3282, La.Civil Code of 1870 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cArt. 3282. The mortgage is a real right on the property bound for discharge of the obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201cIt is in its nature indivisible and prevails over all the immovables subject to it, and over each and every portion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">\u201cIt follows them into whatever hands they pass.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">See also Landry v. Hawkins, 156 So.2d 795 (La.App.1st Cir. 1934). And an action for enforcement or reformation of a mortgage clearly is a <em>real </em>action, which is entirely local, not transitory, in nature. See generally, Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, Title II, Real Actions. See also Yiannopoulos, Civil Law of Property, \u00a7 141 (1966), at pp. 428, 429:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">\u201cIn addition to the remedies available to the owner of immovable property or holder of an immovable real right under the nominate real actions of the Code of Civil Procedure, relief is also available under numerous innominate actions based on the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, or the jurisprudence of the courts. * * * Under the Code of Civil Procedure the owner of immovable property and the holder of immovable real rights have at their disposal the remedies of sequestration, declaratory judgment, and injunction. * * * Finally, ownership and real rights on immovables may be adjudicated in a number of nonstatutory \u2018fringe\u2019 or \u2018quasi-real\u2019 actions, such as the action of trespass, <em>the action, to remove a cloud from title, </em>and the action of specific performance.\u201d Footnotes omitted.

An analogous situation is found in Mire v. Sunray DX Oil Company, 285 F.Supp. 885 (W.D.La.1968), (a decision remanding that case to the State Court, from which no review was sought), wherein the same District Judge whose decision is under review here, considered the nature of the rights of a mineral lessee. There, after carefully analyzing the Louisiana jurisprudential rules and Codal Articles, as interpreted by the Louisiana Supreme Court, he concluded that rights obtained by a mineral lessee are incorporeal <em>real </em>rights, conferring upon the lessee rights <em>upon </em>the land, but not rights m the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-21\">While Beutke v. American Securities Co., 132 Cal.App.2d 354, 282 P.2d 201 (1955) and Vaughan v.

However, in Casey v. Adams, 102 U.S. 66, 26 L.Ed. 52 (1880), the Supreme Court fashioned an exception to this general provision for \u201clocal\u201d actions. This exception was not created, however, for the purpose of undermining an explicit congressional mandate with the vagaries of state property law. Rather, as a practical matter, if the relief sought were such that only a court with jurisdiction over the res could grant it, and if Section 94 placed venue elsewhere, no federal court would be able to adjudicate an <em>in rem </em>claim against a national bank. Bruns, Nordeman &amp; Co. v. American National Bank &amp; Trust Co., 2 Cir., 1968, 394 F.2d 300, 304 (Friendly, J.). The considerations which underlay Casey v. Adams, supra, are not present here. Appellee seeks only to alter the nature of his contractual relationship with appellant, and not to alter the nature of the cloud on its title. Obviously, the relief sought involves real property, and, indeed, ultimately it will affect real property, but this is not the test for determining whether the action is local or transitory. The relief sought is not <em>in rem, </em>it is not in the property itself, and hence a federal court in New York, where the bank is established, could grant appellee relief without having jurisdiction over the res. Michigan National Bank v. Robertson, 372 U.S. 591, 83 S.Ct. 914, 9 L.Ed.2d 961 (1963). See generally 1 Moore, Federal Practice 0.142[2-1], pp. 1455, 1456 (2 ed. 1964). Under these circumstances, I would hold that this action is transitory and governed by Section 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The Louisiana Civil Code of 1870 makes it clear that a mortgage is an \u201caccessorial right\u201d to the loan note which is the primary evidence of indebtedness. Louisiana Civil Code Articles 1771, 3284, 3285. Thus an action to reform the terms of the underlying debt is a personal action and not one to place or remove an encumbrance on the real property itself. Cf. West v. Lehmer, 115 La. 213, 38 So. 969 (1905).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">I would reverse the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">. I entertain some doubt as to the propriety of applying state rather than federal law to the issue of whether an action of this kind against a national bank is transitory or local. 1 Moore, Federal Practice If 0.142 [2.-1], p. 1462 (2 ed. 1964).
