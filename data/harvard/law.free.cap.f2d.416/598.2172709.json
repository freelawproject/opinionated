The district court rendered summary judgment for Blazon Mobile Homes Corporation based on depositions, affidavits, answers to interrogatories, responses to requests for admission and exhibits. From this judgment, Blazon appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Blazon, Inc., an Ohio corporation, was organized in 1946 and since that time had manufactured and sold children\u2019s play and sport equipment including gymnasium sets and pools. In 1959 plaintiff also began to produce lawn 'furniture, including lawn swings and patio benches. The prices of its products to the retailer range from 410 to $45.95. The products were distributed and sold through various organizations including Montgomery Ward; J. C. Penney &amp; Co.; Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.; Western Auto Stores; Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.; and B. F. Goodrich Stores. Its products are also exhibited and sold at various national and regional toy and houseware shows. Advertising is done exclusively through its own catalogue.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Blazon registered its trademark in 1954 and its mark was classified in the Patent Office Trademark Class 22 (\u201cGames, Toys and Sporting Goods\u201d). Plaintiff also uses twenty-nine other trademarks to identify its products. Among these is Blazonite, which is used to identify galvanized steel sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Blazon Mobile Homes, located in Elk-hart, Indiana, was incorporated in 1964. The shareholders claim that the word \u201cBlazon\u201d was chosen after a word search through the family dictionary. From its inception Blazon Mobile Homes has not manufactured or sold a single mobile home. Rather, the business has been limited to the manufacture and sale of travel trailers and pick-up campers. The price range of these products is from $970 to $2,645. The trailers are sold exclusively through dealers, none of whom sell items similar to those manufactured by plaintiff-appellant Blazon. Mobile Homes displays and sells its products at mobile home shows held in Elk-hart, Indiana, and Cleveland, Ohio, and its advertising is done in national magazines dealing with mobile homes and campers.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">\u201cBlazon\u201d is a word found in most dictionaries having reference to a shield or coat of arms. As applied to the products here involved, it is not descriptive, or suggestive of the characteristic of the product, nor is it a coined word. Rather, \u201cBlazon\u201d falls into the arbitrary category. Cf. Tisch Hotels, Inc. v. Americana Inn, Inc., 350 F.2d 609, 611 (7th Cir. 1965). We do not think as contended by appellants that the word \u201cBlazon\u201d is stronger than the usual arbitrary mark. The trial court properly held that there is no evidence that any so-called secondary meaning has attached to plaintiff\u2019s \u201cBlazon\u201d trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The Lanham Trademark Act test of infringement is whether \u201csuch use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. * * * \u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1) (a). If the same trademark is used in an unrelated field, there is no likelihood of confusion. Fleischmann Distilling Co. v. Maier Brewing Company, 314 F.2d 149 (9th Cir. 1963). In Westward Coach Manufacturing Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 388 F.2d 627 (7th Cir. 1968), the court was presented with a question of infringement under the Indiana Trade-Mark Act, Ind.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 66-142 (Burns\u2019 1961 Repl.) which adopts a test similar to that in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1) (a) and found, unlike the matter before us, that though there was a common market for users and dealers for the automotive and trailer industries with the use of the mark \u201cMustang\u201d, there was no likelihood of confusion concerning the \u201cMustang\u201d automobile. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>court in California Fruit Growers Exchange v. Sunkist Baking Co., 166 F.2d 971 (7th Cir. 1947), in considering the term \u201cSunkist\u201d as applied to bread and citrus fruits, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">Unless \u201cSunkist\u201d covers everything edible under the sun, we cannot believe that anyone whose I.Q. is high enough to be regarded by the law would ever be confused or would be likely to be confused in the purchase of a loaf of bread branded as \u201cSunkist\u201d because someone else sold fruits and vegetables under that name. The purchaser is buying bread, not a name. If the plaintiffs sold bread under the name \u201cSunkist,\u201d that would present a different question; but the plaintiffs do not, and there is no finding that the plaintiffs ever applied the word \u201cSunkist\u201d to bakery products. 166 F.2d at 973-974.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We agree with the district court that there is no likelihood of confusion between the products of Blazon and those of Blazon Mobile Homes. The market for children\u2019s toys and sport equipment is completely separate from that of trailers and campers. Even the expansion by Blazon, Inc. into patio furniture for adults does not create an overlap in markets. Further, methods of distribution and the respective prices of the products negate any conclusion of confusion as to the source of the products. Each is known in its product area, and we cannot conclude that the trademark \u201cBlazon\u201d covers everything in the recreational area. Cf. California Fruit Growers Exchange v. Sunkist Baking Co., 166 F.2d 971 (7th Cir. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Appellant claims that there is evidence of actual confusion since a representative of Sears Roebuck inquired of an officer of Blazon at a cocktail party regarding Blazon\u2019s trailers. Sears does not sell trailers and the employee admitted that his interest in trailers was a personal one. We agree with the district court that this evidence, alone, does not show confusion resulting from the use of \u201cBlazon\u201d by both companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Plaintiff also contends the district court improperly relied on differences in the channels of distribution since the plaintiff could also market its products through trade magazines and dealerships. Plaintiff has not chosen to adopt these other channels of distribution and we will not speculate as to the result if it did. Rather it is our conclusion that children\u2019s play equipment and trailers and campers are two separate product markets and the use of \u201cBlazon\u201d in both markets is not likely to cause confusion. There are other companies in other fields who use the word \u201cBlazon\u201d in their title and their use of \u201cBlazon\u201d no more than its use by the defendant here contributes to any confusion as to the source of the products.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Blazon has charged Mobile Homes with unfair competition under Indiana law. The Indiana Statute, Ind. Ann.Stat. \u00a7 66-142 (Burns\u2019 1961 Repl.), which embodies the case law on unfair competition is similar to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 (1) (a). Westward Coach Manufacturing Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 388 F.2d 627 (7th Cir. 1968). For the reasons set forth above as to the lack of violation of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act, we do not think that it was unfair competition to use the word \u201cBlazon\u201d to sell mobile homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
