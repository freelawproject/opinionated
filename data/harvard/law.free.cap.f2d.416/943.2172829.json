The following year this litigation was settled when the parties exchanged paid-up, royalty free licenses for the disputed external standardization feature which is used in connection with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The spectrometer is a device that measures infinitesimal radiations from particles; the external standardization feature calibrates the spectrometer to a known standard. Both licenses recited that they were \u201cpersonal,\u201d and contained limitations on their assignability and transferability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">A brief statement of the events which followed is in order. After the settlement, in April 1965, defendant Dero Research and Development Corp. (Dero) began purchasing all of the outstanding ANS stock, which it finally acquired by December. At the same time it \u201cingested\u201d ANS (whose name was changed to Ansitron, Inc. in December 1965), moved all its furniture, fixtures, and inventory to Dero\u2019s plant, and treated it on its books as though it were a division or subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">In January 1966, Dero and Ansitron entered into an exclusive distributorship, sales, and service agreement with the Picker X-Ray Corporation (Picker), under which Picker distributed the entire product line of spectrometers. In April 1967, Dero filed a certificate of dissolution for Ansitron with the Connecticut Secretary of State and later commenced negotiations with Picker for the sale of the entire Ansitron brand spectrometer product line, including the disputed patent license. The following April Dero formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Ansitron, Inc., a Connecticut corporation (Ansitron II).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-17\">In November 1968, Packard began this suit to enjoin Ansitron, Dero, and Ansitron II from either continuing to use the patent, or transferring it to anyone else. The substance of Packard\u2019s claim is that the license it granted ANS in 1965 was personal, and could be assigned or transferred only once. It contends also, that ANS and its successors have through their corporate changes either allowed the license to lapse, or are in any case forbidden by the terms of the license to sell it to Picker or anyone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>else. To prevent that sale, Packard sought and obtained the preliminary injunction from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Judge Zavatt construed the relevant paragraph of the licensing agreement set out in footnote 1 to be \u201cclear and unambiguous.\u201d He also held that it limited the license to one transfer or assignment, and that this assignment had in effect taken place when ANS was merged into Dero. Relying on his finding of no ambiguity, he stated he would refuse to consider parol evidence introduced by the defendants to explain the understanding of the parties with respect to the disputed paragraph. It is of interest, however, that he clearly relied on some parol evidence submitted by ANS to show that \u201can acquisition of ANS was being contemplated by some unknown third party\u201d at the time that the negotiations for the license agreement were under way. The court therefore relied on parol evidence to support the interpretation urged by Packard, but rejected it for a different interpretation. Since we cannot agree that the licensing agreement was unambiguous, we believe the parol .evidence offered by ANS should have been received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">The rules guiding an appellate court in its review of a preliminary injunction are clear and therefore a brief recital is all that is necessary here. A preliminary injunction will be overturned only if the trial court abused its discretion. See United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953); Societe Comptoir de L'Industrie, etc., Inc. v. Alexander\u2019s Department Store, Inc., 299 F.2d 33, 1 A.L.R.3d 752 (2d Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">The decision to grant or to deny a preliminary injunction depends in part on a flexible interplay between the likelihood of irreparable harm to the movant and the court\u2019s belief that there is a \u201creasonable certainty\u201d that the movant will succeed on the merits at a final hearing. Unicon Management Corp. v. Koppers Management Co., 366 F.2d 199 (2d Cir.1966). While our reading of the disputed paragraph might render Packard\u2019s ultimate victory at trial somewhat less certain than Judge Zavatt believed, it does not disturb the district judge\u2019s finding that Packard was in danger of suffering irreparable harm if the proposed sale of the patent license was consummated. Accordingly, given the present posture of this case, we believe the interests of the parties and the efficient administration of justice will be best served by permitting the preliminary injunction to stand on condition that Dero is granted a preference for an immediate trial on the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a) (2), authorizing the advancement of the case for trial and the admissibility of certain evidence introduced at the preliminary hearing, on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">In sum, the grant of the preliminary injunction is affirmed with instructions to the District Court to grant a preference and an early trial on the injunction issues.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">.

We recognize that Dero may be unable to prepare its counterclaims in time for the expedited trial. It may receive a separate trial on these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
