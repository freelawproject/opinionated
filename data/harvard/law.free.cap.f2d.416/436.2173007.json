On various asserted grounds they removed the action to the district court, and obtained leave to proceed in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. They did not file the removal bond required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(d) to secure the \u201ccosts and disbursements incurred by reason of the removal proceedings should it be determined that the case was not removable or was improperly removed.\u201d Appellee moved to remand because of this failure. The court, holding that appellants were not relieved of the obligation to file the bond, ordered them to post it. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">At the threshold we must consider our jurisdiction. An interlocutory order is not normally appealable. We</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">consider this order to post a bond, however, to be within the rule of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 1949, 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">The question, which appears to be a matter of first impression, is what security for costs are within the waiver<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> effected by the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no merit in the suggestion that costs means only charges due to the clerk of court as distinguished from those collectible by the other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">Secondly, whatever the word \u201cdisbursements\u201d in section 1446(d) may mean; it is to be distinguished from ordinary costs in degree, and not in kind, and still refers only to recoverable expenses of litigation. We find it within the scope of the word \u201ccosts\u201d in section 1915(a). We would be reluctant to extend the waiver of section 1915(a) to situations, such as the issuance of a preliminary injunction, in which security is required to protect a party against damages as well as costs. See F.R.Civ.P. 65(c). Such a waiver might even raise issues of due process. But that is not this case. There is no constitutional right to reimbursement for'expenses of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-18\">Nor do we feel that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the waiver provision in section 1915(a) and the unqualified language of section 1446(d). The seeming purpose of section 1915(a) is to waive in one stroke what would otherwise be obligations, rather than insert a separate exception in each provision imposing them. <em>Compare </em>28 U.S.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>C. \u00a7\u00a7 1917, 1921, which, like \u00a7 1446(d), do not expressly except litigants proceeding in forma pauperis. If there could be any doubt about this, it cannot withstand the weight of the principle that justice is not to be denied because of the litigant\u2019s poverty.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Finally, we disagree with appellee\u2019s contention that appellants have not established sufficient indigency to proceed in forma pauperis. The court\u2019s contrary conclusion was warranted by its factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The order of the District Court is reversed and the action remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-12\">. Had there been a final order of remand, such orders, too, are normally unappealable. One of the grounds given for removal, however, comes within the exception provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). We agree with appellants that jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the court\u2019s ruling on the bond, even should it be construed as equivalent to a remand where, as here, appellants were without funds to comply, does not require us to examine the sufficiency of these grounds, whatever may be our doubts on that score.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-19\">.
