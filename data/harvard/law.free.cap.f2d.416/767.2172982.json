ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b824-23\">A lone gunman entered, a dry cleaning establishment shortly before its 7:00 p. m. closing time on February 3, 1966, and ordered a female employee to \u201chand over the money.\u201d The employee showed him a half-opened cash register drawer and stated that it contained no money. The lady manager of the business,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the only other person in the premises, was summoned from a back room, and she likewise denied that there was any <em>money </em>on hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Not to be deterred, the gunman escorted the two women into the back room and again told the manager to \u201cget the money,\u201d whereupon the day\u2019s receipts were turned over to him. Acceding to his further demands, the women handed him a dollar each from their respective purses, which had been placed on a table nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">At this point, the gunman produced cord from his pocket, tied the manager\u2019s hands behind her back, and secured her in a bathroom. He then raped the employee, confined both women in the bathroom, and left. The captives eventually extricated themselves, and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">About 9:30 that evening, the raped employee was given physical and gynecological examinations at a hospital. The physical examination disclosed no external bruises or evidence of trauma, and so was inconclusive as to recent sexual activity. The gynecological examination, however, was positive on that score; smear tests disclosed intact sperm.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Shortly thereafter, appellant was arrested and identified as the robber-rapist by the employee and the manager.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tried in the District Court on an indictment in one count of rape<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and two counts of robbery,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a jury rejecting his claim of alibi<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> found him guilty on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">On this appeal, appellant attributes error to (1) the admission into evidence of slides containing the smears; (2) his impeachment, after giving testimony in his own behalf, by use of a prior conviction; and (3) certain statements by Government counsel in closing argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After careful study of the record in its bearing upon these contentions, we conclude that the conviction should stand affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">The examinations of the raped employee were conducted by Dr. Marlene Nelson Kelly at the District of Columbia General Hospital. In the course of the gynecological examination, smears from the vaginal vault and cervix were taken on slides, on each of which Dr. Kelly had scratched the patient\u2019s name and her own. The slides were then turned over to a nurse, who took them to the hospital\u2019s laboratory for further examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">On the next morning, Dr. Benjamin Turla, a pathologist, conducted the laboratory examination and, over appellant\u2019s objection, testified that one of the slides contained intact sperm- taken from the cervix. Subsequent to- the laboratory procedures, Dr. Kelly also performed a sperm test, and she was permitted to testify that she found intact sperm in secretions from the vagina. The slides themselves, also objected to, were admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-16\">The crux of appellant\u2019s objections was that the Government\u2019s evidence failed to identify the slides that were examined as the slides upon which the smears had been placed, and fell short of establishing a chain of continuous custody and control of the slides from the time they were made until they were examined. Appellant relies heavily on Novak v. District of Columbia,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where we reversed a conviction of driving an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>automobile under the influence of intoxicating liquor which had been predicated upon laboratory analyses of the accused\u2019s urine revealing a high alcoholic content. A police officer had testified that at the time of the arrest the accused furnished him a urine sample, and that he then put the accused\u2019s name and his own initials on the bottle containing the sample and delivered it to the District\u2019s Department of Health. At the trial, a laboratory report of the Health Department and testimony of a Health Department chemist established the analyses, and the fact that both of them had been made of urine samples taken from a bottle labeled with the accused\u2019s name, but the bottle was never identified or offered in evidence. We held that the report and the testimony were inadmissible. Since it had never been shown that the analyses were made from the urine sample taken from the accused, we held that \u201c[t]here is missing a necessary link in the chain of identification,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> fatal to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Were there no other pertinent considerations, we would conclude that the <em>Novak </em>rule was adequately satisfied here. For purposes of his examination, Dr. Turla identified the slides by the markings Dr. Kelly had placed on them, and at the trial both he and Dr. Kelly identified the slides by those markings. As we have stated, the markings contained the names of the examining physician and the patient, and Dr. Kelly testified that she marked no other slides with those two names. Thus the possibility that other \u25a0 slides may have borne the same combination of names was statistically remote indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">Moreover, Dr. Kelly had possession of the slides until she gave them to a nurse to carry to the hospital laboratory, and the slides were kept in the laboratory from then until they were examined. At most unaccounted for was the period when the nurse had them in transit from Dr. Kelly to the laboratory, and we do not think that calling the nurse as a witness was essential to the showing the government was required to make.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The normal presumption that individuals entrusted with grave responsibilities discharge them with care<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cshould apply a fortiori to doctors and nurses, whose professional training and traditions teach them to be meticulous.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The record is bare of any indication that the nurse mishandled or tampered with the slides. The <em>Novak </em>rule demands that the possibilities of misidentification and adulteration be eliminated, not absolutely, but as a matter of reasonable probability,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the evidence complies with that standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Subsequent to our <em>Novak </em>decision, we pointed out in Wheeler v. United States<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that evidence introducible under the Federal Business Records Act<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> satisfies <em>Novak </em>requirements. The Act provides that \u201cany writing or record * * * made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence or event\u201d becomes admissible as evidence thereof \u201cif made in regular course of any business, and if it was the regular course of such business to make such memorandum or record\u201d contemporaneously with or within a reasonable time after the event recorded.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It further specifies that \u201c[a] 11 other circumstances of the making of such writing or record, including lack of personal knowledge by the entrant or maker, may * * * affect its weight, but * * * shall not affect its admissibility.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\"><em>Wheeler </em>parallels in striking fashion the case at bar. There an examination was conducted in a hospital of an alleged rape victim to determine whether there had been an act of intercourse. Smears were placed on slides scratch-marked to identify both the examining physician and the patient, and were transmitted to the hospital\u2019s laboratory for testing. At Wheeler\u2019s trial, the examining physician and a laboratory bacteriologist so associated the slides by their markings so as to leave \u201cno doubt that these slides were made and kept in the regular course of business and that it was the hospital\u2019s regular course of business to make them.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We held that the slides, and testimony as to the laboratory findings upon their examination, were properly let into evidence, and that other circumstances went only to the weight to be ascribed to them. We distinguished <em>Novak </em>on the ground \u201cthat the specimen there was not taken in the business of the laboratory involved. Instead it was taken by an outside agency, the police, and only thereafter delivered to the laboratory.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-17\">Appellant seeks, however, to avoid that consequence here by urging that while the evidence establishes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the slides were made in the course of the hospital\u2019s regular business it does not show that it was the regular course of the hospital\u2019s business to make such slides. Appellant is undoubtedly correct in his insistence that each of these conditions is prerequisite to admissibility,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but the evidence establishes that both obtained here. As the Supreme Court has said, the essential determination on admissibility is to be made \u201c[according to] the character of the records and their earmarks of reliability * * <em>* </em>acquired from their source and origin and the nature of their compilation.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-4\">\u25a0There is good reason to treat a hospital record entry as trustworthy. [Footnote omitted]. Human life will often depend on the accuracy of the entry, and it is reasonable to presume that a hospital is staffed with personnel who competently perform their day-today tasks. To this extent at least, hospital records are deserving of a presumption of accuracy even more than other types of business entries.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">In this case, Dr. Kelly testified that she had made about ten examinations similar to that conducted here during the rather limited period of her connection with the hospital. Dr. Turla answered affirmatively the prosecutor\u2019s questions as to whether markings of the examining physician\u2019s and patient\u2019s names on slides in such cases are \u201cplaced there <em>normally </em>by hospital personnel in the ordinary course of hospital business.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, in response to the trial judge\u2019s question as to whether there was \u201can established procedure\u201d when another physician conducts the examination and prepares the slides, he also testified that \u201cas soon as the specimen is received in the laboratory, the specimen itself is checked for identification on the patient, the names of the doctors and we enter that in our books,\u201d and that thereafter the laboratory examination is made. While the testimony was not as clear-cut as it could have been, we think that it showed adequately, not only that the slides in question were made and analyzed in the regular course of hospital operations, but also that it was a part of the hospital\u2019s regular business to make and analyze such slides. We hold that the slides were properly admitted into evidence and that the weight to be attached to them was a matter for the jury.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Two defense witnesses gave testimony which if believed by the jury would have established that appellant could not have committed the offenses charged. A lady friend said that he was in her company on the date in question from about 5:55 p. m. onward, including the period from approximately 7:15 to nearly 11:00 p. m. in a movie. A male acquaintance stated that he saw appellant in the theater at about 7:35 that evening.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>After these witnesses had testified, defense counsel advised the court that a decision had to be made as to whether appellant should also testify. Invoking Luck v. United States,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> he requested a ruling as to whether if appellant did testify the Government would be allowed to impeach him on the basis of prior criminal conviction. It then developed that in 1953 appellant was twice convicted of robbery and given consecutive sentences totaling six to nineteen years, from which he was paroled in 1964. The prosecuting attorney, alluding to the fact that appellant had already presented alibi witnesses, argued that the Government should be permitted to use the convictions for impeachment if appellant decided to add his own testimony to what had gone before. The trial judge ruled that the Government could devote one of the convictions to that purpose, which the Government did when appellant later testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">So, once again,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we are confronted with a contention of error in the treatment of a <em>Luck </em>request, but it is satisfactorily answered by our prior decisions. \u201cConvictions for crime,\u201d we have said, \u201cretain statutorily some degree of relevance to trustworthiness which <em>Luck </em>does not automatically dispel.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> What <em>Luck </em>taught was that Congress \u201cleft some room for the play of judicial discretion over the unfolding circumstances of the immediate trial,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and thereby \u201cendowed the trial judge with a new resource of flexibility in conducting the search for truth.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The trial judge\u2019s function, we have explained, is to weigh the probative contributions that impeachment might make on issues of credibility against the ever-present risk of prejudice to the accused on the issue of guilt,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and to exercise discretion according to how the cause of truth would seem to be better served.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And that discretionary exercise, we have equally emphasized, is to be \u201caccorded a respect appropriately reflective of the inescapable remoteness of appellate review.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">In Gordon v. United States,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> we announced guidelines to assist trial judges in making <em>Luck </em>determinations. Although the case at bar was tried before <em>Gordon </em>was decided, the trial judge\u2019s ruling comports well with <em>Gordon </em>criteria.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The conviction used for appellant\u2019s impeachment was for robbery, an offense involving stealing \u2014 \u201cconduct,\u201d we said in <em>Gordon, </em>\u201cwhich reflects adversely on a man\u2019s honesty and integrity.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The age of the conviction, about 14 years when appellant testified, presents no problem of remoteness in <em>Gordon </em>terms, for appellant, having been incarcerated until late 1964 \u2014 15 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>befare the instant crimes \u2014 could hardly be said to have led the \u201clegally blameless life\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> which might dissipate the relevance of a past conviction. And although the impeachment here was by a conviction of robbery, the offense charged in two of the counts on which appellant was being tried, the trial judge, by limiting the impeachment to but one of the two prior robbery convictions, exercised a discretion in harmony with a suggestion that <em>Gordon </em>was later to make. That suggestion was \u201cto limit the impeachment by way of a similar crime to a single conviction and then only when the circumstances indicate strong reasons for disclosure, and where the conviction directly relates to veracity.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The <em>Gordon </em>criteria are, as we have indicated, just guidelines, and not unbending rules inexorably determinative of the problem as to whether and to what extent impeachment should be permitted. Judicial discretion, in an endeavor to enable the jury to get at the truth, is the soul of any satisfactory resolution. Here the critical inquiry was on credibility, as between the Government\u2019s two identification witnesses and appellant\u2019s two alibi witnesses <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u2014 a situation wherein \u201cthere was a greater, not less, compelling reason for exploring all avenues which would shed light on which of the * * * witnesses was to be believed.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> It was quite evident, when the <em>Luck </em>request was advanced, that appellant\u2019s testimony would be calculated to support the alibi already related by his witnesses,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and as events turned out his own testimony did not add any significant details to those the jury had already been given. All circumstances considered, we think the trial judge was at liberty to determine that \u201cwith credibility so vital, the cause of truth was not likely to be advanced by permitting appellant to testify to events already delineated to the jury if facts germane to the reliability of that testimony were suppressed.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">Finally, appellant contends that certain remarks by Government counsel addressed to the jury during his summation were improper and prejudicial. We have examined the challenged statements and find that none warrants upsetting appellant\u2019s conviction, and that only one requires extended comment<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>When appellant took the witness stand in his own behalf, he recited from a prepared list the names of eight persons, other than those who had already testified, who allegedly saw him at the theater on the evening in question. Yet, although these eight individuals allegedly possessed information crucial to appellant\u2019s cause, none was called to verify his alibi. The prosecuting attorney, in summation, argued that from this failure an inference might reasonably be drawn that their testimony would not have favored the alibi. No instruction in this regard was incorporated into the court\u2019s charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">An adverse inference is permitted from the failure of the accused to call witnesses \u201cpeculiarly within [his] power to produce\u201d when their \u201ctestimony would elucidate the transaction.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Here the record indicates that both the claimed existence of the eight witnesses and their identity remained undisclosed until appellant testified late in the trial. Thus they were distinctively defense witnesses in the sense that the Government was unaware of them and, if indeed witnesses to the alibi, their testimony would have enlightened the jury considerably. But their availability as witnesses at the trial was not explored, and the record leaves this aspect of the matter unclear. We do not know whether, as to any or all of the eight missing witnesses, appellant knew their whereabouts or whether they were otherwise amenable to subpoena.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">The prosecutor\u2019s comment was obviously improper with respect to any of the eight witnesses whom appellant might have been powerless to produce at the trial.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> But the comment was not objected to, and ordinarily we do not entertain challenges to the propriety of argument to the jury that are first raised on appeal<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The wisdom of that practice becomes evident in this case, since if objection had been made appellant\u2019s ability to procure the witnesses might then have been explored. We note also that appellant never gave so much as a hint as to why none of the eight witnesses was produced. We think the mathematical probabilities are that all eight of the witnesses would hardly have been unprodueible, with the very likely result that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was at least partly if not substantially accurate. In these circumstances, we do not find plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">We think, however, that for the future when counsel, either for the prosecution or the defense, intends to argue to the jury for an inference to be derived from the absence of a witness, an advance ruling from the trial court should be sought and obtained.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We think, too, that if such argument is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>be permitted, an appropriate instruction should be given defining for the jury the conditions under which the inference might be properly drawn. Only by such a practice can the risk of vitiating the entire trial by improper argument be avoided, and can the jury be informed sufficiently to enable it to intelligently discharge its function in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-24\">.

The Court there concluded that the statutory term \u201cregular course of business\u201d refers essentially to \u201cthe inherent nature of the business in question and in the methods systematically employed for the conduct of the business as a business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 63 S.Ct. at 481. Regularity alone was declared to be an improper test of admissibility; the test is the \u201ccharacter of the records and their earmarks of reliability * * * acquired from their source and origin and the nature of their compilation.\u201d Thus, admission is extended only to those records that are \u201creflections of the day to day operations of a business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113-114, 63 S.Ct. at 480.

As we have observed, <em>supra </em>note 6, appellant urges that, in view of his showing on alibi, the evidence was legally insufficient to support the conviction. One of the alibi witnesses was appellant\u2019s girl friend, the other apparently a friend, and their association of the movie episode with the offense date was not airtight. Appellant\u2019s third witness did not see him until long after the offenses had been completed, and appellant\u2019s own aibi testimony was impeached.
