L. Robertson and Associates Plumbing, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cRobertson\u201d), a non union contractor. In October of that year, Robertson, under contract with Babcock Builders, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cBabcock\u201d), began to install plumbing in the so-called D. P. D. Corporation building in Coral Gables, Florida. Sometime in mid-October the Union instructed one Henry LeBold to go to the job site in question and there await the arrival of Robertson employees. Le-Bold was further instructed that upon commencement of work by these same employees he was to set up a picket line publishing the Union\u2019s grievances with Robertson. From October 19 to October 28 LeBold sat patiently in his automobile awaiting these tradesmen and, upon ascertaining their presence on the job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>site on October 28, he hoisted his sign<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and began to picket. The picketing continued throughout the week (including Saturday but excluding Sunday) and into the following week. Simultaneous with and for some time preceding LeBold\u2019s activity, the bargaining representative for Babcock\u2019s laborers had been picketing the same job site. However, on November 2, 1966, that union reached an accord with Babcock and work in those related trades proceeded. That same day representatives from Babcock (its president) and Robertson (its president) and a local attorney met with the purpose of resolving the problem of petitioner\u2019s picket line. There it was \u201cdetermined that the thing to do was to ask (Robertson) not work (sic) during working hours. * * * It seemed like * * * a good logical thing to do, so (they) proceeded with it. * * * as a procedure of trying to keep (Robertson) employed and (its) contract operating but not shutting down (Babcock\u2019s) job.\u201d (J.A. 61.) It was further decided at this meeting that Robertson was to work only after 4:30 in the afternoon on weekdays and during the daytime on weekends. It was also resolved that in the event of continued picketing, Babcock was to discharge Robertson and employ a union contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">On the afternoon of November 2, Babcock called a Mr. Kaplan (Union\u2019s attorney) and related to him the fact that Robertson\u2019s employees would not, thereafter, be on the job site during the hours of 8:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. on weekdays and therefore requested Kaplan to discontinue picketing during those hours. In that conversation Kaplan ascertained that Robertson would work evenings and on weekends and, discovering this, notified Babcock that this conduct amounted to sporadic and intermittent working conditions and the Union would remain firm in its intention to picket during the regular work hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">At 4:12 P.M. Robertson sent a telegram to the Union\u2019s business manager, Mr. Long, notifying him of the planned absence of the plumbers during the regular daytime hours (J.A. 106). The following morning, at 11:06 A.M., the Union\u2019s representative replied by telegram disclaiming any bad faith and reasserting its intention to continue picketing during \u201cnormal\u201d work hours because the picketing was \u201cinformational only.\u201d (J.A. 106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">Earlier that same morning the Union had resumed picketing the job site despite the absence of Robertson employees and in the face of a statement by Babcock to LeBold \u201cthat there were no plumbers on the job.\u201d (J.A. 68.) Babcock, upon the refusal of the Union representative to cease his picketing, attempted to contact Mr. Kaplan and being unsuccessful in that regard talked again to Mr. Long. In that conversation Babcock asked the question, \u201cWhat would happen on that job if another plumbing contractor got the job ? \u201d In reply Long noted: \u201cWe would not picket H. L. Robertson.\u201d (J.A. 100.) Shortly thereafter Babcock terminated the contract with Robertson and then the Union excused LeBold because, in the words of a Union representative, \u201cit\u2019s all settled.\u201d (J.A. 80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">Robertson filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Regional Director of the Twelfth Region of the Board. The Regional Director refused, however, to issue a complaint. This determination was subsequently reversed by the Board\u2019s Office of Appeals and on February 9, 1967, a complaint was issued against the Union charging violation of Sections 8 (b) (4)(i) and (ii)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(b) (4) (i) and (ii)(B) (1964).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>hearing was had before the trial examiner who made findings of fact, conclusions of law and a recommended order suggesting that the Union cease and desist its unfair labor practices and take certain affirmative steps to implement the order. These findings and conclusions were upheld by the Board and on May 10, 1968, that body adopted the trial examiner\u2019s order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Union filed a petition to review in this court and the Board filed a cross-petition for enforcement of its order. We enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\">In order to uphold the Board\u2019s ruling in this case, this court must look thereto for a review of the conduct complained of in light of the controlling statute (appendix) and prior case law interpreting its meaning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We must then analyze its decision and inquire whether the result finds substantial evidence in the record for support. If it does\u2014 our task is at an end for the scope of our review in these cases is compressed, limited to discovering if there is a rational basis for the decision and full compliance with the law. Where these exist, this court will not and cannot substitute its judgment for the agency\u2019s. <em>See </em>Administrative Procedure Act \u00a7 10(e), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (E) (Supp. Ill, 1965-67); Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America v. NLRB, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 275, 371 F.2d 740 (1966) ; International Union UAW v. NLRB, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 196, 392 F.2d 801 (1967); Braniff Airways, Inc. v. CAB, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 399, 379 F.2d 453 (1967); American Federation of Musicians v. FCC, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 74, 356 F.2d 827 (1966). We find such support in the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">The Board was confronted here with making a determination as to whether the petitioner\u2019s activity in picketing the job site at a time when no employees of the primary employer were engaged in their \u201cnormal business\u201d amounted to lawful \u201cprimary picketing\u201d or whether it more realistically involved secondary objectives thereby becoming unlawful. The difficulty in making such definitional distinctions has been the subject of numerous legal articles<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but it has been generally held that primary picketing is that activity designed \u201cat applying economic pressure by halting the day-to-day operations of the struck employer,\u201d United Steelworkers of America AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 376 U.S. 492, 499, 84 S.Ct. 899, 11 L.Ed.2d 863 (1964), and thereby attaining an enhanced bargaining position with that employer. On the other hand the \u201cgravamen of a secondary boycott is that its sanctions bear, not upon the employer who alone is a party to the dispute, but upon some third party who has no concern in it. Its aim is to compel him to stop business with the employer in the hope that this will induce the employer to give in to his employees\u2019 demands.\u201d IBEW Local 501 v. NLRB, 181 F.2d 34, 37 (2d Cir. 1950). In other words \u201cit is unlawful for a labor organization to induce employees of a neutral employer to strike or for a labor organization to pressure a neutral employer where the object of the union is to force such employer to. cease doing business with another employer * * Sheet Metal Workers International Association, Local 223 AFL-CIO v. Atlas Sheet Metal Company of Jacksonville, 384 F.2d 101, 105 (5th Cir. 1967). It is a comparatively easy task, under these cases, to determine that conduct amounts to secondary boycotting where, for example, strikers leave the premises of the struck employer to journey across the city to take up their signs at the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>of their employer\u2019s principal customer. However, where the employer and the customer occupy the same job situs, as in most construction contract cases, an added difficulty arises. Is the picketing of the job situs primary or secondary? With the hope of resolving this question, the Board, in 1950, sought to implement the caveat-like language of the statute <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by outlining certain criteria it would use in determining whether the picketing of the premises of the secondary employer, where both he and the primary employer occupy the same job situs, was primary in nature and therefore lawful. The Board held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-4\">the picketing of the premises of the secondary employer is primary if it meets the following conditions: (a) The picketing is strictly limited to times when the <em>situs </em>of dispute is located on the secondary employer\u2019s premises; (b) at the time of the picketing the primary employer is engaged in its normal business at the <em>situs; </em>(c) the picketing is limited to places reasonably close to the location of the <em>situs; </em>and (d) the picketing discloses clearly that the dispute is with the primary employer. (Citations omitted.) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">These so-called <em>Moore Dry Dock </em>criteria have been approved by a number of the circuits as well as by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>Local 761, International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers v. NLRB (General Electric), 366 U.S. 667, 679, 81 S.Ct. 1285, 6 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961), and cases cited therein. The Court in <em>General Electric </em>noted that the \u201capplication of the <em>Dry Dock </em>tests to limit the picketing effects to the employees of the employer against whom the dispute is directed carries out the \u2018dual congressional objectives of preserving the right of labor organizations to bring pressure to bear on offending employers in primary labor disputes and of shielding unoffending employers and others from pressures in controversies not their own.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 679, 81 S.Ct. at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">In the instant case the Union argues that it complied with the <em>Dry Dock </em>rules. It urges that requirement (b) of <em>Dry Dock; </em>namely, that at the time of the picketing the primary employer must be engaged in its normal business at the situs, does not necessarily mean that the presence or absence of employees of the primary is critical to the determination of whether he is engaged in his \u201cnormal business\u201d at the situs. If it does, argues the Union, then it is within the power of the employer to force the picketing employees into a violation of <em>Dry Dock </em>by removing his employees from the job. The Union cites this court to our earlier decision in Seafarers International Union, etc. v. NLRB (Salt Dome), 105 U.S.App.D.C. 211, 265 F.2d 585 (1959), as support for its position. However, this court, while answering, in the negative, the question of whether an employer can transform a picket line from a legal one to an illegal one merely by removing his non-supervisory employees, took pains in the following paragraph to note that we did \u201cnot intend * * * to make a ruling broader than the case before us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590. Since that case is clearly distinguishable, factually,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>at bar we do not feel constrained to interpret our holding there as being dis-positive of the issues here. We do not mechanically apply the <em>Dry Dock </em>standards for we realize that across the board application of any set of standards tends, in the long run, to freeze substance into the mold of form. On the other hand, we do feel that the totality of the circumstance and conduct of the parties must be tested in the light of these standards so that proper determination of the legal consequences may be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">While an \u201cemployer may not, by removing all his employees from the situs of the strike, bar the union from publicizing its cause * * * \u201d (citation omitted). <em>General Electric, supra </em>at 680, 81 S.Ct. 1285, by the same token (and in the same case) the employer could, by the use of separate gates for the purposes of ingress to and egress from the job site, lawfully force the union to picket only those \u201cseparate gates.\u201d We perceive no real distinction between \u201cseparate gates\u201d and \u201cseparate hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">The question of whether the primary employer is engaged in his \u201cnormal business\u201d at the situs is clearly one of factual analysis after a careful review of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here the record supports the findings of the trial examiner that Robertson was to cease his \u201cnormal business\u201d of plumbing contracting during regular work hours of <em>general </em>contracting. He, thereafter, was to resume his \u201cnormal business\u201d at nights and on weekends. These new hours were certainly not conventional, but the fact remains that \u201cnormal business\u201d would be conducted during those new hours. These changes in plans were communicated to the Union, but the Union continued to picket even though Robertson was not about his \u201cnormal business.\u201d This activity was clearly a substantial departure from the standards of <em>Moore Dry Dock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">However, the Union argues in the alternative that since a legitimate object of picketing is publication of the Union\u2019s dispute, the presence or absence of primary employees on the job is of no consequence, and also, even assuming a violation of <em>Moore Dry Dock </em>standards of \u201cnormal business,\u201d the Union\u2019s activity must be upheld on the ground that the Union had no unlawful objective or intent when it picketed the D. P. D. building construction site. The argument makes the distinction between <em>object </em>and <em>effect </em>by urging that if picketing of the primary has only a collateral effect of pressuring the secondary employer then, since Congress most certainly expressed its desire to permit lawful picketing, such an effect is merely an unfortunate concomitant of lawful <em>picketing </em>for \u201chowever severe the impact of primary activity on neutral employers, it [is] not thereby transformed into activity with a secondary objective.\u201d <em>National Woodwork Manufacturers Association, supra </em>note 4, at 627, 87 S.Ct. at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">We have little problem with the argument that the Union had a legitimate object in publicizing its dispute \u2014 a legitimate object of picketing <em>is </em>publication as a means of communicating a grievance, <em>see </em>Milk Wagon Drivers Union of Chicago, Local 753 v. Meadowmoor Dairies, 312 U.S. 287, 61 S.Ct. 552, 85 L.Ed 836 (1941); NLRB v. Local 3, IBEW, 317 F.2d 193 (2d Cir. 1963); Dunn v. Retail Clerks International Association, 307 F.2d 285 (6th Cir. 1962); Centralia Building and <em>Construction </em>Trades Council v. NLRB, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 363 F.2d 699 (1966); NLRB v. Local 3, IBEW, 339 F.2d 600 (2d Cir. 1964). However, publicizing a dispute cannot, in and of itself, render unfair and unlawful labor practices lawful and fair in the face of <em>Moore Dry Dock </em>and the legion of cases there in accord. In our view where there is a substantial departure from the <em>Dry Dock </em>standards, while not amounting to a <em>per se </em>violation of the statute, does at least give rise to a presumption that the Union is acting without the comfort of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>statutory protection. Add to this basic presumption the fact that the Union was on actual notice of the planned change in work scheduling, that it subsequently failed, in the face of such notice, to cease picketing the secondary employer\u2019s premises, and only stopped picketing upon ascertaining that \u201call [was] settled,\u201d we are left with the realization that we cannot say that the Board\u2019s determination was either without substantial evidence in the record or unsupported by the case law. Accordingly we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">One last note with respect to the full application of the Board\u2019s order. We notice that the trial examiner\u2019s suggested order, which was adopted by the Board with slight modification, called upon the Union to not only cease and desist from forcing Babcock into severing his ties with Robertson but also sought to extend that prohibition with respect to \u201cany other secondary employer.\u201d Such an attempted extension of the Board\u2019s power is inconsistent with the several holdings of this court in that regard. <em>See, </em>for example, Local 636, United Ass\u2019n of Journeymen &amp; Apprentices of Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Ind., etc. v. NLRB, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 24, 278 F.2d 858 (1960), and cases cited therein.
