Wood with directions to make recommendation for conclusions of law under the order of reference and Rule 99(c) [since September 1, 1969, Rule 166(c)]. The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on June 24, 1969, wherein such facts as are necessary to the opinion are set forth. Neither party filed a request for review of the commissioner\u2019s opinion, report and recommendations, pursuant to the provisions of Rules 99(c) and 55(b) (3) [since September 1, 1969, Rules 166(c) and 54 (b) (3)] within the time allowed for such filing under the rules of the court. On August 4, 1969, plaintiff filed a motion that the commissioner\u2019s report be adopted by the court without oral argument and on August 8, 1969, defendant filed a response thereto, also requesting adoption of the commissioner\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-15\">The case has been submitted to the court without oral argument and since the court agrees with the commissioner\u2019s opinion and recommended conclusions of law, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby grants plaintiff\u2019s motion to adopt and adopts the same as the basis for its judgment in this case. Therefore, plaintiff\u2019s motion and defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment are granted in part and denied in part as to plaintiff\u2019s first and second causes of action, in- accordance with the opinion. Further proceedings pertaining thereto will be suspended in this court for a period of ninety (90) days from this date pursuant to Rule 100 [since September 1, 1969, Rule 167] to afford the parties an opportunity to obtain an administrative resolution of the equitable adjustment to which plaintiff is entitled, with the parties to comply with said rule and the General Order of April 1, 1968, implementing it. As to plaintiff\u2019s third cause of action, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied, defendant\u2019s cross-motion is granted and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-16\">OPINION OF COMMISSIONER</p>\n<author id=\"b1403-17\">WOOD, Commissioner:</author>\n<p id=\"b1403-18\">This ease is before the court on cross-motions for summary judgment for review, under Wunderlich Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> standards, of a 1966 decision of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals. ASBCA No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>9866, 66-1 BCA f\u00ed 5307. On a monetary-claim totaling some $703,000, and pertaining to nine separate \u201citems,\u201d the Board awarded plaintiff an \u201cequitable adjustment\u201d of $174,000. In three counts, plaintiff here seeks an additional $520,-705.91.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">The preliminary facts are not in any dispute. On March 1,1962, plaintiff was awarded an Air Force contract for the construction of 300 armed services housing units at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. Plaintiff received notice to proceed on March 19, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">The terrain on which the housing units were to be built sloped downward in a generally southwesterly direction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As designed, the housing units were to be placed on individual level sites or terraces supported and separated by embankments. Proper grading, therefore, required both cutting (principally in the north and on the upper sides of the streets) and filling (in the south and on the lower sides of the streets).</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">It was contemplated at the outset that additional fill material, over and above the earth available from the housing site area itself, would be required. Plaintiff and one of its subcontractors (C.M.C. Construction Company) estimated a deficiency of about 24,000 cubic yards, and a subcontract was written on that basis (with a provision for more fill, if required, to be \u201cpaid for at the rate of $1.50 per cubic yard, in place and compacted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-7\">After the clearing of the project area, stripping and stockpiling of topsoil, to a depth of up to 6 inches, commenced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The project area contained some 45,000 cubic yards of such topsoil. During April and early May 1962, C.M.C. was required to remove and store an additional 15,000 cubic yards of \u201ctopsoil.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This required the replacement of the removed \u201ctopsoil\u201d with 15,000 cubic yards of fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-16\">\u201cThe grading operation was first the .cutting of broad sweeps of uniform grade along the lines of houses as they should be constructed, moving the cut material generally to the area where fill was required. The terraces and embankments were then formed and then came excavations for footings, basements and crawl spaces. At the same time borrow material was introduced into the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-17\">In August 1962, the contracting officer decided that plaintiff was contractually obligated to strip 6 inches of surface soil from all lawn areas in the project site, and to replace this surface material with topsoil.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff appealed this decision, and, in 1964, the Board found that plaintiff was entitled to \u201can equitable adjustment of the contract * * * price * * * \u201d for stripping of surface soil the contracting officer, but not the contract, had required,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and also to \u201can equitable adjustment for covering the lawn areas with topsoil * * <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ASBCA No. 8554, 1964 BCA f 4045.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-21\">On remand, the contracting officer, under \u201cmore specific direction of a superior,\u201d made a decision that plaintiff was entitled to an equitable adjustment of $109,599 for the \u201cchange.\u201d Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>timely appealed this decision,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with results indicated generally above, and specifically hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-4\">The Board concluded that in August 1962 the contracting officer had \u201cimposed [on plaintiff] a <em>neiv </em>requirement to strip 6 inches of surface material from all lawn areas and replace it with topsoil,\u201d and that plaintiff \u201cwas completely justified, in the period prior to August 1962, in moving into the area sufficient fill to balance its earth requirements.\u201d' The \u201cpertinent question,\u201d the Board stated, \u201cis to what extent the area had been brought to proper elevation at that time and properly graded.\u201d On this factual problem, the Board found that \u201cin August 1962 some approximation of correct elevation had been attained over substantially the entire area although there was an excess of dirt and grading had not accurately been established.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">\u201cThe six inch stripping for topsoil [required by the contracting officer\u2019s August 1962 decision] commenced in the fall of 1962 and continued into 1963. During the period of this work there was also generated excess dirt from high elevations, the smaller excavations above-mentioned [for sidewalks, curbs, gutters and the cutting of drainage patterns], an accumulation from basements, the readjustment of slopes, an accumulation from utilities installation and spillage. In a word all of the cutting and hauling [of dirt] was not attributable to the change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-7\">The Board\u2019s ultimate disposition of the matter necessitates discussion of plaintiff\u2019s several claims, and of the Board\u2019s action on them, at this point. Before the Board, plaintiff sought, for nine \u201citems,\u201d $550,565.65. To the latter sum plaintiff added, \u201csuccessively and cumulatively, a 15% overhead, a 10% profit and 1% for a bond premium which in themselves are agreed to be appropriate additive percentages,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> thus arriving at a total claim of $703,430.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-8\">The Board characterized plaintiff\u2019s separate items as falling into two categories, and considered them accordingly. In the first category<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> were grouped these items:</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-9\">\n<em>Item Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AdQ\">1. Cost of removing and storing 15,000 \u201cextra\u201d cubic yards of topsoil....................($11,250)..</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">and replacing it with fill material .... ($22,500).. $ 33,750.00</p>\n<p id=\"ArN\">2A. Estimated cost of piling excess dirt removed from lawn areas to make room for topsoil (performed by subcontractor) ............................... <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 14,720.00</p>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">2B. Labor costs of piling excess dirt.................. 17,594.88</p>\n<p id=\"Aha\">2C. Equipment costs of piling excess dirt.............. 68,026.37</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">3. Spreading of topsoil ............................ 53,128.00</p>\n<p id=\"AMo\">Total <footnotemark>13</footnotemark>$187,219.25</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>The Board found that plaintiff was entitled to the $11,250 claimed for removing and storing 15,000 \u201cextra\u201d cubic yards of topsoil,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and to \u201ca reasonable price\u201d for replacing this removed topsoil with \u201cother fill material\u201d (item 1). The Board concluded that $1.50 per cubic yard for the fill material<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cis a proper pricing base to be used here but it should be adjusted for such noncompaction as was required (where the topsoil had been removed from cut areas) and for the inclusion therein of an overhead and profit which are separately to be allowed in this proceeding.\u201d The Board also found that the amount claimed for spreading of topsoil (item 3) should be allowed in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">Item 2 was composed of three elements: item 2A (the estimated cost of piling excess dirt, performed by C.M.C. Construction Company prior to termination of its contract with plaintiff) and items 2B and 2C (plaintiff\u2019s claimed cost of labor and equipment for piling excess dirt).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s unamended claim on item 2 totaled $100,341.25, before adjustments for overhead, profit, and bond premium. The Board found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-5\">For the most part * * * the actual incurred obligations for grading and dirt hauling as represented by these schedules 2B and 2C are not subject to serious question and we do not doubt that a substantial portion is attributable to the six inch removal requirement. We are quite as firm, however, in our belief, and we do find that an indeterminate portion is rightly to be assigned to other dirt moving operations. * * *<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-12\">In discussing the problem of evaluation of these claims, the Board stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-13\">Our principal difficulty is in deciding how much of the sums claimed under Item Nos. 2A, 2B, and 2C are chargeable to the six inch removal over the lawn areas. Except for minor sums which are of no real significance in the context of this case, all the money claimed was expended for dirt handling but an appreciable but indefinite sum represented the costs of handling which was unrelated to the Change and which we have more fully identified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-14\">The possibility of some error in making an evaluation on this record is manifest but we are not thus deterred for it would be patently unjust to deny for that reason payment for the obviously substantial cost of adapting all the lawn areas for the reception of 6 inches of topsoil, whatever may have been the state of grading in August 1962.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-15\">The question of the equitable adjustment due plaintiff under items 1, 2, and 3<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> was resolved by the Board as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-16\">It is our finding and decision that the [plaintiff] should receive an increase in the price of its contract of $174,000 which sum includes an allowance for overhead, profit and bond premium.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-17\">To recapitulate, on items 1 and 3, plaintiff was granted a \u201cgross\u201d equitable adjustment (before any allowance for overhead, profit, and bond premium) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>$86,878, less, on $22,500 of this sum, unspecified downward adjustments for \u201cnon-compaction\u201d and for \u201coverhead and profit.\u201d Translating the Board\u2019s total award of $174,000 into preallowance figures,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> plaintiff was awarded approximately $136,000 for items 1, 2, and 3. Thus, on item 2, plaintiff was awarded approximately $50,000 (before allowance for overhead, profit, and bond premium) on its (unamended) claims totaling $100,-341.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-4\">As its first cause of action, plaintiff asserts that the Board decision is arbitrary, capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence in three respects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-6\">a. in reducing by an undefined amount, the $22,500 claimed, under item 1, for fill material;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-7\">b. in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend its claim under item 2A; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-8\">c. in allowing substantially less than the full amount claimed under item 2.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1407-9\">The Board characterized the balance of plaintiff\u2019s monetary claim as representing \u201calleged additional construction costs occasioned by the changed earth requirements but only indirectly related thereto.\u201d This claim, under several separate items, was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-10\">\n<em>Item Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-11\">4. Damages to utilities by equipment (claimed in be-</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-12\">half of plaintiff\u2019s outside utilities subcontractor) $ 17,604.41 4A.'Damages for delays (in behalf of plaintiff\u2019s outside</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-13\">utilities subcontractor) ...................... 81,233.67</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-14\">5.

The is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>sues thus presented will be discussed seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">PLAINTIFF\u2019S FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">Item 1: Cost of replacing removed topsoil with fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-7\">On this item, for which, in pertinent part, plaintiff claimed $22,500 (plus overhead, profit and bond premium adjustments), the Board found that plaintiff was entitled to a \u201creasonable price\u201d for replacing the \u201cremoved 15,000 cubic yards of topsoil with other fill material,\u201d and that $1.50 per cubic yard was a \u201cproper pricing base.\u201d This figure, however, was \u201cadjusted [downward] for such non-compaction as was required (where the topsoil had been removed from cut areas) and for the inclusion therein of an overhead and profit which are separately to be allowed in this proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">Recognizing that the precise \u201cdownward\u201d adjustments made by the Board are not ascertainable from the administrative record, plaintiff contends that the Board\u2019s failure to grant the full amount claimed (plus the \u201cagreed\u201d allowance for overhead, profit and bond premium) is arbitrary, capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence. Plaintiff asserts (1) that defendant did not even raise \u201cthe issue of non-compaction\u201d before the Board, (2) that any overhead or profit included in the $1.50 per cubic yard price was not plaintiff\u2019s and was not duplicated by an allowance of overhead and profit for plaintiff, and (3) that the Board\u2019s reduction for these factors is therefore improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-9\">In response, defendant urges that the Board, in its \u201cexpertise,\u201d made a reduction in the $1.50 per cubic yard rate \u201cbecause presumably a portion of the additional fill did not have to be compacted,\u201d and that the \u201cpresumption was well taken * * And, defendant says, the Board properly concluded that \u201cin asking for the full subcontract price, plaintiff had included its own profit and overhead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-13\">\n<em>The \u201cnon-compaction\u201d reduction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-14\">The Board\u2019s allusion to \u201csuch non-compaction as was required\u201d is murky. By, this, however, the Board apparently meant that, <em>\u201cpresumably\u201d </em>some of the 15,000 cubic yards of fill did not have to be compacted. This \u201cfinding\u201d if such it be, cannot stand. See Koppers Co. v. United States, 405 F.2d 554, 186 Ct.Cl. 142 (1968); Bell v. United States, 404 F.2d 975, 186 Ct.Cl. 189 (1968).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-15\">Requiring the removal and storage of approximately 15,000 additional cubic yards of topsoil, at a time when plaintiff was faced with an earth deficiency, increased plaintiff\u2019s borrow position by approximately 15,000 additional cubic yards of fill. The record abundantly reflects that the additional fill had to be brought onto the project site <em>and compacted, </em>and is barren of any contradictory evidence. In this state of the administrative record, a downward adjustment, on the ground that \u201cpersumably,\u201d a portion of the fill did not have to be compacted, is \u201carbitrary and unsupported by substantia] evidence.\u201d United Contractors v. United States, 368 F.2d 585, 601-602, 177 Ct.Cl. 151, 172-173 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-16\">\n<em>The overhead and profit reduction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-17\">The Board\u2019s downward adjustment for overhead and profit, \u201cwhich are separately to be allowed in this proceeding,\u201d is also invalid. There is no showing in the administrative record as to the extent, if any, the $1.50 per cubic yard rate included overhead or profit.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>The Board apparently recognized this, for on its face, \u201cpresumably\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> also qualifies \u201coverhead and profit.\u201d Thus, there is nothing by which to measure any diminution, by use of a \u201cprofit and overhead\u201d factor, of the equitable adjustment due plaintiff for fill. <em>Cf. </em>Bruce Constr. Corp. v. United States, 324 F.2d 516, 163 Ct.Cl. 97 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-4\">According to defendant (and this is its sole argument on this point), the Board \u201cproperly concluded\u201d that plaintiff, in claiming a rate of $1.50 per cubic yard, had included its own overhead and profit. Defendant\u2019s argument is neither supported by record citation nor convincing; the Board did not so find, and any such finding, if made, would have been \u201carbitrary and unsupported by any substantial evidence.\u201d See Bell v. United States, <em>supra, </em>404 F.2d at 983, 186 Ct.Cl. at 204. In short, neither the record nor defendant\u2019s argument reflects any proper ground for the Board\u2019s unmeasurable deduction for \u201coverhead and profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Plaintiff is therefore entitled on this item to $22,500 ($1.50 per cubic yard for 15,000 cubic yards of fill), plus, \u201csuccessively and cumulatively,\u201d the percentages for overhead profit, and bond premium agreed to by the parties before the Board as appropriate, less the presently unascertainable amount (including \u201cseparately * * * allowed\u201d overhead and profit) it was awarded therefor. The amount due plaintiff on this item must be determined in further administrative proceedings. United States v. Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, Inc., 384 U.S. 424, 86 S.Ct. 1539, 16 L.Ed.2d 662 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">Item 2: Cost of piling excess dirt.</p>\n<p id=\"A_qX\">Under items 2A, 2B, and 2C, plaintiff claimed a total of $100,341.25, before appropriate allowances for overhead, profit, and bond premium. On findings quoted heretofore, and not here repeated, the Board awarded plaintiff, before adjustment for overhead, profit, and bond premium, approximately $50,000 on item 2.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-12\">Plaintiff asserts generally that the Board\u2019s action is arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by substantial evidence, and particularly that the Board\u2019s decision lacks finality because of (1) a legally erroneous refusal to permit plaintiff to amend its claim under item 2A from $14,720 to $35,000; (2) a refusal to \u201cGive Evidentiary Weight\u201d to an affidavit by the president of C.M.C. Construction Company;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and (3) the establishment of an \u201cinordinately low\u201d equitable adjustment for the cost of piling excess dirt, a \u201cradical reduction\u201d inconsistent with both the evidence before the Board and the Board\u2019s own findings of fact. Defendant controverts each of plaintiff\u2019s arguments, contending in substance that the Board\u2019s award is, under Wunderlich Act standards, entitled to finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s first two claims of error arise from government counsel\u2019s submission to the Board, after the taking of all testimony in the ease, of an affidavit of Mr. David L.

Thus, plaintiff urges, the Board \u201cat the very least should have accepted plaintiff\u2019s figure rather than establishing a price based on no evidence at all.\u201d The latter assumption for the moment aside, the result plaintiff seeks is not a sound one. If evidence is itself of doubtful probative value,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the receipt of other unprobative evidence does not transmute the former into incontrovertible proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-9\">The crucial question, then, is whether the \u201cprice\u201d established for item 2 (including item 2A) is arbitrary, capricious, so grossly erroneous as to imply bad faith, or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-10\"> An \u201cequitable adjustment\u201d of the amount due plaintiff on item 2 involves \u201cmerely * * * inquiries of fact.\u201d United States v.

The Board clearly saw the manifest possibility of \u201csome error in making an evaluation on this record * * Given this record, the result reached was within the zone of reasonableness, and the court\u2019s \u201cimprimatur is one of reasonableness, not rightness.\u201d <em>See </em>Bell v.

Plaintiff also says that \u201cthere was no evidence of negligence in the use of such equipment,\u201d and that the cost of repairing the damage is payable as part of an \u201cequitable adjustment\u201d for the change. Defendant contends, in essence, only that the Board finding that negligent operation accounted for much of the damage to utilities is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">As far as defendant\u2019s argument goes, it is valid. The Board\u2019s finding that negligent operation accounted for <em>much </em>of the damage does have substantial evidentiary support. But, the natural reading of the Board\u2019s language is that the \u201cavailable\u201d equipment \u201cused, in part,\u201d to accomplish the change, even without negligence, caused <em>some </em>damage to utilities. And, there is uncontradicted evidence that the equipment so used did cause some damage to (at least) underground utilities absent any showing of negligence.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Any such damage which was a direct result of the \u201cchange\u201d is compensable. <em>Cf. </em>Paul Hardeman, Inc. v.

The appellant\u2019s case in its behalf is entirely in the testimony of the subcontractor\u2019s officers given in the Federal Court proceedings. In this action the subcontractor did not draw any distinction between work under the changed requirements and the appellant\u2019s other grading operations and made no attempt to attribute its difficulties to the former alone. On the contrary it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>did appear and we specifically find: (1) All commencement delay suffered prior to 7 May 1962 was for reasons unrelated to the changes which are the subject of this appeal. On that day all of the required stripping operations had substantially been completed. (2) Work on the sanitary sewer was substantially completed on 23 July 1962 prior to the time (August) a decision was made on topsoil for the lawn areas. (3) Work on the storm sewer was substantially completed in September 1962 which was prior to the time (October) the changed work was commenced in the lawn areas. (4) Only a relatively minor part of the water and gas distribution system (sprinkler system and 440 of 18,000 feet of gas lines) remained to be installed during the period subsequent to November 1962 when the overhead and management expense is claimed to have been incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-4\">The foregoing findings are not exhaustive but it thereby appears that there is no substantial connection between the costs and the changes and if incurred, they flowed from unrelated circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">These findings were neither challenged directly, nor even mentioned, in plaintiff\u2019s initial brief here. Such an approach does not facilitate the difficult task of deciding cases of this nature, complexity and bulk.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>Jefferson Constr. Co. v.

J. A. Jones Constr. Co. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Koppers Co. v. United States, <em>supra. </em>The Board\u2019s findings have not been shown to be lacking in substantial evidentiary support, and are therefore entitled to finality; the Board\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere is no substantial connection between the costs and the changes and if incurred, they flowed from unrelated circumstances,\u201d has not been shown to be in any way erroneous. Plaintiff is therefore not entitled to recover on this item.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-12\">Item 7: Replacing contaminated gravel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-14\">Plaintiff argues that the Board is \u201cin error\u201d in denying any recovery on this item;<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> that \u201cthe overwhelming bulk\u201d of the contamination was the direct result of the \u201cchange\u201d;<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> that the cost of replacing contaminated gravel is clear; and that the Board\u2019s findings that \u201cthe cost \u2018cannot be ascertained\u2019 \u201d is therefore directly contrary to the evidence. Plaintiff also urges that where Government responsibility for damage is clear, lack of certainty as to the amount of damage does not preclude recovery. J. D. Hedin Constr. Co. v. United States, 347 F.2d 235, 247, 171 Ct.Cl. 70, 86 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the overwhelming bulk of the contamination was the direct result of the change is unfounded. While there is testimony in the record that the gravel would not have become contaminated but for the change, there is also substantial contradictory evidence. Spills as a result of grading, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>traffic unrelated to the change, and the nature of the soil on which the gravel was placed,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> all played a part in the contamination, according to the administrative record. In these circumstances the implicit finding that contamination resulted from several causes, many having no relation to the change, is supported by substantial evidence. Phillips Constr. Co. v. United States, supra; Sternberger v. United States, <em>supra, </em>401 F.2d at 1016-1017, 185 Ct.Cl. at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">The essence of plaintiff\u2019s argument is that <em>all </em>of the cost of rectifying gravel contamination is recoverable. That argument is, for reasons indicated, not a sound one. While plaintiff\u2019s total cost of replacing contaminated gravel is established by the (administrative record, the Board found that the cost of rectifying that amount of contamination resulting from the \u201cchange\u201d \u201ccannot be ascertained.\u201d On this record, that finding deserves finality. Sternberger v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">The ascertainment of damages, or of an equitable adjustment, is not an exact science, and where responsibility for damage <em>is </em>clear, it is not essential that the amount thereof be ascertainable with absolute exactness or mathematical precision: \u201cIt is enough if the evidence adduced is sufficient to enable a court or jury to make a fair and reasonable approximation.\u201d Specialty Assembling &amp; Packing Co. v. United States, 355 F.2d 554, 572, 174 Ct.Cl. 153, 184 (1966); WRB Corp. v.

A. Jones Constr. Co. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Sundstrand Turbo v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Plaintiff has not borne its burden; accordingly, it cannot recover on this item.

The Board noted (and properly) that, under the contract, the \u201chouses had to be clean for inspection to the point of readiness for immediate occupancy.\u201d In denying plaintiff\u2019s claim on this item, the Board stated that \u201cWe perceive that a single cleaning was sufficient for that purpose and if any extra effort was required we are not satisfied it has been measured or was measurable.\u201d Plaintiff asserts that there is undisput\u00e9d testimony \u201cin direct contradiction\u201d to these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-12\">The record discloses that the project site was windy, and that the change required substantial grading and earth moving (although not all of the \u201ccutting and hauling\u201d was attributable to the change). Plaintiff\u2019s witness, Mr. Maxwell, testified that \u201cdust from this earth that was being placed and or removed was continually blowing\u201d ; that \u201con occasions,\u201d or \u201cin cases,\u201d some cleaning operations were performed more than once; that \u201cby the time we got down to the final clean up, we had * * * what we felt was an excessive amount of dirt which had accumulated in these units as a result of continued removal and shifting and placing of soil\u201d; and, in essence, that because of the excessive dirt final cleanup was more costly than it would have been had the \u201csoil * * * been stabilized previously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>Mr. Maxwell also testified that cleanup cost plaintiff approximately $86,000; that during the course of the work the \u201cextra cost of clean up\u201d had not been \u201cseparated,\u201d because \u201cit would be impossible to separate this particular item from the cleanup, over-all cleanup item * * * \u201d; and that he \u201cjust estimated and apportioned this amount as shown on Item No. 8 as what [he] thought as being a fair and reasonable price for this item.\u201d \u201c * * * it was one clean-up operation and it was impossible for [him] to keep this particular item * * * separate from the other regular normal cleanup operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-7\">Mr. Maxwell was unable to explain satisfactorily why more than one cleaning was necessary. He was far from specific as to the extent of recleaning. He indicated that units \u201chad previously been swept and cleaned, not cleaned up as you would clean them up for acceptance by the Air Force but they were cleaned periodically throughout this project * * He made no effort to separate costs of recleaning from extra costs of cleaning attributable to the \u201cexcessive\u201d amount of dirt. It is obvious from his testimony that he attributed all claimed excess cleaning costs to the change. And, his testimony admittedly was no more than an estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-9\">In this state of the record, the Board found that a single cleaning was sufficient to comply with plaintiff\u2019s contractual obligation, and that \u201cif any extra effort was required we are not satisfied that it has been measured or was measurable.\u201d Given this record, it cannot be concluded that the Board\u2019s findings are invalid. Sternberger v. United States, supra; Clack v. United States, 395 F.2d 773, 777, 184 Ct.Cl. 40, 46 (1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-11\">Item 9: \u201cLoss Of Efficiency Caused By Re-Scheduling The Work And Performing It Out-Of-Sequence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1415-12\">On this item, which plaintiff characterized before the Board as \u201closs of efficiency by trades due to the disjointed operation, required because of the requirement to remove 6\" of dirt and replace it with topsoil,\u201d recovery was denied. The Board observed that plaintiff had computed the claim by applying, to total payroll for various operations, a 30 percent for loss of efficiency factor, adding to the product a 16 percent insurance factor. It viewed this proof as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-13\">It is initially to be observed that the use of an estimated percentage of inefficiency unrealistically presupposes an otherwise totally efficient operation and its application to total payroll erroneously assumes that all of the earthwork during this payroll period (1963) was attributable to the changed requirements. Moreover, the 30% estimate was supported by no objective data whatsoever, not even a cost estimate or a subcontractor\u2019s price and may well be insufficient as a matter of law. (Wunderlich Contracting Company, etc., and others v. United States, 351 F.2d 956, 173 Ct.Cl. 180, decided 15 October 1965.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1415-14\">The majority of the Board went on to say that, \u201cAside from the grave doubts raised by this lack of proof, this item presents alleged costs of a consequential type not ordinarily payable as part of an equitable adjustment in price.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> United States v. Rice, 317 U.S. 61, 63 S.Ct. 120, 87 L.Ed. 53 (1942) and some of its progeny were cited in support of the conclusion. A dissent agreed with the result reached, but stated that the claim should be denied for lack of proof;, in the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>senter\u2019s view, the claim was not barred by the \u201cRice doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">The parties disagree as to the basis for the Board\u2019s denial of recovery under item 9. Plaintiff asserts that the Board \u201cquestioned the adequacy of proof\u201d but rejected the claim as one for \u201calleged costs of a consequential type not ordinarily payable as part of an equitable adjustment in price\u201d barred by <em>Rice. </em>Defendant argues that the \u201cBoard denied this claim basically because of lack' of proof,\u201d and that the Board\u2019s allusion to the \u201cRice doctrine\u201d was \u201cmore of an aside than * * * a definitive determination as to claim Item 9 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">A fair reading of the Board\u2019s majority opinion, and the dissent thereto, make it plain that defendant\u2019s view of the basis for the decision is an erroneous one. The majority opinion did not deny the claim on the ground of failure of proof, but on the ground that, as a matter of law, the \u201calleged costs\u201d claimed were not allowable. Such a decision, on a question of law, may be considered <em>de novo. </em>Woodcrest Constr. Co. v. United States, 408 F.2d 406, 187 Ct.Cl. 249, (1969) and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">Defendant does not defend the majority Board decision as to the effect of the \u201cRice doctrine.\u201d Its position is, rather, that \u201c * * * the Board did have jurisdiction <footnotemark>48</footnotemark> pursuant to the Suspension of Work clause,\u201d and that \u201csince its decision upon the merits of claim Item 9 was supported by substantial evidence, said decision should be accorded finality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">The trouble with this is that the majority of the Board did not make a decision \u201cupon the merits\u201d of this claim. Despite its questioning of the adequacy of plaintiff\u2019s proof, the majority opinion recognized that the change \u201cmust adversely have affected the rest of the work,\u201d and that the work remaining after the change was \u201cill-phased.\u201d It cannot be concluded that, but for the legal decision \u2014 an erroneous one, for reasons next stated \u2014 all recovery would have been denied <footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">In Paul Hardeman, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>a changed condition required additional excavation (for which payment was made) and, until the additional excavation was performed, prevented the use of one of two whirley cranes for the placement of concrete. Claim was made that increased costs resulted from the use of only one crane, that the costs were the direct result of the changed condition, and that an equitable adjustment was therefore due. The claim was denied administratively in reliance on the \u201cRice doctrine\u201d (and another conclusion conceded in this court to be unsupported by substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-14\">In this court, defendant argued that the increased costs incurred were \u201csuffered in the performance of work which was required under the contract, the amount and scope of which was unchanged by the changed condition,\u201d and that recovery of such \u201cconsequential\u201d costs was barred by the \u201cRice doctrine.\u201d The court held that defendant had \u201ccontractually assumed the risk that it might have to pay just such costs as plaintiff claims,\u201d and that the Board had \u201cerred as a matter of law in finding that plaintiff was not entitled to an equitable adjustment for the costs in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>Judge Davis, concurring in the court\u2019s opinion, did so \u201cbecause I understand it to lay down and apply the same standard\u201d frequently used by Boards of Contract Appeals: \u201cThat rule permits an equitable adjustment to cover increased costs which were the direct and necessary result of the <em>change </em>or changed conditions, where the condition or the <em>change </em>directly leads to disruption, extra work, or new procedures.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 406 F.2d at 1362-1363, 186 Ct.Cl. 752 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1417-4\"><em>Hardeman </em>involved a changed condition, not a constructive change. As Judge Davis\u2019 concurring opinion reflects, however, the \u201crule\u201d is not limited to changed conditions, but extends to a change as well. Thus, defendant\u2019s admission that the Board had jurisdiction to grant an equitable adjustment<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> is a proper one, and the holding that plaintiff\u2019s claim on item 9 was barred is legally erroneous. Plaintiff is entitled to an equitable adjustment \u201cif and insofar as\u201d the costs claimed were a direct and necessary result of the change. <em>A. L.

It also urges that acceleration of plaintiff\u2019s work was \u201cin fact compelled,\u201d under threat of default termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">As the nature of plaintiff\u2019s contentions reflects, the Board made findings of fact, not conclusions of law, in rejecting this claim. <em>See </em>Phillips Constr.
