Kisting and Anchor Sales and Service, Incorporated, plaintiffs-appellants were named insureds on a policy of insurance issued by the defendantappellee, Westchester Fire Insurance Company, and insuring certain farm property located in the State of Wisconsin. On May 30, 1966 the buildings were damaged by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">Pursuant to the provisions of the policy the insurer served notice on plaintiff Kisting that it desired to take his examination under oath. The notice was dated August 30, 1966 and was signed by an attorney for the insurer, Daniel J. Leahy as \u201cRepresentative for said Insurance Company\u201d. The examination was scheduled for September 7, 1966. Plaintiff Kisting attended the examination but refused to answer a number of relevant questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-18\">Defendant subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment based on the refusal to answer these questions. Upon full consideration of all of the issues presented, the District Court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 action, with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-19\">We have reviewed the entire record and, upon full consideration of the arguments advanced and authorities cited by the parties, we find that the notice of examination was in all respects proper and that under the law of Wisconsin or Illinois, plaintiff Kisting\u2019s refusal to answer the many questions asked him at the examination was a breach of the policy provisions and a bar to recovery. There being no genuine issue of fact in dispute the award of summary judgment was proper. Ashwell &amp; Company, Inc. v. Transamerica Insurance Company, 407 F.2d 762 (7 Cir. 1969). All questions of law were thoroughly discussed and correctly resolved in the excellent memorandum of the District Judge ruling on the motion for summary judgment. Kisting v. Westchester Fire Insurance Company, 290 F.Supp. 141 (W.D.Wis. 1968). That memorandum is hereby adopted and incorporated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-20\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-21\"> Chief Judge Campbell of the Northern District of Illinois is sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
