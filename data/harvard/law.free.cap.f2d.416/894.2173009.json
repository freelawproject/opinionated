The trust was created pursuant to a property settlement agreement executed contemporaneously with the entering of the divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">During the years 1960 through 1962 the taxpayer received payments from the trust income. Part of this income was derived from tax-exempt interest from municipal bonds and the remainder of the income consisted of dividends which qualified for a dividend tax credit which was in effect during the tax years in question, but which thereafter has been repealed. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, Ch. 1, \u00a7 34, 78 Stat. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-18\">The question presented on the present appeal is whether the taxpayer is entitled to exclude from her gross income that portion of the trust distribution which is tax-exempt to the trust. The related question is whether the taxpayer is entitled to the dividend credit on that portion of the qualifying dividends distributed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-19\">The trustee notified the taxpayer that the total distributions to her during the years in question constituted ordinary income from the trust. Accordingly the taxpayer reported and paid taxes on the total amounts received by her from the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-20\">Thereafter the taxpayer filed claim for refund, contending that as beneficiary of the trust she was entitled to exclude from her gross income her pro rata share of the trust distributions which represented tax-exempt income from municipal bonds. She also contended that as a beneficiary she was entitled to the now repealed dividend credit for that portion of her income which was derived from qualifying dividends. After the claim for refund had been disallowed, the present action for refund was filed in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-21\">In an opinion published at 288 F.Supp. 168, District Judge Robert M. McRae, Jr. granted summary judgment in favor of the taxpayer for the claimed refunds plus interest. The United States appeals. We affirm. Reference is made to the opinion of the District Court for a detailed recitation of the facts, which will not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-22\">In making a determination of the taxable character of tax-exempt trust income once it is distributed to the wife-beneficiary in the form of alimony pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>ments, we are concerned primarily with \u00a7\u00a7 71(a) (1) and 682 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Exclusion of interest from municipal bonds from gross income is authorized by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) (1). Under this provision income from municipal bonds held in trust is not taxable to the trustee. By virtue of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 652(b) and 662(b) the non-taxable character of the interest continues in the hands of the beneficiary when tax-exempt interest is distributed to a beneficiary in the form of trust income. The end result of these statutory provisions is that if income is tax-exempt to the trust, it is tax-exempt to the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">It is contended on behalf of the Government that \u00a7 71(a) (1) prohibits the taxpayer in the present ease from being treated as a beneficiary under the alimony trust for the purpose of availing herself of the tax-exempt character of the amounts distributed to her and the dividend credit. This contention is made notwithstanding the above-quoted language of \u00a7 682(b). The Government argues that the latter section refers only to trust accounting principles, that is, for determining the taxable year in which the ex-wife of either a \u00a7 682(a) trust or a \u00a7 71(a) trust must include the payments to her in her gross income. In essence the Government contends that \u00a7 71(a) creates an exception to the standard conduit principles applicable to trust income distributed to beneficiaries as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 652(b) and 662(b). We find nothing in the language of the statutes or in the legislative history to support such an interpretation of \u00a7 71(a). A thorough search of the legislative history of these code sections has failed to shed any light upon the congressional intent in regard to the taxability of alimony payments under the fact situation presented on this appeal. See H.R.Rep. 2333, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 46, 72-73 (1942); S.Rep. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 83, 85 (1942) and 88 Cong.Rec. 6377 (1942). We therefore base our conclusion upon the language of the statute, interpreting it in the light of its ordinary meaning and significance. National City Bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>of Cleveland v. United States, 371 F.2d 13, 16 (6th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The Government relies upon the accepted proposition that alimony payments made from a \u00a7 71(a) alimony trust must be included in the gross income of the wife regardless of whether the payments are from income or corpus of the trust. This was the clear intent of the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-6\">\u201cWhere the husband\u2019s alimony or separate maintenance obligation is discharged through periodic payments attributable to property in trust, life insurance, annuity or endowment contracts, or to any other interest in property, the wife is required to include such payments in gross income, whether they come from income or capital. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-8\">\u201cThe full amount of periodic payments received under the circumstances described in section 22 (k) is required to be included in the gross income of the recipient whether such amounts are derived, in whole or in part, from income received or accrued by the source to which such payments are attributable. Thus, it matters not that such payments are attributable to property in trust, to life insurance, endowment or annuity contracts, or to any other interest in property, or are paid directly or indirectly by the obligor husband from his income or capital.\u201d H.R.Rep. 2333, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 46, 72 (1942). See also S.Rep. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 85 (1942).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Bottomed on this proposition, the Government argues that since alimony payments derived from corpus are included in the gross income of the ex-wife, the natural extension of the rule, requires that distributions from tax-exempt income likewise are taxable. The answer to this contention is that the Congress has not said that all alimony payments, regardless of their source, are to be included in the gross income of the ex-wife. We decline to extend this statutory provision beyond the language enacted by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Taxes should be imposed by Congress, and not by the courts. If there is serious doubt as to taxability, as in this case, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. McFeely v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 296 U.S. 102, 111, 56 S.Ct. 54, 80 L.Ed. 83; Gellman v. United States, 235 F.2d 87, 93 (8th Cir.). Statutes should be applied as enacted by Congress. Narrow and strained construction should be avoided. Western &amp; Southern Life Insurance Co. v. Huwe, 116 F.2d 1008, 1009 (6th Cir.). The changes in the Internal Revenue laws which the Government proposes here, if desirable, should be accomplished through the Constitutional process for the enactment and amendment of statutes. This is \u201ca matter which we think is the business of Congress, not ours.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Brown, 380 U.S. 563, 579, 85 S.Ct. 1162, 1170, 14 L.Ed.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">In further support of its position the Government cites the case of Neeman v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 26 T.C. 864, aff\u2019d per curiam, 255 F.2d 841 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 841, 79 S.Ct. 65, 3 L.Ed.2d 75. In <em>Neeman </em>the husband was a beneficiary of a trust which distributed to him tax-exempt interest from municipal bonds. Subsequent to a divorce, the husband made certain alimony payments to his ex-wife from the income he received from the trust. The ex-wife contended that the portions of tax-exempt interest she received in her alimony payments should be excluded from her gross income. In rejecting this contention, the Tax Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-13\">\u201cFinally, petitioner contends that although the parties have stipulated that the specific source of funds used by Dodge to pay the amounts of alimony to petitioner \u2018is unknown\u2019 we should nevertheless find that the alimony was paid from Dodge\u2019s tax-exempt income and that the payments retained such tax-exempt status in petitioner\u2019s hands and should, therefore, be excluded from her gross income under section 22(b) (4) of the Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Revenue Code of 1939. There are several reasons why this contention must fail. We need only mention two. First, petitioner has failed to show that such alimony payments were in fact paid out of tax-exempt income. Without such proof we cannot determine that there was a violation of petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights in this respect and accordingly petitioner must bear the misfortune resulting from such failure of proof. Burnet v. Houston, 283 U.S. 223 [51 S.Ct. 413, 75 L.Ed. 991] (1931). Second, we have stated elsewhere in this Opinion that the source of such payments was immaterial. Luckenbach v. Pedrick, <em>supra </em>[2 Cir., 214 F.2d 914]; Albert R. Gallatin Welsh Trust, <em>supra </em>[16 T.C. 1398].\u201d 26 T.C. at 868-869.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The facts in <em>Neeman </em>are significantly different from the facts in the present case. The taxpayer in this case is a named beneficiary of a trust set up to pay her alimony. In <em>Neeman </em>the ex-wife was not a beneficiary but received her alimony payments directly from her husband who, in turn, was a beneficiary of a trust. Thus <em>Neeman </em>was not concerned with the relationship of \u00a7\u00a7 652 (b), 662(b), 682(b) and 71(a) (1). In addition the <em>Neeman </em>court expressed some concern over the fact that the husband had other fully taxable income and the wife was unable to establish the specific source of the funds from which her alimony payments came. In the present case, the plaintiff was able to establish accurately what part of her payments came from tax-exempt interest and what part came from taxable income. Also <em>Neeman </em>was primarily concerned with the constitutionality of \u00a7 22 (k) of the 1939 Code as amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent that <em>Neeman </em>might be construed to be applicable to the present case in regard to the immateriality of the source of alimony payments, we respectfully decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">We agree with the interpretation that the District Judge placed upon \u00a7 682(b) to the effect that the wife shall be considered as the beneficiary \u201cspecified in this part\u201d for purposes of computing her taxable income. \u201c[T]his part\u201d refers to Part I, entitled \u201cEstates, Trusts and Beneficiaries,\u201d of subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 641 through 683. \u201cThis part\u201d provides that distributions of income from a trustee \u201cshall have the same character in the hands of the beneficiary as in the hands of the trust.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 652(b) and 662(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">We conclude that \u00a7 71(a) (1) does not create an exception to the conduit principles pertaining to the beneficiaries of trust income as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 652(b) and 662(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly we agree with the opinion of the District Court holding that the taxpayer is entitled to the benefit of the tax-exempt character of the trust income and the dividend tax credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 71(a) (1) and 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">\u00a7 71.
