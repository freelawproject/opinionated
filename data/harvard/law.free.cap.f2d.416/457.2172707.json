L. DeLong. More specifically, the Court was required to decide whether DeLong had actual or apparent authority to bind United by the guaranty upon which appellant\u2019s claim for relief is premised. Judge Henley, in a soundly reasoned opinion, persuasively demonstrated that DeLong lacked such authority. 286 F.Supp. 173, 176-182 (E.D.Ark.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-23\">We reject as untenable appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence established as a matter of law that the instrument under consideration constituted a valid and binding obligation of United, and that consequently the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-24\">We have canvassed the voluminous record and are convinced that the evidence clearly supports the judgment of dismissal. Indeed, we find scant, if any, probative evidence to support appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>claim. The district court was fully justified in finding on the evidence presented that DeLong had no authority to bind United by the instrument sued on. Certainly, analysis of the entire record does not leave us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
