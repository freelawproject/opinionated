Brouner, purchased office furniture from Ira Haupt &amp; Co. with a loan from Chemical Bank New York Trust Company and leased it back to Haupt. A security deposit of $13,125 was given to Office Decorators by Haupt pursuant to a supplement to the lease agreement. This security deposit was commingled with other funds in Office Decorators\u2019 general bank account. It was never segregated into a trust fund as required by section 382-a of the General Business Law of the State of New York (now N.Y. General Obligations Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 24-A, \u00a7 7-101 (McKinney 1964)). On January 29, 1964, two months before an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against Haupt, Brouner sold Office Decorators to a nominee of Chemical Bank. The agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">\u201cIt is understood * * * that the Company [Office Decorators] has received $13,125 as a security deposit * * * [which] has been withdrawn by the undersigned [Brouner] as additional consideration for the transfer, to you [Chemical Bank\u2019s nominee] of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">On March 25, 1966, Haupt\u2019s Trustee commenced a summary proceedings to recover the deposit from Brouner on the theory that the fund had been converted.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">A bankruptcy court\u2019s summary jurisdiction is based upon either actual or constructive possession of the bankrupt\u2019s property, consent of the adverse claimant, or a determination that the adverse claim is \u201cmerely colorable\u201d and not \u201creal and substantial.\u201d Harrison v. Chamberlin, 271 U.S. 191, 193-194, 46 S.Ct. 467, 70 L.Ed. 897 (1926). If the adverse claim is real and substantial, the Trustee must seek his recovery in a plenary action under section 23 of the Bankruptcy Act. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46 (1964). Brouner contends that summary jurisdiction is improper since he has a real and substantial claim to $13,125 based on his agreement of sale with Chemical Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">The Trustee has a claim against Office Decorators for the security deposit and if the sum is not on deposit in a bank as a trust fund, then there is a claim against those responsible for the absence of the fund. Those responsible would include both Brouner and his successor in interest, i. e., Chemical Bank\u2019s nominee. If the Trustee chooses to pursue his remedy against Brouner, the private arrangement between Brouner and Chemical Bank as to who is liable between themselves should not hinder the Trustee\u2019s remedy. This Court is not called upon to determine whether Brouner has equitable rights of subrogation, contribution, or indemnification against Chemical Bank as a result of the total transaction. Even if those rights exist against Chemical Bank, it does not mean that Brouner has a claim adverse to the Trustee that is real and substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">The Referee\u2019s order, directing appellant, Brouner, to .turn over the sum of $13,125 plus interest to Haupt\u2019s Trustee in Bankruptcy, was a proper exercise of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s summary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
