BROWN, Chief Judge, and WISDOM, GEWIN, BELL, THORNBERRY, COLEMAN, GOLDBERG, AINSWORTH, GODBOLD, DYER, SIMPSON, MORGAN, and CARS-WELL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge, with whom AINSWORTH and SIMPSON, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to grant rehearing en bane.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">Without regard to the intrinsic question of the correctness of the Court\u2019s decision and opinion, this is one of those cases within the spirit of F.R.A.P. 35 and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 46 which deserves consideration by the full Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-17\">As the records of this Court reflect, we have within the very recent months had to deal extensively with Title VII civil rights cases concerning discrimination in employment on account of race, color, sex and religion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Court decisions on critical standards are of unusual importance. This is SO' because, except for preliminary administrative efforts at conciliation and the rare pattern or practice suit by the United States,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> effectuation of Congressional policies is largely committed to the hands of individual workers who take on the mantle of a private attorney general<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to vindicate, not individual, but public rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-18\">This makes our role crucial. Within the proper limits of the case-and-eontroversy approach we should lay down standards not only for Trial Courts, but hopefully also for the guidance of administrative agents in the field, as well as employers, employees, and their representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-19\">The full Court should look at the issue here posed. And now in the light of the standard erected \u2014 sex if coupled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>with another factor is acceptable \u2014 it is imperative that the full Court look at it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">Equally important, the full Court should look to correct what, in my view, is a palpably wrong standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">The case is simple. A woman with pre-school children may not be employed, a man with pre-school children may.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The distinguishing factor seems to be motherhood versus fatherhood. The question then arises: Is this sex-related? To the simple query the answer is just as simple: Nobody \u2014 and this includes Judges, Solomonic or life tenured \u2014 has yet seen a male mother. A mother, to oversimplify the simplest biology, must then be a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">It is the fact of the person being a <em>mother </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>a woman \u2014 not the age of the children, which denies employment opportunity to a woman which is open to a man.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">How the Court strayed from that simple proposition is not easy to define. Not a little of the reason appears to be a feeling that the Court in interpreting \u00a7 703(a) (1), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) (1), prohibiting sex discrimination,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is bound to accept the contention of one of the parties, rather than pick and choose, drawing a middle line, or for that matter reaching independently an interpretation sponsored by no one, Thus, after noting that in the Trial Court and here the Employer did not \u201cchoose to rely on the \u2018bona fide occupational qualification\u2019 section of the Act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but, instead, defended on the premise that their established standard of not hiring women with pre-school age children is not per se discrimination on the basis of \u2018sex\u2019 \u201d (Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 1, 2-3), the Court virtually acknowledges the patent discrimination based on biology. The Court states: \u201cWhere an employer, as here, differentiates between men with preschool age children, on the one hand, and women with pre-school age children, on the other, there is arguably an apparent discrimination founded upon sex. It is possible that the Congressional scheme for the handling of a situation of this kind was to give the employer an opportunity to justify this seeming difference in treatment under the \u2018bona fide employment disqualification\u2019 provision of the statute.\u201d 411 F.2d at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-18\">But in what immediately followed the Court then does a remarkable thing. Referring to EEOC (appearing only as <em>amicus), </em>it states: \u201cThe Commission, however, in its appearance before us has rejected this possible reading<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>statute. It has left us, if the prohibition is to be given any effect at all in this instance, only with the alternative of a Congressional intent to exclude absolutely any consideration of the differences between the normal relationships of working fathers and working mothers to their pre-school age children, and to require that an employer treat the two exactly alike in the administration of its general hiring policies. If this is the only permissible view of Congressional intention available to us, * * * we have no hesitation in choosing the latter.\u201d 411 F.2d at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">It is this self-imposed interpretive straightjacket which, I believe, leads the Court to the extremes of \u201ceither/or\u201d outright per se violation with no defense or virtual complete immunity from the Act\u2019s prohibitions. This it does through its test of \u201csex plus\u201d: \u201c[1] A per se violation of the Act can only be discrimination based solely on one of the categories <em>i. e., </em>in the case of sex; women vis-a-vis men. [2] When <em>another </em>criterion of employment <em>is added </em>to one of the classifications listed in the Act, there is no longer apparent discrimination based solely on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 411 F.2d at 3-4 (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Reducing it to this record the Court characterizes the admitted discrimination in this way. \u201cThe discrimination was based on a <em>two-pronged </em>qualification, <em>i. e., </em>a woman with pre-school age children. Ida Phillips was not refused employment because she was a woman nor because she had pre-school age children. It is the <em>coalescence </em>of these <em>two elements </em>that denied her the position she desired. In view of the above, we are convinced that the judgment of the District Court was proper, and we therefore affirm.\u201d 411 F.2d at 4 (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-13\">If \u201csex plus\u201d stands, the Act is dead.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This follows from the Court\u2019s repeated declaration<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that the employer is not forbidden to discriminate as to non-statutory factors. Free to add non-sex factors, the rankest sort of discrimination against women can be worked by employers. This could include, for example, all sorts of physical characteristics, such as minimum weight (175 lbs.), minimum shoulder width, minimum biceps measurement, minimum lifting capacity (100 lbs.), and the like. Others could include minimum educational requirements (minimum high school, junior college), intelligence tests, aptitude tests, etc. And it bears repeating that on the Court\u2019s reading, one of these would constitute a complete defense to a charge of \u00a7 703(a) (1) violation <em>without </em>putting on the employer the burden of proving \u201cbusiness justification\u201d under \u00a7 703(e) (note 7, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-14\">In addition to the intrinsic unsoundness of the \u201csex plus\u201d standard, the legislative history refutes the idea that Congress for even a moment meant to allow \u201cnonbusiness justified\u201d discrimination against women on the ground that they were mothers or mothers of preschool children. On the contrary, mothers, working mothers, and working mothers of pre-school children were the specific objectives of governmental solicitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-15\">In the first place, working mothers constitute a large class<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> posing much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>discussed problems of economics and sociology. And with this large.class and the known practice of using baby-sitters or child care centers, neither an employer nor a reviewing Court can \u2014 absent proof of \u201cbusiness justification\u201d (note 7, <em>supra,) </em>\u2014 assume that a mother of pre-school children will, from parental obligations, be an unreliable, unfit employee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-14\">In this and the related legislation on equality of <em>compensation </em>for women<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> one of the reasons repeatedly stressed for legislation forbidding sex discrimination was the large proportion of married women and mothers in the working force whose earnings are essential to the economic needs of their families.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-15\">Congress could hardly have been so incongruous as to legislate sex equality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>in employment by a statutory structure enabling the employer to deny employment to those who need the work most through the simple expedient of adding to sex a non-statutory factor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">A mother is still a woman. And if she is denied work outright because she is a mother, it is because she is a woman. Congress said that could no longer be done.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1314-12\"><em>. </em>Presumably because it was <em>amicus </em>only and not a party, the Government did not seek either rehearing or rehearing en banc. For understandable reasons the private plaintiff, Ida Phillips, who has the awesome role of private Attorney General without benefit of portfolio, or more important, an adequate purse, presumably felt that she had fulfilled her duty when the Court ruled. Subsequently, on a poll being requested. F.R.A.P. 35; 5th Circuit Rule 12, the Government filed a strong brief attacking the Court\u2019s decision. Likewise, the private plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a persuasive brief. This merely emphasizes that it has been members of this Court, not the parties, who have raised questions about the Court\u2019s decision. This is in keeping with 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 46 and F.R.A.P. 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1314-14\">.

Statistics compiled by the Wage and Labor Standards Administration of the United States Department of Labor in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>dicate that working mothers comprise an important and increasing segment of the Nation\u2019s labor resources. In the most recent compilation (March 1967), there were 10.6 million working mothers in the labor force with children under 18 years of age. This is an increase of 6 million over 1950 and an increase of 9.1 million over 1940. Of the total of working mothers in March 1967, 38.9% were mothers of children under 6 years of age and 20.7% were mothers with children under 3 years of age. In numerical terms, 4.1 million working mothers had children under 6 and 2.1 million working mothers had children under 3.

The brief of EEOO points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-7\">\u201cIn answering the question: \u2018What arrangements do working mothers make for child care?\u2019, the Department of Labor responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-8\">\u2018In February 1965, 47 percent of the children under 6 years of age were looked after in their own homes and thirty percent were cared for in someone else\u2019s home, but only 6 percent received group care in day care centers or similar facilities.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-9\">Who are Working Mothers, <em>supra </em>[Note 12].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1317-11\">Furthermore, it is the policy of the Administration to encourage unemployed women on public assistance, who have children, to enter the labor market by providing for the establishment of day care centers to enable them to accept offers of employment. On August 8, 1969, President Nixon stated in his address to the Nation on welfare reforms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-12\">\u2018As I mentioned previously, greatly expanded day-care center facilities would be provided for the children of welfare mothers who choose to work. However, these would be day-care centers with a difference. There is no single ideal to which this Administration is more firmly committed than to the enriching of a child\u2019s first five years of life, and thus helping lift the poor out of misery, at a time when a lift can help the most. Therefore, these day-care centers would offer more than custodial care; they would also be devoted to the development of vigorous young minds and bodies. As a further dividend, the day-care centers would offer employment to many welfare mothers themselves.\u2019 Text of Nixon\u2019s Address to the Nation Outlining His Proposals for Welfare Reform, N.
