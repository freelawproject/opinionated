Defendants argue that the information they would have had to furnish to procure the stamps on the admittedly stolen and untaxed alcohol would incriminate them under bothufederal and state laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They reason from this that section 5205(a) (2) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">This contention is without merit; although apparently a matter of first impressions in this circuit, it has been fully canvassed in several decisions in the Fourth and Fifth Circuits and we fully agree with these courts in uniformly rejecting the argument. See, e. g., United States v. Walden, 411 F.2d 1109 (4th Cir. 1969); Wilson v. United States, 409 F.2d 604 (5th Cir. 1969); Hall v. United States, 407 F.2d 1320 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">First, section 5205(a) (2) does not require the \u201cpossessor\u201d of distilled spirits in unstamped containers to purchase the tax stamps or to keep possibly incriminating records; rather, sections 5005(b) (1) and 5555 put these duties on the \u201cproprietor * * * [of the] distilling apparatus.\u201d Not being under any obligation to report, defendants here cannot avail themselves of the Fifth Amendment privilege. See Shoffeitt v. United States, 403 F.2d 991 (5th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1084, 89 S.Ct. 868, 21 L.Ed.2d 777 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">More specifically, the Supreme Court decisions relied on by defendants in no way undermine the principles that criminal penalties may be imposed incident to valid regulatory statutes and that records can be required to be kept when reasonably necessary to the administration of such a statute. See Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787 (1948). The cases relied on by defendant point towards allowing a Fifth Amendment privilege to be raised when the tax statute in question has as its purpose not raising revenue but rather identifying those engaged in activities generally illegal under state law. These cases involve statutes which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">\u201care directed at a small number of people who are inherently suspect of illegal activities, where the activities required to be reported on are almost certain to be illegal because the general area of activity is permeated with criminal statutes.\u201d United States v. Walden, 411 F.2d 1109 (4th Cir. 1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">The statutory scheme for taxation of distilled spirits, set out at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5001-5692 (1964), on the other hand, is clearly a genuine revenue raising program. It is not directed at \u201ca select few,\u201d but to thousands of legitimate producers, distributors, and retailers. See Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 18, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969). That incidentally there are required records and criminal penalties to assure compliance with the act does not change its basic character. The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that information may be collected and penalties attached to \u201cregulatory programs of gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>eral application,\u201d Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 98, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1969); such a program is presented here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\">. Marchetti v.
