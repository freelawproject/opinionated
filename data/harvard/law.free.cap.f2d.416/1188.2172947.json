During trial there was introduced as exhibits the LSD tablets and the glassine envelopes of, admittedly, marihuana, that defendant, according to the testimony, had transferred to an undercover government agent. At the conclusion of the case the court ordered a verdict for the defendant on count 2, the government having failed in the technical proof needed to establish a tax violation. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-18\">The only point of any possible consequence on this appeal relates to the court\u2019s refusal to withdraw the marihuana exhibit from the consideration of the jury when it withdrew the marihuana count. Although at first blush this seems an unusual ruling, we find it correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-19\">After probing other defenses, the defendant went to the jury on entrapment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant protests that the marihuana evidence prejudiced him in this regard. In the nonlegal sense of the word doubtless it did. Defendant\u2019s willingness, according to the government testimony, to sell marihuana \u2014indeed to offer to do so at the time of the completion of the LSD sale \u2014 weakened his position that he was inveigled by the government agent. In view of the contemporaneousness of the offer, the defendant\u2019s claim that because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>marihuana sale took place three weeks later it was too distant in time to be of value is meritless. We consider the episode relevant and admissible proof of defendant\u2019s predilection even though the transfer was only a state offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">When the marihuana exhibit was introduced, no limitation was requested that it be considered only on count 2. It was, accordingly, in evidence for all relevant purposes. The government had the right to have it remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1244-13\">. We are indebted to defendant\u2019s counsel for tlie suggestion that this defense failed as a matter of law only because of a \u201csemantic\u201d error, which proved to mean that a government witness said the wrong words from the defendant\u2019s point of view.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
