An officer might, for example, stop a motorist for traveling alone in a high-occupancy vehicle lane, only to discover upon approaching the car that two children are slumped over asleep in the back seat. The driver has not violated the law, but neither has the officer violated the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   But what if the police officer's reasonable mistake is not one of fact but of law? In this case, an officer stopped a vehicle because one of its two brake lights was out, but a court later determined that a single working brake light was all the law required. The question presented is whether such a mistake of law can nonetheless give rise to the reasonable suspicion necessary to uphold the seizure under the Fourth Amendment. We hold that it can. Because the officer's mistake about the brake-light law was reasonable, the stop in this case was lawful under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the morning of April 29, 2009, Sergeant Matt Darisse of the Surry County Sheriff's Department sat in his patrol car near Dobson, North Carolina, observing northbound traffic on Interstate 77. Shortly before 8 a.m., a Ford Escort passed by. Darisse thought the driver looked \"very stiff and nervous,\" so he pulled onto the interstate and began following the Escort. A few miles down the road, the Escort braked as it approached a slower vehicle, but only the left brake light came on. Noting the faulty right brake light, Darisse activated his vehicle's lights and pulled the Escort over. App. 4-7, 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Two men were in the car: Maynor Javier Vasquez sat behind the wheel, and petitioner Nicholas Brady Heien lay across the rear seat. Sergeant Darisse explained to Vasquez that as long as his license and registration checked out, he would receive only a warning ticket for the broken brake light. A records check revealed no problems with the documents, and Darisse gave Vasquez the warning ticket. But Darisse had become suspicious during the course of the stop-Vasquez appeared nervous, Heien remained lying down the entire time, and the two gave inconsistent answers about their destination. Darisse asked Vasquez if he would be willing to answer some questions. Vasquez assented, and Darisse asked whether the men were transporting various types of contraband. Told no, Darisse asked whether he could search the Escort. Vasquez said he had no objection, but told Darisse he should ask Heien, because Heien owned the car. Heien gave his consent, and Darisse, aided by a fellow officer who had since arrived, began a thorough search of the vehicle. In the side compartment of a duffle bag, Darisse found a sandwich bag containing cocaine. The officers arrested both men.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357764\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/366/271/#p272\">\n    366 N.C. 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272-273,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20S.E.2d%20351\">\n    737 S.E.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352-353 (2012); App. 5-6, 25, 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State charged Heien with attempted trafficking in cocaine. Heien moved to suppress the evidence seized from the car, contending that the stop and search had violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. After a hearing at which both officers testified and the State played a video recording of the stop, the trial court denied the suppression motion, concluding that the faulty brake light had given Sergeant Darisse reasonable suspicion to initiate the stop, and that Heien's subsequent consent to the search was valid. Heien pleaded guilty but reserved his right to appeal the suppression decision. App. 1, 7-10, 12, 29, 43-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278446\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/214/515/\">\n    214 N.C.App. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=714%20S.E.2d%20827\">\n    714 S.E.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). The initial stop was not valid, the court held, because driving with only one working brake light was not actually a violation of North Carolina law. The relevant provision of the vehicle code provides that a car must be\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"equipped with a stop lamp on the rear of the vehicle. The stop lamp shall display a red or amber light visible from a distance of not less than 100 feet to the rear in normal sunlight, and shall be actuated upon application of the service (foot) brake. The stop lamp may be incorporated into a unit with one or more other rear lamps.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 20-129(g) (2007).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Focusing on the statute's references to \"a stop lamp\" and \"[t]he stop lamp\" in the singular, the court concluded that a vehicle is required to have only one working brake light-which Heien's vehicle indisputably did. The justification for the stop was therefore \"objectively unreasonable,\" and the stop violated the Fourth Amendment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278446\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/214/515/\">\n    214 N.C.App., at 518-522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=714%20S.E.2d%20827\">\n    714 S.E.2d, at 829-831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State appealed, and the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357764\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/366/271/#p272\">\n    366 N.C. 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20S.E.2d%20351\">\n    737 S.E.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We have recognized that searches and seizures based on mistakes of fact can be reasonable. The warrantless search of a home, for instance, is reasonable if undertaken with the consent of a resident, and remains lawful when officers obtain the consent of someone who reasonably appears to be but is not in fact a resident.

By the same token, if officers with probable cause to arrest a suspect mistakenly arrest an individual matching the suspect's description, neither the seizure nor an accompanying search of the arrestee would be unlawful.

Reasonable suspicion arises from the combination of an officer's understanding of the facts and his understanding of the relevant law. The officer may be reasonably mistaken on either ground. Whether the facts turn out to be not what was thought, or the law turns out to be not what was thought, the result is the same: the facts are outside the scope of the law. There is no reason, under the text of the Fourth Amendment or our precedents, why this same result should be acceptable when reached by way of a reasonable mistake of fact, but not when reached by way of a similarly reasonable mistake of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The dissent counters that our cases discussing probable cause and reasonable suspicion, most notably\n   <em>\n    Ornelas v.

In fact, cases dating back two centuries\n   support treating legal and factual errors alike in this context. Customs statutes enacted by Congress not long after the founding authorized courts to issue certificates indemnifying customs officers against damages suits premised on unlawful seizures.

In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Riddle,\n   </em>\n   a customs officer seized goods on the ground that the English shipper had violated the customs laws by preparing an invoice that undervalued the merchandise, even though the American consignee declared the true value to the customs collector. Chief Justice Marshall held that there had been no violation of the customs law because, whatever the shipper's intention, the consignee had not actually attempted to defraud the Government. Nevertheless, because \"the construction of the law was liable to some question,\" he affirmed the issuance of a certificate of probable cause: \"A doubt as to the true construction of the\n   <em>\n    law\n   </em>\n   is as reasonable a cause for seizure as a doubt respecting the fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This holding-that reasonable mistakes of law, like those of fact, would justify certificates of probable cause-was reiterated in a number of 19th-century decisions.

In those cases, however, we had already found or assumed a Fourth Amendment violation. An officer's mistaken view that the conduct at issue did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   give rise to such a violation-no matter how reasonable-could not change that ultimate conclusion. See Brief for Respondent 29-31; Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   30, n. 3. Any consideration of the reasonableness of an officer's mistake was therefore limited to the separate matter of remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, by contrast, the mistake of law relates to the antecedent question of whether it was reasonable for an officer to suspect that the defendant's conduct was illegal. If so, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment in the first place. None of the cases Heien or the dissent cites precludes a court from considering a reasonable mistake of law in addressing that question. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Herring v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p139\">\n    555 U.S. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 139,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p139\">\n    129 S.Ct. 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p139\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009)(assuming a Fourth Amendment violation while rejecting application of the exclusionary rule, but noting that \"[w]hen a probable-cause determination was based on reasonable but mistaken assumptions, the person subjected to a search or seizure has not necessarily been the victim of a constitutional violation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Heien also contends that the reasons the Fourth Amendment allows some errors of fact do not extend to errors of law. Officers in the field must make factual assessments on the fly, Heien notes, and so deserve a margin of error. In Heien's view, no such margin is appropriate for questions of law: The statute here either requires one working brake light or two, and the answer does not turn on anything \"an officer might suddenly confront in the field.\" Brief for Petitioner 21. But Heien's point does not consider the reality that an officer may \"suddenly confront\" a situation in the field as to which the application of a statute is unclear-however clear it may later become. A law prohibiting \"vehicles\" in the park either covers Segways or not, see A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 36-38 (2012), but an officer will nevertheless have to make a quick decision on the law the first time one whizzes by.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Contrary to the suggestion of Heien and\n   <em>\n    amici,\n   </em>\n   our decision does not discourage officers from learning the law. The Fourth Amendment tolerates only\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   mistakes, and those mistakes-whether of fact or of law-must be\n   <em>\n    objectively\n   </em>\n   reasonable. We do not examine the subjective understanding of the particular officer involved. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Whren v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746960\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/806/#p813\">\n    517 U.S. 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746960\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/806/#p813\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746960\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/806/#p813\">\n    135 L.Ed.2d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). And the inquiry is not as forgiving as the one employed in the distinct context of deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity for a constitutional or statutory violation. Thus, an officer can gain no Fourth Amendment advantage through a sloppy\n   study of the laws he is duty-bound to enforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, Heien and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   point to the well-known maxim, \"Ignorance of the law is no excuse,\" and contend that it is fundamentally unfair to let police officers get away with mistakes of law when the citizenry is accorded no such leeway. Though this argument has a certain rhetorical appeal, it misconceives the implication of the maxim. The true symmetry is this: Just as an individual generally cannot escape criminal liability based on a mistaken understanding of the law, so too the government cannot impose criminal liability based on a mistaken understanding of the law. If the law required two working brake lights, Heien could not escape a ticket by claiming he reasonably thought he needed only one; if the law required only one, Sergeant Darisse could not issue a valid ticket by claiming he reasonably thought drivers needed two. But just because mistakes of law cannot justify either the imposition or the avoidance of criminal liability, it does not follow that they cannot justify an investigatory stop. And Heien is not appealing a brake-light ticket; he is appealing a cocaine-trafficking conviction as to which there is no asserted mistake of fact or law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here we have little difficulty concluding that the officer's error of law was reasonable. Although the North Carolina statute at issue refers to \"\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   stop lamp,\" suggesting the need for only a single working brake light, it also provides that \"[t]he stop lamp may be incorporated into a unit with one or more\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   rear lamps.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 20-129(g)(emphasis added). The use of \"other\" suggests to the everyday reader of English that a \"stop lamp\" is a type of \"rear lamp.\" And another subsection of the same provision requires that vehicles \"have all originally equipped rear lamps or the equivalent in good working order,\" \u00a7 20-129(d), arguably indicating that if a vehicle has multiple \"stop lamp[s],\" all must be functional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The North Carolina Court of Appeals concluded that the \"rear lamps\" discussed in subsection (d) do not include brake lights, but, given the \"other,\" it would at least have been reasonable to think they did. Both the majority and the dissent in the North Carolina Supreme Court so concluded, and we agree. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357764\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/366/271/#p272\">\n    366 N.C., at 282-283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20S.E.2d%20351\">\n    737 S.E.2d, at 358-359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 283,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20S.E.2d%20351\">\n    737 S.E.2d, at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Hudson, J., dissenting) (calling the Court of Appeals' decision \"surprising\"). This \"stop lamp\" provision, moreover, had never been previously construed by North Carolina's appellate courts. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 283,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20S.E.2d%20351\">\n    737 S.E.2d, at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (majority opinion). It was thus objectively reasonable for an officer in Sergeant Darisse's position to think that Heien's faulty right brake light was a violation of North Carolina law.

If the statute is genuinely ambiguous, such that overturning the officer's judgment requires hard interpretive work, then the officer has made a reasonable mistake. But if not, not. As the Solicitor General made the point at oral argument, the statute must pose a \"really difficult\" or \"very hard question of statutory interpretation.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 50. And indeed, both North Carolina and the Solicitor General agreed that such cases will be \"exceedingly rare.\" Brief for Respondent 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court's analysis of Sergeant Darisse's interpretation of the North Carolina law at issue here appropriately reflects these principles. As the Court explains, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 540, the statute requires every car on the highway to have \"a stop lamp,\" in the singular.N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 20-129(g) (2007). But the statute goes on to state that a stop lamp (or, in more modern terminology, brake light) \"may be incorporated into a unit with one or more\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   rear lamps,\" suggesting that a stop lamp itself qualifies as a rear lamp.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652906\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-cas/9/825/#p826\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). And the statute further mandates that every car have \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   originally equipped rear lamps ... in good working order.\" \u00a7 20-129(d)(emphasis added). The North Carolina Court of Appeals dealt with the statute's conflicting signals in one way (deciding that a brake light is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a rear lamp, and so only one needs to work); but a court could easily take the officer's view (deciding that a brake light\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a rear lamp, and if a car comes equipped with more than one, as modern cars do, all must be in working order). The critical point is that the statute poses a quite difficult question of interpretation, and Sergeant Darisse's judgment, although overturned, had much to recommend it. I therefore agree with the Court that the traffic stop he conducted did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

Indeed, had this very case arisen after the North Carolina Supreme Court announced its rule, the North Carolina Court of Appeals would not have had the occasion to interpret the statute at issue.

But I have not seen any persuasive argument that law enforcement will be unduly hampered by a rule that precludes consideration of mistakes of law in the reasonableness inquiry. After all, there is no indication that excluding an officer's mistake of law from the reasonableness inquiry has created a problem for law enforcement in the overwhelming number of Circuits which have adopted that approach. If an officer makes a stop in good faith but it turns out that, as in this case, the officer was wrong about what the law proscribed or required, I know of no penalty that the officer would suffer.

Instead, in support of its conclusion that reasonable suspicion \"arises from the\n   <em>\n    combination\n   </em>\n   of an officer's understanding of the facts\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   his understanding of the relevant law,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 536 (emphasis added), the Court first reaches to founding-era customs statutes and cases applying those statutes.

Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Brinegar\n   </em>\n   is an odd case for the Court to rely on given that, like the cases I discussed above, it subsequently emphasizes that \"the mistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting on\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3943769\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/160/#p176\">\n    338 U.S., at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3943769\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/160/#p176\">\n    69 S.Ct. 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

This is a Fourth Amendment case, but the Court's reading of it imagines a holding that is not rooted in the logic of the opinion. We held in\n   <em>\n    DeFillippo\n   </em>\n   that an officer had probable cause to support an arrest even though the ordinance that had allegedly been violated was later held by the Michigan Court of Appeals to be unconstitutional. This was so, we explained, because the officer conducted an arrest after having observed conduct that was criminalized by a presumptively valid law at the time of that conduct. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179569\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/31/\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179569\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/31/\">\n    ., at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179569\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/31/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"At th[e] time [of the arrest], of course, there was no controlling precedent that this ordinance was or was not constitutional, and hence the conduct observed violated a presumptively valid ordinance\"). We noted that it would have been wrong for that officer not to enforce the law in that situation. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179569\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/31/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Police are charged to enforce laws until and unless they are declared unconstitutional....

Rather,\n   <em>\n    DeFillippo\n   </em>\n   involved a police officer correctly applying the law that was then in existence and that carried with it a presumption of validity. Here, by contrast, police stopped Heien on suspicion of committing an offense that never actually existed. Given that our holding in\n   <em>\n    DeFillippo\n   </em>\n   relied so squarely on the existence of a law criminalizing the defendant's conduct, and on the presumption of validity that attends actual laws, it can hardly be said to control where, as here, no law ever actually criminalized Heien's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On the practical side, the Court primarily contends that an officer may confront \"a situation in the field as to which the application of a statute is unclear.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 539. One is left to wonder, however, why an innocent citizen should be made to shoulder the burden of being seized whenever the law may be susceptible to an interpretive question. Moreover, the Court fails to reconcile its belief that the Fourth Amendment gives officers leeway to address situations where the application of a criminal statute may be unclear with our prior assumption that the Fourth Amendment does not give officers such leeway where they rely on a statute that authorizes police conduct that may violate the Fourth Amendment.

Nor does it engage with the analytic consequences of North Carolina's similar concession that it does not mean to claim\n   \"that an officer's mistaken understanding of the Fourth Amendment itself can support a seizure if that understanding was reasonable.\" Brief for Respondent 29. It is not clear why an officer's mistaken understanding of other laws should be viewed differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   While I appreciate that the Court has endeavored to set some bounds on the types of mistakes of law that it thinks will qualify as reasonable, and while I think that the set of reasonable mistakes of law ought to be narrowly circumscribed if they are to be countenanced at all, I am not at all convinced that the Court has done so in a clear way. It seems to me that the difference between qualified immunity's reasonableness standard-which the Court insists without elaboration does not apply here-and the Court's conception of reasonableness in this context-which remains undefined-will prove murky in application. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 539 - 540. I fear the Court's unwillingness to sketch a fuller view of what makes a mistake of law reasonable only presages the likely difficulty that courts will have applying the Court's decision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   To my mind, the more administrable approach-and the one more consistent with our precedents and principles-would be to hold that an officer's mistake of law, no matter how reasonable, cannot support the individualized suspicion necessary to justify a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.
