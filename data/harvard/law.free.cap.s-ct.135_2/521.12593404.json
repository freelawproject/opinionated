We hold that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner Gregory Warger was riding his motorcycle on a highway outside Rapid City, South Dakota, when a truck driven by respondent Randy Shauers struck him from behind. Warger claims he was stopped at the time of the accident, while Shauers claims that Warger suddenly pulled out in front of him. Regardless of the cause of the accident, no one disputes its tragic result: Warger sustained serious injuries that ultimately required the amputation of his left leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Warger sued Shauers for negligence in Federal District Court. During jury selection, counsel for both parties conducted lengthy\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   of the prospective jurors. Warger's counsel asked whether any jurors would be unable to award damages for pain and suffering or for future medical expenses, or whether there was any juror who thought, \"I don't think I could be a fair and impartial juror on this kind of case.\" App. 105. Prospective juror Regina Whipple, who was later selected as the jury foreperson, answered no to each of these questions. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 83, 89, 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Trial commenced, and the jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of Shauers. Shortly thereafter, one of the jurors contacted Warger's counsel to express concern over juror Whipple's conduct. The complaining juror subsequently signed an affidavit claiming that Whipple had spoken during deliberations about \"a motor vehicle collision in which her daughter was at fault for the collision and a man died,\" and had \"related that if her daughter had been sued, it would have ruined her life.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a-41a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Relying on this affidavit, Warger moved for a new trial. He contended that Whipple had deliberately lied during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   about her impartiality and ability to award damages. Thus, he asserted, he had satisfied the requirements of\n   <em>\n    McDonough Power\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    464 U.S. 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    78 L.Ed.2d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), which holds that a party may \"obtain a new trial\" if he \"demonstrate[s] that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   and ... that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 556,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The District Court refused to grant a new trial, holding that the only evidence that supported Warger's motion, the complaining juror's affidavit, was barred by Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b). As relevant here, that Rule provides that \"[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict,\" evidence \"about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury's deliberations\" is inadmissible. Rule 606(b)(1). The Rule contains three specific exceptions-allowing testimony \"about whether (A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention; (B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form,\" Rule 606(b)(2)-but the District Court found none of these exceptions to be applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755662\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/606/\">\n    721 F.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). It first held that Warger's proffered evidence did not fall within the \"extraneous prejudicial evidence\" exception set forth in Rule 606(b)(2)(A). The court explained that \"[j]urors' personal experiences do not constitute extraneous information; it is unavoidable they will bring such innate experiences into the jury room.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 611. Next, the court rejected Warger's alternative argument that Rule 606(b)is wholly inapplicable when a litigant offers evidence to show that a juror was dishonest during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   . Acknowledging that there was a split among the Federal Courts of Appeals on this question, the Eighth Circuit joined those Circuits that had held that Rule 606(b)applies to any proceeding in which the jury's verdict might be invalidated, including efforts to demonstrate that a juror lied during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   .

In doing so, we simply accord Rule 606(b)'s terms their plain meaning. The Rule, after all, applies \"[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict.\" Rule 606(b)(1). A postverdict motion for a new trial on the ground of\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   dishonesty plainly entails \"an inquiry into the validity of [the] verdict\": If a juror was dishonest during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   and an honest response would have provided a valid basis to challenge that juror for cause, the verdict must be invalidated.

Although some common-law courts would have permitted evidence of jury deliberations to be introduced to demonstrate juror dishonesty during\n   <em>\n    voir dire,\n   </em>\n   the majority would not, and the language of Rule 606(b)reflects Congress' enactment of the\n   more restrictive version of the common-law rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Rule 606(b)had its genesis in\n   <em>\n    Vaise v. Delaval,\n   </em>\n   1 T.R. 11, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K.B. 1785), in which Lord Mansfield held inadmissible an affidavit from two jurors claiming that the jury had decided the case through a game of chance. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2352, p. 696 (J. McNaughton rev. 1961). The rule soon took root in the United States,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 696-697, where it was viewed as both promoting the finality of verdicts and insulating the jury from outside influences, see\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

Under what was sometimes known as the \"Iowa\" approach, juror testimony regarding deliberations was excluded only to the extent that it related to matters that \" 'inhere[d] in the verdict,' \" which generally consisted of evidence of the jurors' subjective intentions and thought processes in reaching a verdict. 3 C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \u00a7 6:16, p. 70 (4th ed.2013); 8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 2353, 2354, at 699-702.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A number of courts adhering to the Iowa rule held that testimony regarding jury deliberations is admissible when used to challenge juror conduct during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   .

Under this version, sometimes called the \"federal\" approach, litigants were prohibited from using evidence of jury deliberations unless it was offered to show that an \"extraneous matter\" had influenced the jury. See 3 Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \u00a7 6:16, at 71; Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20F.R.D.%20183\">\n    56 F.R.D. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 265 (1973).

Therefore, Warger asserts, the \"inquiry begins and ends with what happened during voir dire.\" Brief for Petitioner 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We are not persuaded. Warger, it seems, would restrict Rule 606(b)'s application to those claims of error for which a court must examine the manner in which the jury reached its verdict-claims, one might say, involving an inquiry into the jury's verdict. But the \"inquiry\" to which the Rule refers is one into the \"\n   <em>\n    validity\n   </em>\n   of the verdict,\" not into the verdict itself. The Rule does not focus on the means by which deliberations evidence might be used to invalidate a verdict. It does not say \"during an inquiry into jury deliberations,\" or prohibit the introduction of evidence of deliberations \"for use in determining whether an asserted error affected the jury's verdict.\" It simply applies \"[d]uring an inquiry into the validity of the verdict\"-that is, during a\n   <em>\n    proceeding\n   </em>\n   in which the verdict may be rendered invalid. Whether or not a juror's alleged misconduct during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   had a direct effect on the jury's verdict, the motion for a new trial requires a court to determine whether the verdict can stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, Warger contends that excluding jury deliberations evidence tending to show that a juror lied during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   is unnecessary to fulfill Congress' apparent objectives of encouraging full and open debate in the jury room and preventing the harassment of former jurors. He observes that jurors remain free to, and may sometimes be forced to, disclose what happened in the jury room, and that ethical rules limit the ability of parties to harass jurors following trial. But these are arguments against Rule 606(b)generally, not arguments for the particular exception to the Rule that Warger seeks. Congress' enactment of Rule 606(b)was premised on the concerns that the use of deliberations evidence to challenge verdicts would represent a threat to both jurors and finality in those circumstances not covered by the Rule's express exceptions. Warger cannot escape the scope of the Rule Congress adopted simply by asserting that its concerns were misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nor do we accept Warger's contention that we must adopt his interpretation of Rule 606(b)so as to avoid constitutional concerns. The Constitution guarantees both criminal and civil litigants a right to an impartial jury. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheppard v.

Similarly here, a party's right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 606(b)'s removal of one means of ensuring that jurors are unbiased. Even if jurors lie in\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in a way that conceals bias, juror impartiality is adequately assured by the parties' ability to bring to the court's attention any evidence of bias before the verdict is rendered, and to employ nonjuror evidence even after the verdict is rendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We further hold, consonant with the Eighth Circuit, that the affidavit Warger sought to introduce was not admissible under Rule 606(b)(2)(A)'s exception for evidence as to whether \"extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Generally speaking, information is deemed \"extraneous\" if it derives from a source \"external\" to the jury.

See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 117-119,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28154\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/107/#p123\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 27 C. Wright &amp; V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \u00a7 6075, pp. 520-521 (2d ed. 2007). Here, the excluded affidavit falls on the \"internal\" side of the line: Whipple's daughter's accident may well have informed her general views about negligence liability for car crashes, but it did not provide either her or the rest of the jury with any specific knowledge regarding Shauers' collision with Warger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Indeed, Warger does not argue that Whipple's statements related to \"extraneous\" information in this sense. Instead, he contends that because Whipple would have been disqualified from the jury had she disclosed her daughter's accident,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   information she shared with the other jurors was extraneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We cannot agree that whenever a juror should have been excluded from the jury, anything that juror says is necessarily \"extraneous\" within the meaning of Rule 606(b)(2)(A). Were that correct, parties would find it quite easy to avoid Rule 606(b)'s limitations. As discussed above, Congress adopted the restrictive version of the anti-impeachment rule, one that common-law courts had concluded precludes parties from using deliberations evidence to prove juror dishonesty during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   . But if Warger's understanding of the \"extraneous\" information exception were accepted, then any time a party could use such evidence to show that a juror's \"correct response [during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   ] would have provided a valid basis for a challenge\"-a prerequisite for relief under\n   <em>\n    McDonough,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    464 U.S., at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -all evidence of what that juror said during deliberations would be admissible.
