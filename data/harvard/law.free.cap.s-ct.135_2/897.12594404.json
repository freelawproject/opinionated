Enacted in 1968 in response to a growing number of complex but related cases filed in multiple districts, \u00a7 1407authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to transfer civil actions \"involving one or more common questions of fact ... to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings\" in order to \"promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions.\" \u00a7 1407(a); see H.R.Rep. No. 1130, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1968) (\u00a7 1407codified procedures used in the early 1960's to resolve more than 1,800 separate actions filed against electrical equipment manufacturers in 33 District Courts, all of the actions seeking damages for antitrust law violations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Transfer under \u00a7 1407aims to \"eliminate duplication in discovery, avoid conflicting rulings and schedules, reduce litigation cost, and save the time and effort of the parties, the attorneys, the witnesses, and the courts.\" Manual for Complex Litigation \u00a7 20.131, p. 220 (4th ed. 2004). \"Each action\" transferred pursuant to \u00a7 1407, the provision instructs, \"shall be remanded by the panel at or before the conclusion of ... pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred unless it shall have been previously terminated.\" \u00a7 1407(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a benchmark interest rate disseminated by the British Bankers' Association based on the rate at which certain banks predict they can borrow funds. LIBOR is a reference point in determining interest rates for financial instruments in the United States and globally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In August 2011, the JPML established MDL No. 2262 (LIBOR MDL) for cases involving allegations that the banks named as defendants understated their borrowing costs, thereby depressing LIBOR and enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial instruments sold to investors.\n   <em>\n    In re Libor-Based Financial Instruments Antitrust Litigation,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160934\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/802/1380/\">\n    802 F.Supp.2d 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (JPML 2011). Composing the LIBOR MDL, over 60 actions, commenced in California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, were coordinated or consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In June 2012, the District Court entertained a motion to dismiss four categories of cases included in the MDL. The first three categories involved putative class actions, each with a single lead case: (1) the Gelboim-Zacher action, filed on behalf of purchasers of bonds with LIBOR-linked interest rates; (2) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of over-the-counter LIBOR-based instruments (OTC plaintiffs); (3) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of LIBOR-based instruments on exchanges (Exchange plaintiffs). The fourth category, not relevant here, comprised a set of individual actions filed by Charles Schwab Corporation and related entities. The Gelboim-Zacher complaint asserted a federal antitrust claim under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that claim only, while the complaints in the other actions asserted a federal antitrust claim in addition to other differently based federal and state claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Determining that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable antitrust injury, the District Court granted the banks' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' antitrust claims-the sole claim raised in the Gelboim-Zacher complaint. Assuming that the Gelboim-Zacher plaintiffs were entitled to an immediate\n   appeal of right under \u00a7 1291because their suit had been \"dismissed in [its] entirety,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a, the District Court granted Rule 54(b)certifications to the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs authorizing them to appeal the dismissal of their antitrust claims while their other claims remained pending in the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On its own initiative, the Second Circuit dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher appeal because the \"orde[r] appealed from did not dispose of all claims in the consolidated action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court thereafter withdrew its Rule 54(b)certifications in the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs' actions and, \"given the reaction of the Second Circuit,\" App. 294, denied petitioners' request for a Rule 54(b)certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We granted review of the Second Circuit's judgment dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher appeal. 573 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582857,12582858,12582859,12582860,12582861,12582862\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2876/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582825,12582826,12582827,12582859,12582831,12582845\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/189/832/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Before this Court, petitioners Gelboim and Zacher contend that the order dismissing their case in its entirety removed them from the consolidated proceeding, thereby triggering their right to appeal under \u00a7 1291. Respondent banks urge that consolidated cases proceed as one unit for the duration of the consolidation. Consequently, they maintain, there is no appeal of right from an order dismissing fewer than all consolidated claims, thus the sole avenue for appeal while the consolidation continues is Rule 54(b). Agreeing with Gelboim and Zacher, we reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordinarily retain their separate identities,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   so an order disposing of one of the discrete cases in its entirety should qualify under \u00a7 1291as an appealable final decision. Section 1407refers to individual \"actions\" which may be transferred to a single district court, not to any monolithic multidistrict \"action\" created by transfer. See\n   <em>\n    Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503127\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/26/#p37\">\n    523 U.S. 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503127\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/26/#p37\">\n    118 S.Ct. 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503127\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/26/#p37\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998)(\u00a7 1407does not \"imbu[e] transferred actions with some new and distinctive ... character\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Congress anticipated\n   that, during the pendency of pretrial proceedings, final decisions might be rendered in one or more of the actions consolidated pursuant to \u00a7 1407. It specified that \"at or before the conclusion of ... pretrial proceedings,\" each of the transferred actions must be remanded to the originating district \"\n   <em>\n    unless [the action] shall have been previously terminated\n   </em>\n   .\" \u00a7 1407(a)(emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The District Court's order dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher complaint for lack of antitrust injury, without leave to amend, had the hallmarks of a final decision. Ruling on the merits of the case, the District Court completed its adjudication of petitioners' complaint and terminated their action. As a result of the District Court's disposition, petitioners are no longer participants in the consolidated proceedings. Nothing about the initial consolidation of their civil action with other cases in the LIBOR MDL renders the dismissal of their complaint in any way tentative or incomplete. As is ordinarily the case, the \u00a7 1407consolidation offered convenience for the parties and promoted efficient judicial administration, but did not meld the Gelboim-Zacher action and others in the MDL into a single unit. Cf.\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 904, n. 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The banks' view that, in a \u00a7 1407consolidation, no appeal of right accrues until the consolidation ends would leave plaintiffs like Gelboim and Zacher in a quandary about the proper timing of their appeals. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4, which this Court has called \"jurisdictional,\"\n   <em>\n    Bowles v. Russell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573311\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/205/#p209\">\n    551 U.S. 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573311\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/205/#p209\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573311\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/205/#p209\">\n    168 L.Ed.2d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed \"within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from,\" Rule 4(a)(1)(A). If plaintiffs whose actions have been dismissed with prejudice by a district court must await the termination of pretrial proceedings in all consolidated cases, what event or order would start the 30-day clock? When pretrial consolidation concludes, there may be no occasion for the entry of any judgment. Orders may issue returning cases to their originating courts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but an order of that genre would not qualify as the dispositive ruling Gelboim and Zacher seek to overturn on appeal. And surely would-be appellants need not await final disposition of all cases in their originating districts, long after pretrial consolidation under \u00a7 1407could even arguably justify treating the cases as a judicial unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The sensible solution to the appeal-clock trigger is evident: When the transferee court overseeing pretrial proceedings in multidistrict litigation grants a defendant's dispositive motion \"on all issues in\n   some transferred cases, [those cases] become immediately appealable ... while cases where other issues remain would not be appealable at that time.\" D. Herr, Multidistrict Litigation Manual \u00a7 9:21, p. 312 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The banks express concern that plaintiffs with the weakest cases may be positioned to appeal because their complaint states only one claim, while plaintiffs with stronger cases will be unable to appeal simultaneously because they have other claims still pending. Brief for Respondents 46-47. Rule 54(b)attends to this concern. District courts may grant certifications under that Rule, thereby enabling plaintiffs in actions that have not been dismissed in their entirety to pursue immediate appellate review. That is just what happened in this very case. The District Court granted Rule 54(b)certifications to the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs so they could appeal at the same time Gelboim and Zacher could. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 903 - 904. And if the MDL court believes that further proceedings might be relevant to a claim a defendant moves to dismiss, the court ordinarily can defer ruling on the motion, thus allowing all plaintiffs to participate in the ongoing MDL proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While Rule 54(b)can aid parties with multiple-claim complaints-here, the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 903 - 904-the rule, properly read, is of no avail to Gelboim and Zacher. Rule 54(b)addresses orders finally adjudicating fewer than all claims presented in a civil action complaint. It \"does not apply to a single claim action nor to a multiple claims action in which all of the claims have been finally decided.\"\n   <em>\n    Mackey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1105215\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/351/427/#p434\">\n    351 U.S., at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1105215\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/351/427/#p434\">\n    76 S.Ct. 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.
