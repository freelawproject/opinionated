The retirees (and their former union) claim that these agreements created a right to lifetime contribution-free health care benefits for retirees, their surviving spouses, and their dependents. The employer, for its part, claims that those provisions terminated when the agreements expired. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit sided with the retirees, relying on its conclusion in\n   <em>\n    International Union, United Auto., Aerospace, &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1890821\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/716/1476/#p1479\">\n    716 F.2d 1476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1479 (1983), that retiree health care benefits are unlikely to be left up to future negotiations. We granted certiorari and now conclude that such reasoning is incompatible with ordinary principles of contract law. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for it to apply ordinary principles of contract law in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Respondents Hobert Freel Tackett, Woodrow K. Pyles, and Harlan B. Conley worked at (and retired from) the Point Pleasant Polyester Plant in Apple Grove, West Virginia (hereinafter referred to as the Plant). During their employment, respondent United Steel, Paper and Forestry,\n   Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO-CLC, or its predecessor unions (hereinafter referred to as the Union), represented them in collective bargaining. Tackett and Pyles retired in 1996, and Conley retired in 1998. They represent a class of retired employees from the Plant, along with their surviving spouses and other dependents. Petitioner M &amp; G Polymers USA, LLC, is the current owner of the Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When M &amp; G purchased the Plant in 2000, it entered a master collective-bargaining agreement and a Pension, Insurance, and Service Award Agreement (P &amp; I agreement) with the Union, generally similar to agreements the Union had negotiated with M &amp; G's predecessor. The P &amp; I agreement provided for retiree health care benefits as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Employees who retire on or after January 1, 1996 and who are eligible for and receiving a monthly pension under the 1993 Pension Plan ... whose full years of attained age and full years of attained continuous service ... at the time of retirement equals 95 or more points will receive a full Company contribution towards the cost of [health care] benefits described in this Exhibit B-1.... Employees who have less than 95 points at the time of retirement will receive a reduced Company contribution. The Company contribution will be reduced by 2% for every point less than 95. Employees will be required to pay the balance of the health care contribution, as estimated by the Company annually in advance, for the [health care] benefits described in this Exhibit B-1. Failure to pay the required medical contribution will result in cancellation of coverage.\" App. 415-416.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Exhibit B-1, which described the health care benefits at issue, opened with the following durational clause: \"Effective January 1, 1998, and for the duration of this Agreement thereafter, the Employer will provide the following program of hospital benefits, hospital-medical benefits, surgical benefits and prescription drug benefits for eligible employees and their dependents....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 377-378 (emphasis deleted).

Respondent retirees, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, sued M &amp; G and related entities, alleging that the decision to require these contributions breached both the collective-bargaining agreement and the P &amp; I agreement, in violation of \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA) and \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Stat.%20891\">\n    88 Stat. 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the retirees alleged that M &amp; G had promised to provide lifetime contribution-free health care benefits for them, their surviving spouses, and their dependents. They pointed to the language in the 2000 P &amp; I agreement providing that employees with a certain level of seniority \"will receive a\n   full Company contribution towards the cost of [health care] benefits described in ...

Specifically, the court inferred that parties to collective bargaining would intend retiree benefits to vest for life because such benefits are \"not mandatory\" or required to be included in collective-bargaining agreements, are \"typically understood as a form of delayed compensation or reward for past services,\" and are keyed to the acquisition of retirement status.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The court concluded that these inferences \"outweigh[ed] any contrary implications [about the termination of retiree benefits] derived from\" general termination clauses.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1483.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   inferences on review of the District Court's dismissal of the action, the Court of Appeals concluded that the retirees had stated a plausible claim.\n   <em>\n    Tackett I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481255\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/478/\">\n    561 F.3d, at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Keeping in mind the context of the labor-management negotiations identified in\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man,\n   </em>\n   \" the court found \"it unlikely that [the Union] would agree to language that ensures its members a 'full Company contribution,' if the company could unilaterally change the level of contribution.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The court construed the language about \"employees\" contributing to their health care premiums as limited to employees who had not attained the requisite seniority points to be entitled to a full company contribution.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   And it discerned an intent to vest lifetime contribution-free health care benefits from provisions tying eligibility for health care benefits to eligibility for pension benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 490-491.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On remand, the District Court conducted a bench trial and ruled in favor of the retirees. It declined to revisit the question whether the P &amp; I agreement created a vested right to retiree benefits, concluding that the Court of Appeals had definitively resolved that issue.

When collective-bargaining agreements create pension or welfare benefits plans, those plans are subject to rules established in ERISA. ERISA defines pension plans as plans, funds, or programs that \"provid[e] retirement income to employees\" or that \"resul[t] in a deferral of income.\" \u00a7 1002(2)(A). It defines welfare benefits plans as plans, funds, or programs established or maintained to provide participants with additional benefits, such as life insurance and disability coverage. \u00a7 1002(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ERISA treats these two types of plans differently. Although ERISA imposes elaborate minimum funding and vesting standards for pension plans, \u00a7\u00a7 1053, 1082, 1083, 1084, it explicitly exempts welfare benefits plans from those rules, \u00a7\u00a7 1051(1), 1081(a)(1). Welfare benefits plans must be \"established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,\" \u00a7 1102(a)(1), but \"[e]mployers or other plan sponsors are generally free under ERISA, for any reason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate welfare plans,\"\n   <em>\n    Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.

Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 30:6, p. 108 (4th ed. 2012)(Williston) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the Court of Appeals applied the\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   inferences to conclude that, in the absence of extrinsic evidence to the contrary, the provisions of the contract indicated an intent to vest retirees with lifetime benefits.\n   <em>\n    Tackett II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714239\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/589/#p600\">\n    733 F.3d, at 599-600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   itself, the court purported to apply \"traditional rules for contractual interpretation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1890821\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/716/1476/#p1479\">\n    716 F.2d, at 1479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court first concluded that the provision governing retiree insurance benefits-which stated only that the employer \"will provide\" such benefits-was ambiguous as to the duration of those benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1480. To resolve that ambiguity, it looked to other provisions of the agreement. The agreement included provisions for terminating active employees' insurance benefits in the case of layoffs and for terminating benefits for a retiree's spouse and dependents in case of the retiree's death before the expiration of the collective-bargaining agreement, but no provision specifically addressed the duration of retiree health care benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1481-1482. From the existence of these termination provisions and the absence of a termination provision specifically addressing retiree benefits, the court inferred an intent to vest those retiree benefits for life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court then purported to apply the rule that contracts should be interpreted to avoid illusory promises. It noted that the retiree insurance provisions \"contain[ed] a promise that the company will pay an early retiree's insurance upon such retiree reaching age 65 but that the retiree must bear the cost of company insurance until that time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1481. Employees could retire at age 55, but the agreement containing this promise applied only for a 3-year term.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Thus, retirees between the ages of 55 and 62 would not turn 65 and become eligible for the company contribution before the 3-year agreement expired. In light of this fact, the court reasoned that the promise would be \"completely illusory for many early retirees under age 62\" if the retiree benefits terminated when the contract expired.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1890821\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/716/1476/#p1479\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, the court turned to \"the context\" of labor negotiations.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1482. It observed that \"[b]enefits for retirees are ... not mandatory subjects of collective bargaining\" and that \"employees are presumably aware that the union owes no obligation to bargain for continued benefits for retirees.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Based on these observations, the court concluded that \"it is unlikely that such benefits ... would be left to the contingencies of future negotiations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1890821\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/716/1476/#p1479\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1890821\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/716/1476/#p1479\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   It also asserted that \"retiree benefits are in a sense 'status' benefits which, as such, carry with them an inference that they continue so long as the prerequisite status is maintained.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1890821\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/716/1476/#p1479\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although the contract included a general durational clause-meaning that the contract itself would expire at a set time-the court concluded that these contextual clues \"outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a routine duration clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1483.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Two years after\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man,\n   </em>\n   the court took this analysis even further. In a dispute between retirees and a steel company over retiree health insurance benefits, it construed the language \"will continue to provide at its expense, supplemental medicare and major medical benefits for Pensioners aged 65 and over\" to \"\n   <em>\n    unambiguously\n   </em>\n   confe[r]\" lifetime benefits.\n   <em>\n    Policy v.

Worse, the Court of Appeals has taken the inferences in\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   and applied them indiscriminately across industries. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1074 (automobile);\n   <em>\n    Armistead v.

For example,\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   relied in part on the premise that retiree health care benefits are not subjects of mandatory collective bargaining. Parties, however, can and do voluntarily agree to make retiree benefits a subject of mandatory collective bargaining. Indeed, the employer and union in this case entered such an agreement in 2001. App. 435-436.\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   also relied on the premise that retiree benefits are a form of deferred compensation, but that characterization is contrary to Congress' determination otherwise. In ERISA, Congress specifically defined plans that \"resul[t] in a deferral of income by employees\" as pension plans, \u00a7 1002(2)(A)(ii), and plans that offer medical benefits as welfare plans, \u00a7 1002(1)(A). Thus, retiree health care benefits are not a form of deferred compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Further compounding this error, the Court of Appeals has refused to apply general durational clauses to provisions governing retiree benefits. Having inferred that parties would not leave retiree benefits to the contingencies of future negotiations, and that retiree benefits generally last as long as the recipient remains a retiree, the court in\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   explicitly concluded that these inferences \"outweigh[ed] any contrary implications derived from a routine duration clause terminating the agreement generally.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1890821\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/716/1476/#p1479\">\n    716 F.2d, at 1482-1483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court's subsequent decisions went even further, requiring a contract to include a specific durational clause for retiree health care benefits to prevent vesting.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noe, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 555. These decisions distort the text of the agreement and conflict with the principle of contract law that the written agreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement of the parties. See 1 W. Story, Law of Contracts \u00a7 780 (M. Bigelow ed., 5th ed. 1874); see also 11 Williston \u00a7 31:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Perhaps tugged by these inferences, the Court of Appeals misapplied other traditional principles of contract law, including the illusory promises doctrine. That doctrine instructs courts to avoid constructions of contracts that would render promises illusory because such promises cannot serve as consideration for a contract. See 3 Williston \u00a7 7:7 (4th ed. 2008). But the Court of Appeals construed provisions that admittedly benefited some class of retirees as \"illusory\" merely because they did not equally benefit\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   retirees. See\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1480-1481. That interpretation is a contradiction in terms-a promise that is \"partly\n   <em>\n    \"\n   </em>\n   illusory is by definition not illusory. If it benefits some class of retirees, then it may serve as consideration for the union's promises. And the court's interpretation is particularly inappropriate in the context of collective-bargaining agreements, which are negotiated on behalf of a broad category of individuals and consequently will often include provisions inapplicable to some category of employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court of Appeals also failed even to consider the traditional principle that courts should not construe ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises. See 3 A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 553, p. 216 (1960) (explaining that contracts that are silent as to their duration will ordinarily be treated not as \"operative in perpetuity\" but as \"operative for a reasonable time\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The court recognized that \"traditional rules of contractual interpretation require a clear manifestation of intent before conferring a benefit or obligation,\" but asserted that \"the duration of the benefit once clearly conferred is [not] subject to this\n   stricture.\"\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1481, n. 2. In stark contrast to this assertion, however, the court later applied that very stricture to noncollectively bargained contracts offering retiree benefits. See\n   <em>\n    Sprague v. General Motors Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22348\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/388/#p400\">\n    133 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (C.A.6 1998)(\"To vest benefits is to render them forever unalterable. Because vesting of welfare plan benefits is not required by law, an employer's commitment to vest such benefits is not to be inferred lightly; the intent to vest must be found in the plan documents and must be stated in clear and express language\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The different treatment of these two types of employment contracts only underscores\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   's deviation from ordinary principles of contract law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Similarly, the Court of Appeals failed to consider the traditional principle that \"contractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the bargaining agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107959\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/190/#p207\">\n    501 U.S. 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107959\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/190/#p207\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107959\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/190/#p207\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). That principle does not preclude the conclusion that the parties intended to vest lifetime benefits for retirees. Indeed, we have already recognized that \"a collective-bargaining agreement [may] provid[e] in explicit terms that certain benefits continue after the agreement's expiration.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   But when a contract is silent as to the duration of retiree benefits, a court may not infer that the parties intended those benefits to vest for life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There is no doubt that\n   <em>\n    Yard-Man\n   </em>\n   and its progeny affected the outcome here.
