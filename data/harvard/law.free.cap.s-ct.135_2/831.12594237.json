And, it requires us to determine what standard the Court of Appeals should use when it reviews a trial judge's resolution of an underlying factual dispute. Should the Court of Appeals review the district court's factfinding\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   as it would review a question of law? Or, should it review that factfinding as it would review a trial judge's factfinding in other cases, namely by taking them as correct \"unless clearly erroneous?\" See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6). We hold that the appellate court must apply a \"clear error,\" not a\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The basic dispute in this case concerns the meaning of the words \"molecular weight\" as those words appear in a patent claim. The petitioners, Teva Pharmaceuticals (along with related firms), own the relevant patent. The patent covers a manufacturing method for Copaxone, a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis. The drug's active ingredient, called \"copolymer-1,\" is made up of molecules of varying sizes. App. 1143a. And the relevant claim describes that ingredient as having \"a molecular weight of 5 to 9 kilodaltons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744942\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/370/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744942\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/370/\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 1145a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and several other firms), tried to market a generic version of Copaxone. Teva sued Sandoz for patent infringement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177790\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/810/578/#p581\">\n    810 F.Supp.2d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 581 (S.D.N.Y.2011). Sandoz defended the suit by arguing that the patent was invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177790\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/810/578/#p581\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177790\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/810/578/#p581\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The Patent Act requires that a claim \"particularly poin[t] out and distinctly clai[m] the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\u00b6 2 (2006 ed.); see\n   <em>\n    Nautilus, Inc. v.

The phrase \"molecular weight of 5 to 9 kilodaltons,\" said Sandoz, did not satisfy this requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The reason that the phrase is fatally indefinite, Sandoz argued, is that, in the context of this patent claim, the term \"molecular weight\" might mean any one of three different things. The phrase might refer (1) to molecular weight as calculated by the weight of the molecule that is most prevalent in the mix that makes up copolymer-1. (The scientific term for molecular weight so calculated is, we are told, \"peak average molecular weight.\") The phrase might refer (2) to molecular weight as calculated by taking all the different-sized molecules in the mix that makes up copolymer-1 and calculating the average weight,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   adding up the weight of each molecule and dividing by the number of molecules. (The scientific term for molecular weight so calculated is, we are told, \"number average molecular weight.\") Or, the phrase might refer (3) to molecular weight as calculated by taking all the different-sized molecules in the mix that makes up copolymer-1 and calculating their average weight while giving heavier molecules a weight-related bonus when doing so. (The scientific term for molecular weight so calculated, we are told, is \"weight average molecular weight.\") See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065641\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/1363/#p1367\">\n    723 F.3d 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1367 (C.A.Fed.2013); App. 124a. In Sandoz's view, since Teva's patent claim does not say which method of calculation should be used, the claim's phrase \"molecular weight\" is indefinite, and the claim fails to satisfy the critical patent law requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The District Court, after taking evidence from experts, concluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite. Among other things, it found that in context a skilled artisan would understand that the term \"molecular weight\" referred to molecular weight as calculated by the first method,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"peak average molecular weight.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177790\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/810/578/#p581\">\n    810 F.Supp.2d, at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   <em>\n    Nautilus, supra,\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580976,12707010\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2120/\">\n    134 S.Ct., at 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he definiteness inquiry trains on the understanding of a skilled artisan at the time of the patent application\").

It found that the term \"molecular weight\" was indefinite. And it consequently held the patent invalid.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065641\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/1363/#p1367\">\n    723 F.3d, at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, the Federal Circuit reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   all aspects of the District Court's claim construction, including the District Court's determination of subsidiary facts.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1369, 1373; see also\n   <em>\n    Lighting Ballast Control LLC v.

After all, the Federal Circuit will continue to review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the district court's ultimate interpretation of the patent claims.

Moreover, it is always possible to consolidate for discovery different cases that involve construction of the same claims. And, as we said in\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   , subsidiary factfinding is unlikely to loom large in the universe of litigated claim construction.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 389-390,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744942\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/370/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The dissent argues that claim construction does not involve any \"factfinding,\" or, if it does, claim construction factfinding is akin to the factfinding that underlies our interpretation of statutes.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 844, 846 - 848 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).

Indeed, as discussed in Part III,\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   this case provides a perfect example of the factfinding that sometimes underlies claim construction: The parties here presented the District Court with competing fact-related claims by different experts, and the District Court resolved the issues of fact that divided those experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The dissent's contention also runs contrary to Sandoz's concession at oral argument that claim construction will sometimes require subsidiary factfinding. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34, 38-40. It is in tension with our interpretation of related areas of patent law, such as the interpretation of \"obviousness,\" which we have said involves subsidiary factfinding subject to Rule 52(a)'s clear error review. See\n   <em>\n    Dennison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209345\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/809/#p811\">\n    475 U.S., at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209345\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/809/#p811\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it fights the question presented in this case, which\n   <em>\n    assumes\n   </em>\n   the existence of such factfinding. See Pet. for Cert. i (whether \"a district court's factual finding in support of its construction of a patent claim term may be reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   ... or only for clear error\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Neither do we find factfinding in this context sufficiently similar to the factfinding that underlies statutory interpretation. Statutes, in general, address themselves to the general public; patent claims concern a small portion of that public. Statutes typically (though not always) rest upon congressional consideration of general facts related to a reasonably broad set of social circumstances; patents typically (though not always) rest upon consideration by a few private parties, experts, and administrators of more narrowly circumscribed facts related to specific technical matters. The public, and often an adversarial public, typically considers and discusses the relevant general facts before Congress enacts a statute; only private parties, experts, and administrators likely consider the relevant technical facts before the award of a patent. Given these differences, it is not surprising that this Court has never previously compared patent claim construction in any here relevant way to statutory construction. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 837, however, the Court has repeatedly compared patent claim construction to the construction of other written instruments such as deeds and contracts.

We recognize that a district\n   court's construction of a patent claim, like a district court's interpretation of a written instrument, often requires the judge only to examine and to construe the document's words without requiring the judge to resolve any underlying factual disputes. As all parties agree, when the district court reviews only evidence intrinsic to the patent (the patent claims and specifications, along with the patent's prosecution history), the judge's determination will amount solely to a determination of law, and the Court of Appeals will review that construction\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   See Brief for Petitioners 27, Reply Brief 16; Brief for Respondents 43; see also Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In some cases, however, the district court will need to look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence and to consult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the background science or the meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seymour v. Osborne,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3412564\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/78/516/#p546\">\n    11 Wall. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 546,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3412564\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/78/516/#p546\">\n    20 L.Ed. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1871)(a patent may be \"so interspersed with technical terms and terms of art that the testimony of scientific witnesses is indispensable to a correct understanding of its meaning\"). In cases where those subsidiary facts are in dispute, courts will need to make subsidiary factual findings about that extrinsic evidence. These are the \"evidentiary underpinnings\" of claim construction that we discussed in\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   , and this subsidiary factfinding must be reviewed for clear error on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For example, if a district court resolves a dispute between experts and makes a factual finding that, in general, a certain term of art had a particular meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention, the district court must then conduct a legal analysis: whether a skilled artisan would ascribe that same meaning to that term\n   <em>\n    in the context of the specific patent claim under review\n   </em>\n   . That is because \"[e]xperts may be examined to explain terms of art, and the state of the art, at any given time,\" but they cannot be used to prove \"the proper or legal construction of any instrument of writing.\"\n   <em>\n    Winans v.

The district judge, after deciding the factual dispute, will then interpret the patent claim in light of the facts as he has found them. This ultimate interpretation is a legal conclusion. The appellate court can still review the district court's ultimate construction of the claim\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . But, to overturn the judge's resolution of an underlying factual dispute, the Court of Appeals must find that the judge, in respect to those factual findings, has made a clear error. Fed. Rule Civ.

But in some instances, a factual finding may be close to\n   dispositive of the ultimate legal question of the proper meaning of the term in the context of the patent. Nonetheless, the ultimate question of construction will remain a legal question. Simply because a factual finding may be nearly dispositive does not render the subsidiary question a legal one. \"[A]n issue does not lose its factual character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the ultimate\" legal question.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

It is analogous to a judge (sitting without a jury) deciding whether a defendant gave a confession voluntarily.

An appellate court similarly should review for clear error those factual findings that underlie a district court's claim construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We can illustrate our holding by considering an instance in which Teva, with the support of the Solicitor General, argues that the Federal Circuit wrongly reviewed the District Court's factual finding\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   See Brief for Petitioners 54-56; Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   31-32. Recall that Teva's patent claim specifies an active ingredient with a \"molecular weight of about 5 to 9 kilodaltons.\" Recall Sandoz's basic argument, namely that the term \"molecular weight\" is indefinite or ambiguous. The term might refer to the weight of the most numerous molecule, it might refer to weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules, or it might refer to weight as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules count for more. The claim, Sandoz argues, does not tell us which way we should calculate weight. See Part I,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To illustrate, imagine we have a sample of copolymer-1 (the active ingredient) made up of 10 molecules: 4 weigh 6 kilodaltons each, 3 weigh 8 kilodaltons each, and 3 weigh 9 kilodaltons each. Using the first method of calculation, the \"molecular weight\" would be 6 kilodaltons, the weight of the most prevalent molecule. Using the second method, the molecular weight would be 7.5 (total weight, 75, divided by the number of molecules, 10). Using the third method, the molecular weight would be more than 8, depending upon how much extra weight we gave to the heavier molecules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Teva argued in the District Court that the term \"molecular weight\" in the patent meant molecular weight calculated in the first way (the weight of the most prevalent molecule, or peak average molecular weight). Sandoz, however, argued that figure 1 of the patent showed that Teva could not be right.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177790\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/810/578/#p581\">\n    810 F.Supp.2d, at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (We have set forth figure 1 in the Appendix,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ). That figure, said Sandoz, helped to show that the patent term did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   refer to the first method of calculation. Figure 1 shows how the weights of a sample's molecules were distributed in three different samples. The curves indicate the number of molecules of each weight that were present in each of the three. For example, the figure's legend says that the first sample's \"molecular weight\" is 7.7. According to Teva, that should mean that molecules weighing 7.7 kilodaltons were the most prevalent molecules in the sample. But, look at the curve, said Sandoz. It shows that the most prevalent molecule\n   weighed, not 7.7 kilodaltons, but slightly less than 7.7 (about 6.8) kilodaltons. See App. 138a-139a. After all, the\n   <em>\n    peak\n   </em>\n   of the first molecular weight distribution curve (the solid curve in the figure) is not at precisely 7.7 kilodaltons, but at a point just before 7.7. Thus, argued Sandoz, the figure shows that the patent claim term \"molecular weight\" did not mean molecular weight calculated by the first method. It must mean something else. It is indefinite.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177790\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/810/578/#p581\">\n    810 F.Supp.2d, at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The District Court did not accept Sandoz's argument. Teva's expert testified that a skilled artisan would understand that converting data from a chromatogram to molecular weight distribution curves like those in figure 1 would cause the peak on each curve to shift slightly; this could explain the difference between the value indicated by the peak of the curve (about 6.8) and the value in the figure's legend (7.7). App. 138a-139a. Sandoz's expert testified that no such shift would occur. App. 375a-376a. The District Court credited Teva's expert's account, thereby rejecting Sandoz's expert's explanation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177790\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/810/578/#p581\">\n    810 F.Supp.2d, at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Brief for Respondents 61. The District Court's finding about this matter was a factual finding-about how a skilled artisan would understand the way in which a curve created from chromatogram data reflects molecular weights. Based on that factual finding, the District Court reached the legal conclusion that figure 1 did not undermine Teva's argument that molecular weight referred to the first method of calculation (peak average molecular weight).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4177790\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/810/578/#p581\">\n    810 F.Supp.2d, at 590-591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When the Federal Circuit reviewed the District Court's decision, it recognized that the peak of the curve did not match the 7.7 kilodaltons listed in the legend of figure 1.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065641\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/1363/#p1367\">\n    723 F.3d, at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Holdsworth, A History of English Law 350-351 (1924). They could be issued and revoked only by the Crown, which sometimes used the patent to delegate governmental power to regulate an industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 344-347. Provoked by the Crown's use of these so-called \"monopoly patents\" to promote private economic interests over innovation and beneficial commerce, Parliament enacted the Statute of Monopolies in 1624.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 353.

It is true that, in\n   <em>\n    Great Northern,\n   </em>\n   the Court referred to questions of fact arising in the context of contract construction, which, it pointed out, must go to a jury.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"423297\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/259/285/#p291\">\n    259 U.S., at 292-293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"423297\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/259/285/#p291\">\n    42 S.Ct. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Court's conclusion that similar questions must be settled by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) when they relate to the interpretation of a railway tariff merely proves the point that the allocation of a technical usage inquiry depends upon the legal instrument that the court is construing. In that case, the Court was faced with a tariff filed with, and administered by, the ICC. And it was not concerned with allocating evidentiary determinations between trial and appellate courts, but with allocating them between an agency and the judiciary.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 289,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"423297\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/259/285/#p291\">\n    42 S.Ct. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The majority's unexamined reliance on technical usage could be read to cast doubt on this practice, as well as on our holding in\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   that claim construction is exclusively for the court. If claim construction involves subsidiary questions of technical meaning or usage that are indistinguishable from those questions submitted to the jury in the contract context, see 12 Williston \u00a7 34:19, then one might wonder why such issues are not submitted to the jury in the patent and statute contexts, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The majority also analogizes to the obviousness inquiry in patent law, which involves findings of fact subject to Rule 52(a)(6).\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 840 - 841 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dennison Mfg.

These other rights fall into two categories: \" 'public rights belonging to the people at large,' \" and \"privileges\" or \"franchises,\" \"which public authorities ha[ve] created purely for reasons of public policy and which ha [ve] no counterpart in the Lockean state of nature.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 566-567Notwithstanding a movement to recognize a \"core\" property right in inventions, the English common law placed patents squarely in the final category, as franchises that \"depend upon express legislation,\" and \"hath [their] essence by positive municipal law.\" 7 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 479, n. 7, 480, and n. 4, 497 (1926). The distinction between \"core\" private rights, on the one hand, and public rights and government-created privileges, on the other, has traditionally had significant implications for the way in which rights are adjudicated. Nelson,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . Thus, no matter how closely a franchise resembles some \"core\" private right, it does not follow that it must be subject to the same rules of judicial interpretation as its counterpart.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n    Cases interpreting deeds and land patents exemplify this rule and show why the majority's assertion that patents affect fewer people than statutes, in addition to being a dubious overgeneralization, is not a material distinction. Land patents are more like deeds than statutes in the sense that their effects are more localized, yet the judicial power approaches them differently because they dispose of public rights held by the government on behalf of the people, Nelson 566.
