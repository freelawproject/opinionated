United States,\n   </em>\n   573 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581253\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2259/#p2274\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2274,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581253\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2259/#p2274\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). This case, a criminal prosecution under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%20491\">\n    48 Stat. 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as amended, 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), raises a related question: Does a court owe deference to an executive agency's interpretation of a law that contemplates both criminal and administrative enforcement?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Second Circuit thought it does. It deferred to the Securities and Exchange Commission's interpretation of \u00a7 10(b), see\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Its decision tilled no new ground. Other Courts of Appeals have deferred to executive interpretations of a variety of laws that have both criminal and administrative applications. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

They collide with the norm that legislatures, not executive officers, define crimes. When King James I tried to create new crimes by royal command, the judges responded that \"the King cannot create any offence by his prohibition or proclamation, which was not an offence before.\"\n   <em>\n    Case of Proclamations,\n   </em>\n   12 Co. Rep. 74, 75, 77 Eng. Rep. 1352, 1353 (K.B. 1611). James I, however, did not have the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference. See\n   <em>\n    Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). With deference to agency interpretations of statutory provisions to which criminal prohibitions are attached, federal administrators can in effect create (and uncreate) new crimes at will, so long as they do not roam beyond ambiguities that the laws contain. Undoubtedly Congress may make it a crime to violate a regulation, see\n   <em>\n    United States v. Grimaud,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657885\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/220/506/#p519\">\n    220 U.S. 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657885\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/220/506/#p519\">\n    31 S.Ct. 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657885\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/220/506/#p519\">\n    55 L.Ed. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1911), but it is quite a different matter for Congress to give agencies-let alone for us to\n   <em>\n    presume\n   </em>\n   that Congress gave agencies-power to resolve ambiguities in criminal legislation, see\n   <em>\n    Carter v. Welles-Bowen Realty, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726764\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/722/#p733\">\n    736 F.3d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 733 (C.A.6 2013)(Sutton, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Government's theory that was accepted here would, in addition, upend ordinary principles of interpretation. The rule of lenity requires interpreters to resolve ambiguity in criminal laws in favor of defendants. Deferring to the prosecuting branch's expansive views of these statutes \"would turn [their] normal construction ... upside-down, replacing the doctrine of lenity with a doctrine of severity.\"\n   <em>\n    Crandon v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5276\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/152/#p178\">\n    494 U.S. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5276\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/152/#p178\">\n    110 S.Ct. 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5276\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/152/#p178\">\n    108 L.Ed.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990)(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The best that one can say for the Government's position is that in\n   <em>\n    Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564389\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/687/\">\n    515 U.S. 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564389\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/687/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564389\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/687/\">\n    132 L.Ed.2d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), we deferred, with scarcely any explanation, to an agency's interpretation of a law that carried criminal penalties. We brushed the rule of lenity aside in a footnote, stating that \"[w]e have never suggested that the rule of lenity should provide the standard for reviewing facial challenges to administrative regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 704, n. 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564389\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/687/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statement contradicts the many cases before and since holding that, if a law has both criminal and civil\n   applications, the rule of lenity governs its interpretation in both settings. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leocal v. Ashcroft,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p11\">\n    543 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11-12, n. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p11\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p11\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729782\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/505/#p518\">\n    504 U.S. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518, n. 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3382554,11729782\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/112/2102/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729782\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/505/#p518\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992)(plurality opinion);\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 519,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3382554,11729782\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/112/2102/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). The footnote in\n   <em>\n    Babbitt\n   </em>\n   added that the regulation at issue was clear enough to fulfill the rule of lenity's purpose of providing \"fair warning\" to would-be violators.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564389\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/687/\">\n    515 U.S., at 704, n. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564389\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/687/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that is not the only function performed by the rule of lenity; equally important, it vindicates the principle that only the\n   <em>\n    legislature\n   </em>\n   may define crimes and fix punishments. Congress cannot, through ambiguity, effectively leave that function to the courts-much less to the administrative bureaucracy. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wiltberger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1442088\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/18/76/#p95\">\n    5 Wheat. 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1442088\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/18/76/#p95\">\n    5 L.Ed. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1820).\n   <em>\n    Babbitt\n   </em>\n   's drive-by ruling, in short, deserves little weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Whitman does not seek review on the issue of deference, and the procedural history of the case in any event makes it a poor setting in which to reach the question. So I agree with the Court that we should deny the petition. But when a petition properly presenting the question comes before us, I will be receptive to granting it.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
