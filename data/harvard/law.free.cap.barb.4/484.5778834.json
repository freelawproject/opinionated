Loomis sued Warring and others in trover, for converting fifteen of his sheep. Warring was a constable, and had an execution against the property of Loomis. There was a levy upon \u201cthirteen sheep\u201d endorsed upon the execution. On the day of sale the defendants below attended, and the plaintiff\u2019s sheep, numbering 21 or 22, were present. The constable offered for sale by virtue of the execution, thirteen of the sheep, without designating them. On being asked by a bidder which sheep he sold, he replied, \u201c the <em>best\u2014the fattest </em>of them.\u201d The sheep were thus cried and sold to one of the defendants. After this sale the defendants drove all the sheep to a neighbor\u2019s house, and there selected out 13 sheep, and then drove the remainder back. The jury gave the plaintiff a verdict for the value of the 13 sheep; and the justice rendered a judgment for the plaintiff thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-8\"><em>N. </em>Cobb, for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-9\"><em>D. Reed </em>Wheeler, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-10\"><em>By the </em>Court, Marvin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao7\">The sale gave no title to the purchaser. There was no indenlification of the property. The specific sheep were not pointed out. It was the sale of a right to select out 13 sheep from the flock. A constable has no power to make such a sale or contract. If the owner should make such a contract, no title would pass until the selection was made. Until that act was done the contract would be ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ecutory. At a sale of personal property by a public officer, the property must be present; and it must be pointed out and specifically designated, so that the purchaser may know precisely the article or articles which he purchases. The sale is complete upon the acceptance of the bid, and the title instantly passes upon the payment of the amount bid. The authority of the officer over the property then ceases. The statute only authorizes a sale \u201cif the goods and chattels be present, and pointed out to the inspection and examination of the bidders.\u201d (2 <em>R. S. </em>252, \u00a7 149.) See also <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Soper, </em>(14 <em>John. </em>352,) where the court lay down the general rule, that nothing ought to pass at a public sale but what was then known and promulgated; that it was a general and salutary principle\u2014 one necessary, in order to guard against fraud, and to preserve \u2022fairness at public auctions\u2014that no property should pass at a sheriff\u2019s sale, but what was at the time ascertained and declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The bidder must know the specific property which he is buying. It must not be left to any future act to ascertain it. It is argued in this case, that the constable sold \u201c the best and fattest \u201d of the sheep. Who is to ascertain which are the best and fattest? Are judges to be called in, if the purchaser and the defendant in the execution cannot agree ? Is such a question to be left open to controversy ? To sanction such a course of proceeding on the part of public officers, would lead to frauds and abuses, and to controversies and litigation. The property must be so pointed out and identified that no controversy can arise as to its identity\u2014so that the purchaser may maintain replevin for the specific articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">In this case no one could say which thirteen sheep were the property of the purchaser, when his bid was accepted and the sale closed. All the defendants participated in driving away the sheep. There was evidence against all of them, and the jury have found them all guilty. This is not a case where the purchaser acquired a good title, though there may be irregularities in the sale. Here all had notice of the manner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>sale; a sale void in law, and from which no title can be derived by any one having notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">It does not appear from the justice\u2019s return whether the plaintiff was called when the jury came into court, and rendered their verdict. And the point is now made that this is a fatal error, and <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Raynor, </em>(3 <em>Denio, </em>77,) is cited to sustain the position. In that case it appeared <em>affirmatively </em>from the return, that the justice called the plaintiff, and some <em>unknown person </em>answered, and it was held that the justice was bound to see that the plaintiff appeared in person, or by some person duly authorized, before he received the verdict. The case of <em>Baum </em>v. <em>Tarpenny, </em>(3 <em>Hill, </em>75,) is like the present case. There it did not appear whether the plaintiff was called or was present, and it was held that when the justice has jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, it will be intended that the proceedings were regular, until the contrary appears. (See <em>also Oakly v. Van Horne, </em>21 <em>Wend. </em>305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
