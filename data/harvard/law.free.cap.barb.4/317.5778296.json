Keeler brought an action of trespass against Delavan, before a justice of the peace of Onondaga county, and declared against the defendant for stoning, beating, and otherwise abusing, chasing, maiming and maliciously wronging the plaintiff\u2019s cow and hogs at different times within the last two years, since the spring of 1845, in the town of Lafayette, to his damage $50. The justice\u2019s return stated that the plaintiff having thus declared against the defendant, demanded that the cause be tried by a jury ; and that the cause was then adjourned, and a venire issued. That on the adjourned day the plaintiff appeared before the justice, personally, and th\u00e9 defendant by his attorney. But it did not appear from the return that the defendant pleaded to the declaration, at all. He called and examined witnesses, however, and cross-examined the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff of $8, and the justice rendered a judgment for that amount, together with costs. On certiorari, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>judgment was reversed by the county court, and the plaintiff brought a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-6\"><em>Forbes &amp; </em>Sheldon, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-7\"><em>O. </em>Vandenburgh, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b318-8\"><em>By the </em>Court, Gridley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALd\">The plaintiff in error recovered a judgment of $8,00, in an action of trespass, against the defendant in error, before a justice of the peace of Onondaga county. This judgment was reversed by the county court. To show that the county judge was right in reversing this judgment, the counsel of the defendant relies on several grounds of error committed in the justice\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">1. The plaintiff had proved by one Reuben M. Handy, that the defendant had beaten a cow and a hog of the plaintiff, with stones and with great severity; and that he had been in the practice for <em>the last two years of stoning and beating the plaintiff\u2019s cow and hogs. </em>On his cross-examination, the witness had testified, among other things, as follows: \u201c <em>I don\u2019t know that there has been a hog or cow along there but that he has stoned them\u2019\u2019 </em>On the re-examination of this witness, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel propounded the following question : <em>\u201c Have you seen him stone cattle generally that were in the road ?\u201d </em>This question was objected to, and the objection overruled by the court, and the witness was permitted to answer. This was held by the county judge to be erroneous, and for that cause he reversed the judgment of the justice. We are bf the opinion that the judgment should not have been reversed for this cause, for these reasons: (1.) That the question merely involved an inquiry into a matter concerning which the <em>defendant </em>had previously examined the witness. . The testimony of Handy, given on his direct examination, had tended to show a long continued habit of the defendant of treating the plaintiff\u2019s beasts with cruelty, from which special malice towards the plaintiff might well have been inferred. To rebut such an inference, the defendant gave evidence of a general practice of the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>beat off all animals indiscriminately with stones, from the highway near his premises. It was then clearly competent for the plaintiff to inquire into this practice. And in this view the justice was right in allowing the question. (2.) Suppose, however, the evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible, yet, the defendant having committed the first fault, in giving evidence of this description, it was in the discretion of the justice to receive evidence by way of cross-examination of the witness upon this topic, at the instance of the plaintiff. This principle is settled in the 24th of Wendell, 425, 6; and such is the conclusion of Messrs. Cowen &amp; Hill, after a review of all the cases. (1 <em>Cow-en &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes, </em>430, 431, 432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">II. Another ground of error relied on by the counsel for the defendant in error, is that a venire was issued when no issue was joined. The answer to this objection is, that the cause was tried on the assumption that the defendant had pleaded. The defendant\u2019s counsel expressly consented to try the cause with five jurors; and gave evidence on behalf of the defendant. Any error, therefore, of this description, was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">III. Again; it is said that other illegal evidence was admitted by the justice. The amended return does indeed show such to have been the fact; but, it also shows that the objection to such evidence was afterwards withdrawn. The cause was unskilfully tried before the justice; and much evidence that would not have been competent if objected to, was received, to the prejudice of the defendant. Injustice may have been done him by the jury; but we are compelled to say that all such errors were waived, and that no legal ground existed for reversing the judgment in the court below. We must therefore reverse the judgment of the county court, and affirm that of the justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
