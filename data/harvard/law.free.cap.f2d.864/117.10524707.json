Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on their procedural due process claims. They contend that they could be discharged only \u201cfor cause\u201d and, thus, had a property interest in continued employment which could not be taken away without procedural due process. Plaintiffs contend that they were entitled to a pre-termination hearing and adequate post-termination procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-28\">Defendants move for summary judgment as to plaintiffs\u2019 procedural and substantive due process claims. Defendants contend that plaintiffs were at-will employees who did not have a property interest in continued employment and, thus, were not entitled to due process protections. For the following reasons, the Court will grant defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Glynn-Brunswick Memorial Hospital Authority (\u201cHospital\u201d) is a county hospital authority organized as a public agency under the laws of the State of Georgia. Prior to March 30, 1987, the Hospital had an in-house security department with approximately nine employees. Plaintiffs were employed as security officers; however, none of them had formal written contracts of employment. After an investigation, several members of the security department confessed that they had participated in hospital thefts. Those employees were immediately discharged. The Hospital decided to dissolve what remained of its in-house security department and hire an independent contractor to provide security services. On March 30, 1987, defendants notified plaintiffs of the decision to dissolve the security department and eliminate plaintiffs\u2019 positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">At the time the Hospital dissolved its in-house security department, it had in effect a personnel policy manual with a section covering separation of employees. The manual states that it shall apply to all employees and that its purpose is \u201cto assure the observance of uniform and equitable procedures in the separation of personnel.\u201d The \u201cgeneral policy\u201d states that, whenever an employee is separated, the Hospital shall classify him according to the conditions surrounding his separation so that there will be a record for providing employment references, deciding whether to rehire an individual and deciding whether payment of other compensation is warranted. The manual lists seven classifications of separation; they are: discharges, quits, deaths, normal retirement, lack of ability, reduction in force and special separations. The Hospital stated that the reason for plaintiffs\u2019 termination was the dissolution of the security department. Plaintiffs claim this reason is pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The personnel policy also contains a grievance procedure applicable to all hospital employees. Article IX, \u00a7 3.2 of the policy states that the Hospital will make \u201ca sincere effort\u201d to settle grievances in accordance with the procedures provided in the policy. The policy sets forth five steps for filing a complaint. Steps one through four consist of filing a written complaint and receiving a written reply. The final step states that the employee may request action by the Administrator if the grievance has not been settled by the prior steps. The policy also states that the Hospital will consider a grievance abandoned if an employee does not present his complaint to the next higher step within the established time limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">When plaintiffs were terminated, they filed grievance letters and received written responses in accordance with the grievance procedures. Plaintiffs did not pursue their grievances through the final step provided by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Plaintiffs filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that defendants deprived them of a constitutionally protected property interest without due process of law. Section 1983 provides individuals with a private cause of action when constitutional deprivations occur under color of state law. Thus, to maintain their claims, plaintiffs must establish that they have a constitutionally protected life, liberty or property interest and that the actions of the Hospital in abridging those rights occurred under color of state law. Because the Hospital is a public hospital authority created under O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 31-7-1 <em>et seq., </em>its actions constitute state acts within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Richards v. Emanuel County Hospital Authority, </em>603 F.Supp. 81, 83 (S.D.Ga.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The more difficult question is whether plaintiffs have constitutionally protected rights at stake. If such rights exist, the process due in abridging those rights is governed by federal law. <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 541, [105 S.Ct. 1487, 1492-1493], 84 L.Ed.2d 494, 503 (1985). However, the creation and parameters of property rights are typically determined by state law. <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577 [92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709], 33 L.Ed.2d 548, 561 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The plaintiff in <em>Roth, </em>an assistant professor employed for one academic year at a state university, challenged the university\u2019s decision not to rehire him at the end of his term. The Supreme Court held that plaintiff, being specifically hired for a one-year term, had no constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment. The Court stated that, in order to have a property interest protected by procedural due process, a person \u201cmust have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577 [92 S.Ct. at 2709], 33 L.Ed.2d at 561. The Court further stated that such property interests \u201care created and their dimensions defined by existing rules or understandings such as state law. . . .\u201d <em>Id.; see also Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 344 [96 S.Ct. 2074, 2077], 48 L.Ed.2d 684, 690 (1976) (sufficiency of entitlement claim must be decided by reference to state law; no property interest in continued employment under North Carolina law, thus no due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In Georgia, an indefinite hiring may be terminated at will by either party, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 34-7-1, and an employer may discharge an at-will employee, with or without cause, without liability. <em>Taylor v. Foremost McKesson, </em>656 F.2d 1029, 1031 (5th Cir.1981). It follows that, in Georgia, an at-will employee typically does not have a reasonable expectation of continued employment sufficient to form a protectable property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">However, under Georgia law, a property interest does arise whenever a public employee can be terminated only for cause. <em>Brownlee v. Williams, </em>233 Ga. 548 [212 S.E.2d 359] (1975). In <em>Brownlee, </em>plaintiff was an employee covered by the Civil Service Act of Fulton County, which required that an employee be dismissed only for cause. <em>Brownlee, supra </em>at 553, [212 S.E.2d 359]. The court held that, by requiring \u201ccause\u201d for dismissal, the Legislature had given the employee a property interest in his continued employment. <em>Brownlee, supra </em>at 555 [212 S.E.2d 359].</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">In <em>Glenn v. Newman, </em>614 F.2d 467, 471-72 (5th Cir.1980), the court held that city regulations which created \u201ca reasonable expectation of continued employment absent noncompliance with one of the specified reasons [for dismissal]\u201d were analogous to allowing termination only for cause. Relying in part on <em>Brownlee, supra, </em>the court held that the city regulations and the review procedure provided by the city supported a finding of a constitutionally protected property interest in plaintiff\u2019s employment. <em>Glenn, supra </em>at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Similarly, in <em>Barnett v. Housing Authority of City of Atlanta, </em>707 F.2d 1571 (11th Cir.1983), the court found that Atlanta Housing Authority\u2019s Personnel Policy permitted involuntary dismissal, in the absence of a general reduction in the work force, only for \u201ccause\u201d and mandated extensive review procedures of termination decisions. The court held that, \u201cby limiting the power of the appointing body to dismiss an employee, these regulations confer on [plaintiff] a valid property interest in continued employment.\u201d <em>Barnett, supra </em>at 1577.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">The <em>Barnett </em>court noted that the personnel policy at issue contained an explicit \u201cfor cause\u201d requirement, a detailed list of grounds for termination and comprehensive procedures for grievances. The court noted that these features distinguished the case from <em>Barlow v. Atlanta Housing Authority, </em>592 F.2d 280 (5th Cir.1979), where the court held that the prior personnel policy did not create a protectable property interest. <em>Barnett, supra </em>at 1576 n. 8; <em>see also Harrison v. Housing Authority of City of College Park, </em>445 F.Supp. 356 (N.D.Ga.1978) (personnel policy did not create right to continued employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Since <em>Barnett </em>was decided, the Georgia Court of Appeals has held that internally administered policies do <em>not </em>transform an at-will employee into a contract employee and will not support an action for wrongful discharge. <em>Garmon v. Health Group of Atlanta, Inc., </em>183 Ga.App. 587, 589 [359 S.E.2d 450] (1987). In <em>Garmon, </em>plaintiff sued defendant for wrongful discharge, claiming that she was discharged in violation of the hospital\u2019s written policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Plaintiff conceded that she did not have an employment contract with the hospital and that its policies could not transform her from an at-will employee to a contract employee. Nonetheless, plaintiff argued that the policies were legally enforceable and that failure to comply with the policies in her termination constituted wrongful discharge. <em>Garmon, supra </em>at 588 [359 S.E.2d 450]. The court rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention and affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant, holding that \u201c[t]he fact that the employee had notice of certain hospital policies and procedures regarding discipline and termination of employees which she alleges were not followed in her discharge would not give rise to an action for wrongful termination.\u201d <em>Garmon, supra </em>at 589 [359 S.E.2d 450]. The court stated that \u201caccept[ing] [plaintiff\u2019s] argument for legal enforcement of the subject policies would, for the purpose of her termination, transform her from an at-will employee into one under contract to the hospital, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 34-7-1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">As discussed above, a claim of entitlement to continued employment must be decided by reference to state law. <em>Bishop, </em>426 U.S. at 344 [92 S.Ct. at 2077], 48 L.Ed.2d at 690. Relying on <em>Garmon, supra, </em>the most recent interpretation of this issue by a Georgia court, this Court finds that defendant\u2019s internal personnel manual did not confer upon plaintiffs legitimate claims of entitlement to continued employment. Plaintiffs were at-will employees who could be discharged with or without cause, absent a discriminatory purpose. As such, plaintiffs had no protectable property interests in their positions and their \u00a7 1983 claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In accordance with the foregoing, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment is hereby DENIED. Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, and the Clerk of Court is directed to enter an appropriate judgment of dismissal on behalf of the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
