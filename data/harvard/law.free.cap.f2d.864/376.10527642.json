EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b453-24\">Petitioner Sam Baba Ouedraogo seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) order denying him voluntary departure. The immigration judge denied petitioner\u2019s motion for voluntary departure based on a prior conviction for prostitution. Because Ouedraogo\u2019s prostitution conviction has since been dismissed, we remand for further consideration of Ouedraogo\u2019s petition for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-26\">In 1985, Ouedraogo, a nonimmigrant visitor, entered the United States on a B-1, B-2 visa, for a period not to exceed six months. In July 1986, the Sacramento, California office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issued an Order to Show Cause against petitioner, alleging that Ouedraogo was subject to deportation due to his failure to depart within six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>months. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">At the deportation hearing, Ouedraogo requested voluntary departure. The INS opposed Ouedraogo\u2019s request, alleging that petitioner was not \u201ca person of good moral character\u201d as required by the Immigration and Nationality Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(e). In response to the INS\u2019 allegations, Oue-draogo stated that he had been convicted of prostitution and of resisting arrest in California. Petitioner denied, however, that he was guilty of either offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In September 1986, the immigration judge ordered Ouedraogo deported. On appeal, the BIA affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s decision and found \u201cthe respondent statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure in light of his admission of two recent criminal convictions of soliciting for prostitution and resisting lawful arrest.\u201d In July 1988, Ouedraogo was permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty to prostitution and a California Deputy District Attorney dismissed the charges against him. Shortly thereafter, petitioner moved this court to remand his deportation case to the BIA. In opposing petitioner\u2019s motion, the INS argues: (1) that this court lacks jurisdiction to review Ouedraogo\u2019s case due to an untimely filing of the review petition; and (2) that Ouedraogo\u2019s admissions before the immigration judge support the deportation order. We address these arguments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The INS argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Ouedraogo\u2019s case due to the untimely filing of the review petition. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ouedraogo petitioned for review on August 14, 1987, more than six months after the BIA issued its February 4, 1987 order. In his reply brief, Ouedraogo claims that he \u201cwas never advised of the Board\u2019s decision, or provided a copy of the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d Petitioner contends that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(f)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> creates an affirmative duty on the Board to serve an alien with its decision and the time for filing a review petition runs from the date the alien receives the order. We agree that INS regulations require the BIA to send a copy of its decision to the affected alien. However, the time for filing a review petition begins to run when the BIA complies with the terms of federal regulations by mailing its decision to petitioner\u2019s address of record. See <em>Lee v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>685 F.2d 343 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">The record does not demonstrate when the BIA mailed a copy of the February 4, 1987 order to petitioner. Counsel for INS has been unable to locate any letter of transmittal or contemporaneous notation (such as an entry on a docket sheet) documenting the mailing of the February 4 order. Because the INS cannot establish when it mailed the Board\u2019s decision, we decline to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">The INS also contends that Ouedraogo is ineligible for voluntary departure because petitioner admitted that he engaged in prostitution. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f) and \u00a7 1182(a)(12). The record does not support this assertion. When asked to recite his prior convictions, Ouedraogo advised the immigration judge that he had been convicted of prostitution. At the same time, however, petitioner denied that he was guilty of prostitution and described for the immigration judge his version of the events that led to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Because the BIA\u2019s order denying petitioner\u2019s request for voluntary departure was based at least in part on petitioner\u2019s conviction for prostitution, which has been dismissed, we vacate the BIA\u2019s order and remand for further consideration in light of this development.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\">.

The INS argues that Ouedraogo must file a motion with the agency to reopen the case to have the BIA reconsider its order. In effect, the INS argues that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.2 and 3.8 preclude us from remanding the case to the BIA. We disagree. Those sections of the Code of Federal Regulations establish a procedure for an alien to reopen his case before the administrative agency. They do not purport to prohibit a reviewing court from remanding a case to consider a new development that occurred while the appeal was pending. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
