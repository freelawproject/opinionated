The plaintiffs, abutting landowners, appealed from a final decree of the Superior Court sustaining the decision of the board. The trial judge made \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order for Decree,\u201d which he adopted as his \u201cReport of Material Facts.\u201d The evidence is not reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">We state the pertinent findings of the judge. Nordblom sought a \u201cspecial permit . . . pursuant to Section 4.30 (Use 23) of the [z]oning [b]y [l]aws of the town of Brookline ... to use the locus as a parking space [nonresidential] for approximately fifty-four cars for employees, customers or guests of Pelham Hall (an apartment hotel).\u201d The locus, previously purchased by Nordblom, \u201cshown on the [t]own [assessors\u2019 atlas as Lot 2-4 in Block 46, is located in an M-2.0 ([a]partment [h]ouse) district.\u201d It is located on the \u201cnortheasterly side of John Street on the corner of Green Street,\u201d and \u201cis partially contiguous to a parking lot which also serves Pelham Hall.\u201d A nonresidential parking area is defined in \u00a7 2.29 of the zoning by-law as a \u201clot designed or used for the shelter or storage of commercial or non-commercial motor vehicles used by the occupants or users of a lot or lots devoted to a use or uses not permitted in a residence district, in which space is available either to long-term or to transient or casual parkers.\u201d A nonresident parking area must abut or be <em>\u201cacross the street from a non-residence district\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Initially Nordblom made an application to the building inspector for a permit \u201cto construct the parking lot on the locus. This was refused because a. special permit is required from the board.\u201d The board subsequently granted the special permit. Its decision satisfied all of the requirements that must be demonstrated before a special permit may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The judge concluded that \u201c[t]he decision goes into considerable detail as to the relevant and required factors as prescribed in the zoning by law. The evidence before the board, as appearing in its decision, is sufficient to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>its finding and the conditions imposed are consonant with the applicable provisions of the zoning by law.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The judge further concluded that the board correctly found that the proposed parking area \u201cis practically surrounded by apartment buildings with parking areas, and is in a neighborhood otherwise generally devoted to commercial uses.\u201d The entire locus was found to be \u201c\u2018across the street from a non-residential district/ within the meaning of . . . Section 4.30 (Use 23).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The plaintiffs contend that because the locus was divided into three \u201cseparate and distinct lots of land before title to them was acquired by . . . [Nordblom],\u201d the special permit for a nonresidential parking area is limited to the ten foot segment of the locus across the street from the business district.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Apparently in an attempt to support this contention, the plaintiffs state that \u201c[Vjhe zoning by-law defines \u2018lot\u2019 as \u2018/a] parcel of land used or set aside and available for use as the site of one or more buildings and buildings accessory thereto or for any other definite purpose, in one ownership and not divided by a street, nor including any land within the limits of a public or private way upon which such lot abuts, even if the fee to such way is in the owner of the lot.\u2019\u201d This quote from \u00a7 2.17 of the zoning by-laws omits the concluding sentence which reads, \u201cA <em>lot for the purpose of this [Iffy-law may or may not coincide with a lot of record\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Quite obviously the plaintiffs by ignoring this concluding sentence reach an erroneous conclusion. The locus is presently \u201cin one ownership\u201d and the town assessors\u2019 plot plan treats it as one area, although numbered lots two through four. We are of opinion that the zoning by-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>does not require that the board treat the locus as three distinct lots. The requirements of the by-law have been satisfied. See, generally, <em>Chater </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>348 Mass. 237, 246; <em>Vassalotti </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Sudbury, </em>348 Mass. 658, 661. The judge rightly ruled that the board did not exceed its authority in granting the special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> Section 9.5 reads as follows: \u201c (a) The Board of Appeals shall not approve any such application for a special permit unless it finds that in its judgment all the following conditions are met: (1) The specific site is an appropriate location for such a use, structure, or condition. (2) The use as developed will not adversely affect the neighborhood. (3) There will be no nuisance or serious hazard to vehicles or pedestrians. (4) Adequate and appropriate facilities will be provided for the proper operation of the proposed use. (b) In approving a special permit the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions and safeguards as are deemed necessary to protect the neighborhood . . ..\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
