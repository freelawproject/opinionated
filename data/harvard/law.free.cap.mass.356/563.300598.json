In that proceeding the union seeks certification under G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 5 (c), as representative for collective bargaining of all of MBTA's approximately 300 monthly payroll employees (excluding executive payroll employees). MBTA appeared before the Commission to contest its jurisdiction and filed a motion to dismiss the petition for certification. On December 23, 1968, this motion was denied and the Commission assigned the case for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The Commission in the county court filed a demurrer and answer. The facts stated above are admitted in the answer. The demurrer raises the questions (a) whether a writ of prohibition is an appropriate remedy, and (b) whether the Commission has jurisdiction of a certification proceeding affecting employees of MBTA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">A single justice reserved and reported the case for the decision of the full court upon the pleadings and a stipulation concerning certain papers filed before the Commission. Officers of the union were permitted to intervene by the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">1. A writ of prohibition is an appropriate method of preventing a quasi judicial body from exercising a jurisdiction which it does not possess and of determining whether jurisdiction exists. <em>Hathaway Bakeries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>316 Mass. 136, 139, 141-143. <em>Wheaton College </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>352 Mass. 731, 732-734. See <em>Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>351 Mass. 643, 644, 647. The writ (see the <em>Hathaway Bakeries, Inc. </em>case, at p. 139), of course, is not to be used to correct errors committed by such a tribunal if it has jurisdiction. \u201cPQts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>[only] function is to prevent the . . . [tribunal] from proceeding to a decision when . . . [it] has no power to make any decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">2. Whether the Commission has jurisdiction in the present case depends on interpretation of several statutes. The first of these, G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 2 (inserted by St. 1964, c. 563), established MBTA as \u201ca body politic and corporate and a political subdivision of the [Commonwealth.\u201d MBTA\u2019s employees have been held to be public employees. <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 214, 218-219. Under c. 161 A, \u00a7 19, MBTA\u2019s directors are given \u201cauthority to bargain collectively with labor organizations representing employees . . . and to enter into agreements with such organizations relative to wages, salaries, hours, working conditions, health benefits, pensions and retirement allowances of such employees. [A] The employees of the authority <em>shall submit all grievances and disputes pursuant to arbitration provisions in agreements </em>existing at the time of the creation of the authority or subsequently entered into with the authority, or, in the absence of such provisions, to the [B] <em>state board of conciliation and arbitration, or other board or body having similar powers and duties. </em>The provisions of [C] general or special laws relative to <em>rates </em>of wages, <em>hours </em>of employment and <em>working conditions </em>of public employees and relating to contracts for public works, shall not apply to the authority nor to the employees thereof, nor to employees of contractors with the authority but [D] the authority and its employees shall be governed with respect to <em>hours </em>of employment, <em>rates </em>of wages, salaries, hours, working conditions, health benefits, pensions and retirement allowances of its employees and [E] with respect to contracts for construction, maintenance and repair [F] by the laws relating to street railways\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">These provisions of c. 161A must be compared with the State Labor Relations Law found in G. L. c. 150A. Sec-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>tian 2 (2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of c. 150A since 1937 (see St. 1937, c. 436, and St. 1938, c. 345) has exempted the Commonwealth and its political subdivisions from the definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d although G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in subsections (3), (4), and (10), permits recourse to the State Labor Relations Commission by State employees in specified circumstances. Chapter 150A has not permitted such recourse by employees of \u201cpolitical subdivisiones],\u201d except as that has been done with respect to certain employees of any \u201c[m]unicipal employer.\u201d See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178G (as amended through St. 1966, c. 156). See <em>City Manager of Medford </em>v. <em>State Labor Relations Commn. </em>353 Mass. 519, 520. MBTA, however, does not seem to us to be a \u201cdistrict\u201d within the definition in \u00a7 178G of \u201c^m]unicipal employer\u201d as \u201cany county, city, town or district, and any person designated by the municipal employer to act in its interest.\u201d The Commission and the interveners do not appear to rely upon \u00a7 178G, and do not mention the section in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Chapter 161A, \u00a7 19, quoted above, must be examined in detail. Although MBTA\u2019s directors are permitted to engage in collective bargaining with labor organizations, its employees (see point [A] in \u00a7 19 as already quoted) are to submit all disputes to arbitration under the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>whatever agreements may exist, and, if there are no applicable provisions (see points \u00a1AJ and [B] in \u00a7 19), then to the State Board of Conciliation and Arbitration existing under G. L. c. 23, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6*This board is different from the Labor Relations Commission, which exists under c. 23, \u00a7 90 (inserted by St. 1938, c. 345, \u00a7 l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although both the Board (fn. 5) and the Commission (fn. 6) act on labor questions, we think that the Commission (see c. 161A, \u00a7 19, at point [B], as quoted above) cannot be said under \u00a7 19 to be an organization within the language, \u201cother board or body having similar powers or duties\u201d to the State Board of Conciliation and Arbitration. The State board is a mediating body. The Commission has specified statutory duties largely of an investigatory and quasi-judicial character.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">A later provision of c. 161A, \u00a7 19 (see point [C] in \u00a7 19 as quoted) exempts MBTA and the employees from statutes relating (a) to hours of employment, wage rates, and working conditions of public employees, and (b) to contracts for public works. Doubtless, because of this exemption, MBTA and its employees (see point pD] in \u00a7 19) are stated to be governed with respect to such matters, under the statutes \u201crelating to street railways\u201d (see points [LQ and [3T] in \u00a7 19 as quoted). This general provision, in context, cannot reasonably be interpreted as intended to subject MBTA and its employees to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. The provision appears to be designed only to make applicable to MBTA statutory provisions directly relating to street railways so far as they govern the matters specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>in \u00a7 19. See e.g. G. L. c. 161, \u00a7 91A (specifying the number of guards per train), and \u00a7 103 (requiring that street railroad employees shall not work more than nine hours each day).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">MBTA points out also that by St. 1962, c. 760, \u00a7 1, certain provisions of the State Labor Relations Law (G. L. c. 150A) were made applicable to (and the State Labor Relations Commission was given, in effect, some jurisdiction over) certain other Authorities, viz. Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (St. 1952, c. 354, \u00a7 3); Massachusetts Port Authority (St. 1956, c. 465, \u00a7 2); Massachusetts Parking Authority (St. 1958, c. 606, \u00a7 3); and Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority (St. 1960, c. 701, \u00a7 3). By contrast, there is no reference in G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19, to the State Labor Relations Commission. MBTA, of course, is a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d of the Commonwealth. On the other hand, no one of the authorities mentioned in St. 1962, c. 760, \u00a7 1 (although each is referred to as a \u201cpublic instrumentality\u201d) is designated as such a subdivision in the statute, cited above, creating it. The absence of legislation expressly making MBTA (when it was created in 1964) subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, and the express provisions of St. 1962, c. 760, \u00a7 1, making c. 150A applicable to the other authorities, seem to us significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The statutes which have been mentioned above convince us that the Legislature has not placed MBTA, as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth, within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. As the statutes now stand we conclude that the Commission is without jurisdiction.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">\n<em>Writ to issue.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> The petition alleges and the Commission\u2019s answer admits that the Commission in the past has construed G. L. c. 150A, and especially \u00a7 2 (2), as permitting the Commission \u201cto investigate petitions\u201d relating to employees of MBTA and to certify bargaining representatives.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> Each letter in brackets in the text of \u00a7 19 has been included for convenient reference to the material immediately following such letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> As amended through St. 1968, o. 513, \u00a7 3, e. 150A, \u00a7 2 (2), reads: \u201cThe term \u2018employer\u2019 includes any person acting in the interest of an employer, directly or indirectly, and shall include any health care facility, and any nonprofit institution, but <em>shall not include the commonwealth or political subdivision thereof, </em>except in the case of a health care facility, or any labor organization, other than when acting as an employer, or anyone acting in the capacity of officer or agent of such labor organization\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 178D (as amended through St. 1962, c. 504), reads, in part: \u201cEmployees of the commonwealth or <em>any political subdivision </em>thereof shall have the right to form and join vocational or labor organizations and to present proposals relative to salaries and other conditions of employment through representatives of their own choosing. No such employee shall be discharged or discriminated against because of his exercise of such right . . (emphasis supplied). Section 178D is to be compared with \u00a7 178F (as amended through St. 1967, c. 774) which appears to relate only (a) to an \u201c[e]mployee,\u201d defined in \u00a7 178F as \u201cany employee of the commonwealth assigned to work in any department, board, commission or other agency thereof\u201d with exceptions not now pertinent, and (b) to the term \u201c[e]mployer\u201d defined as \u201cthe commonwealth, acting through a department or agency head . . ..\u201d There is no evidence in \u00a7 178F of intention to have the section apply to \u201cpolitical subdivisiones]\u201d of the Commonwealth as in \u00a7 178D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\"> Section 7 reads in part: \u201cThe associate commissioners shall constitute the board of conciliation and arbitration, and shall have the powers and perform the duties given them by . . .
