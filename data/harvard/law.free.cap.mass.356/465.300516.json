Verdicts were returned for the plaintiffs. The case comes here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of his motion for directed verdicts, and to two rulings on evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">The plaintiff Mary Frazier testified as follows: Immediately before the accident the Parker car, which had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>proceeding about five miles an hour, came to a stop behind a truck. She then heard \u201ctwo contacts, bang, bang, like that.\u201d One contact was made when a car behind the defendant\u2019s car hit the defendant\u2019s car. The defendant\u2019s car hit the Parker car. The Parker car did not hit the truck in front because it was moving. The trunk and rear bumper of the Parker car were pushed in.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">One Silva, the driver of the car which struck the defendant\u2019s car, testified that he was proceeding about five to ten miles an hour and the defendant\u2019s car was about a car length in front of him. \u201cHe never saw any red lights go on the rear ... [of the defendant\u2019s car], no brake fights or anything else.\u201d He \u201cput his brakes on and then he hit . . . [the defendant\u2019s car], bumper to bumper.\u201d There was no damage to Silva\u2019s car or to the rear of the defendant\u2019s car. Silva did not know whether the defendant\u2019s car struck the Parker car before his car struck the defendant\u2019s. Nor did he know whether the collision had caused the defendant\u2019s car to move.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201cEvidence of a rear end collision without evidence of the circumstances under which it happens is not proof of the negligence of the operator of either vehicle, and the rule of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>does not apply, but slight evidence of the circumstances \u2018may place the fault.\u2019\u201d <em>Buda </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>302 Mass. 411, 412-413. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Bragdon, </em>289 Mass. 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We are of opinion that the evidence of the circumstances does not go far enough to \u201cplace the fault\u201d within the principle just stated. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, it cannot be said on this record that the defendant was negligent in driving too close to the Parker car and in failing to stop after his car was hit. The defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdicts should have been granted. In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to discuss the rulings on evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\"><em>Judgments for the defendant. </em>.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
