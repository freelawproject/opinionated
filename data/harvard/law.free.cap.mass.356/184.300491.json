One is a suit for declaratory relief. The other two proceedings are under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113B, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>G. L. c. 175A, \u00a7 19. The proceedings were reserved and reported by the single justice without decision upon the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The board and the bureau are associations of insurance companies. They are rating organizations licensed under G. L. c. 175A to file rates with the commissioner, on behalf of their members and subscribers, for various kinds of insurance, including automobile property damage liability insurance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They have in the past made \u201crate filings\u201d for automobile property damage liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Statute 1968, c. 643, was approved on July 16, 1968. Section 2A of that act directed the commissioner to \u201cfix and establish the same classifications of risks and the same basic premium charges or lesser charges ... in connection with the issue or execution of motor vehicle liability policies or bonds, both as defined in . . . [G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A] as he fixed and established . . . for . . . [1967].\u201d Section 3 of the act amended G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C, to require insurance companies authorized to issue compulsory bodily injury liability coverage policies or bonds \u201cto issue to any person purchasing such policy or bond, at his option, additional coverage ... of property damage, so called, to a limit of at least five thousand dollars. The rates for such additional coverage shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, under the provisions of ...

October 14, 1968, the effective date of St. 1968, c. 643, the board and the bureau \u201cmade . . . rule filingos] covering the rating of the additional property damage liability coverage described in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C, as amended by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 3.\u201d The rating rules provided that the rates for such coverage would be the rates shown in the \u201cMassachusetts Automobile Property Damage Manual.\u201d These filings were approved by the commissioner and were effective as of October 14, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On November 25, 1968, the commissioner filed in his office a \u201cMemorandum in Regard to Classifications of Risks and Schedule of Premium Charges for Motor Vehicle Liability Policies or Bonds as Defined in . . . [G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34AJ for the Year 1969, and Property Damage Liability . . . Coverage.\u201d The commissioner purported to \u201cestablish and promulgate\u201d for 1969 the classifications of risks, premium charges and rules and regulations applicable to \u201cmotor vehicle liability policies or bonds\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, which were in effect for 1967. He also purported to \u201cestablish, reaffirm and approve\u201d for 1969 the classifications of risks, premium charges and rules and regulations applicable to automobile property damage liability insurance (as defined by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C, as amended by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 3) which were in effect for 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">On December 26, 1968, the board and the bureau each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>delivered to the commissioner purported filings regarding automobile property damage liability insurance. Each filed separately under G. L. c. 175A and under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C. The commissioner returned the documents, stating that they were \u201cinconsistent with . . . [his] Memorandum and Order of November 25, 1968.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">1. The commissioner contends that the rate \u201cfreeze\u201d provision of St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 2A, applies to automobile property damage liability insurance. He argues that the Legislature, when it used the words \u201cpolicies or bonds\u201d as opposed to \u201ccoverage\u201d (compare St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 2A with St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 3) intended the words \u201cpolicies or bonds\u201d to include all coverages contained in policies or bonds which contain the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage, and not just the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage. He assigns a similar meaning to the same words in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113B, and asserts that under that section, prior to the passage of c. 643, \u201che had the power theoretically\u201d to fix and establish the rates for all coverages included with the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage in a single policy or bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We think that the words must be limited to the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A. In <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>341 Mass. 386, 388, this court stated that the requirements of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A (2), did not apply to property damage coverage. Similarly in <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Bern, </em>328 Mass. 42, 43-44, the provision of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113A, which forbids exceptions or exclusions from the compulsory coverage was said to have \u201cno application to the coverage in excess of the required $5,000.\u201d In both cases, this court limited the words \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy as defined in . . . [G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A]\u201d as they appear in \u00a7 113A to the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage. See also <em>Macheras </em>v. <em>Syrmopoulos, </em>319 Mass. 485, 486-487. The words there are essentially the same words as the Legislature used in St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 2A, and G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113B, as amended by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 2. Where the Legislature uses the same words in several sections which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>concern the same subject matter, the words \u201cmust be presumed to have been used with the same meaning in each section.\u201d <em>Liddell </em>v. <em>Standard Acc. Ins. Co. </em>283 Mass. 340, 346. The commissioner was neither required nor authorized by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 2A, to \u201cfreeze\u201d the automobile property damage liability insurance rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">2. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113C, as amended by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 3, requires the insurance companies \u201cto issue to any person purchasing . . . [compulsory bodily injury liability coverage], at his option, additional coverage . . . of property damage . . ..\u201d The board and the bureau contend that \u00a7 113C does not apply to everyone who purchases the automobile property damage liability coverage. Apparently focusing on the words \u201cat his option,\u201d they argue that if the insurance company willingly offers the insured the automobile property damage liability coverage, \u201cno statutory compulsion is needed, no option is exercised, and the rates for such additional coverage are governed by G. L. c. 175A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We do not agree. The board and the bureau admit that the class of risks to which they argue \u00a7 113C applies is quite small and may, in fact, be nonexistent. We think that if their interpretation of the section were adopted, the class would be nonexistent, for then an insurance company would need only to always \u201cvoluntarily\u201d offer such coverage to all persons purchasing the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage in order to avoid the rates requiring the commissioner's prior approval under \u00a7\u00a7 113B and 113C. An intention to enact a barren and ineffective provision is not lightly to be imputed to the Legislature. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>316 Mass. 351. <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn. </em>324 Mass. 309. We believe that the words \u201cat his option\u201d signify nothing more than a desire by the Legislature to make clear that, although the insurance companies issuing compulsory bodily injury liability coverage are required to offer certain automobile property damage liability coverage, the insured is not required to purchase it. We conclude that the Legislature intended the provisions of G. L. c. 175, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\u00a7 113C, as amended by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 3, to apply to all policies and bonds containing the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage to the extent set out in part 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">3. The board and the bureau contend that this interpretation of \u00a7 113C \u201cis unconstitutional because it makes unreasonable distinctions among insurance companies writing automobile property damage liability insurance.\u201d The distinction, however, is not a distinction between insurance companies but a distinction as to insurance policies. Section 113C requires companies issuing policies or bonds containing the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage to offer in the same policies or bonds certain optional coverage. It also requires that the rates for \u201csuch additional coverage,\u201d the optional automobile property damage liability coverage, included with the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage be approved by the commissioner. It does not prohibit insurance companies which issue policies or bonds containing the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage from offering, independent of the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage, automobile property damage liability insurance. Nor does it make the rates for such independent automobile property damage liability insurance or the rates for automobile property damage liability coverage in excess of the required amount subject to the approval of the commissioner. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113C, applies only to automobile property damage liability insurance up to and including $5,000 which is offered in conjunction with the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage. The companies issuing policies or bonds that include the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage are free to file under G. L. c. 175A with regard to the excess or independent automobile property damage liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">4. The board and the bureau also contend that the filings they tendered under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1130, on December 26, 1968, were \u201cunnecessary.\u201d They maintain that because the rate rulings filed on October 14,1968, adopted for \u00a7 1130 coverage the rates \u201cshown ... in the Massachusetts Auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>mobile Property Damage Manual\u201d (as opposed to the rates shown in the <em>present </em>manual), the filings tendered on December 26, 1968, under G. L. c. 175A, by establishing the rates shown in the manual, apply also to \u00a7 113C coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In effect, the board and the bureau contend that in approving the rules filed on October 14, 1968, the commissioner \u201crepealed\u201d the provision of \u00a7 113C which requires his approval of rates under \u00a7 113B and returned the rate setting procedure to c. 175A, where it had been prior to the enactment of St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 3. We do not think that the commissioner intended such a result. In any event, he lacked the authority to adopt or approve any rule directly contrary to the statute under which he acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">5. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113C, as amended by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 3, states that the rates \u201cshall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, under the provisions of . . . [\u00a7 USB].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are of opinion that the Legislature intended the entire procedure established in the first paragraph of \u00a7 113B to apply to \u00a7 113C. The insurance companies, their associations or both may file with the commissioner suggested rates. The commissioner is to conduct hearings and investigations. Then, on or before September 15, the commissioner is to fix and establish or approve \u201cadequate, just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory\u201d rates. These rates would then be in effect \u201cthe ensuing calendar year or any part thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">It seems clear that the Legislature intended the commissioner to have adequate time to investigate the rates filed by the insurance companies prior to their effective date. In the instant case the rates were filed on December 26, 1968, The commissioner was afforded less than four working days before the \u201censuing calendar year\u201d when the rates were to be effective. We realize, of course, that c. 643 was not enacted in time for the procedure outlined in \u00a7 113B to be followed. Nevertheless, the time during which the commissioner could act under \u00a7 113B was certainly not adequate. It seems to us that the board and the bureau need not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>waited over five months from the date of the enactment of the legislation and over two months from its effective date before filing their rates. Although the commissioner could have acted subsequent to September 15, 1968 (see <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>328 Mass. 161, 163), we think he was justified in rejecting the filings made under \u00a7 113C and thus reestablished for the ensuing year the rates then in effect with regard to the \u00a7 113C coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">6. In the suit for declaratory relief, a final decree is to be entered declaring (1) that the provisions of St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 2A, apply only to the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, and that the commissioner\u2019s memorandum of November 25, 1968, in so far as it purports to apply to coverages other than the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, is of no effect; (2) that the board and the bureau were entitled during 1968, and in 1969 and 1970 are entitled to make filings under G. L. c. 175A relative to all automobile property damage liability coverage <em>not </em>subject to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C; and (3) that the board and the bureau were and are entitled during the same years to make filings subject to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C, relative to automobile property damage liability coverage to a limit of at least $5,000 which is offered to the insured as part of a policy or bond which also includes the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In the proceedings under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113B, and G. L. c. 175A, \u00a7 19, decrees are to be entered ordering the commissioner to accept the filings tendered by the board and the bureau on December 26, 1968, under G. L. c. 175A, said filings to be effective as of December 31, 1968, applicable to automobile property damage liability coverage in excess of the $5,000 amount required by \u00a7 113C and to automobile property damage liability coverage offered independent of the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage, and subject to the provisions of G. L. c. 175A, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> General Laws c. 175A, \u00a7 6 (a), inserted by St. 1947, c. 641, provides in pertinent part, \u201cEvery insurer shall file with the commissioner or his designated representative every manual of classifications, rules and rates, every rating plan and every modification of any of the foregoing which it proposes to use.

My concurrence in the result reached in part 5 of the opinion, is on the following grounds: (a) The Commissioner, by his order of November 25, 1968, purported to establish for 1969 automobile property damage rates for the purposes of, and to the extent set out in, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C, as amended by St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 3. Although the meaning of the final sentence of \u00a7 113C, as amended by \u00a7 3 of the 1968 statute, is uncertain in various respects, I interpret the sentence as intended to make all the procedures under \u00a7 113B applicable to the determination and review of rates under \u00a7 113C, as amended, (b) Section 113B permits review of the Commissioner\u2019s orders under that section \u201cwithin twenty days from the filing of . . . [the] memorandum thereof in his office,\u201d by a petition for review filed in the county court. The only proceeding initiated within twenty days after November 25, 1968, was the petition for declaratory relief mentioned in the first paragraph of the opinion (seasonably filed on December 16, 1968, because December 15 was a Sunday; see G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 9). Paragraph 22 of that petition reads, \u201cThe petitioners seek declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231A and, <em>insofar as the memorandum of November 25 constitutes an order or other action of the Commissioner which may he appealed to this Court, under C. L. c. 175, s. USB </em>or under any other provisions of the General Laws, the petitioners also appeal therefrom\u201d (emphasis supplied), (c) Even if it be assumed that this petition constitutes a proper petition for review under \u00a7 113B, the question of review of the Commissioner\u2019s action of November 25, 1968, as action establishing automobile property damage rates for 1969, does not appear to have been argued in the brief for the petitioners. Accordingly, I conclude that that type of review is not now sought and has been abandoned. See S. J. C. Rule 1:13 (351 Mass. 738).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
