Sweeney (appellant). The matter was referred to a master who filed a report to which the appellant (who had been substituted for an original party as successor in title) filed an objection on the grounds that the master\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact compelled the conclusion that the way was a public way by prescription and that there was no finding \u201cas to the ratio of public to private use\u201d of the way. While the record is silent on whether the appellant complied with Rule 90 of the Superior Court (1954) relative to a request for a summary of evidence, the master did file such a summary dealing with the ratio of public to private use of the way. The master\u2019s report was confirmed and a final decree based thereon was entered which adjudged that no part of the way in question was a public way but that a right of way for the benefit of the appellant for residential and farming purposes did exist across the land of the appellee. The appellant appealed from the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The master found that the appellee owned a parcel of land in Boxborough situated on the northerly side of Whit-comb Road, a public way. In the deed to the appellee\u2019s predecessors in title appeared the language, \u201csaid premises are conveyed, subject to any rights of the public in the road known as Joatham Road.\u201d The deed to the appellant\u2019s predecessors in title, conveyed two lots, one of which was described as being located \u201con the West side of the-so-culled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>.....[Joatham Road].\u201d On a view the master found a well defined way running north from Whitcomb Road through the appellee\u2019s land for approximately 1,240 feet to the southerly line of the appellant\u2019s land. This way is about eleven feet in width, has a hard gravel surface with five telephone poles along its side fine, and ends in a small circular turnabout area at the southerly end of the appellant\u2019s land. Save for the references above no deed in evidence contained any other mention of Joatham Road whatever. The only available access to the appellant\u2019s land was through the land of the appellee and such access \u201cis reasonably necessary.\u201d There was no evidence that the parcels of land belonging to the appellant and the appellee were ever in a common ownership. From 1940 through 1961 the town listed a Clarke Road as a public way. Clarke Road is also known as Joatham Road. During the same period the town plowed snow on the way, scraped the way every other year and \u201coccasionally cut or sprayed the brush\u201d along its length. Few members of the public used the way and then only for purposes of visiting a spring located beyond the appellant\u2019s land, hauling wood from back land or occasionally hunting. A house on the appellant\u2019s land has been in existence for over thirty years and over the years various owners of the appellant\u2019s land or occupants of the house have employed the way as a means of ingress to and egress from the land \u201cin the manner in which ways are commonly used for residential and farming purposes.\u201d This use has been open and continuous for a period in excess of twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The master found that no public way had been established by prescription but that there was a right of way by prescription in the appellant. Upon these findings the final decree was entered and the appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We are bound by the findings of the master unless they are mutually inconsistent, contradictory or plainly wrong.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>Lukas </em>v. <em>Leventhal, </em>344 Mass. 762. <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>346 Mass. 62, 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We find no inconsistencies in the master\u2019s findings relative to the possibility that a public way had been established. Public use of the way was sparse and spotty as distinguished from the use of the way in <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>329 Mass. 36, where, as the appellee properly contends, evidence of maintenance by the city of Beverly was incidental to evidence of extensive public use. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coupe, </em>128 Mass. 63, 64-65, and cases cited, established that a public way by prescription must be based on evidence of use \u201cby the public, adverse and continuous for a period of twenty years or more . . ..\u201d That there was continued use by the public for more than twenty years does not in itself raise a presumption that such use was adverse. \u201cTo establish such a use the further fact must be proved, or admitted, that the general public used the way as a public right; and that it did must be proved by facts which distinguish the use relied on from a rightful use by those who have permissive right to travel over the private way.\u201d <em>Bullukian </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>248 Mass. 151, 155. We conclude that the master\u2019s report, which is a clear factual summary of the pertinent history of the way, affords no basis in law for agreement with the contentions of the appellant relative to public adverse use of the way. In so stating we have taken into consideration the language of Mr. Justice Holmes in <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>158 Mass. 526, 552, relative to the frequency of public use in smaller communities where such use is perhaps best estimated by the nature of the area served.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Nor does the fact that the town has listed Clarke Road as a public way in its annual estimates to the Commonwealth for assistance under G. L. c. 81 warrant a conclusion that a public way was thus established. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coupe, </em>128 Mass. 63, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\"> The record brings to us only limited summaries of evidence not constituting a full report and, hence, we apply the stated rule. <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>296 Mass. 479, 483. <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Minot, </em>319 Mass. 253, 256-260.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
