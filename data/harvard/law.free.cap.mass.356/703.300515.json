Prynnwood by its answer, amended on January 12, 1967 (see fn. 4, <em>infra), </em>prays that the final decree shall (1) declare the restriction enforceable, (2) permanently enjoin any construction without Prynnwood\u2019s approval, and (3) require removal of Dr. Donoghue\u2019s structure from the locus. The probate judge made somewhat incomplete findings and reserved and reported the case (G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13) without decision. The evidence is reported. The facts are stated upon the basis of the judge\u2019s findings and a stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Prynnwood owned land (including the locus) near a country club (the club) in Longmeadow. Development started in 1945. Thirty-seven large lots were laid out in the original plans. In 1959, eight lots were added to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>velopment. All the lots have been. sold. Houses have been built upon all but three lots. Prynnwood still owns some adjacent vacant land.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The deeds from Prynnwood included varying restrictions. Each deed \u201ccontained the restriction that finished plans of any proposed house had to be approved by\u201d Prynnwood.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In most other deeds, but not in the deed to Dr. Donoghue, there appeared a provision that Prynnwood \u201creserves the right to amend these restrictions from time to time and . . . the right to waive compliance with these restrictions in any instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The probate judge found that about May 2, 1965, Dr. Donoghue gave \u201cRichard A. McCullough, a real estate agent, a deposit of . . . [$500] toward the purchase\u201d of the locus. McCullough told Dr. Donoghue \u201cthat the deed would contain a restriction . . . that his plans would have to be approved by . . . [Prynnwood], and that since this lot adjoined the . . . [c]lub land, . . . [Prynnwood] preferred a one-story house on . . . [the locus] so that . . . [other] houses . . . which were two-story, would have an unimpaired view of the [c]lub.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">McCullough took the deposit to Edwin S. Munson, sole stockholder and principal officer of Prynnwood and in \u201ccomplete control\u201d of its affairs. Munson was experienced in real estate matters. Dr. Donoghue had given to McCullough and McCullough gave to Munson \u201ca rough penciled sketch of the proposed house and McCullough testified<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that he showed it to . . . Munson, but . . . Munson had no recollection of this incident.\u201d McCullough was paid a commission on the sale. The deed was executed on May 3, 1965, the balance of the purchase price was paid, and the deed was recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Dr. Donoghue employed \u201cElroy Weber, an architect who has won many awards for design ... to draw plans and prepare a model of the house to be built .... The projected . . . cost . . . [was] at least . . . ($130,000.) . . . and the plans in substance are for a one-story, modern-style, square-shaped, flat-roofed\" house.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Munson declined to approve the plans and model primarily because he objected to the flat roof. He admitted that, \u201cwhile he did not like the plans, he would . . . approve them except that some of the neighbors,\" friends of his, \u201cvehemently objected to the proposed structure and he was considerate of their attitude.\" The judge found that \u201cMunson\u2019s refusal to approve the plans is based in part on his personal dislike of the flat-roof design, but that he would approve ... if the . . . neighbors withdrew their objections.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">There is no uniformity of style in the houses erected in this development area. All but that on the locus are \u201cof traditional or conventional styles, with the exception of two, which might be classified as modern.\" The \u201cproposed house will not depreciate the value of any other house in the development, nor will it be detrimental to the neighborhood.\" When the case was heard, \u201cthere was no appreciable construction on the . . . [locus] except that a foundation had been dug and a builder\u2019s shack\" had been built.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the date of the report, the house had \u201cbeen substantially fully erected and landscaped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">1. In the circumstances, the judge\u2019s findings, justified by the evidence, do not show the existence of any common scheme (cf. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Van Dam, </em>291 Mass. 477, 481-487; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Haley Greystone Corp. </em>352 Mass. 252, 255-257), with respect to the restrictive covenant. The same considerations are here present which led this court in <em>Patrone v. Falcone, </em>345 Mass. 659, 661-663, to treat a somewhat com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>parable provision in a deed (for approval of plans) as enforceable only by the grantor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">2. We do not interpret the restriction as imposing no objective standard whatsoever upon Prynnwood\u2019s action in giving or withholding approval of its grantee\u2019s plans or as making Prynnwood\u2019s whim and its officers\u2019 aesthetic taste binding upon Dr. Donoghue in framing plans.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Restrictions of this type will be strictly interpreted in favor of limiting the restraint on use of the granted premises. See <em>American Unitarian </em>Assn. v. <em>Minot, </em>185 Mass. 589, 595; <em>Hemenway </em>v. <em>Bartevian, </em>321 Mass. 226, 229. See also <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>299 Mass. 559, 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Our cases indicate that such a restriction may be enforced if the power to do so is exercised reasonably. See <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Duryea, </em>261 Mass. 314, 315-317 (which dealt with a restrictive provision containing somewhat more definite standards). We think, however, that (at least in the absence of explicit language to the contrary or the specification of standards of judgment), a restriction of this type should be interpreted as requiring (cf. <em>Nassif </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine R.R. </em>340 Mass. 557, 565) that the person whose approval is required shall decide objectively, honestly, and reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">3. The trial judge\u2019s findings go far to show Munson\u2019s conduct to have been arbitrary. We give weight to the findings (a) that two other houses in the development may be \u201cclassified as modern\u201d; (b) that the \u201cproposed house will not . . . be detrimental to the neighborhood\u201d; and (c) that Munson would have approved the plans except for the objections of neighbors (whose houses, so the judge found, were not depreciated in value). We note also the stipulation that Munson had not enforced similar covenants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>against others. In any event, this, we conclude, is not a case for granting mandatory equitable relief to Prynnwood. We reach this conclusion without reliance (as estopping Prynnwood to seek relief) upon any failure on Munson\u2019s part (see fn. 5) to object to the sketch of the house prior to giving the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Obviously, the harm to Dr. Donoghue, if now forced to remove his costly house, would very greatly exceed any possible damage to Prynnwood, for whose benefit alone the requirement of approval is enforceable. He unwisely took certain risks in proceeding to build before obtaining Prynn-wood\u2019s approval or judicial relief. His conduct, however, in the circumstances may be excusable because of Prynnwood\u2019s unreasonable refusal to approve. See fn. 4 concerning the denial of preliminary injunctive relief. In any event, his conduct does not require us to deny him the benefit of equitable considerations affecting relief, which are somewhat comparable to those recently applied by us in denying mandatory relief in <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>Deery, ante, </em>532, 537-538. There is no basis for awarding Prynnwood monetary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">4. A final decree, consistent with this opinion, is to be entered in the Probate Court declaring that Prynnwood unreasonably refused to approve the plans of Dr. Donoghue\u2019s house, that such approval no longer may be required, and that Prynnwood is not to be given either injunctive relief or damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\"> The record and docket originally filed with us were confused concerning the date of filing of one or more papers. It is the duty of the register or clerk to check the accuracy of the record and copies of the docket by careful proof reading. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 135, as amended through St. 1960, c. 171; S. J. C. Rule 1:09, 351 Mass. 736.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\"> The restrictions in the deed of the locus read: \u201cSubject, however, to the restriction that . . .
