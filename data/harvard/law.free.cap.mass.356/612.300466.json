The defendants filed a demurrer to the declaration which was sustained. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed two substitute declarations, to each of which demurrers were sustained. The case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the sustaining of the demurrer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the second substitute declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">The material allegations in the declaration are as follows. On July 22, 1960, and August 16, 1960, the trustees of Associated, the defendants Sanderson, Selby and Crane, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>called for the redemption of Associated\u2019s common and preferred stock, respectively, and declared partial liquidating dividends. On December 24, 1931, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, James F. Bacon, purchased Associated stock, and received certificates therefor indorsed in blank, from one Francis A. Gallop. The plaintiff, on April 7, 1967, as administrator of Bacon\u2019s estate, presented the stock certificates to the defendant Old Colony Trust Company (Old Colony), Associated\u2019s transfer agent. Upon presentment, Old Colony refused payment of the certificates. \"At no time did [the] plaintiff\u2019s intestate or the plaintiff register the transfer of the ownership of the Associated Stock with the defendant Associated . . . and, accordingly, the books and records of . . . Associated . . . never reflected the transfer to [the] plaintiff\u2019s intestate and the true and lawful ownership of the . . , Stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The defendants contend that the judge sustained the demurrer because the \"second substitute declaration did not cure the defects in the prior declarations and . . . the assumptions of law made by the prior Court in sustaining the earlier demurrers had become the law of the case.\u201d We do not agree. In <em>Saxon Theatre Corp. of Boston </em>v. <em>Sage, </em>347 Mass. 662, 665, we noted with approval the rule holding \"that after a demurrer to a declaration has been sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>and a superseding amendment has been allowed the demurrer to the original declaration will not be dealt with.\u201d The judge is free to make his own determinations based on the allegations set forth in the amended declaration and he is not required to accept \u201cthe rulings of two prior judges on the same legal issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The defendants also argue that a transferee \u201ccannot . . . maintain an action for a dividend against the issuer of stock or its agents unless and until that transferee has applied for a transfer of the registration of the ownership\u201d on the books and records of the corporation. However, the defendants, by relying on this line of argument, overlook the overriding objective of the \u201cInvestment Securities\u201d Article of the Uniform Commercial Code (code), G. L. c. 106, Article 8 (effective October 1, 1958), which confers negotiability upon \u201csecurities governed by this Article.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Article 8 does not require that before a \u201cholder\u201d of securities can enforce rights under the securities he must be the \u201crecord owner\u201d of those securities. A purchaser acquires the rights of his transferor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Article 8 is first concerned with whether the instruments involved are \u201csecurities\u201d within the definition expressed in \u00a7 8 - 102 (1) (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the instant case, the stock certificates are clearly \u201csecurities\u201d and therefore fall within the ambit of \u00a7 8 -105 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In the case before us the pleadings do not contain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>denial of the validity of the signatures, and \u201cunless specifically denied in the pleadings, each signature on the security or in a necessary indorsement is admitted.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With the signatures admitted, \u00a7 8 -105 (2) (c) becomes effective and the \u201cproduction of the . . . [security] entitles a holder to recover on it unless the defendant establishes a defense or a defect going to the validity of the security.\u201d An indorsement in blank is sufficient to transfer legal title under- \u00a7 8-308 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The defendants further contend that under \u00a7 3 of the Uniform Stock Transfer Act, St. 1910, c. 171, predecessor of G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 29 (repealed by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 2), and its code counterpart, \u00a7 8-207, \u201ca corporation and its agents are free from liability when payment of a dividend is made to the record holder of the shares in the absence of notice of a conflicting claim.\u201d We need not now interpret \u00a7 8 - 207 or its predecessor for, in any event, the judge\u2019s ruling sustaining their demurrer cannot be upheld. Payment, even if averred in the demurrer, is a matter of defence, not a ground for the sustaining of a demurrer. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester St. Ry. </em>196 Mass. 329, 336. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>289 Mass. 217, 221. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We do not agree with the additional contention of the defendants that the case of <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bannon Corp. </em>253 Mass. 8, is controlling. In that case we held that unless the pledgee of stock certificates completed the blank certificates by filling in his name, he had no right to have new certificates issued or to have title to the certificates registered in his name. However, the requirements set forth in the <em>O\u2019Bannon </em>case were decided prior to the adoption of the code. In so far as these requirements are inconsistent with the concepts of negotiability enunciated in Article 8, they are no longer of any effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-12\"> The defendants \u201c demur generally and specifically to each of the six (6) counts of the plaintiff\u2019s second substitute declaration and say that the said declaration and each count thereof and the matters therein contained in manner and form as the same are stated and set forth are not sufficient in law for the plaintiff to have its action against the said defendants, and assign specifically to the said second substitute declaration as a whole, and to each of said six (6) counts thereof as though set forth separately, their reasons therefor:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">\u201c1.

The said second substitute declaration and each count thereof fails to set forth or allege a material fact necessary to state a cause of action, to wit: that either the plaintiff or its intestate was a shareholder of record of Associated Textile Companies at any time; and in fact it affirmatively alleges the contrary;</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\u201c4. The said second substitute declaration and each count thereof fails to set forth or allege a material fact necessary to establish the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, to wit: that either the plaintiff or its intestate ever presented a completed instrument to any one of the defendants and requested a transfer on the books of the Associated Textile Companies; and in fact it affirmatively alleges the contrary;</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">\"5. The declaration and each count thereof reveals in its face that the causes alleged are barred by loches and the Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">\u201c6.

In any event, at law, the matter involved in this ground is an affirmative defence which cannot be raised by demurrer.
