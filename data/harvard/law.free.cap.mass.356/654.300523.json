T. Mahoney and Dr. J. Lewis Mahoney, both of whom died domiciled in St. Petersburg, Florida. The probate judge entered a final decree ordering the funds distributed as follows: \u201c$20,000 of the trust property to the Right Reverend Monsignor John J. Mullens, superintendent of St. Paul\u2019s Catholic School in St. Petersburg, Florida\u201d; one-half of the \u201crest, residue and remainder of . . . [the] trust property\u201d after fees and expenses to the Right Reverend Monsignor James F. Enright; one-eighth portions of said remainder to the Missouri Province Educational Institute of St. Louis, The Catholic Extension Society of the United States of America, The Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith, and The Passionist Missions, Inc. This is an appeal by J. Harold Mahoney, a nephew of Dr. Mahoney. The trial judge made a \u201cReport of Material Facts\u201d and the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Article 5 of the Mahoney Trust stated that after the death of the surviving settlor the trust property not previously disposed of should be divided \u201cinto two equal shares . . . Dr. Mahoney\u2019s half and Mrs. Mahoney\u2019s half.\u201d Article 6 provided: \u201cAs to Dr. Mahoney\u2019s half <em>the Trustee shall distribute the same to such persons and charitable institutions in such shares and amounts as Dr. Mahoney shall appoint by a written direction, signed and acknowledged by Dr. Mahoney, and delivered to the Trustee during the lifetime of Dr. Mahoney. </em>In default of and subject to such appointment, Dr. Mahoney\u2019s half shall be distributed as follows: one-half shall be distributed to Mr. Francis Hartnett, a nephew of Dr. Mahoney . . . ; the remaining half shall be distributed to Mr. J. Harold Mahoney, a nephew of Dr. Mahoney, now residing in Parrsboro, Cumberland County, Nova Scotia; if said J. Harold Mahoney is not living at the death of the survivor of Bertha K. T. Mahoney and J. Lewis Mahoney, said half shall be distributed in equal shares to those of the children of said J. Harold Mahoney who are alive at that time; if neither said J. Harold Mahoney nor any of his children are living at said time, said half shall be distributed in equal shares to Boston University, Boston, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Massachusetts, for use in the Medical School, and' to Boston College, Newton, Massachusetts\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We summarize pertinent portions of the judge\u2019s finding. \u201cOn March 20, 1941 a Living Trust was created by Dr. J. Lewis Mahoney and Bertha K. T. Mahoney, the Day Trust Company being named as the Trustee of such Indenture.\u201d New England Merchants National Bank of Boston is the present trustee since it absorbed the Day Trust. The present litigation involves only Dr. Mahoney\u2019s share of the trust. On August 14, 1944, November 22, 1944 and December 15, 1944, \u201cDr. Mahoney made distributee substitutions of his share ... in accordance with the provisions of the Trust.\u201d Dr. Mahoney died on January 2, 1945. The power of appointment exercised by Dr. Mahoney on November 22, 1944, \u201cin accordance with Article VI, by a written directive acknowledged by him,\u201d revoked the appointment executed on August 14, 1944. \u201cOn December 15, 1944 Dr. Mahoney amended the Appointment made November 22, 1944.\u201d Mrs. Mahoney died June 6, 1967. Francis Hartnett \u201cpre-deceased both Dr. &amp; Mrs. J. Lewis Mahoney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">J. Harold Mahoney does not claim that the trust is invalid but contends that the power of appointment exercised by Dr. Mahoney under the trust is invalid for reasons which we will discuss later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Initially, we must decide whether the law of Massachusetts or the law of Florida is to govern. \u201cAn inter vivas trust ... is generally held to be valid if valid in the place of administration fixed by the settlor. If the trust is valid under that law, so also ... an appointment . . . made by the exercise of a power of appointment contained in the trust\u201d will be valid. Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7 635, at p. 4034.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Dr. Mahoney was domiciled in Florida when the trust was created and died a domiciliary of that State. The trust instrument, however, was held in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts corporate trustee; it was duly executed-in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Massachusetts and the property composing the trust was delivered to the trustee in Massachusetts at the time of the creation of the trust. There is nothing in the record indicating that the trust res ever left Massachusetts. In these circumstances, there is reason to believe that Dr. Mahoney intended the trust to be administered in Massachusetts. Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7 612, at pp. 3952-3953. <em>Amerige </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>324 Mass. 648, 659. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Alfred Univ. </em>339 Mass. 82, 85. We are, therefore, of opinion that the validity of the exercise of the power of appointment must be determined by Massachusetts law. Scott, Trusts (3d ed.) \u00a7 635, at p. 4034. <em>Greenough </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>235 Mass. 235, 241-242. See <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>325 Mass. 469, 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">J. Harold Mahoney contends that the power of appointment exercised by Dr. Mahoney was invalid because it was obtained through undue influence. He also argues that there were \u201cno \u2018facts\u2019 to showr that the claim of undue influence was unfounded\u201d and that the judge \u201chas made for his decree a conclusion of law entirely unsupported by any evidence or finding.\u201d We do not agree. It is well established that \u201c\u2018The . . . \u00a1\u00a1contestant has3 the burden of proving undue influence.\u2019 <em>Viens </em>v. <em>Viens, </em>302 Mass. 366, 367. <em>Tarricone </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>340 Mass. 758, 762. \u2018The guiding principles as to the factors to be considered in cases of fraud or undue influence have been set forth by Chief Justice Rugg in the leading case of <em>Neill </em>v. <em>Brackett, </em>234 Mass. 367, and need not be restated.\u2019 <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Noel, </em>337 Mass. 133, 139.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Wellesley College, </em>346 Mass. 162, 171. J. Harold Mahoney has not pointed to any specific instances of undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The record reveals no evidence that any of the beneficiaries of the power exercised by Dr. Mahoney on November 22, 1944, influenced his execution of that power. The testimony of one Caroline Conway, Dr. Mahoney\u2019s nurse during his terminal illness, points to the conclusion that undue influence was not exerted on Dr. Mahoney. In response to the question, \u201cDid Dr. Mahoney ever state to you that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>anyone had ever influenced or attempted to influence [him] to change the trust or the provisions for the disposition of this trust?\u201d she replied, \u201cNo .... No one ever influenced Dr. Mahoney. He had a very strong, good mind of his own . . . and, during the whole year I took care of him, I never saw anybody influence him for anything.\u201d Moreover, neither Mr. Arthur J. Nelson, Dr. Mahoney\u2019s attorney and personal friend, nor Caroline Conway, received any benefit from the exercise of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">That Mr. Nelson and Caroline Conway were in a position wherein it may have been possible to influence Dr. Mahoney\u2019s decisions is \u201cnot enough to warrant a finding of undue influence. There must be a solid foundation of established facts upon which to rest an inference of its existence.\u201d <em>Neill </em>v. <em>Brackett, </em>234 Mass. 367, 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">J. Harold Mahoney additionally contends that the fiduciary relationship between Mr. Nelson and Dr. Mahoney has been abused. We see no basis for such a conclusion. Even though Mr. Nelson did not advise Dr. Mahoney to seek independent advice regarding the disposition of the trust, there is no evidence that the transaction was not honestly conducted. <em>Barnum, </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>320 Mass. 177, 181. As previously stated, Mr. Nelson received no benefit from the exercise of the power, and the evidence shows that the instrument was drawn according to Dr. Mahoney\u2019s direction and specifications, and with his complete approval. There is no solid foundation of established facts upon which to rest an inference of misrepresentation or concealment of facts. <em>Barnum, </em>v. <em>Fay, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">J. Harold Mahoney\u2019s contention that Right Reverend Monsignor Enright exerted undue influence on and abused his confidential relationship with Dr. Mahoney does not require an extensive discussion. No evidence was introduced concerning the relationship, other than that the men were friends, and that Dr. Mahoney was one of Monsignor Enright\u2019s parishioners. In addition, we note that the appointments to Monsignor Enright were not personal gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The evidence was sufficient to permit the judge to conclude, in effect, that the exercise of the power by Dr. Mahoney was free from undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>Costs and expenses of this appeal to be awarded in the discretion of the Probate Court.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
