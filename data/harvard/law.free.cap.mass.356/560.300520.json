Slater, on the counts in tort against them, respectively. The jury could have found the facts stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The Maxwells on October 4,1964, stopped at Henriques\u2019s real estate office. They found there Slater and his wife. Mrs. Maxwell told Slater she wanted to buy a small ranch house with specifications mentioned by her. Slater drove the Maxwells to 20 Davis Street, Woburn, and showed the Maxwells the house, including the cellar. Mrs. Maxwell \u201ctold Slater the cellar looked large enough to build a room there\u201d to use as a playroom for her grandchildren. She \u201csaw a hole in the cellar and something sticking out of it.\u201d She \u201casked Slater what it was, and he said he did not know.\u201d Her husband \u201csaid it looked like a pump.\u201d She said, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s a pump doing here?\u201d Slater \u201csaid he didn\u2019t know but ... it didn\u2019t look as if it had been used.\u201d The cellar was then dry and there was no water in the hole. Mrs. Maxwell asked, \u201cpQs the cellar dry?\u201d Slater replied that the Ratcliffes \u201chad a 9 x 12 rug on the other side of the cellar and it was dry.\u201d She also \u201casked Slater why there wasn\u2019t any bulkhead there, and he said that he didn\u2019t know and that it\u2019s dry.\u201d She believed and relied upon Slater\u2019s representation, and Henriques\u2019s representations mentioned below, that the cellar was dry \u201cin making her decision to buy the house, and would not have bought the house had she known that the representation was not true because she wanted to build a room in the basement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Mrs. Maxwell went to the house again on October 7 with her daughter and a friend, William A. Curry, \u201cwho was going to try to build the playroom.\u201d They met Hen-riques at his office and were driven by him to the house. While in the basement \u201cthey asked Henriques why the pump was there, and he said he didn\u2019t know, that they may have had water at some time.\u201d Curry also \u201ctalked with Henriques about building the room and asked if the cellar was dry, and Henriques said the cellar was dry.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Maxwell then said that Slater \u201chad told her there was a rug on the floor and she took it for granted that it was dry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The Maxwells bought the house and moved in on Novem-i ber 7. About five to six weeks later water came into thei cellar \u201cexcept during dry spells\u201d and the pump \u201cdid not! take care of the water.\u201d The playroom was never built because the cellar \u201cwas wet . . . and the floor had water on it.\u201d Some property was damaged by water.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Ratcliffe told a broker, one DiPanfilo, about the water problem when he went to him about selling the house. There was later a multiple listing of the house and the executive secretary of a real estate board sent information about this house to each member of the board\u2019s multiple listing service, including Henriques\u2019s office. The \u201clisting stated in part that the list price was $16,500 and contained the following remarks: \u2018Sump pump in cellar, gets some water seepage periodically.\u2019 \u201d It was agreed that Slater and Henriques were engaged as brokers for Ratcliffe in the sale of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The evidence summarized above came from several witnesses called by the Maxwells. Verdicts were directed for Slater and Henriques at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The evidence permitted the jury to conclude that both Slater and Henriques represented that the cellar was dry. They could infer that Slater and Henriques were associated in the same office and that each had, or should have had, knowledge of the facts about \u201cwater seepage periodically\u201d stated in the multiple listing. The state of the cellar was, in any event, an existing fact susceptible of knowledge. <em>Yorke </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>332 Mass. 368, 371. <em>Pietrazak </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>341 Mass. 107, 109. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>355 Mass. 117, 119. The brokers\u2019 statements, according to the testimony, were not mere expressions of opinion or statements promissory in character. They could reasonably be viewed as flat statements that the cellar was dry. Cf. <em>Yerid </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>341 Mass. 527, 529-531; <em>Fogarty </em>v. <em>Van Loan, </em>344 Mass. 530, 531-532; <em>Richman </em>v. <em>Seaberg, </em>353 Mass. 757, 758. Because the question of the dryness of the cellar had been raised expressly, there was special obligation on the brokers to avoid half truths and to make disclosure at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>least of any facts known to them or with respect to which they had been put on notice. See <em>Kannavos </em>v. <em>Annino, ante, </em>42, 46-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">There was ample evidence of reasonable reliance and damage. The brokers acted in respects in which they owed a duty, not only to their principal, Ratcliffe, but to the Maxwells with whom they dealt directly. See <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>271 Mass. 570, 572-574.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The jury could conclude that all the elements of a cause of action in deceit had been proved. It was error to direct verdicts for the brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-14\"> Counts in warranty against all three defendants and the count against Rateliffe in tort have been waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\"> Curry testified that Henriques, when asked if the pump was used, said, \u201cto my knowledge, no; that ... he thought at one time they had a big storm or flood of some sort and put it in in case it happened again.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
