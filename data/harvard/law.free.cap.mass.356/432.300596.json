L. c. 272, \u00a7 34; unnatural and lascivious acts with boys under sixteen, second offences, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35A; indecent assault and battery upon boys under fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B; and being a lewd, wanton, and lascivious person in speech and behavior, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. There are seventeen indictments which were tried subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, and are here on the defendant\u2019s appeal with many assignments of error, \u25a0 On so much of the indictments.as did not charge second offences, he was tried to a jury,'and found guilty on each. On .the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>remaining portions of the indictments which charged second offences, he was tried jury waived and found guilty on each.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The evidence is extremely sordid.. Beyond stating that it was ample to convict,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we shall not defile our reports by repeating any of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The third assignment is that there was error in accepting the recommendations of the district attorney that the trial be conducted in a private hearing, allowing only the witnesses to be present in the court room, and denying the request of the defendant that his mother, sister, brother, and a friend be allowed in the court room. The reasons assigned are that the judge (1) violated the constitutional right of the defendant to a public hearing and (2) misconstrued the provisions of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 16A, which reads: \u201cAt the trial of a complaint or indictment for rape, incest, carnal abuse or other crime involving sex, where a minor under eighteen years of age is the person upon, with or against whom the crime is alleged to have been committed . . . the presiding justice shall exclude the general public from the court room, admitting only such persons as may have a direct interest in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Both reasons are valid, and we need not consider any other assignments to determine the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Before any evidence was taken the judge allowed the district attorney\u2019s motion that \u201cbecause of the age of the victims\u201d the trial be in private hearing, allowing only the witnesses in the court room. Counsel for the defendant stated that the only spectators present were the defendant\u2019s mother, sister, brother, and a friend. The district attorney interjected, \u201cI would object to that very strongly, Your Honor. That is precisely why I don\u2019t want them in the courtroom.\u201d Counsel for the defendant continued, \u201cI would respectfully request that these people be allowed to remain in the courtroom.\u201d The judge ruled, \u201cNo. We will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>accept the recommendation and suggestion of the District Attorney.\u201d The defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blondin, </em>324 Mass. 564, 570-571, it was stated by Chief Justice Qua, \u201cThere is nothing in the Constitution of this Commonwealth corresponding to the right to a \u2018public trial\u2019 expressly granted by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and there is nothing to prevent the enactment of such a statute as \u00a7 16A.\u201d The Legislature, in enacting this (p. 571), \u201ccould reasonably determine that the public interest would be better served by exclusion. ; . . It calls only for exclusion of \u2018the general public\u2019 as distinguished from \u2018such persons as may have a direct interest in the case.\u2019 It is to be strictly construed in favor of the general principle of publicity. The expression \u2018such persons as may have a direct interest in the case\u2019 must be interpreted broadly. It was certainly not intended to be limited to the parties. .... The intent was to distinguish between persons having a legitimate reason for being present and mere idle spectators who are often attracted in large numbers to sensational trials involving sex issues, not only to the detriment of the community but sometimes to the degradation of justice itself. We do not construe the statute as excluding a parent, husband, wife, or guardian of a defendant or even a friend whose presence he desires and who might give him legitimate assistance or comfort without interfering with the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We are of opinion that there was error in excluding the mother, brother, sister, and friend of the defendant: Such a ruling was beyond the authorization in \u00a7 16A. It was not a strict construction in favor of the general principle of publicity.' .We might wonder why the defendant would wish his mother or sister to hear evidence establishing his character as of the very lowest. Likewise it was not because the defendant wished assistance and comfort in testifying, as he did not take the stand. It is also improbable that the defendant could have been acquitted by any jury with the evidence so overwhelming and uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"ar6-dedup-0\">Such' considerations cannot contravene, the right of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>defendant not only to a proper construction of \u00a7 16A but to his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. These rights outweigh also the district attorney\u2019s argument that the purpose of the exclusion was to spare the young witnesses the embarrassment of relating in public unusually degrading experiences.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The exclusion of the defendant\u2019s relatives and friend was in-violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which requires that \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial . . ..\u201d \u201c[Without exception all courts have held that an accused is at the very least entitled to have his friends, relatives and counsel present, no matter with what offense he may be charged.\u201d <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U. S. 257, 271-272, n. 29. Even if .we might be of opinion that violation of \u00a7 16A was harmless error, we cannot reach that result under the Sixth Amendment. This is because we must assume that the court empowered to declare the supreme law of the land would assert that the Sixth Amendment was applicable to this trial under the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U. S. 335; <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U. S. 400; <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>386 U. S. 213. A showing of prejudice is not necessary for reversal of a conviction which is not the result of public proceedings. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>247 Fed. 394, 398-399 (8th Cir.); <em>Tanksley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>145 F. 2d 58, 59 (9th Cir.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kobli, </em>172 F. 2d 919, 921 (3d Cir.); <em>Levine </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 610, 627n (dissenting opinion); annotation, 156 A. L. R. 265, 296; annotation, 48 A. L.
