L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (as amended through St. 1957, c. 193, \u00a7 1), to review a decision of the respondent board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 15, 1968, the petitioner, while operating a motor vehicle in Lynn, fatally injured a pedestrian. On May 8, 1968, the Registrar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>of Motor Vehicles, following a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 29 (as amended through St. 1967, c. 193), revoked the driver\u2019s license of the petitioner, finding that his inattention plus excessive speed was the cause of the death and that he was not without serious fault. The petitioner appealed to the respondent board under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 28 (as amended through St. 1950, c. 536), and, after hearing, the decision of the registrar was affirmed on July 18, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In the meantime on April 5, 1968, in the District Court of Southern Essex the petitioner was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle \u201cnegligently so that the lives or safety of the public might be endangered,\u201d and was fined $100. He appealed. On May 14, 1968, the defendant (the petitioner here) filed in the Superior Court a motion to suppress the citation. The basis of the motion was failure to give the defendant the original citation at the time and place of the violation, a defence at that time under G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>354 Mass. 206. See now St. 1968, c. 725, \u00a7 2. The motion was allowed and the criminal proceeding dismissed on June 19, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The present petition was filed on July 29, 1968. On December 4, 1968, a final decree was made by a judge of the Superior Court which recited that the case was heard on the original papers and, citing G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22D, ordered that \u201cthe Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall forthwith restore and reinstate the operator\u2019s license of the petitioner.\u201d The respondent board appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The case is not moot. While it appears that the license for the moment has been restored, this action was in compliance with an order from which the respondent board has properly appealed. The order of restoration obviously was not final. The completion of the pending proceeding could in due course lead to a reversal and the imposition of the order of revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The petitioner urges that the dismissal of the criminal proceeding required the registrar to restore his license. We do not agree. This presents a novel and obscure question of statutory construction. But the policy of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>utes. is clear. The extensive loss of life on our highways due to operation of automobiles has become a national disgrace and is a growing challenge to the power of government to insure the safety of our citizens. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">General Laws, c. 90 \u00a7 29 (as amended through St. 1967, c. 193), provides in material part (italics supplied): <em>\u201c Whenever the death of any person results from any such accident, the registrar shall suspend forthwith the license </em>or right to operate Of the person operating the motor vehicle in said, accident, and shall order the said- license to be delivered to him [the registrarl, unless' a preliminary investigation indicates that the operator may not have been at fault; <em>and the registrar shall revoke </em>the same <em>unless, upon investigation and after a hearing, he determines that the accident occurred without serious fault upon the part of the </em>operator&gt; of such motor vehicle . . ..\u201d ' &gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 22D (as amended through St. 1967, c. 432, \u00a7 1), provides in material part: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section twenty-two, if the registrar has suspended or revoked any license issued under this chapter solely or in part because of an automobile law violation, as defined in section one of chapter ninety C, he shall forthwith reinstate such license if the holder thereof is later found not guilty of such automobile law violation by a court of competent jurisdiction . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">In the first place, we are of opinion that the conditions of \u00a7 22D are satisfied. Although no statute, including \u00a7 29, requires that a revocation be based upon a violation of a criminal statute or upon an automobile. law violation as defined in c. 90C, \u00a7 1 (as amended through St. 1967, c. 432, \u00a7 2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the revocation here was due, in part at least, to an automobile law violation. The dismissal of the criminal proceeding because of failure to comply with c. 90C, - \u00a7 2, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tantamount to a finding of not guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>149 Mass. 7, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In the second place, however, we are of opinion that c. 90, \u00a7 22D, does not apply to the revocation of a license under c. 90, \u00a7 29. One matter of significance is the initial phrase of \u00a7 22D, \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 22.\u201d This leads to the inference that \u00a7 22D was designed to affect the powers of the registrar only under \u00a7 22, and to have no effect on his powers under \u00a7 29 which is concerned with fatal accidents and cases involving \u201cserious fault.\u201d As matter of policy, there could have been a rational distinction drawn by the Legislature from less serious causes falling under \u00a7 22. Accidents causing death may reasonably be treated as constituting a more serioiis category. The Legislature could have concluded that in this category the registrar could revoke the license of an operator upon a finding of \u201cserious fault\u201d even though a court had found him not guilty of an automobile law violation arising from the same events.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In the case at bar the license was revoked after an investigation and hearing led to a determination that the petitioner was \u201cnot without serious fault.\u201d The facts before the respondent board amply warranted the action of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">We are of opinion that the decree of the Superior Court judge was in error and must be reversed. The order of the respondent board is to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-15\"> For powers and duties of the board see G.
