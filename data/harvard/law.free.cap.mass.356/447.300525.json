The defendants were arraigned in the District Court of Dukes County and each pleaded not guilty to six complaints charging possession of marihuana, G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 205; conspiracy to violate the narcotic drug laws, G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 213A; possession of marihuana, G.L. c, 94, \u00a7 205; being present where a narcotic drug was illegally kept, G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 213A; possession of a harmful drug, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>derivative of barbituric acid, G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 187B; and unlawful sale of a narcotic drug, to wit, marihuana, G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Subsequently, with police approval, an assistant district attorney entered into an arrangement with the defendants whereby he agreed to nol pros the complaints charging unlawful sale provided the defendants pleaded guilty to the other complaints, and would cooperate by providing the police with all information they had as to the source of the marihuana. The defendants actually did plead guilty to all complaints except the two for selling. On each of the latter the assistant district attorney indorsed and signed, \u201cApril 10, 1968. The within complaint is nol pressed for reason of insufficient evidence at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">On or about May 13, 1968, the district attorney obtained indictments for the identical offences which were the subject of the nol pressed complaints. This was in breach of the agreement between the assistant district attorney and the defendants upon which the defendants relied and which they fully performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">A Superior Court judge allowed motions to dismiss the indictments, and reported the cases to this court for a determination whether the nol pros of the felony complaints for selling in consideration of pleading guilty to the other complaints is a bar to the prosecution of the subsequent indictments for the offences nol prossed. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 30A.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">We are of opinion that the rulings were correct. An assistant district attorney, whose office exists pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 14, has few powers prescribed by statute. However, by the terms of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 70A, he has equal power with the district attorney to enter a nol pros. As was said in <em>Commonwealth, </em>v. <em>St. John, </em>173 Mass. 566, 569-570, \u201cWhen such promises \u00e1re made by the public prosecutor or with his authority, the court will see that due regard is paid to them, and that the public faith which has been pledged by him is duly kept. The prosecuting officer has also the power to enter a <em>nolle prosequi.\u201d </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>10 Pick. 477, 491-492.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Here the district attorney in seeking to repudiate the agreement made by an assistant district attorney justifies on the alleged ground that the offences nol prossed were felonies in violation of G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 217, over which the District Court had no power to enter a final sentence with the consequence that the action of the assistant district attorney had no effect on the subsequent indictments. In our opinion this is a dishonorable course for the Commonwealth to attempt to take. The highest degree of ethics should be the standard of the sovereign which should serve as an example to all others. The courts have the duty to enforce that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Let an entry be made that the nol pros of the complaints was a bar to the indictments, which are unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
