In the Superior Court a final decree affirmed the board\u2019s decision. The petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">At the hearing before the board there was evidence (1) that the petitioner had pleaded guilty in the Superior Court to two counts in the form provided in G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79, charg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ing him with performing an abortion (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 19)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) that he was placed on probation for three years. No objection was made to the admissibility of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The petitioner, after his admission of violation of \u00a7 19, made no effort to present facts which might avoid his being adjudged \u201cguilty of deceit, malpractice, gross misconduct in the practise of his profession, or of any offence against the laws of the commonwealth relating thereto,\u201d all of which are grounds for revocation of his license. G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61 (as amended through St. 1963, c. 241, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3). The petitioner instead chose to rest his case upon the chance of successfully challenging the validity of \u00a7 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Before us the petitioner argues that the use of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d renders \u00a7 19 unconstitutionally vague, because there is no definition of what is unlawful. He cites no authority which supports this contention. The broad contention that the statute is void for vagueness lacks support in the authorities. See, for example, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, Inc. </em>281 Mass. 402; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>325 Mass. 519; <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287; <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co. </em>269 U. S. 385; <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U. S. 451; <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U. S. 88; Note, Due Process Requirements of Definiteness in Statutes, 62 Harv. L. Rev. 77; Comment, Legislation \u2014 Requirement of Definiteness in Statutory Standards, 53 Mich. L. Rev. 264; Collings, Unconstitutional Uncertainty \u2014 An Appraisal, 40 Cornell L. Q. 195; Note, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">We are of opinion that any uncertainty has been made sufficiently definite by decisions of this court. In our cases it has been stated over the years that a physician may lawfully perform an abortion if he acts in good faith and in an honest belief that it is necessary for the preservation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the life or health of the woman. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sholes, </em>13 Allen, 544, 558. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>121 Mass. 69, 76-77, 82. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nason, </em>252 Mass. 545, 551. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>307 Mass. 7, <em>12. Commonwealth v. Wheeler, </em>315 Mass. 394, 395. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brunette, </em>341 Mass. 675, 677-678.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">As another indication of vagueness as well as a violation of the due process and the equal protection clauses, the petitioner refers to the requirement introduced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nason, supra, </em>that the doctor\u2019s judgment correspond \u201cwith the average judgment of the doctors in the community in which he practises.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brunelle, supra. </em>Compare <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Belinkoff, </em>354 Mass. 102. The petitioner has demonstrated neither the existence of any peril to the woman nor his good faith in performing the abortion, both of which are fundamental to exoneration. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>396-397. Therefore, he is unaffected by any defect in the <em>Nason </em>test and has no standing to raise any question concerning it. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Colangelo, </em>344 Mass. 387, 390. <em>Peterson, petitioner, </em>354 Mass. 110, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The pleas of guilty were enough to justify the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\"> Section 19 provides: \u201cWhoever, with intent to procure the miscarriage of a woman, unlawfully administers to her, or advises or prescribes for her, or causes any poison, drug, medicine or other noxious thing to be taken by her or, with the like intent, unlawfully uses any instrument or other means whatever, or, with like intent, aids or assists therein, shall . . .\u201d be punished.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
