Each defendant filed a demurrer based upon legal insufficiency and failure to state concisely and with substantial certainty the substantive facts neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>sary to state a cause of action. The demurrers were sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The first count, as stated in the record and omitting the overstatements of the record as put forth in the plaintiff\u2019s brief, is as follows: The plaintiff is the beneficiary named in a certificate of insurance under a policy issued by the corporate defendant. Upon the death of his father the plaintiff became entitled to $3,000, the proceeds of the insurance, but the insurance company refused to pay \u201cfor the reason\u201d that on October 25, 1966, at a meeting of the officers and directors of the Boston Retail Liquor Dealers Association the insurance company, acting through its agent, negligently made a false representation that if the officers and directors would accept a reduced coverage to $3,000, those members not actively at work on that date would be covered under the policy. The insurance company knew or should have known that the policy excluded those who were not actively at work on that date, and intended that the officers and directors vote to accept the reduced coverage. The officers and directors (the plaintiff voting as director), in reliance on the representation, voted for the reduced coverage, all to the damage of the plaintiff beneficiary, because the plaintiff\u2019s father was not actively at work on October 25,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The plaintiff seeks to bring his action within <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Everett M. Brooks Co. </em>351 Mass. 497. In that case the plaintiff, a general contractor, and the defendant, a civil engineer and surveyor, each had a contract with the same real estate developer. The defendant placed stakes on the developer\u2019s real estate so that the contractor could build roads. The defendant knew that the plaintiff was the contractor, and that the work which the plaintiff would perform would be in accordance with the grades and stakes which the defendant would set out. We held (p. 501) that there could be recovery, although the plaintiff and the defendant had no contract with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In the case at bar the plaintiff is suing as beneficiary upon a negligent representation made to the officers and directors of the association in order to influence their action. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>case cannot be brought within the <em>Craig </em>case. To allow recovery would allow \u201cliability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class,\u201d an unfortunate result carefully avoided in the <em>Craig </em>case (p. 500). See <em>Ultramares Corp. </em>v. <em>Touche, Niven &amp; Co. </em>255 N. Y. 170, 179. If recovery were permitted, it would extend to an indefinite number of unidentified members of the association holding an unknown number of policies. An unknown number of the plaintiff\u2019s fellow beneficiaries would be included, embracing persons not present at the meeting at which the alleged misstatement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The counts are fatally defective in other respects. It is not alleged that the officers and directors knew that the plaintiff\u2019s father was a member of the association and was not actively at work on October 25, 1966, or that they intended him to be covered. There is no allegation that the plaintiff knew that his father was not actively at work and that he voted intending him to be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\n<em>Orders sustaining demurrers affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
