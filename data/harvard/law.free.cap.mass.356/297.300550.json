Theodore. One petition is against the executors of his estate and against the trustees of the \u201cTheodore Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Trust.\u201d The other petition is also against the executors and against the trustees of the \u201cStephen E..and George Si Theodore Family Trust.\u201d In each case the petitioner sought a determination that the trust was \u201cvoid as to her rights to share as . . . [the testator\u2019s] widow in his estate.\u201d' The cases were heard together and a final decree was entered in each favorable to the petitioner. The cases are here on the respondents\u2019 appeals. The judge made a report of material facts and the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We state the pertinent facts contained in the judge\u2019s report, although some of these facts do not appear to us to be supported by the evidence. The testator and the petitioner, his second wife, were married in February, 1951. The respondents are the two sons of the testator \u201cby his first wife,\u201d from whom he was divorced. After the testator\u2019s marriage to the petitioner they lived together for a few months and \u201cwere thereupon embroiled in domestic litigation.\u201d They separated in June, 1952, and on July 1, 1952, she filed a petition for separate support, obtaining an order for temporary support; \u201c[T]here were many probate court proceedings between them thereafter; with increasing orders for her support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u201cThe records of the Registry of Deeds show that on October 1, 1952, the . . . [testator] executed a Declaration of Trust, naming himself as trustee and giving to himself complete control as such trustee for his sole benefit during his lifetime, with full, powers to him alone, to. revoke, amend or alter it; that ... by an amendment he named his two sons ... as succeeding trustees . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u201cThat on April 5, 1956, he executed another Declaration of Trust identified as the \u2018Stephen E. and George S. Theodore Family Trust \u2019 by which he also reserved only to himself full control with full powers for his sole benefit during his lifetime.\u201d \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The testator \u201cnever had any real or personal property or money standing in his name individually after he executed the first trust on October. 1, 1952. \u25a0 All \u2022 real estate . [was] handled as an asset only of some trust.\u2019- '</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201cAlthough he executed a will on August 29, 1964, while ' on his death bed, he left no assets of any kind which could operate under that will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The \u201cnumerous Notices of Claims\u201d filed against the testator\u2019s estate \u201cclearly show that he handled his assets to defraud other creditors as well as his wife.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The petitioner contends that the trusts <em>\u201cwere </em>mere \u25a0 <em>\u2018shams,\u2019 </em>were <em>\u2018cobrable\u2019 </em>and were <em>attempted testamentary dispositions created </em>by . . . [the testator] solely with the intent to hinder, delay and <em>to defraud the petitioner </em>. . . and are therefore void as to her.\u201d She argues that her contentions are supported by the evidence that the trusts were established after she had separated from the testator, that the testator \u201cwas the trustee and sole beneficiary\u201d of the trusts and that after the creation of the trusts the testator \u201cnever had any assets standing in his name individually.\u201d She asserts that these facts \u201ccompel as the only inferences\u201d her aforementioned contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We do not agree. The evidence showed that the \u201cTheodore Family Trust\u201d held two parcels of real estate granted to it by one Joseph P. Derrane, \u201c[b]eing the same premises conveyed to . . . [Derrane] by deed of Anastasia Theodorides,\u201d and that the \u201cStephen E. and George S. Theodore Family Trust\u201d held three parcels of real estate conveyed to it by the testator <em>as trustee </em>of another trust, the <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Stephen and George Realty Trust. \u2019 \u2019 The \u2018 \u2018 Stephen and George Realty Trust\u201d received the three parcels from one Demetrios E. Theodore, who in turn received them from one \u201cAnastasia Theodore.\u201d There was no evidence of any prior conveyance or transfer of any of the property by the testator to Demetrios E. Theodore or Anastasia Theodorides or that the testator had previously owned any of the property. There was no evidence of any consideration flowing from the testator to any of the previous owners of the property.'</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The Massachusetts cases relied upon by the petitioner are clearly distinguishable from the instant cases. All of them concerned a conveyance of property by the husband. See <em>Livermore </em>v. <em>Boutelle, </em>11 Gray, 217; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>105 Mass. 385; <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Fiske, </em>173 Mass. 413; <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>196 Mass. 179; <em>Kerwin </em>v. <em>Donaghy, </em>317 Mass. 559. Here the petitioner failed to prove any transfer or conveyance, fraudulent or otherwise, direct or indirect, by the testator of his property to the trusts. We are of opinion that the case of <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>192 Mass. 5, is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The final decrees are reversed and the cases are remanded to the Probate Court where decrees are to be entered dismissing the petitions. Costs and expenses are to be in the discretion of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> We have examined the \u201cnumerous Notices of Claims\u201d and do not think that the conclusion reached by the judge was justified. Some of these claims appear to be in connection with the real estate, title to which was in the trusts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
