[The] petitioner to the office and duties of Plumbing Inspector for the Town of Clinton.\u201d A judge of the Superior Court ordered judgment dismissing the petition. The petitioner appealed from the judgment. The trial judge made no findings but the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">We state facts which the judge could have found. On July 12, 1963, the petitioner, a member of the board, took the civil service qualifying examination for the position of plumbing inspector. He was notified, on January 13, 1964, that he had passed, and was placed number one on the civil service fist because of his status as a disabled veteran. At the February meeting of the board, the petitioner \u201cmade a motion that action be taken on the appointment of a plumbing inspector.\u201d The motion was tabled in order to allow the other members of the board additional time to study the candidates on the civil service list.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Following this meeting the other members of the board, one Peter O\u2019Malley, and one Harold Alzapiedi, the chairman, in accordance with G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 22, requested the town counsel, Mr. Edward T. Mitchell, to rule \u201con the prospective appointment of . . . [The petitioner] as Plumbing Inspector, and the possibility of such appointment constituting a conflict of interest.\u201d In a letter dated February 25, 1964, Mr. Mitchell indicated that both the petitioner\u2019s position as a member of the board and his ownership of a retail plumbing supply business constituted conflicts of interest which were direct impediments to the petitioner\u2019s appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The petitioner, in an effort to evade the conflicts described in the town counsel\u2019s letter, purportedly sold his plumbing supply business to his brother; Stephen J. Starr, for the nominal sum of $1. At the board meeting held on March 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>1964, the petitioner placed a bill of sale for his business and his resignation from the board on a table in the board office. The bill of sale was examined by Mr. Mitchell, O\u2019Malley (newly elected chairman), and a new member of the board, one Saverio Notaro. Because the petitioner chose to transfer the business to his brother, Mr. Mitchell suggested he file an affidavit stating that he would have no future affiliation with his plumbing supply business. O\u2019Malley did not accept or look at the petitioner\u2019s resignation. The petitioner \u201cpicked . . . [the bill of sale and the resignation] up off the desk and put . . . [them] back in his pocket . . . [a]nd . . . did not request any formal action.\u201d O\u2019Malley and Notaro agreed to give the petitioner one day to present an affidavit to the board. On March 5, 1964, the petitioner again appeared before the board and O\u2019Malley told the petitioner of his dissatisfaction with the bill of sale and stated that even if the petitioner resigned he \u201ccould not in good conscience vote for . . . [the petitioner] because . . . [he] felt there is still a conflict of interest, since . . . [the petitioner had been] a member of this Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The minutes of the board meeting do not show that the petitioner submitted a formal resignation to the board until receipt of the letter dated June 9, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">1. The petitioner contends that G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 4A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is not a bar to his appointment as plumbing inspector because he \u201chad resigned and could not participate in his own appointment.\u201d However, he did not officially tender his resignation to the board until June 9, 1964. He had previously offered to resign on the condition that he be appointed to the plumbing inspector\u2019s position. The impetus for his ultimate resignation stemmed from a meeting on June 8, 1964, with W. Henry Finnegan, Director of Civil Service for the Commonwealth. At that meeting Finnegan made it clear that the petitioner\u2019s resignation from the board and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>his divestment of any interest in the plumbing supply business were conditions precedent to his appointment to the position of plumbing inspector. The petitioner at all relevant times prior to his resignation was a member of the board and therefore could not have been appointed plumbing inspector by the board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Mastrangelo </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Watertown, </em>340 Mass. 491. See <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>254 Mass. 384; <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>262 Mass. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">2. The petitioner also claims that his plumbing supply business does not present a conflict since \u201c[t]he appointed job deals with inspecting plumbers\u2019 work . . . [and the] supply business deals with the <em>public </em>on retail sales.\u201d As we stated in the case of <em>Selectmen of Avon </em>v. <em>Linder, </em>352 Mass. 581, 583, the conflict of interest law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was enacted \u201cas much to prevent giving the appearance of conflict as to suppress all tendency to wrongdoing.\u201d The petitioner\u2019s retention of the plumbing supply business while serving as plumbing inspector would, it seems obvious, give the appearance of a conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">3. The petitioner argues that the question of conflict of interest is \u201cmoot since he has sold the business and submitted his [b]ill of [s]ale with the resignation.\u201d We do not agree. On July 9, 1964, the business was purportedly sold to one Jack D. Pelley, the petitioner\u2019s brother-in-law, for $3,300; the deposit was made by a cashier\u2019s check for $1,300 and the balance by a promissory note from Pelley to the petitioner for $2,000. Pelley, a linotype operator, claims that at the time of the supposed purchase, he borrowed $800 cash from his father-in-law, the petitioner\u2019s father, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>make the down payment on the business. Eelley. also claims that he acquired the business for \u25a0 investment purposes, because he had failing eyesight and would have to leave his position as a printer. The \u201cpurchase\u201d of the business was to be the eventual means by which he would support his family. At this time, Eelley was earning approximately $7,000 a year. Yet, after the \u201cpurchase\u201d of the supply business, the gross receipts, a' week for the period June 13, 1964, to October 17, 1964, were never greater than $64.16 and were as low as $14.20 for the week of August 1, 1964. From the total gross receipts of approximately $600 during Eelley\u2019s ownership, he paid his father-in-law $200 on account of the $800 loan and he paid the petitioner $250, $50 a month, in rent. During the five month period Eelley claimed to have operated the business, he \u201cpaid out $450\u201d out of an income of approximately $600, and had not expended any funds to replenish the merchandise sold during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The petitioner claims that prior to the sale to Eelley he sold the business to his brother, but that his brother became a \u201clittle skeptical\u201d about the petitioner\u2019s securing the appointment of plumbing inspector, and that some three .or four weeks after the purported sale the petitioner \u201creacquired\u201d the business. The petitioner also claims that after \u201creacquiring\u201d the business he attempted to sell it to other prospective customers. However, he was unable to recall any of their names. From the foregoing the judge could have concluded that the petitioner did not make a bona fide sale and did not properly divest himself of his plumbing supply business. ......\u2014 - ......</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">4. We do not agree with the argument of the petitioner that <em>Younie </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Unemployment Compensation, </em>306 Mass. 567, 571, supports his contention that under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 23,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> once \u201c[a] disabled veteran . . f [has] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>been certified for appointment, the appointing power . . . [can]] not decline to appoint him.\u201d As we stated in <em>Commissioner of the Metropolitan Dist. Commn. </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv. </em>348 Mass. 184, 192, the <em>Younie </em>case raised \u201c[n]]o issues relating to moral fitness and character . . . and we do not construe the quoted language as having reference to such issues.\u201d We also stated in that case that \u201cunder \u00a7 23 an appointing authority has the power and duty to protect the public interest in having only public officers and employees of good character and integrity and may refrain from appointing a disabled veteran in preference to others where there are reasonable grounds to regard that veteran\u2019s character or past conduct as rendering him unfit and unsuitable to perform the duties of office.\u201d <em>Commissioner of the Metropolitan Dist. Commn. </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv., supra, </em>193.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">There was ample \u25a0 justification for the dismissal of the petition. Since the judge has made no findings of fact, the judgment dismissing the petition imports a finding of every fact essential to support it. <em>Murtagh </em>v. <em>Registrars of Voters of Peabody, </em>340 Mass. 737. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>322 Mass. 634, 635. In any event, \u201c[i]]t is our duty to decide the case according to our own judgment of the evidence, giving due weight to the findings implied in the . . , [judgment]].\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Woburn, supra, </em>635. We are of opinion that the board acted properly in refusing to appoint the petitioner to the position of plumbing inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> As amended through St. 1951, c. 6. The relevant portion of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 4A, reads as follows: \u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided, a town board may, if authorized by vote of the town, appoint any member thereof to another town office or position for the term provided by law, if any, otherwise for a term not exceeding one year.\u201d \" .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\"> G. L. c. 268A. Section 21A of this chapter (added by St. 1967, c. 887, \u00a7 2), although enacted subsequent to the events here relevant, supports the position taken by the town counsel and the board. The section reads as follows: \u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, no member of a municipal commission or board shall be eligible for appointment or election by the members of such commission or board to any office or position under the supervision of such commission or board. . . .
