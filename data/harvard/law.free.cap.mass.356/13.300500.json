(Park) became general contractor in February, 1963, for an addition to a public school. Crane Co. (Crane) furnished two boilers to Alfred L. Butler, a heating, ventilating, and air conditioning subcontractor. Crane now seeks to recover the price of the boilers ($8,750) owed to it as a claim against Park\u2019s pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ment bond. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, as amended through St. 1962, c. 696; see later amendment by St. 1964, c. 609, \u00a7\u00a7 4-5. By final decree the bill was dismissed. The facts are stated upon the basis of the trial judge\u2019s report of material facts, except as otherwise indicated. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Butler negotiated for the boilers with Frank Bresnihan, Crane\u2019s agent in the Boston area. Bresnihan \u201csolicited business on behalf of Crane . . . [gave service to] Crane\u2019s customers and received Butler\u2019s order ... for the Crane boilers and did everything that would be beneficial to Crane in the Boston area.\u201d Butler had known Bresnihan \u201cfor many years as the agent for Crane.\u201d The evidence shows that a representative of Park had dealt with him previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The boilers were installed in the school during July, 1963. Butler in July \u201crequisitioned $11,000 from Park for the boilers.\u201d Park on August 24 or 26, 1963, paid Butler\u2019s July requisition, including $11,000 for the boilers, after Butler had furnished Park certificates from all Butler\u2019s suppliers that, they had been paid for items in Butler\u2019s June requisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">On August 26, Butler sent Park its requisition for work performed during August. Park, before making payment, requested certificates from Butler\u2019s suppliers that \u201cthey had been paid from the money requisitioned in July.\u201d On September 20, Butler made out a check for $8,750 to Crane and delivered it to Bresnihan. He told Bresnihan that he could not be paid by Park unless he had a certificate from Crane that Crane had been paid for the boilers. Bresnihan gave such a certificate <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Butler. After receiving the certificate Park paid Butler $17,453.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Thereafter Butler\u2019s check to Crane was dishonored for lack of sufficient funds in Butler\u2019s bank account. Crane, which notified Park of this, has never been paid for the boilers.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The trial judge concluded that Bresnihan, \u201cbecause of his activities as an agent had the apparent authority to issue a certificate on Crane\u2019s behalf\u201d and \u201cto accept the check\u201d for Crane. \u201cBresnihan knew that Park was relying on Crane\u2019s certificate and would not have made the payment to Butler\u201d without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">1. The trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions concerning Bresnihan\u2019s relationship to Crane were justified by the evidence. Bresnihan testified that he was Crane\u2019s representative for eastern Massachusetts. His \u201cduties were to get specifications, to take jobs over and quote them ... on occasion [to] take care of service . . . and to do anything else that would be beneficial to . . . Crane ... in this area.\u201d He had a commission sales agreement with Crane.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although it was \u201cusual\u201d to have payments by customers \u201csent directly to . . . Crane,\u201d this \u201cwasn\u2019t wholly adhered to,\u201d as in this case. Bresnihan took Butler\u2019s check thinking that he was helping Crane by \u201cgetting . . . payment on an invoice . . . about 60 days old.\u201d He first communicated to Crane the facts about the certificate he had signed when Crane told him Butler\u2019s check had been dishonored.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Bresnihan, as a matter of good customer relations, went to the jobsite once to discuss a problem concerning the boilers\u2019 tubes. His duties for Crane \u201cwould vary somewhat depending on the job. Both Crane and . . . [he] were trying to promote Crane and . . . were both willing to do whatever . . . [they] thought would be the best for . . , Crane.\u201d In a deposition by a general credit manager of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Crane, Bresnihan was described as \u201cour Pacific Steel Boiler Agent.\u201d During November and December, 1963, Bresnihan, at Crane\u2019s request, tried to obtain payment of the sum owed to Crane by Butler. Park and Butler both knew that Bresnihan represented many firms as sales representative in the Boston area.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">It has been said \u201cthat an agent who solicits orders and sends them to his principal to be filled has no implied authority to receive payment for the goods.\u201d See <em>/Sacks </em>v. <em>Martin Equip. Co. </em>333 Mass. 274, 280. See also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>164 Mass. 490, 491; <em>Boice-Perrine Co. </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>243 Mass. 327, 330-331; <em>Aluminum Prod. Co. </em>v. <em>Regal Apparel Co. </em>296 Mass. 84, 88; Restatement 2d: Agency, \u00a7 70 (and see \u00a7 62). In the <em>Boice-Perrine Co. </em>case, the rule set out above was stated. There, however, on \u201cslender\u201d evidence, it was held that ratification of a selling agent\u2019s unauthorized act in accepting payment could be inferred if it was not immediately disaffirmed by the principal. Rugg, C.J., went on to say: \u201cPrompt disavowal of such act is imperative because the inference of authority flows readily from the trust reposed by a principal in bis agent. Harm to the victim of such unauthorized conduct of an agent may be repaired or mitigated by immediate knowledge of the denial of responsibility by the principal.\u201d No such disavowal of Bresnihan\u2019s act by Crane was here shown, although there was prompt notice of the dishonor of Butler\u2019s check. Cf. <em>Pampegian </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>319 Mass. 218-219, which, however, did not involve a selling agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The scope of Bresnihan\u2019s actual authority is somewhat ambiguous. There was evidence which justified the conclusion that Bresnihan did more than act as a sales solicitor for Crane. The trial judge could give weight to the testimony that Bresnihan provided some service, that he actually appeared as Crane\u2019s representative at the jobsite, that there was not always strict adherence to the contract between Crane and Bresnihan, and that Crane accepted efforts by Bresnihan not specifically required by the contract. Although as in the <em>Boice-Perrine Co. </em>case, 243 Mass. 327, 330-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>331, the evidence is \u201cslender,\u201d we think that the trial judge (although not required to do so) could reasonably infer either (a) that Bresnihan, who appears to have acted wholly in good faith and in what he believed to be Crane\u2019s interest, had at least apparent authority to accept Butler\u2019s check and to give the certificate, or (b) that Crane ratified Bres-nihan\u2019s act by failure to disavow it promptly. See <em>Crane Co. </em>v. <em>James McHugh Sons, Inc. </em>108 F. 2d 55, 58-59 (10th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">2. If Bresnihan is to be treated as Crane\u2019s agent, his act in giving the certificate estops Crane to assert against Park and Park\u2019s surety that Crane had not been paid for the boilers (see <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>206 F. 2d 57, 60 [4th Cir.]) since Park relied upon the certificate to its detriment. See <em>McLearn </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>276 Mass. 519, 524-527; <em>Looney </em>v. <em>Trimount Theatres, Inc. </em>282 Mass. 275, 279-280. Cf. <em>Cleaveland </em>v. <em>Malden Sav. Bank, </em>291 Mass. 295, 296-298. The certificate put it in Butler\u2019s power to obtain payment from Park of an amount (in excess of the price of the boilers) which Park would not have paid without the certificate. There was clear knowledge by Crane\u2019s agent that there would be reliance. See <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>King, </em>9 Met. 511, 517; <em>Antonelli Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co. </em>354 Mass. 465, 468-469; Williston, Contracts (3d ed.) \u00a7 139. See also <em>Golding </em>v. <em>108 Longwood Ave. Inc. </em>325 Mass. 465, 467-468; <em>Yorke </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>332 Mass. 368, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Although, as between Butler and Crane, the receipt of Butler\u2019s dishonored check did not discharge Butler\u2019s debt to Crane (see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-511 [\u00a13] and Uniform Commercial Code, 1962 Official Text with comments, p. 148 and comment 4 to that section), the representation contained in the certificate was made for the benefit of Park. Park relied on it to its detriment by forgoing the opportunity to \"withhold from Butler payments which Park could have retained under the general conditions of the prime contract. See <em>Hub Steel &amp; Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>283 Mass. 463, 464-465. The circumstance that the certificate recited that Crane \u201creceived as payment\u201d a check for $8,750 did not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>we think, impose in the circumstances the duty upon Park to make certain that the check had been honored before relying upon the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> The certificate, apparently typed for Butler on his letterhead and by him given to Bresnihan for signature, read in part, \u201c [Bjeceived as payment check #10437 in the amount of $8,750.00 for labor and . . . material delivered to A. L. Butler &amp; Company at the Senior High School Addition, Lexington, Massachusetts, for the month of July, 1963.\u201d This certificate was signed, \u201cCrane Company By: Frank Bresnihan 10 High Street, Boston, Mass.\u201d Bresnihan knew that Butler was going to use the certificate to secure payment of his August reqidsition work. Butler did not disclose to Crane or Bresnihan, at the time he gave Bresnihan the check later dishonored, that he was \u201chaving business difficulties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> It was not shown that Park had knowledge of the details of this agreement which described Bresnihan as a \u201c commission representative.\u201d It provided, among other things, that all orders \u201cshall be subject to acceptance by the General Credit Department\u201d of the Pacific Steel Boiler Division of Crane, and that Bresnihan had \u201cno authority to create or incur any liability against\u201d Crane. A communication by Crane to Park on October 17, 1963, referred to Bresnihan as \u201cour agent\u201d but did not disclaim or repudiate Bresnihan\u2019s action in giving the certificate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
