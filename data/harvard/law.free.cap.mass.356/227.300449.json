A master, to whom the case was referred, filed a report and, at the plaintiffs\u2019 request, a summary of certain evidence. An interlocutory decree was entered confirming the report. Thereafter a final decree was entered dismissing the bill, from which the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>We summarize the pertinent facts as follows: On December 2, 1958, the defendants owned a tract of land consisting of about ninety-eight acres in the towns of Bolton and Harvard. From that date to October 31, 1966, the defendants sold five parcels of land, totaling about twelve acres, to the plaintiffs. The defendants made no other conveyances of any land in the tract. In each of the deeds they imposed the same restrictions, with the exception of one minor variation, on the grantees\u2019 use of the premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These deeds did not impose any restrictions on the defendants\u2019 remaining land. Each parcel sold was plotted on a separate plan recorded with the deed thereto, and no subdivision plan of the area was filed in the registry of deeds. One of the plaintiffs, however, \u201cwas shown a copy of a plan having five lots laid out on . . . [the defendants\u2019] premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">It appears that the defendants orally assured each of the plaintiffs that all lots of land subsequently sold would be subject to the same restrictions imposed in the plaintiffs\u2019 deeds and that the defendants would assiduously protect the tract\u2019s rural and residential characteristics. The defendants, however, now plan to establish a recreational area on their remaining land, a use which apparently would be prohibited by the restrictions imposed on the plaintiffs\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The sole issue, as the plaintiffs state, is whether the statute of frauds, although not pleaded, precludes the plaintiffs, the grantees of restricted land, from enforcing the defendants\u2019 oral promises to impose the same restrictions on the land retained by them. The judge ruled that the statute was a bar to the relief sought by the plaintiffs. We agree. \u201c[I]t was settled in this Commonwealth by <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>213 Mass. 380, that the statute of frauds prevents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the enforcement against the vendor ... of any implied or oral agreement that the vendor\u2019s remaining land shall be bound by restrictions similar to those imposed upon lots conveyed. Only where . . . the vendor binds Ms remaining land by writing, can reciprocity of restriction between the vendor and the vendee be enforced.\u201d <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Van Dam, </em>291 Mass. 477, 482. <em>Belmont </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Amusement Corp. </em>333 Mass. 565, 572. G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 1, Fourth. See Restatement: Property, \u00a7 522 (1). But see \u00a7 524 c, Illustration 1, of the Restatement. Here there was no evidence in writing, either in a plan or in the deeds, that the restrictions were to apply to the defendants\u2019 remaimng land.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The statute of frauds was not pleaded by the defendants. Accordingly the plaintiffs contend that the defence is not available to the defendants. It is true that ordinarily the statute of frauds cannot be relied on unless pleaded. <em>Middle-sex Co. </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>4 Gray, 447. <em>Stoneham Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>295 Mass. 390, 393. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Paquette, </em>341 Mass. 67, 76. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 28. But it has been held that if the bill does not contain allegations plainly showing a situation where the statute might apply there is no occasion to plead it and the defendant may have the benefit of it, even though not pleaded. <em>Tourtillotte </em>v. <em>Tourtillotte, </em>205 Mass. 547, 551. See <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>States Constr. Co. </em>193 Va. 513, 521. That is the case here. Neither the plaintiffs\u2019 original bill nor their amended bill alleged that the defendants made any agreement (oral or otherwise) relating to the restrictions. In these circumstances the statute was available to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>Paterlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> These restrictions were: \u201c1.
