We will conclude that the trial court erred, both with respect to procedural issues and with respect to substantive issues, in determining that the City\u2019s general plan, as well as Measures R and C, are invalid, and we will reverse the trial court\u2019s orders to that effect. We will also conclude that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to Garat and will reverse the trial court in that regard as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">In 1969, the City formally adopted a general plan\u2014a comprehensive and long-term amalgam of policies, goals, standards, guidelines and maps designed to form a cohesive and integrated framework within which to plan for the future physical development of the City (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 65300-65302)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014in accordance with the requirements of chapter 3 (\u201cLocal Planning,\u201d beginning with \u00a7 65100), division 1 (\u201cPlanning and Zoning,\u201d beginning with \u00a7 65000), title 7 (\u201cPlanning and Land Use,\u201d beginning with \u00a7 65000) of the Government Code. The City\u2019s general plan was revised extensively on two different occasions during the early 1970\u2019s and has been amended in one particular or another on several occasions since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The voters of the City adopted a zoning ordinance, Measure R, in November 1979. In large part, Measure R served to apply an RA (residential agricultural) zoning classification to various portions of the City\u2019s territory and an RC (residential conservation) zoning classification to other portions of that territory\u2014all with an eye to controlling the growth of development in areas of an \u201copen\u201d or \u201crural\u201d character. The City thereafter amended its general plan so as to encompass the requirements of Measure R.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In November 1987, the voters of the City adopted further land-use and development legislation by initiative by adopting a Measure C. Measure C had a variety of functions, among them: (a) Amending Measure R so as to delete the authority of the City\u2019s council to amend or repeal Measure R; (b) amending Measure R so as to further promote and encourage agriculture by \u201cprotecting\u201d agricultural lands from \u201cpremature\u201d development (quotations, ours); and (c) requiring the City to develop a general plan for those areas within the City\u2019s sphere of influence that had not already been encompassed by the City\u2019s extant general plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">On January 28, 1988, the Arlington Heights consortium (referring collectively to the plaintiffs/petitioners in Super. Ct. No. 192556) filed the first of the two consolidated lawsuits which form the body of the dispute now before us. Arlington Height\u2019s suit set forth several different causes of action, some of which were attended (at least implicitly) by a prayer for monetary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>damages/just compensation and some of which were attended by a prayer for extraordinary writ relief and equitable relief (including injunctive relief), all with the common theme that they challenged the validity of Measure C in one fashion or another. Included among these causes of action was a petition for a writ of traditional mandate directing the City \u201cto void the initiative Measure C and Measure R (incorporated within the provisions of Measure C)\u201d and \u201cto forthwith cease administering and enforcing said initiative ordinances, or any part thereof.\u201d The Arlington Heights lawsuit was followed by the filing of a lawsuit by the Garat consortium (referring collectively to the plaintiffs/petitioners in Super. Ct. No. 191567) on February 1, 1988. As amended in March 1988, the Garat lawsuit was similar to the Arlington Heights lawsuit\u2014in particular, to the extent that the Garat lawsuit contained a cause of action which petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate directing the City \u201cto cease administering or enforcing\u201d Measure C. Some months thereafter, the trial court consolidated the Arlington Heights and Garat lawsuits and (in functional effect) bifurcated the damages/just compensation causes of action from the other causes of action (the \u201cinvalidity causes of action\u201d) so as to permit the invalidity issues to proceed to final resolution prior to resolving the remaining damages/just compensation issues.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In very quick fashion, the invalidity proceedings became focused on the relatively narrow issues of whether the City\u2019s general plan was invalid and whether Measures R and C were themselves invalid because they were inconsistent with the (allegedly) invalid general plan, the next substantive step taken to bring the invalidity proceedings to a final resolution was taken by the City. In January 1989, the City filed a motion for summary judgment/ summary adjudication of issues (summary adjudication). In this motion, the City argued, among other things: (1) That any challenge to the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Measure R was time-barred; (2) that any challenge to the validity of the general plan was time-barred; (3) that the statutory requirement of consistency between zoning ordinances and their underlying general plans (\u00a7 65860) was not applicable to charter cities; and (4) that, even if the City\u2019s general plan was deficient as a matter of law, the invalidation of Measures R and C was an inappropriate remedy by which to address such a deficiency. The City\u2019s motion presented the above issues (hereinafter, the summary adjudication issues) as being solely issues of law\u2014issues of law which were without substantial controversy and as to which there were no triable issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The trial court denied the City\u2019s motion apparently (and curiously) on the ground, at least with respect to the above issues, that those issues were issues of law and not issues of fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The trial court then conducted hearings on the substantive merits of at least some of the invalidity causes of action, first addressing the issue of the legal adequacy of the City\u2019s general plan. In June 1989, the trial court issued its minute order ruling on the legal adequacy of the City\u2019s general plan, to wit: \u201cThe Court finds that the general plan of the City of Riverside is legally inadequate in that its land use element, circulation element, housing element, and noise element do not substantially comply with the requirements of Government Code \u00a765302. The Court finds that the said general plan is out of date, in that it fails to accurately reflect current conditions, and contains numerous internal inconsistencies.\u201d This minute order was followed by the filing of a statement of decision by the trial court which set forth a rather detailed discussion of the basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The parties and the trial court then turned their attention to the issue of the appropriate remedy for the perceived shortcomings in the City\u2019s general plan. The trial court conducted further hearings with respect to that issue. Following these further hearings, the trial court concluded, and issued a statement of decision to the effect, that Measures R and C were required by law to be consistent with the City\u2019s general plan, that Measures R and C were enacted at a time when the City\u2019s general plan was internally inconsistent and otherwise deficient as a matter of law (\u201cinadequate\u201d)\u2014rendering consistency between the City\u2019s general plan and Measures R and C an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>impossibility\u2014and that, consequently, the initiative measures themselves were invalid <em>ab initio. </em>The trial court thereafter entered two orders on the same day (Sept. 5, 1989), one of which was somewhat ambiguously denominated a \u201crevised\u201d order:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">(1) The \u201cfirst\u201d order mandated the City to bring its general plan into conformity with the requirements of state law pursuant to the provisions set forth in article 14 (\u201cActions or Proceedings,\u201d beginning with \u00a7 65750), chapter 3, division 1, title 7 of the Government Code, and further mandated the City \u201cto rescind Measures R and C, and to refrain from implementing those measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">(2) The second, \u201crevised\u201d order deleted any reference to the City\u2019s obligation to bring its general plan into conformity with the requirements of state law, and instead simply declared Measures R and C to be \u201clegally invalid\u201d and mandated the City \u201cto rescind Measures R and C, and to refrain from implementing those measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Following its rulings on the substantive issues raised by the parties, the trial court further ruled that Garat qualified for an award of attorney fees under the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d provisions of section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The trial court did not fix the amount of attorney fees to be awarded, but made clear its intention that its decision as to the parties\u2019 \u201cright\u201d to such fees was to be treated as \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of appeal, subject to a remand to the trial court for a fixing of the amount of the fees if the appropriateness of the award itself was upheld on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">With respect to the substantive (i.e., invalidity) issues raised in the trial court below, the City has purported to appeal from four distinct trial court actions: (a) The trial court\u2019s statement of decision regarding its determination that the City\u2019s general plan was deficient as a matter of law; (b) the trial court\u2019s statement of decision regarding its determination that Measures R and C were legally invalid <em>ab initio', </em>(c) the trial court\u2019s order mandating the City to bring its general plan into conformity with the requirements of state law and to rescind and otherwise deny implementation to Measures R and C; and (d) the trial court\u2019s \u201crevised\u201d order simply mandating the City to rescind and otherwise deny implementation to Measures R and C. Of course, the City has also appealed from the trial court\u2019s collateral order awarding attorney fees to Garat, arguing that any such award of fees must \u201crise or fall\u201d with the success of the underlying action and that the underlying action must, on appeal, \u201cfall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">On appeal, among other issues, the City has once again raised the summary adjudication issues, the same legal issues which it first addressed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>trial court in its motion for summary adjudication\u2014the issue of the timeliness of the Garat and Arlington Heights actions, the issue of the (nonnecessity of a charter city\u2019s zoning enactments being consistent with that city\u2019s general plan, and the issue of the appropriateness of invalidating Measures R and C to remedy the perceived deficiencies of the City\u2019s general plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">As we discuss in detail below, we conclude that the trial court erred both in finding that the City\u2019s general plan was invalid/inadequate and in invalidating Measures R and C in light of that general plan\u2019s perceived invalidity/ inadequacy. We also conclude that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to Garat.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Additional facts will be referred to, as needed, in the discussion which follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Appealability Issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">A. <em>Appealability of Trial Court\u2019s September 5, 1989, Orders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">At the outset, we questioned whether the September 5,1989, orders constituted an appealable \u201cfinal judgment\u201d over which this court could exercise appellate jurisdiction. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (a); see <em>Supple </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1009 [247 Cal.Rptr. 554].) We sought supplemental letter briefs from the parties on this question and received such a brief from the City of Riverside.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As we discuss below, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s September 5, 1989, orders <em>do </em>constitute an appealable \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of section 904.1, subdivision (a), of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">As a general matter (and leaving aside statutory exceptions), an appeal will not lie from other than a final and fully dispositive judgment by the court below\u2014a judicial principle known as the \u201cone final judgment rule\u201d: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by statute, an appeal lies only from a judgment that terminates the proceeding in the lower court by completely disposing of the matter in controversy. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Henneberque </em>v. <em>City of Culver City </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 837, 841 [218 Cal.Rptr. 704].) As is the case with most general matters, however, the one final judgment rule admits</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of several exceptions. Of particular interest here is the exception recognized for \u201ca judgment or order finally disposing of a cause of action that has been severed from separate and independent causes of action remaining to be tried.\u201d <em>(Day </em>v. <em>Papadakis </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 503, 508 [282 Cal.Rptr. 548], citing <em>Schonfeld </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 401, 416-419 [123 Cal.Rptr. 669].) As emphasized in the <em>Day </em>opinion, this exception to the one final judgment rule requires <em>both </em>that there be an actual severance of the causes of action to be first tried from the causes of action to remain untried (with the severance occurring prior to the adjudication/disposition of those \u201cfirst tried\u201d causes of action) <em>and </em>that the first tried causes of action be substantively separate from and independent of the causes of action remaining to be tried. <em>(Day, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at pp. 510-511, citing <em>Armstrong Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 732, 736-737 [170 Cal.Rptr. 767], and approving <em>Armstrong's </em>analysis of <em>Schonfeld, supra.)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The trial court\u2019s formal order severing the damages/just compensation causes df action from the invalidity causes of action does not create a problem with the \u201cone final judgment rule\u201d insofar as the present appeal is concerned. The damages/just compensation causes of action were clearly severed prior to their disposition and they concern issues which are indisputably separate and independent from those which are raised in the invalidity causes of action: (1) Most obviously, the damages/just compensation causes of action involve the calculation of monetary compensation, an issue completely absent from the invalidity causes of action; and (2) more fundamentally, the damages/just compensation causes of action assume the application of the land-use planning and zoning legislation here in issue and seek damages and/or just compensation for the application of that legislation to private property, while the invalidity causes of action assert that the land-use legislation here in issue either has been null and void from the outset or has become null and void\u2014thus implicitly assuming that such legislation does not have any application to private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">A far more troublesome matter insofar as the \u201cone final judgment rule\u201d is concerned is the fact that certain invalidity causes of action have been adjudicated in the trial court and brought before us in the instant appeal while <em>other </em>invalidity causes of action remain untried in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The issues which are presently before us on appeal are those which are concerned with (a) a determination of whether the City\u2019s general plan is valid and (b) if it is determined that the City\u2019s general plan is <em>invalid, </em>a determination of whether Measures R and C are invalid <em>as a consequence </em>of the general plan\u2019s invalidity. These issues are addressed in the first and second causes of action in the Arlington Heights lawsuit and in the fourth and fifth causes of action in the Garat lawsuit. Remaining untried in the trial court at this time are at least eight invalidity causes of action in the Arlington Heights lawsuit and seven invalidity causes of action in the Garat lawsuit\u2014 all of which appear to be concerned with the (in)validity of Measure C and/or Measure R, on one basis or another, but none of which appear to be concerned with the (invalidity of the City\u2019s general plan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As far as we are able to determine from the appellate record, the trial court never formally severed the invalidity causes of action which were tried from those which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>were not. Complicating matters further is the fact that the trial court\u2019s original order of September 5,1989, addressed both the perceived invalidity of the City\u2019s general plan <em>and </em>the perceived invalidity of Measures C and R, while the trial court\u2019s \u201crevised\u201d order of September 5, 1989, addressed <em>only </em>the perceived invalidity of the two measures. This state of affairs is susceptible of two equally plausible interpretations:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">(1)  Those invalidity causes of action which solely involve the issue of the (invalidity of the City\u2019s general plan were de facto severed from those invalidity causes of action which do not involve the issue of the (in)validity of the City\u2019s general plan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The fact that the trial court tried <em>only </em>those invalidity causes of action involving the issue of the (invalidity of the City\u2019s general plan lends support to this interpretation; <em>or</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">(2) The invalidity causes of action which involve the issue of the (invalidity of the City\u2019s general plan were not severed from those invalidity causes of action which do not involve that issue. The following facts <em>all </em>lend support to this interpretation: (i) the trial court did not issue a formal severance order; (ii) the causes of action which were tried and adjudicated by the trial court concerned the (in)validity of Measures R and C as well as the (in)validity of the City\u2019s general plan; and (iii) the trial court issued two separate final orders, one of which was concerned <em>solely </em>with the (invalidity of Measures R and C.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The record before us is simply too vague, ambiguous and incomplete to permit us to determine which of the above interpretations is the correct one. However, insofar as the instant appeal is concerned, <em>either </em>interpretation will support our exercise of appellate jurisdiction:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">(a) <em>If </em>a de facto severance of the causes of action before us on appeal occurred, that severance constitutes a valid \u201cseverance exception to the one final judgment rule.\u201d There was an actual (albeit, de facto) severance and the severed, adjudicated causes of action involve an issue which is separate and independent of the issues raised in the other invalidity causes of action\u2014the issue of the (in)validity of the City\u2019s general plan; <em>or</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">(b)  <em>If, </em>on the other hand, there was not a de facto severance of the causes of action before us on appeal, the plaintiffs/petitioners are barred by the principle of res judicata from trying the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>invalidity causes of action and the matter before us constitutes \u201cone final judgment\u201d insofar as the invalidity causes of action are concerned.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">We are not barred by the \u201cone final judgment rule\u201d from exercising appellate jurisdiction in the matter before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\n<em>B. Issues Properly Encompassed by the Notice of Appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Garat has questioned the City\u2019s right to raise again on appeal the summary adjudication issues <em>(ante). </em>Garat argues that those issues are not encompassed by the limited and narrowly focused notice of appeal filed by the City in our case No. E007409. Garat is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">First, Garat argues that the summary adjudication issues cannot be raised on appeal by virtue of the City\u2019s purported appeal from the trial court\u2019s statements of decision. It is true, of course, and the City does not deny, that statements of decision are simply not appealable. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1.) To the extent, then, that the City has attempted to appeal from statements of decision by the trial court, the City\u2019s notice of appeal is of no effect. In response to this \u201coverinclusiveness,\u201d the City has argued that the fact that a notice of appeal contains more than it should ought not to invalidate those portions of the notice that are appropriately set forth. In keeping with the general rule that notices of appeal will be liberally construed to provide for a hearing on the merits of those issues presented for appellate review <em>(Futlick </em>v. <em>F.W. Woolworth Co. </em>(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 296, 298 [308 P.2d 405]), we agree with the City\u2019s position that its ineffective attempt to appeal from the trial court\u2019s statements of decision does not preclude it from bringing the summary adjudication issues before this court for review so long as those issues are implicated in properly appealable orders of the trial court which <em>are </em>addressed by the City\u2019s notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Second, Garat argues that an appeal from only a specified <em>portion </em>of a final judgment or appealable order is to be construed as bringing only those issues encompassed by the specified portion before the appellate tribunal for review <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>R.J. Novick Constr. Co. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 798, 805 [144 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 408, 575 P.2d 1190]), and that this rule of limitation bars the City\u2019s attempt to raise the summary adjudication issues on appeal in this case. Garat reasons that the two trial court orders appealed from by the City (the order and \u201crevised\u201d order filed on Sept. 5, 1989) constitute only limited determinations by the trial court, that those orders do not encompass or implicate the summary adjudication issues, and that the City is thus precluded from raising those legal issues on appeal. The flaw in Carat\u2019s reasoning lies in its failure to recognize that the two orders appealed from by the City constitute the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d of the trial court insofar as the bifurcated invalidity proceedings brought before us are concerned. (See pt. IA, <em>ante.) </em>Indeed, by virtue of its orders, the trial court has determined that the City\u2019s general plan is deficient as a matter of law, that it must be brought into conformity with the requirements of state law, and that Measures R and C were void <em>ab initio </em>because they were, by virtue of their nature as \u201czoning enactments,\u201d required to be consistent with the general plan but were adopted at a time when the general plan was invalid and consistency was impossible to achieve\u2014precisely the issues addressed by the City\u2019s motion for summary adjudication of issues. In our view, the City\u2019s appeal from the two orders of the trial court constitutes an appeal from <em>all </em>of the trial court\u2019s \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the bifurcated invalidity proceedings conducted by that court, including all of the trial court\u2019s intermediate rulings relating to the issues which were finally adjudicated. The City\u2019s appeal constitutes a general appeal\u2014and a general appeal presents for appellate review all of the material, nonappealable orders entered by the trial court in the proceedings below (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 906), such as a denial of a motion for summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Having determined that the City\u2019s summary adjudication issues are properly before us on appeal, we turn now to a substantive analysis of the trial court\u2019s decisions on all of the issues before us, including the summary adjudication issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Do a Charter City\u2019s Legislative Zoning Enactments Have to Be Consistent With the Provisions of Its General Plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In direct answer to the question, no\u2014but a charter city may elect to be consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">As our discussion unfolds in this and the following sections, it will become clear that this issue, the issue of zoning/general plan consistency for charter cities, is the linchpin issue by which many of the other issues in this case are bound and fixed. It is, notwithstanding the considerable effort and attention paid to it by the parties, a relatively straightforward and simple issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The gist, the fundamental core, of Garat\u2019s attack on Measures R and C is the contention that Measures R and C are invalid because they are unlawfully inconsistent with the City\u2019s general plan and cannot be brought into lawful consistency with the general plan because the City\u2019s general plan is itself deficient as a matter of law\u2014rendering \u201clawful\u201d consistency an impossibility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The inescapable flaw in this argument is the fact that the legislative zoning enactments (hereinafter, simply zoning enactments) of a charter city do not have to be consistent with that city\u2019s general plan. Thus, inconsistency between the zoning enactments of a charter city and that city\u2019s general plan does not invalidate those zoning enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Section 65860, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part: \u201cCounty or city zoning ordinances shall be consistent with the general plan of the county or city by January 1,1974.\u201d However, section 65803 has, from June 1986 to the present time, specifically provided: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided, this chapter shall not apply to a charter city, except to the extent that the same may be adopted by charter or ordinance of the city.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The \u201cthis chapter\u201d referred to (at all times) in section 65803 is chapter 4 (\u201cZoning Regulations,\u201d beginning with \u00a7 65800), division 1, title 7 of the Government Code and is the chapter that contains section 65860.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In this case, it is undisputed that the City is a charter city. A review of the City\u2019s charter reveals no adoption by the City of a consistency requirement in that document. The sole question remaining in determining whether the exemption provisions of section 65803 apply to the City, then, is whether the City has adopted a consistency requirement by way of ordinance. Garat argues that such is the case, and in support of its argument points to several provisions in the City\u2019s zoning laws that require that adjudicative/administrative approvals of applications for certain types of conditional use permits and minor variances be consistent with the City\u2019s \u201cmaster plan.\u201d These scattered references to consistency, however, fall far short of section 65803\u2019s provision that a specific requirement of consistency between the zoning enactments and the general plan of a charter city will be found to exist only if that requirement is \u201cadopted by charter or ordinance.\u201d On the face of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>City\u2019s extant charter/statutory scheme, then, there is no requirement that the City\u2019s zoning enactments be consistent with its general plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In passing, we note and reject two other arguments made by Garat in support of its contention that the City had, in fact, adopted a zoning enactment/general plan consistency requirement by ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">(1) Garat argues that general purpose language contained in title 19 of the City\u2019s Municipal Code (\u201cZoning\u201d) constitutes the adoption of a zoning enactment/general plan consistency requirement by ordinance. It is true that section 19.02.020 of the City\u2019s Municipal Code contains the statement that the City\u2019s zoning regulations are deemed necessary to (among other things) \u201cpromote the public health, safety and general welfare, all as a part of the Master Plan of the City.\u201d This statement, however, is nothing more than a general statement of intention or purpose; it does not rise to the level of an express adoption of a zoning enactment/general plan consistency requirement as contemplated by section 65803.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">(2) Garat also argues that the City\u2019s adoption of various \u201cspecific plans\u201d \u2014a specific plan being a more focused and detailed development \u201cscheme\u201d for a particular, limited portion of the greater area encompassed by the broader overall development \u201cscheme\u201d of a general plan\u2014pursuant to article 8 (\u201cSpecific Plans,\u201d beginning with \u00a7 65450), chapter 3, division 1, title 7 of the Government Code means, by logical necessity, that the City has adopted a zoning enactment/general plan consistency requirement. The logic of Carat\u2019s argument unfolds in this way: (a) The City has adopted specific plans (e.g., the Sycamore Canyon Specific Plan) \u201cin accord with California State requirements for specific plans (Government Code \u00a7 65450)\u201d; (b) the adoption of specific plans is not subject to the general exemption from state zoning laws which is provided in section 65803 for charter cities; (c) specific plans must be consistent with their inclusive general plans (\u00a7 65454); (d) no zoning enactments may be adopted or amended with respect to an area within a specific plan unless the zoning enactment would be consistent with the specific plan (\u00a7 65455); (e) consequently, the City, by adopting specific plans in accordance with state law, has indirectly adopted an overall zoning enactment/general plan consistency requirement by ordinance. There are at least two flaws in this argument. First, assuming arguendo that the City has implicitly adopted a zoning enactment/general plan consistency requirement within certain specific plan areas, this simple fact does not compel the conclusion that the City has, as a general matter, adopted such a requirement for the entire general plan area. Second, and far more importantly, section 65700, subdivision (a), exempts charter cities from the provisions of chapter 3 (\u201cLocal Planning,\u201d beginning with \u00a7 65100), division 1, title 7 of the Government Code (excepting the requirement that a city adopt a general plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>containing all of the statutorily mandated plan elements) in virtually the same way that section 65803 exempts charter cities from the provisions of chapter 4 of that division and title\u2014and the above provisions of the Government Code relating to specific plans are contained in that chapter 3. Thus, the City enjoys, even under this analysis, an exemption from consistency requirements unless the same are assumed \u201cby charter or <em>ordinance\"\u2014not </em>\u201cby remote implication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In further argument on the same issue, Garat has attempted to circumvent the express exemption set forth in section 65803 by citing numerous cases which have found a consistency requirement in a myriad of factual contexts \u2014all of them centering on the fundamental principle that a general plan is a \u201cconstitution for all future developments\u201d <em>(Citizens of Goleta Valley </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 570 [276 Cal.Rptr. 410, 801 P.2d 1161], quoting from <em>O\u2019Loane </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 774, 782 [42 Cal.Rptr. 283]) and recognizing that \u201cthe propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements.\u201d <em>(Citizens of Goleta Valley </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Resource Defense Fund </em>v. <em>County of Santa Cruz </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806 [184 Cal.Rptr. 371].) <em>None </em>of the cases cited by Garat, however, have <em>held </em>that the zoning enactments of a charter city must be consistent with that city\u2019s general plan absent the city\u2019s having expressly adopted such a consistency requirement by charter or ordinance. That is, Garat has failed to cite one case which holds that a consistency requirement obtains in circumstances such as those that exist in <em>this </em>case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">There is at least one case that addresses the consistency requirement in a context that is directly applicable to this case, <em>Verdugo Woodlands Homeowners etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 696 [224 Cal.Rptr. 903]. In <em>Verdugo, </em>the court acknowledged the fact that the section 65803 exemption of charter cities from the consistency requirement of section 65860 arguably left charter cities virtually free to ignore the overall benefits of integrated planning. However, <em>Verdugo </em>also noted the fact that the Legislature has imposed the provisions of the state planning law on charter cities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>in numerous instances (e.g., \u00a7 65300) and has steadfastly refused to do the same with respect to the consistency requirement. <em>Verdugo </em>reluctantly concluded, as do we, that the legislative directive of section 65803 is unmistakable and unavoidable and that the consistency requirement of section 65860 simply does not apply to charter cities which have not adopted the same for themselves by either charter or ordinance. We join with the strong suggestion made by our sister court in <em>Verdugo </em>(at p. 704) that the Legislature examine the wisdom of permitting charter cities (or their voters, through the initiative process) to ignore such a fundamental principle of sound land-use planning as consistency between a city\u2019s zoning enactments and that city\u2019s general plan for land use and development.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">There seems to be no dispute that Measure R was a legislative act, enacted by way of the initiative process. We conclude that it constituted a zoning ordinance by applying RA and RC zoning classifications to certain property in Riverside. (See \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of Measure R.) The trial court erred in invalidating Measure R because of its perceived inconsistency with the City\u2019s general plan. To the extent that Measure C is a zoning enactment\u2014 and Measure C may be construed as zoning legislation insofar as section 4 of Measure C specifically amends section 7 of Measure R\u2014the trial court erred in like fashion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There is no requirement that there be any such consistency\u2014irrespective of the validity of the City\u2019s general plan.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Does the General Plan of a Charter City Have to Be Internally Consistent in Order to Be Valid?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In direct answer to the question, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In part II of this opinion, above, we addressed the issue of whether there is a statutory requirement of <em>external </em>consistency between a charter city\u2019s zoning enactments and its general plan. In this section of the opinion, we address whether there is a statutory requirement of <em>internal </em>consistency that applies to the general plans of charter cities.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">This issue of internal consistency is one of the fundamental issues raised by Garat in its direct attack on the validity of the City\u2019s general plan and constitutes one of the primary grounds on which the trial court found the City\u2019s general plan to be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The statement of decision which the trial court referred to in its order finding the City\u2019s general plan deficient as a matter of law went on at great length to describe the shortcomings which the trial court found in that general plan. In large part, the trial court found that these shortcomings related to (what the trial court saw as) serious internal inconsistencies between the various parts, pieces and elements of the general plan. The trial court found that this internal inconsistency, as much or more than anything else, rendered the City\u2019s general plan invalid.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On appeal, the City contests the trial court\u2019s finding that its (the City\u2019s) general plan was invalid.  Among other things, and preliminarily, the City particularly challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that the general plan of a charter city must, by law, be internally consistent. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination in this regard was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Here, unlike the consistency issue addressed in part II, above, we are dealing with provisions of the state planning law which <em>are </em>applicable to charter cities.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Insofar as it is pertinent here, section 65700, subdivision (a), has, at all times relevant to this matter, provided: \u201cThe provisions of this chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>[chapter 3] shall not apply to a charter city, except to the extent that the same may be adopted by charter or ordinance of the city; except that charter cities shall adopt general plans in any case, . . . and such plans shall contain the mandatory elements required by Article 5 (commencing with Section 65300) of Chapter 3 of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Since January 1, 1985, section 65300 has provided: \u201cEach planning agency shall prepare and the legislative body of each county and city shall adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the county or city, and of any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency\u2019s judgment bears relation to its planning. Chartered cities shall adopt general plans which contain the mandatory elements specified in Section 65302.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Section 65300.5 (in effect and unamended since Jan. 1, 1976) provides: \u201cIn construing the provisions of this article [article 5], the Legislature intends that the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated, <em>internally consistent </em>and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The \u201cchapter\u201d referred to in section 65700, subdivision (a), is chapter 3, division 1, title 7 of the Government Code, the chapter which includes all of the above cited statutory provisions. The \u201cArticle 5\u201d referred to in section 65700, subdivision (a), is the article of chapter 3 that contains sections 65300, 65300.5 and 65302.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The question thus presented is this: Do sections 65300 and 65700, subdivision (a), construed together and as they were worded at each and all time(s) relevant to this matter, require only that charter cities adopt a general plan that contains the enumerated \u201cmandatory elements\u201d of section 65302, <em>or </em>do sections <em>65300 </em>and 65700, subdivision (a), as so construed, not only require that charter cities adopt a general plan that contains the enumerated \u201cmandatory elements\u201d of section 65302, but also require that charter cities adopt a general plan in which those \u201cmandatory elements,\u201d <em>as construed under section 65300.5, </em>are internally consistent with each other? We conclude that the latter interpretation is the proper one.  We are guided in reaching this conclusion by the basic principle of statutory interpretation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201cwherever possible, a statute must be harmonized with other statutes contained in the legislative scheme.\u201d <em>(Verdugo Woodlands Homeowners etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at p. 703.)  In particular, we note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">(1) Section 65700, subdivision (a), requires that a charter city\u2019s general plan contain \u201cthe mandatory elements required by Article 5\u201d\u2014not just those mandatory elements required by section 65302. This broad-reaching language in section 65700, subdivision (a), leads us to conclude that the \u201cmandatory elements\u201d of section 65302 are to be understood and construed as being qualified by the other applicable provisions of article 5, such as the \u201cinternal consistency\u201d provision of section 65300.5;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">(2) Section 65300.5, by itself, is a legislative directive as to how we are to understand and construe section 65302. Under the directive of section 65300.5, the \u201cmandatory elements\u201d of section 65302 must be understood as being \u201cinternally consistent mandatory elements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The trial court did not err as a matter of law in reaching the issue of the internal (in)consistency between and among the mandatory elements of the City\u2019s general plan in determining whether that general plan was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Was the Challenge to the Validity of the City\u2019s General Plan Timely?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">In direct answer to the question, yes\u2014but only with respect to those portions of the City\u2019s general plan which were potentially impacted or influenced by Measure C.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">In this section of our opinion, we address the issue of whether Carat\u2019s actions, insofar as they directly attacked the validity of the City\u2019s general plan itself rather than the validity of Measures R and C, were brought in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\"> The City cites section 65009, subdivision (c), in support of its contention that the lawsuits filed in this case were, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>exception of the challenge to Measure C, untimely insofar as they sought to challenge the validity of the City\u2019s general plan itself.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That statutory subsection provides, in pertinent part: \u201c[N]o action or proceeding shall be maintained in any of the following cases by any person unless the action or proceeding is commenced and service is made on the legislative body within 120 days after the legislative body\u2019s decision: (1) To attack, review, set aside, void, or annul <em>the decision of a legislative body to adopt or amend a general or specific plan. </em>This paragraph does not apply where an action is brought based upon the complete absence of a general plan or a mandatory element thereof, <em>but does apply to an action attacking a general plan or mandatory element thereof on the basis that it is inadequate.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The City focuses its argument on the second emphasized portion of the above statutory subdivision, arguing that the instant suits, insofar as they constitute an attack on the validity of the City\u2019s general plan itself, are clearly untimely inasmuch as they have been brought months, and even years, after the City\u2019s general plan was either adopted or amended (again, conceding the exception of the adoption of Measure C, understood as an amendment to the City\u2019s general plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Garat, on the other hand, focuses its argument relating to this issue on the first emphasized portion of the above statutory subdivision. Garat argues that the direct attack on the validity of the City\u2019s general plan is not an attack on a \u201cdecision of a legislative body to adopt or amend a general or specific plan,\u201d but, rather, is a direct attack on the extant substance of the general plan, the continuing (allegedly) inadequate condition of the general plan. Carat\u2019s position on this issue does not withstand close scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Our determination as to whether section 65009, subdivision (c), should be applied to Carat\u2019s direct challenge to the validity of the City\u2019s general plan is directed by the Legislature\u2019s purpose in adopting that enactment: . . when the Legislature has stated the purpose of its enactment in unmistakable terms, we must apply the enactment in accordance with the legislative direction, and all other rules of construction must fall by the wayside.\u201d <em>(Milligan </em>v. <em>City of Laguna Beach </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 829, 831 [196 Cal.Rptr. 38, 670 P.2d 1121].)  Here, the purpose underlying the Legislature\u2019s adoption of section 65009 is set forth unmistakably in subdivision (a)(3) thereof: \u201cThe purpose of this section is to provide certainty for property owners and local governments regarding decisions made pursuant to this division.\u201d The Legislature\u2019s clear call for a \u201cquick and certain finality\u201d as to the types of issues encompassed by section 65009 leads us to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">(1) That Carat\u2019s direct attack on the validity of the City\u2019s general plan, inasmuch as it is an attack on \u201ca general plan or mandatory element thereof on the basis that it is inadequate,\u201d <em>is </em>subject to the 120-day statute of limitations set forth in section 65009, subdivision (c); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">(2) That actions \u201cattacking a general plan or mandatory element thereof on the basis that it is inadequate\u201d must be brought in the context of an action \u201c[t]o attack, review, set aside, void, or annul the decision of a legislative body to adopt or amend a general or specific plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We acknowledge that our interpretation of section 65009, subdivision (c), precludes the possibility of an action being brought to challenge the validity of a general plan on the ground of \u201cinadequacy\u201d in the absence of a \u201ctriggering event\u201d such as the adoption or amendment of that plan.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, we find that this limitation on actions challenging general plans is entirely consistent with the expressed legislative desire for finality and certainty set forth in section 65009, subdivision (a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We also acknowledge a further necessary implication of our interpretation of section 65009, subdivision (c): Inasmuch as an adoption of, or amendment to, a general plan is needed to \u201ctrigger\u201d the 120-day \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d within which challenges to the general plan based on inadequacy can be brought, it follows that only those portions of the general plan which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>impacted or influenced by the adoption or amendment can properly be challenged in the action which is brought. This requirement of some sort of nexus of relevancy between the direct object of the challenge (e.g., an amendment to a general plan) and the overall reach of the challenge (e.g., those portions of the general plan being amended or impacted by the amendment) is hardly startling and has been recognized in other contexts by other courts. (See, e.g., <em>Neighborhood Action Group </em>v. <em>County of Calaveras </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1184 [203 Cal.Rptr. 401]; <em>Kings County Farm Bureau </em>v. <em>City of Hanford </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 742 [270 Cal.Rptr. 650]: \u201cThe lack of a mandatory element invalidates the general plan if the missing element is directly involved in the project under review.\u201d)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Carat\u2019s actions were filed within 120 days of the adoption of Measure C. To the extent, then, that Carat\u2019s actions seek to directly challenge the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the City\u2019s general plan, as amended by Measure C, Carat\u2019s actions are timely under section 65009, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Having in these preceding four sections of the opinion resolved the various \u201cprocedural\u201d issues raised by the parties on appeal, we now turn our attention to a substantive review of the trial court\u2019s determination that the City\u2019s general plan was deficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Was the City\u2019s General Plan Legally Inadequate?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">A. <em>Scope of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">As noted in part IV, only Carat\u2019s challenge to the \u201cadequacy\u201d of the City\u2019s general plan as amended by Measure C and as effective on November 3, 1987, is timely under section 65009, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">In addition, although, as noted in part II, Measure R was a zoning ordinance rather than an amendment to the general plan, and thus not subject to challenge under the \u201ctriggering event\u2019Ystatute of limitations/nexus principles discussed in part IV, nonetheless, to the extent that Measure R was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>amended by section 5 of Measure C,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and to the extent such amendment constituted an amendment, by Measure R, of the general plan (see fn. 19, <em>ante), </em>Carat\u2019s challenge to the \u201cadequacy\u201d of those portions of the City\u2019s general plan amended by Measure R, as Measure R was amended by Measure C, is also timely under section 65009, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The issue on appeal is therefore whether the general plan, as amended by section 5 of Measure C in adding subsections (a) and (c)(1) through (5) to subparagraph 3(c) of Measure R, is adequate.  The scope of review is limited by the requirement that there be a nexus between the amendments and the elements or characteristics of the plan claimed to be inadequate. If an amendment affects only a particular zoning category, we must first determine whether a general plan element or portions of the general plan claimed to be legally inadequate for whatever reason, including internal inconsistency, have any relevance as a planning guideline to that category; if not, we need make no determinations as to whether the element or other questioned portions of the general plan are themselves inadequate or inconsistent. (See, e.g., <em>Neighborhood Action Group </em>v. <em>County of Calaveras, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1184.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>As to the contentions in this case, our review concerns whether subsections (a) and (c)(1) through (5) of subparagraph 3, subdivision (c) of Measure R (added by Measure C) and which encompass the following geographical areas, the \u201cGreenbelt,\u201d \u201cLa Sierra Lands,\u201d Sycamore Canyon Park area, other appropriate areas of recreational opportunities for biking, equestrian and hiking uses consistent with farming needs, agricultural and wildlife protection, and lands described as \u201cagricultural\u201d in section 3, subdivision (c) of Measure C, relate to the alleged inadequate portions of the general plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">It should also be noted, because there seems to have been some confusion below on this point, that the scope of review of the adequacy of the City\u2019s general plan is limited to a determination as to whether the plan was adequate <em>as of the time it was amended by Measure C on November 3,1987, </em>and that we are not concerned with whether the general plan was adequate at any time before that. <em>(Lesher Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Walnut Creek </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 545 [277 Cal.Rptr. 1, 802 P.2d 317]. See pt. IV, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>B. Standard of Review.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">General plan adequacy is reviewable under traditional mandate principles. (\u00a7 65751.) On appeal, we conduct an independent review of the plan\u2019s adequacy; the question of whether there has been substantial compliance with the laws related to general plans is one of law, and therefore the conclusion of the trial court is not entitled to any deference. <em>(Kings County Farm Bureau </em>v. <em>City of Hanford, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 692, 742.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">On the other hand, the City\u2019s legislative enactments are entitled to some deference; there is a presumption that both the general plan and the initiative measures amending such are valid (see <em>Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 604-605 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473, 92 A.L.R.3d 1038]), and so long as reasonable minds might differ as to the necessity or propriety of the enactment, the municipality\u2019s (or electorate\u2019s) determination of policy must be upheld. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The only issue to be resolved is whether, applying the standard that the legislation, unless clearly arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, must be upheld <em>(No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 223, 243 [242 Cal.Rptr. 37]), the general plan, as amended, substantially complies with state law, i.e., whether there has been \u201c <em>\u2018actual </em>compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute,\u2019 as distinguished from \u2018mere technical imperfections of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>form.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Camp </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334, 348 [176 Cal.Rptr. 620], italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">In turn, as noted above, this issue is further narrowed by the principle that only insofar as the challenged legislation (here Measure C as a general plan amendment) is factually relevant to the alleged inadequacies of the plan will such inadequacies be reviewed to determine if the plan is adequate. (See <em>Neighborhood Action Group </em>v. <em>County of Calaveras, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1187-1188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">C. <em>Burden of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Because there is a presumption that the City\u2019s general plan and its initiative measure amending the plan are valid and that official duties have been regularly performed, the burden is on those challenging the plan (here Garat) to demonstrate that the plan is inadequate. <em>(Bownds </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 875, 883 [170 Cal.Rptr. 342].) It is also up to Garat to demonstrate the existence of a nexus between any plan inadequacies and the amendments thereto accomplished by Measure C. (See <em>Neighborhood Action Group </em>v. <em>County of Calaveras, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>D. The Meaning of Adequacy.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The term \u201cadequate\u201d has both a common and a legal meaning. The common meaning has overtones of subjectivity: synonyms include \u201cacceptable,\u201d \u201cappropriate,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d and \u201csuitable.\u201d In contrast, the legal meaning of \u201cadequacy,\u201d as that term is used in connection with ascertaining the validity of general plans, is much more circumscribed: to be legally adequate, a plan must show \u201csubstantial compliance with the <em>statutory </em>requirements\u201d for plans <em>(Camp </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d 334, 348; <em>Buena Vista Gardens Apartments Assn. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego Planning Dept. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 289, 297-298 [220 Cal.Rptr. 732]), and any judicial review must not become an impermissible study of the plan\u2019s merits. (175 Cal.App.3d at p. 298; Camp, <em>supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Thus, the standards of adequacy are defined by the statutes related to general plans. Turning to those statutes, the following statutory requirements, for example, are necessary for an adequate general plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">a. A general plan must be \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and \u201clong-term.\u201d (\u00a7 65300.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">b. The plan and its elements and parts must comprise \u201can integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 65300.5)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>c. The plan must address all the elements specified in section 65302, i.e., land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, and safety. (\u00a7\u00a7 65301, 65302.) The degree of specificity and level of detail shall reflect local conditions and circumstances. (\u00a7 65301)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">d. The required elements must meet the criteria, if any, set out in section 65302. For example, the components of the circulation element must be correlated with the land-use element. (\u00a7 65302, subd. (b).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">It follows that even though a plan or its parts may not, from a court\u2019s subjective point of view, be \u201csatisfactory\u201d or \u201csuitable,\u201d nonetheless, unless there is a statutory requirement on point, such unsatisfactoriness or unsuitability may not form a basis for concluding that the plan is legally inadequate.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>E. The Trial Court\u2019s Conclusions as to Adequacy Under Statutory Requirements.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In its statement of decision, the trial court concluded that the general plan was \u201clegally inadequate\" on the basis that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">(1) The land-use element did not contain required building intensity standards for nonresidential categories of land use,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> citing section 65302, subdivision (a) and <em>Twain Harte Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>County of Tuolumne </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 664, 699 [188 Cal.Rptr. 233];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">(2) The housing element did not address housing objectives by income group as required by section 65583, and thus it failed substantially to comply with section 65580 et seq.;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">(3) The circulation element was not correlated with the land-use element as required by section 65302, subdivision (b), and this lack of correlation was not cured by the various community and specific plans;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">(4) The noise element, adopted in 1975, had not been updated to reflect the data in the 1981 circulation and transportation element, thus creating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>inconsistencies between the two elements, and the noise element also failed to provide noise analysis or contours for local industrial plants, \u201cappears vague,\u201d and \u201cdoes not include policies addressing noise compatibility to be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive noise,\u201d all in violation of section 65302, subdivision (f)(5) and <em>Neighborhood Action Group </em>v. <em>County of Calaveras, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1189;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">(5) The general plan itself was not in compliance with the requirements of section 65300 et seq. \u201cbecause it is out of date and fails to accurately reflect current conditions,\u201d apparently in violation of the plan\u2019s own general guidelines which provide that there should be major revisions every four or five years, and revisions as new information becomes available, as well as in violation of the principle set forth in <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d 334, 351 that the status of the general plan as the \u201cconstitution\u201d for the City\u2019s development mandates that the plan be reasonably complete and current;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">(6) The general plan is internally inconsistent, in violation of sections 65300.5 and 65302, subdivision (b), in that the noise element is inconsistent with the circulation and transportation element, the floodplains shown in the open-space/conservation/scenic-highway elements and in the seismic/safety elements are inconsistent with each other, the circulation and transportation element is not correlated with the land-use element, and the land-use categories used in \u201cvarious documents\u201d are inconsistent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">(7) The general plan is not available to the public, landowners, City staff and decision makers, and hence is not a usable planning document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\n<em>F. The Trial Court Erroneously Relied Upon Two Nonstatutory Bases When It Concluded That the City\u2019s General Plan Was Legally Inadequate.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\"> Before discussing the trial court\u2019s adequacy determination based on statutory requirements, we address its conclusion that the general plan was legally inadequate based, in part, on the fact that it had not been updated and the fact that in its current form, i.e., a collection of documents spread out over several locations, rather than a single, easily accessible document, it was not \u201cavailable.\u201d Neither of these facts may form a basis for concluding that the plan is <em>legally </em>inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">1. <em>With One Exception, There Is No Statutory Requirement That a General Plan Be Updated at Any Particular Time</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Garat generally contends that overall the plan was out of date and specifically contends that the following elements were not based on current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>data and were not meaningful planning tools: open space/conservation/ scenic highway, noise and seismic safety, and safety. It further asserts that in November 1987, the general plan was not long-term in perspective because it was adopted in 1969, its \u201chorizon year\u201d was 1990, and it had not been revised in a manner that assured its relevance to current conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">There is no statutory requirement that a general plan be updated at any given interval, or in connection with any given event, except that section 65588, made applicable to the housing element of general plans by section 65302, subdivision (c), provides that the housing element \u201cshall\u201d be reviewed as frequently as necessary to evaluate certain enumerated factors, and that, \u201c[i]n order to facilitate effective review by the department [of Housing and Community Development] of housing elements, local governments . . . shall prepare and adopt the first two revisions of their housing elements no later than the dates specified in\u201d the schedule set out in section 65588, with subsequent revisions to be completed at not less than five-year intervals following the second revisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">It is a well-accepted principle of statutory interpretation that when \u201c1 \u201c \u2018a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject [or the same subject] ... is significant to show that a different intention existed.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>([Williams </em>v. <em>County of San Joaquin </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1326, 1332-1333 [275 Cal.Rptr. 302], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Drake </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 749, 755 [139 Cal.Rptr. 720, 566 P.2d 622], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Valentine </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 121,142 [169 P.2d 1], quoting 23 Cal.Jur. 778, \u00a7 154.)  Thus, where, as here, the Legislature specifically directs that a particular portion of a general plan must be updated on a regularly scheduled basis, but fails to impose a similar requirement as to the plan itself, or any other element or part thereof, we conclude that there is no statutory requirement that anything other than the housing element be regularly revised.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">2. <em>There Is No Statutory Requirement That a General Plan Be Organized or Kept in Any Particular Format or Location</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">There is no statutory requirement, within the Government Code provisions related to general plans, that a general plan be kept in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>format that it is \u201cavailable to the public, landowners, city staff and decision makers.\u201d The only statutory language related to this issue is found in section 65301, subdivisions (a) and (b), which provide that the plan may be adopted \u201cin any format deemed appropriate or convenient by the legislative body, including the combining of elements\u201d and that the plan \u201cmay be adopted as a single document or as a group of documents relating to subjects or geographic segments of the planning area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">It is true that in <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d 334, 349, footnote 8, the reviewing court agreed with those challenging the adequacy of the plan that the physical composition of the plan (which was apparently rather disorganized) made \u201cresort to it an awkward exercise and would also seem to generate doubt concerning the integrity of the plan,\u201d but there was never even a suggestion, much less a holding, that such deficiencies could serve as the basis for invalidating the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">By our opinion on this matter, we do not intend to indicate approval of a general plan which is scattered among various governmental departments and for which there is no comprehensive index, or which is otherwise difficult to obtain in whole or in part. We merely hold that the ease of access to a plan (as opposed to whether it actually exists) is not a basis for attack under a mandate action brought pursuant to section 65751.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>G. Garat Has Failed to Carry Its Burden of Proof as to the Required Nexus Between the General Plan Defects of Which It Complains and the Policies and Geographical Areas of Inquiry Implicated by the Measure C Amendments to the Plan.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">As noted above, it is Carat\u2019s burden to prove that the plan is legally inadequate. (See pt. VC.) The first step which must be taken to meet that burden is to demonstrate the existence of a nexus between the claimed inadequacies of the amended plan and the policies and geographic areas implicated by the amendment. As discussed below in connection with each of the four areas of claimed inadequacy of the elements of the City\u2019s general plan, Garat has failed to meet this initial step of its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">1. <em>Garat Has Failed to Establish a Nexus Between the Asserted Legal Inadequacies of the Land-use, Housing, Circulation and Noise Elements and the Policies and Geographical Areas Implicated by the Measure C Amendments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Garat contends that the Measure C amendments relate to the asserted legal \u201cinadequacies\u201d of the land-use, housing, circulation and noise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>elements of the general plan, separate and apart from the alleged \u201cinconsistencies\u201d within and between various elements of the plan. However, without exception, it has failed to establish any nexus between these legal inadequacies and the policies and geographical areas implicated by the adoption of Measure C.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">a. <em>The Land-use Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Garat contends that the land-use element does not include standards of building intensity recommended for nonresidential categories of land use. In four and one-half pages of discussion about the legal requirement for such a standard, there is not a single word related to any nexus between the policies and geographical areas implicated by the adoption of Measure C and the lack of such standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">b. <em>The Housing Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Garat contends that the housing element fails to include quantified objectives for the provision of housing for all income levels. Again, Garat makes no attempt to argue that there is any nexus between the policies and geographical areas implicated by the adoption of Measure C and this asserted inadequacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">c. <em>The Noise Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Garat contends that the noise element fails to provide noise contours for local industrial plants, and also fails to include land-use policies to minimize the exposure of residents to excessive noise. Again, Garat makes no attempt to argue that there is any nexus between the policies and geographical areas implicated by the adoption of Measure C and this asserted inadequacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">d. <em>The Circulation Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Garat also contends that the circulation element fails to reflect changes in land use since 1981, so that the circulation and land-use elements are not correlated as required by section 65302, subdivision (b). Again, Garat makes no attempt to argue that there is any nexus between the policies and geographical areas implicated by the adoption of Measure C and this asserted inadequacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">\n<em>H. Garat Has Failed to Establish a Nexus Between the Asserted Inconsistencies Within and Between the Various Elements and the Policies and Geographical Areas Implicated by the Adoption of Measure C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Garat contends that certain asserted internal \u201cinconsistencies\u201d within the general plan and between certain elements of the plan, affect the policies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>geographical areas of Measure C. However, without exception, it has failed to establish any nexus between the policies and geographical areas implicated by the adoption of Measure C and these internal inconsistencies. It is not enough to simply point to asserted conflicts between two elements, as Garat has done here; instead, it is necessary to explain how the land-use policies established by Measure C for particular geographical areas described in Measure C will be affected by such inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">For example, in <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698 [179 Cal.Rptr. 261], the Sierra Club brought an action challenging an ordinance which changed the zoning in an area from agricultural to residential uses based on inconsistency between the maps for two elements of the general plan. The Sierra Club demonstrated not only that the map of the land-use element was inconsistent in some areas with the map of the open space/conservation element, but that the particular property in question which had had its zoning changed as a result of the ordinance (here, what we have been referring to as the geographic areas implicated by Measure C policies), while zoned consistently with the map of the land-use element, was inconsistently zoned as to \u201cthe map of the open space conservation element <em>in the area where the [subject] property [was] located.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 703, italics added.) In other words, the plaintiffs established that there was an actual connection between the inconsistent elements and the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">1. <em>The Conflicting Floodplain Maps</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Garat complains that the floodplain map in the open space, conservation and scenic highways element conflicts with the floodplain map in the seismic safety and safety element of the general plan, because the maps were adopted at different times and designate different areas as subject to possible flooding.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Garat makes no attempt to point to a connection between the alleged inconsistency between these two maps and the geographical areas implicated by the adoption of Measure C.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Furthermore, Garat makes no attempt to demonstrate that the difference in the maps is actually an inconsistency. A public entity might well decide, for purposes of planning for seismic safety and general safety, to use a map designating a different degree of flooding and broader land area subject to flooding than the degree and area of flooding considered relevant for open space, conservation and scenic highway planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The fact that section 65302, subdivisions (a), (d), (e) (via \u00a7 65560) and (g) mandate or suggest that the land-use, conservation, open space and safety elements of a general plan <em>all </em>contain information on floodplains and/or flood control is an indication that the degree and risk of flooding may differ depending upon the planned uses to which the land may be put; therefore, the mere fact that the maps in the various elements do not match as to land area does not necessarily mean that there is a legally consequential \u201cinconsistency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The broad objectives of general plans may well be expected to encompass competing interests (see <em>Citizens Assn, for Sensible Development of Bishop Area </em>v. <em>County of Inyo </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151,175 [217 Cal.Rptr. 893]), and an informed resolution of the tension between such competing interests requires that the information related to each objective be provided with an eye towards defining the scope of the conflict, not towards providing information which has been homogenized so that the same subject, i.e., floodplains, is dealt with as a factor unconnected with the objectives related to the general plan element to which the subject relates. To put it another way, section 65300.5 requires that the general plan and its elements and parts \u201ccomprise an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of <em>policies </em>. . . .\u201d It is the <em>policies </em>which must be integrated, internally consistent and compatible, not the maps which simply depict policies applied to specific land areas, not the data and statistics, and not even the objectives within the various elements.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Obviously, of course, misinformation may make it impossible for the public entity to set up and implement policies in a consistent manner, but on this issue, too, a person challenging the adequacy of a general plan must point out the nexus between the inconsistent information and the public entity\u2019s asserted inability to set up or implement consistent policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>2. <em>The Lack of Correlation Between the Circulation and Transportation Element and the Land-use Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Garat contends that the circulation and transportation element is not sufficiently correlated and consistent with the land-use element because the land-use plan diagram has been continually revised since 1981 to reflect changes in land-use designations for \u201cparticular areas within the City,\u201d and additional community and specific plans have been adopted, but the circulation element, which was adopted in 1981, has not been revised to reflect these changes in land-use designations.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Once again, Garat makes absolutely no attempt to point to a connection between the alleged inconsistency and lack of correlation between these two elements and the geographical areas and policies established by the adoption of Measure C. Furthermore, Garat makes no attempt to demonstrate that the various changes in land use and adoption of community and specific plans <em>actually </em>have resulted in an impact on traffic and other circulation and transportation concerns, or whether such impact, if any, was such as to require the circulation element to be updated so as to avoid inconsistency or lack of correlation with the land-use element. Although the normal nature of growth in Southern California might suggest that such would be the case, such a suggestion hardly takes the place of actual evidence sufficient to satisfy Carat\u2019s burden of persuasion, let alone of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">3. <em>Inconsistent and Incompatible Land-use Designations in the General Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Garat next urges that the land-use categories used in various plan documents are inconsistent and incompatible, giving as an example the fact that the land-use plan diagram lists, under the title of \u201cOpen Space/Parks,\u201d three categories: (1) public park, (2) natural arroyo, and (3) local park (with several subcategories of parks), whereas the general plan text describes separate categories denominated as \u201copen space\u201d (which includes steep slopes and washes), \u201curban parks\u201d (with several subcategories), \u201cgolf courses\u201d and \u201cgateway parks.\u201d According to Garat, these inconsistencies make it impossible to determine with certainty what the permitted uses are for property within the City, so that \u201c[t]hus, a basic function of the General Plan, i.e., to guide future land uses, goes unfulfilled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">To repeat, Garat fails to correlate the inconsistencies claimed to exist because of these differing denominations with any policies and geographical areas implicated by the adoption of Measure C and also fails to establish that the differing denominations actually create any legally cognizable inconsistency. For example, it has failed to show that any particular piece of land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>much less the geographical areas designated in Measure C, could not be used as either or both a gateway park pursuant to the categories in the plan\u2019s general text and as a public or local park pursuant to the categories in the land-use element. The mere use of different names for certain categories of use does not prove that the uses are inconsistent or mutually exclusive; \u201cWhat\u2019s in a name?

Once again, Garat fails to establish either a nexus between the alleged inconsistency and the policies and geographical areas provided by the adoption of Measure C <em>or </em>any evidence that the changes in the circulation element actually created a need to update the noise element to avoid the kind of factual inconsistencies which would in turn result in inconsistent <em>policies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Because Garat has failed to establish the requisite nexus between the policies and geographical areas implicated by the Measure C amendment and the claimed inadequacies of the plan as amended by Measure C, we need not consider whether the asserted inadequacies actually exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Was Invalidation of Measures R and C a Proper Remedy for the (Perceived) Invalidity of the City\u2019s General Plan?<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">In direct answer to the question: No, under the circumstances of this case.

We conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the scheme of judicial oversight set forth in article 14, and not judicial invalidation of Measures R and C or a blanket invalidation of the City\u2019s general plan, would have been the appropriate \u201cmechanism\u201d by which to remedy any perceived invalidity/ inadequacy in the City\u2019s general plan.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">vn.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Garat Is Not Entitled to Attorney\u2019s Fees Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The trial court\u2019s \u201cOrder\u201d of September 5, 1989 (and, by reference, its minute order of June 10,1989) finding and declaring the General Plan of the City of Riverside legally invalid is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The trial court\u2019s \u201cRevised Order Regarding Validity of Initiative Measures\u201d of September 5, 1989, finding and declaring Measures R and C legally invalid is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The trial court\u2019s order of April 13, 1990, awarding attorney fees to the petitioners therein (Garat, herein) is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Ramirez, P.

We agree with <em>Day </em>that the better rule, the rule that best serves the jurisdictional underpinnings of the one final judgment rule, is that which recognizes a \u201cseverance exception to the one final judgment rule\u201d only in those instances where there is both an actual severance of causes of action and a showing of separation and independence between the causes of action to be tried first and the causes of action to be tried at a later time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Remaining untried at this time in the Arlington Heights lawsuit are the following invalidity causes of action: (1) The third cause of action (Measures C and R are invalid because they unlawfully hinder the City in fulfilling its legal obligation to meet regional housing needs); (2) the sixth cause of action (Measure C is invalid because it violates the constitutional principle of equal protection of the laws in that it favors owner-agriculturalists over other agriculturalists); (3) the seventh cause of action (Measure C is invalid because it unlawfully interferes with the City\u2019s ability to carry out its administrative fiscal duties); (4) the eighth cause of action (Measure C is invalid because its adoption violated the proscription against the adoption of administrative regulations (as opposed to legislative measures) by the initiative process); (5) the ninth cause of action (Measures C and R are invalid because they are so vague, ambiguous and speculative as to be unenforceable); (6) the tenth cause of action (Measures C and R are invalid because they violate California\u2019s comprehensive scheme of land-use regulation); (7) the eleventh cause of action (Measures C and R are invalid because they violate state laws regulating annexation and prezoning matters and also violate certain constitutional due process rights of some owners of adjacent but noncity property); and (8) the twelfth cause of action (seeking declaratory relief as to all previously pled causes of action).

Rather, <em>Mira </em>simply holds that a zoning enactment, like any other legislative enactment, is subject to the requirement that it not be arbitrary or capricious (that is, that the enactment not constitute such an abuse of discretion as to amount to an abuse of the legislative body\u2019s fundamental police power) and that inconsistency between a zoning enactment and a general plan of a charter city might be one indicia of arbitrariness or capriciousness. This is very different from holding that the section 65803 exemption of charter cities itself has an implied exemption. Indeed, <em>Mira </em>expressly acknowledges the existence of the section 65803 exemption at the very page above cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Even construed as a zoning enactment (due to its amendment of Measure R), however, Measure C still does not initiate or implement any substantive zoning functions such as the zoning of particular areas of land, creating zoning regulations or the classification of certain uses as falling within a given \u201ctype.\u201d Rather, Measure C\u2019s amendment of section 7 of Measure R merely established certain procedural changes in the way in which Measure R\u2019s provisions themselves were to be subject to change.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayx\">To the extent that Measure C is an amendment to the City\u2019s general plan, we deal with the trial court\u2019s rulings and orders in part V of this opinion. Noteworthy is the fact that most of the provisions of Measure C act neither as zoning legislation (establishing land use regulations and zones for particularly described areas, all in implementation of the general plan) nor as an amendment to the general plan regarding policies, objectives and goals for the physical development of the area addressed by the plan. Instead, most of the provisions of Measure C merely direct the City to take general action (and, in certain portions of the Measure, to take specific action) to implement Measure C and carry out the general plan. (See, in particular, \u00a7 5 of Measure C\u2014adding subpar. 3(c), subsecs, (b) and (c)(6) to Measure R\u2014as well as \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7 and 8 of Measure C.)</p>\n<p id=\"ApLe\">There is a question regarding the legal validity of section 8 of Measure C insofar as it directs the City to adopt amendments to its zoning laws and its municipal code (see <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>City of San Clemente </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1504 [277 Cal.Rptr. 550]), but, given the nature of our analysis in this case, we need not address that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Given our conclusion that the trial court erred in invalidating Measure R and Measure C (to the extent it is construed as a zoning enactment) on the ground that they were inconsistent with the City\u2019s general plan, we need not address the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the timeliness of the lawsuits insofar as that challenge relates to the attacks on the validity of the two initiative measures based on their inconsistency with the City\u2019s general plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b265-11\">The trial court also found that the City\u2019s general plan was invalid (\u201cinadequate\u201d) due to (1) the \u201cfact\u201d that significant portions of it were so \u201cout of date\u201d as to be functionally useless as a foundational reference point for planning and development decisionmaking purposes and (2) the \u201cfact\u201d that the plan, as a physical document, was so \u201cunavailable\u201d to the public and to governmental personnel (owing to its lack of collection, collation, indexing and cross-referencing) that it was unusable as a \u201cplanning document.\u201d We address this aspect of the trial court\u2019s analysis in part V of this opinion, and conclude that neither \u201cfact\u201d is a sufficient basis for holding that the general plan is legally invalid/inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The last sentence of section 65300, the sentence which contains the explicit reference to charter cities, was added to the section by the Statutes of 1984, effective January 1, 1985.

Sections 65300 and 65700, subdivision (a), both require that the general plans of charter cities contain the \u201cmandatory elements\u201d set forth in section 65302\u2014and section 65300.5 merely clarifies the manner in which the term \u201cmandatory elements,\u201d as used in section 65302, is to be understood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We are concerned here only with Measure C understood as an amendment to the City\u2019s general plan, not as a zoning enactment As noted in footnote 17 of this opinion, we need not address the timeliness of the challenge to Measure C understood as a zoning enactment inasmuch as the trial court erred, in any event, in invalidating Measure C as a zoning enactment on the ground of inconsistency with the City\u2019s general plan.</p>\n<p id=\"ATOe\">Likewise, we need not address the \u201ctimeliness\u201d argument raised by Garat that Measure R was \u201cre-adopted\u201d by Measure C and was, consequently, subject to a timely challenge by suit in precisely the same fashion as Measure C. Whether or not Measure R was \u201cre-adopted\u201d by Measure C, Measure R is a zoning enactment, not an amendment to a general plan, and the trial court erred in invalidating it on the ground that it was inconsistent with the City\u2019s general plan.

The circulation element failed to make any proposals for dealing with such problems other than to ask higher levels of government for more money. On the other hand, the land-use element projected substantial population increases, without noting that state highways might be inadequate to handle the growth, and did not contain any objective, standard or proposal for restricting unlimited growth if the highways became inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"AIX\">It is apparent that what made these elements legally objectionable as being internally inconsistent and insufficiently correlated with each other was not the discrete pieces of information they contained, i.e., that the roads were adequate, or that there would be substantial population increases, or that problems would surface with the roads as homes and businesses were built, but was instead the failure of the county to adopt objectives, standards or proposals as part of a consistent policy to make sure that population growth did not overwhelm the existing circulation infrastructure, and that the circulation infrastructure would be increased to keep up with population growth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b282-11\">In this section of the opinion, we address a somewhat different issue than that which was addressed in part II of our opinion, above. In part II of our opinion, we discussed the appropriateness <em>vel non </em>of concluding that Measures R and C were invalid <em>ab initio </em>on the ground of their (alleged) inconsistency with the City\u2019s general plan\u2014that is, we discussed the invalidity of Measures R and C in the context of Carat\u2019s direct legal attack on the two initiative measures. In this section of the opinion, we turn our attention to the appropriateness <em>vel non </em>of the trial court\u2019s invalidation of Measures R and C to <em>remedy </em>the (alleged) invalidity of the City\u2019s general plan\u2014that is, we here discuss the invalidation of Measures R and C in the context of Carat\u2019s direct attack on the City\u2019s general plan itself.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa0\">Given the fact that we have already concluded that the City\u2019s general plan is <em>not </em>legally invalid/inadequate insofar as the challenges brought in this case are concerned (see pt. V, <em>ante), </em>we must, and do, acknowledge that the discussion in this section of the opinion is dictum. However, we nevertheless address the question because we are mindful that (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>general plan (in)validity/(in)adequacy is an issue which is likely to appear regularly before the trial courts which are subject to the appellate review of this court and (2) the general issue of the proper remedies in this particular area of the law is one that is apt to present recurring problems for the trial courts. <em>(Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.3d 698, 708.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">It is interesting to note that subdivision (b) of this statutory section provides that noncharter (i.e., general law) cities must bring their noncomplying general plans into conformity with state law and then they must conform their zoning ordinances with the amended general plans. Implicit in this legislative scheme is an acknowledgment that the appropriate remedy for invalid general plans is not the invalidation of zoning enactments adopted with respect to such plans, but the mandate that the general plans be brought into conformity with state law, and then that the zoning enactments be brought into conformity with the (now conforming) general plans. There are at least two desirable goals of sound government served by this approach: (1) It better enables the courts to maintain an appropriate distance and disinvolvement from the legislative function of plan/ordinance adoption; and (2) it better enables the courts to refrain from making (perhaps unwarranted) assumptions as to what should be invalidated and what should not\u2014it is conceivable, for instance, that once a general plan were amended so as to be brought into compliance with state law, it would be unnecessary to amend extant zoning enactments to come into conformity with that general plan. (See also, <em>Lesher Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Walnut Creek, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 531, 546, fn. 12.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Garat has also argued that our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lesher Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Walnut Creek, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 531 supports the use of an \u201cinvalidation remedy\u201d in cases such as this one. Garat\u2019s reliance on <em>Lesher </em>is misplaced. <em>Lesher </em>concerned a situation in which the validity of a zoning ordinance was challenged on the ground that the ordinance was void <em>ab initio </em>because it conflicted at the time of its adoption with a general law city\u2019s general plan; it did not concern a situation such as the one presented by this case\u2014a situation in which the legal challenge is to the validity/adequacy of a general plan itself. In upholding the challenge to the ordinance there in question, our Supreme Court noted in <em>Lesher </em>that the invalidation of the offending zoning ordinance by the lower court actually would do nothing more than \u201ccarry out\u201d that which had already been accomplished by operation of law: \u201cThe court does not invalidate the ordinance. It does no more than determine the existence of the conflict. It is the preemptive effect of the controlling state statute, the Planning and Zoning Law, which invalidates the ordinance.\u201d <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 544.) To invalidate (or, perhaps more accurately, to declare the invalidity of) a zoning ordinance because it was void <em>ab initio </em>is a far different matter than invalidating a zoning ordinance to <em>remedy </em>an invalid general plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 259.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
