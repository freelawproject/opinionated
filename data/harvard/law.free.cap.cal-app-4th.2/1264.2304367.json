In this appeal we confirm that the mother of the injured child may receive damages for emotional distress occasioned by the negligently caused injuries to her daughter. We determine such damages are appropriate because the mother was contemporaneously aware that the explosion was causing the injuries although she did not actually see or hear her daughter being injured. We decide also that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on negligence per se, in refusing to give a special instruction on landlord liability or in allowing graphic testimony of the children\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Kimberly Wilks (Wilks) and her three daughters lived in a residence they rented from George Hom, Tom Hom, Herbert Hom and Campo Lake Properties (appellants). On October 12, 1987, after the family had lived at the residence for about six months, Wilks\u2019s boyfriend, Arthur Ayres (Ayres) hooked up the house\u2019s existing propane system, which had not previously been in use, to a propane stove. Ayres then left the house to do an errand. At about that time Wilks and her three-year-old daughter, Janelle, were in the living room, where Wilks was using a vacuum cleaner. Wilks\u2019s other two daughters, nine-year-old Jessica and seven-year-old Virginia, were in their respective bedrooms. When Wilks finished vacuuming, she called to Virginia to pull the plug out of the socket in Virginia\u2019s room. As Virginia pulled the plug, there was an immediate explosion. Wilks and Janelle were blown out of the house. Wilks tried to return to the living room but was repelled by the heat. She went around the side of the house, broke down a door to Jessica\u2019s room and pulled Jessica out. She then went into Virginia\u2019s room and brought Virginia out of the house. Virginia died of her injuries several hours later. Jessica survived but was severely burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Wilks, as an individual and as guardian ad litem for Janelle and Jessica, and Steven Donnelly, Virginia\u2019s father, brought a cause of action against appellants for the wrongful death of Virginia and for damages for personal injuries to Janelle, Jessica and Wilks. A jury found that appellants Ayres and Wilks had been negligent, that Wilks\u2019s negligence was not a legal cause of damage to the plaintiffs, that Ayres\u2019s negligence was 15 percent responsible, and that appellants\u2019 negligence was 85 percent responsible. The judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>ment allocated to appellants 85 percent of the noneconomic damages and awarded damages to plaintiffs in the following amounts: Virginia\u2019s heirs, $307,964.80; Wilks, $876,755.93; Jessica, $1,778,608.40; and Janelle, $4,172.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Appellants contend the court erred in instructing the jury regarding recovery for emotional distress damages by a bystander, in instructing the jury on negligence per se and in erroneously refusing to give a special instruction regarding landlord liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants also assert it was error for the court to allow graphic testimony about Virginia\u2019s and Jessica\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">I. <em>The Trial Court Properly Instructed the Jury on Awarding Damages for Emotional Distress to a Bystander</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Appellants contend the trial court erred in instructing the jury on liability to a bystander who observes a negligently caused injury to a loved one.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The bystander theory of recovery for emotional distress caused by witnessing an injury was definitively established in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Legg </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 728 [69 Cal.Rptr. 72, 441 P.2d 912, 29 A.L.R.3d 1316], In <em>Dillon, </em>a mother and her daughter sought damages for the emotional distress they experienced when watching a car hit and roll over another daughter/sister as she crossed the street. The Supreme Court determined that in deciding whether such damage could be deemed the proximate result of a defendant\u2019s negligence, courts should take into account such factors as: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plaintiff from the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence. (3) Whether plaintiff and the victim were closely related, as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relationship.\u201d (68 Cal.2d at pp. 740-741.) The court predicted that more definitive boundaries of liability would be drawn in subsequent cases. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 741.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>\u201c(1) Whether plaintiff was located near the scene of the accident as contrasted with one who was a distance away from it. (2) Whether the shock</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>Courts after <em>Dillon </em>did attempt further definition of the limits of liability. Evolution of the law under their several rulings, however, was neither uniform nor predictable. The Supreme Court in <em>Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 644 [257 Cal.Rptr. 865, 771 P.2d 814] observed that the trend of Court of Appeal decisions had resulted in relaxed guidelines and produced inconsistent rulings and critical comment. The factual setting of <em>Thing </em>was that of a mother whose emotional distress resulted from being informed her son had been struck by a car, then rushing to the scene and witnessing the damage minutes after the accident happened. The trial court had found this scenario inadequate to permit the mother\u2019s claim, ruling against her on summary judgment. The Court of Appeal disagreed, concluding the elements of negligent infliction of emotional distress were sufficiently established.  The Supreme Court reversed the appellate court ruling and then set out \u201cto create a clear rule under which liability may be determined.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 664.) The court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-6\">\u201cIn order to avoid limitless liability out of all proportion to the degree of a defendant\u2019s negligence, and against which it is impossible to insure without imposing unacceptable costs on those among whom the risk is spread, the right to recover for negligently caused emotional distress must be limited. (48 Cal.3d at p. 664.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">To illustrate how the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines had been relaxed, the <em>Thing </em>court reviewed prior cases, first pointing to <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 59 [137 Cal.Rptr. 863, 562 P.2d 1022]. There, the court had held that the plaintiff need not visually perceive the third party injury in order to satisfy the <em>Dillon </em>guideline, suggesting only that he must suffer shock from \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 656, quoting <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 76.) In <em>Krouse, </em>the plaintiff sat in the driver\u2019s seat of his car and knew that his wife was at the curb closing the door to the back seat when a car negligently driven by the defendant approached the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s car, straddled the curb and hit and killed the plaintiff\u2019s wife. The <em>Krouse </em>court ruled it was sufficient that the plaintiff knew his wife\u2019s position an instant before she was struck, saw the defendant\u2019s car coming toward her at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>high speed, and knew it must have hit his wife. <em>(Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 76.)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The <em>Thing </em>court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-6\">\u201cWe also find in <em>Krouse, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 59, the roots of the uncertainty reflected by the instant case over whether the plaintiff must perceive the injury causing incident at all or may recover for emotional distress suffered on viewing its \u2018immediate consequences\u2019 even though not present at the scene when it occurred.\u201d <em>(Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 656.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">The court observed that the uncertainty it noted derived from the <em>Krouse </em>court\u2019s approval of <em>Archibald </em>v. <em>Braverman </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 253 [79 Cal.Rptr. 723], <em>Archibald </em>had extended the potential scope of the bystander claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress by permitting recovery by a mother who did not witness the accident but arrived on the scene very shortly thereafter to see her son\u2019s injuries. The court in <em>Thing </em>distinguished the facts of <em>Dillon </em>and presumably <em>Krouse </em>by noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-8\">\u201cThus, it appeared that this court agreed that persons who were not present at the accident scene could recover damages for the emotional distress they later suffered when told by others of the injury to their loved one or when they later came to the scene.\u201d <em>(Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 656.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">The <em>Thing </em>court then went on to illustrate how the <em>Dillon </em>guidelines had been relaxed in other areas by discussing cases which followed <em>Krouse. </em>(48 Cal.3d at pp. 657-661.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Then, reiterating the necessity of limiting liability <em>(id. </em>at p. 664), the court determined recovery must be limited \u201cto plaintiffs who personally and contemporaneously perceive the injury-producing event and its traumatic consequences.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 666.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">The court thus set forth the rule as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>\u201c[A] plaintiff may recover damages for emotional distress caused by observing the negligently inflicted injury of a third person if, but only if, said plaintiff: (1) is closely related to the injury victim; (2) is present at the scene of the injury-producing event at the time it occurs and is then aware that it is causing injury to the victim; and (3) as a result suffers serious emotional distress\u2014a reaction beyond that which would be anticipated in a disinterested witness and which is not an abnormal response to the circumstances.\u201d <em>(Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 667-668.)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The court noted: \u201cThese factors were present in <em>Ochoa </em>and each of this court\u2019s prior decisions upholding recovery for NIED [negligent infliction of emotional distress].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Thing </em>v. <em>La Chusa, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 668.)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Thus, the <em>Thing </em>court affirmed that bystander damages may be recovered only by a plaintiff who is present at the injury-producing event at the time it occurs and is then aware that it is causing injury to the victim. The court\u2019s analysis did not indicate disapproval, however, of the holding in <em>Krouse </em>that the plaintiff need not visually perceive the injury while it is being inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">The instruction in this case closely tracked the teaching of <em>Thing </em>and was also tailored to the facts of the case. It required that the plaintiff be \u201cpresent at the scene of the accident at the time it occurred\u201d and be \u201caware that such accident caused the injury to Jessica.\u201d Notable is the omission of a requirement that the plaintiff actually \u201cwitness\u201d the injury to Jessica as and when it occurred. We find this instruction to be entirely in accord with the <em>Dillon </em>principle as refined in <em>Thing. </em>Following <em>Krouse, </em>we conclude it is not necessary that a plaintiff bystander actually have witnessed the infliction of injury to her child, provided that the plaintiff was at the scene of the accident and was sensorially aware, in some important way, of the accident and the necessarily inflicted injury to her child. Here, although Wilks could not visually witness the infliction of injuries to Jessica, she was most evidently present at the scene of the accident, was personally impressed by the explosion at the same instant damage was done to her child, and instantly knew of the likely severe damage to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Appellants argue Wilks\u2019s testimony demonstrates that at the time of the explosion she was not then aware that it was causing injury to Jessica. We disagree. Wilks responded to questioning by her attorney as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-9\">Q: \u201cCould you see [Virginia] or Jessica when the explosion occurred?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>A: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">Q: \u201cDo you know where they were when the explosion occurred?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-6\">A: \u201cYes, they were both in their own rooms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-8\">Q: \u201cDid you say anything to anybody before the explosion occurred?\u201d A: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-9\">Q: \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-10\">A: \u201cI asked [Virginia] to unplug the vacuum cleaner cord.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-12\">Q: \u201cDo you have any recollection\u2014what happened once you told her to unplug the plug, what happened after that, did she say anything back to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-13\">A: \u201cOn the way to go unplug the cord, she said, \u2018yes, Mom.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-14\">Q: \u201cOkay, then what happened then?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-15\">A: \u201cThe house immediately exploded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-16\">Q: \u201cWhere was [Virginia] when the house exploded?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-17\">A: \u201cIn her bedroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-19\">Q: \u201cHow do you know if she unplugged the cord, because at that point you couldn\u2019t see?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-20\">A: \u201cBecause I remember Jessica screaming, \u2018plug the cord back in.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-22\">Q: \u201cWhat did you see or hear or feel when the explosion occurred?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-23\">A: \u201cThe walls moving, a bright flash coming out of [Virginia\u2019s] bedroom into where I was standing. It went back into the room. It slammed the doors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>with it. I heard the windows blow out of the front of the house in the girls\u2019 room and the living room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-5\">Q: \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">A: \u201cI was blown out of the front door.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-7\">Q: \u201cWhat did you do then?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-8\">A: \u201cI immediately stood up, put my glasses on. I went into the front door. I probably got halfway in. It was warm in there, very hot. And my hair caught back on fire again. I ran back out the front door, going down to Jessica\u2019s bedroom door. That door was locked. I had to kick in the door, go in and get my daughter out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-9\">\u201cThen you said you immediately ran back [into] the house. How far did you get? Relative\u2014let\u2019s say there was the front door. Where were you running to as you started to go back into the house?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-10\">A: \u201cTo go back to [Virginia\u2019s] door to open\u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-11\">Q: \u201cIs that the door where you saw the explosion come out of?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-12\">A: \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">Wilks\u2019s testimony establishes that she knew Virginia and Jessica were in their bedrooms at the time of the explosion. She heard Virginia\u2019s voice just before the explosion and Jessica\u2019s scream just afterward. The girls\u2019 bedrooms were immediately adjacent to each other, being connected only by a low opening in the wall between them. Wilks experienced the force of the explosion, strong enough to propel her and her youngest daughter Janelle out the front door, and she knew the flash emanated from Virginia\u2019s room. Wilks had to have known at the time of the explosion that both Jessica and Virginia were experiencing injury. Her testimony is sufficient to establish the requirement that she personally and contemporaneously perceived the injury-producing event and its traumatic consequences. In any event, the evidence is assuredly sufficient to warrant the giving of the questioned instruction and amply supports the jury\u2019s verdict based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">II.-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Wiener, Acting P.
