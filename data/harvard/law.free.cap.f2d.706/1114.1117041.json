Sec. 1291. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981). In view of this decisive Supreme Court authority the effort to appeal is palpably frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-15\">The appeal is DISMISSED. The trial court is directed to assess damages to the appellee caused by the appeal, to include a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. Appellee is also awarded double costs.
