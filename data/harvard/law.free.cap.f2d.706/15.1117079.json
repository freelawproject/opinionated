We believe that they do, and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Appellant\u2019s initial complaint, in state court, alleged that an unsubstantiated accusation of embezzlement cost him his work-study job in Boston University\u2019s, comptroller\u2019s office; that, after he was \u201cterminated for academic deficiency\u201d the Law School\u2019s Administrative Board refused him readmission, in part because of this accusation and in part from racial bias; and that he had not received his final work-study paycheck until after a wrongful delay. He claimed that Boston University officials thereby violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and committed various state torts. Without reaching any factual issues, the state court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims on the ground that, in any event, Boston University\u2019s acts were those of a private university, not the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Appellant then filed this complaint in federal court. He alleged essentially the same facts. He added an allegation that the refusal to readmit him was part of a pattern and practice of discrimination against blacks; and he alleged a conspiracy among the defendants not to readmit him. He produced several new legal theories claiming that defendants had violated (in addition to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1985(3), 1986, the Fourteenth Amendment, and state tort law. The district court discussed neither plaintiff\u2019s allegations of discrimination, nor Boston University\u2019s assertion that plaintiff\u2019s academic performance was unusually poor. Rather, it dismissed the complaint on res judicata grounds. For purposes of this appeal, it is conceded that the parties were the same in both actions. But appellant, contending that the \u201ccauses of action\u201d differed, argues that res judicata does not bar his federal court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">The legal principles governing this case are well-settled. Res judicata applies in civil rights actions. <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982) (Title VII); <em>Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980) (\u00a7 1983); <em>Landrigan </em>v. <em>City of Warwick, </em>628 F.2d 736 (1st Cir. 1980); <em>Griffin v. Burns, </em>570 F.2d 1065 (1st Cir.1978); <em>Lovely v. Laliberte, </em>498 F.2d 1261 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1038, 95 S.Ct. 526, 42 L.Ed.2d 316 (1974). Federal courts are to give state court judgments the res judicata effect that state law prescribes. <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., supra; Allen v. McCurry, supra. </em>And, Massachusetts courts apply res judicata in a perfectly traditional manner. That is to say, the doctrine prevents the relitigation of \u201cissues that were or could have been dealt with in an earlier litigation.\u201d <em>Angel v. Bullington, </em>330 U.S. 183, 193, 67 S.Ct. 657, 662, 91 L.Ed. 832 (1947). The entry of a valid and final judgment on the merits \u201cextinguishes ... all rights of a plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the complaint arose.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 61(1), Tent.Draft No. 5, quoted in <em>Boyd v. Jamaica Plain Co-op Bank, </em>7 Mass.App. 153, 386 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>775, 781 (Mass.App.1979) (final form: Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The state court entered a valid, final judgment against appellant in the first case. Under Massachusetts law, as elsewhere, a dismissal for failure to state a claim, under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), operates as <em>a </em>dismissal on the merits, see Mass. R.Civ.P. 41(b)(3), with res judicata effect. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 19 comment d; see <em>Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, </em>452 U.S. 394, 399 n. 3, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 2428 n. 3, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981) (dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)); <em>England v. Automatic Canteen Co. of America, </em>349 F.2d 988 (6th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>383 U.S. 925, 86 S.Ct. 928, 15 L.Ed.2d 845 (1966) (same). Moreover, here appellant was given a full opportunity to amend his state court complaint, see Mass. R.Civ.P. 15(a), and he might have set forth any additional claims \u2014 a circumstance that in Massachusetts has traditionally led the courts to consider a subsequent dismissal for failure to state a claim to be a final dismissal on the merits. <em>McArdle v. Schneider, </em>228 F.Supp. 506 (D.Mass.1964); <em>Osserman v. Jacobs, </em>369 Mass. 200, 339 N.E.2d 193 (1975); <em>Magaletta v. Millard, </em>346 Mass. 591, 195 N.E.2d 324 (1964); <em>Spector v. Loreck, </em>342 Mass. 685, 175 N.E.2d 262 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Given the initial dismissal, the issue before us is simply whether the new complaint grows out of the same \u201ctransaction or series of connected transactions\u201d (Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24) as the old complaint. If so, the fact that appellant now asserts new legal theories, embodied in different statutes and different common law doctrines, does not help him. A \u201cstatement of a different form of liability\u201d cannot overcome res judicata\u2019s bar if \u201cit grows out of the same transaction, act, or agreement, and seeks redress for the same wrong.\u201d <em>Mackintosh v. Chambers, </em>285 Mass. 594, 596, 190 N.E. 38 (1934). In Massachusetts, as elsewhere, a second claim is barred \u201ceven though the plaintiff is prepared in the second action ... to present evidence, grounds, or theories of the case not presented in the first action. ... \u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 25; <em>Boyd v. Jamaica Plain Co-op Bank, </em>386 N.E.2d at 781. <em>See Nilsen v. City of Moss Point, </em>701 F.2d 556 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc). The issue is \u201cnot whether the plaintiff in fact argued his [civil rights] claims in the state proceeding, but whether he could have.\u201d <em>Lovely v. Laliberte, </em>498 F.2d 1261, 1263 (1st Cir.1974). <em>See Manego v. Cape Cod Five Cents Savings Bank, </em>692 F.2d 174, 175 n. 2 (1st Cir.1982). And, if the transactions here at issue are essentially the same as those in the state court case, he could have asserted his present claims there.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Appellant argues that the facts at issue here and in the state court differ. Minor factual variations, however, are beside the point. The question, as put by the Massachusetts courts, is whether the second claim \u201cgrows out of the same transaction, act, or agreement and seeks redress for the same wrong,\u201d <em>Mackintosh v. Chambers, </em>285 Mass, at 596, 190 N.E. 38, or whether \u201cthe second claim is an impermissible variation on the theme of the first,\u201d <em>Bradford v. Richards, </em>11 Mass.App. 595, 417 N.E.2d 1234, 1237 (Mass.App.1981). We have required \u201cseparate and distinct wrongs resting on different factual bases.\u201d <em>Landrigan v. City of Warwick, </em>628 F.2d at 741. The Restatement of Judgments defines \u201ctransaction or series of transactions\u201d pragmatically, by looking at \u201cwhether the facts are related in time, space, origin or motivation, [and] whether they form a convenient trial unit . ... \u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Having examined both complaints, we conclude that the underlying transactions are the same. The first complaint concerned an allegedly false accusation of embezzlement, a loss of a job, and the Board\u2019s refusal to readmit appellant to law school. The second complaint concerns these same occurrences. Appellant now claims that some of these actions formed part of a larger pattern of discrimination and conspiracy. But there are no factual allegations suggesting that his claim grows out of a significantly different \u201ctransac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tion.\u201d Indeed, as a practical matter, all the issues appellant now seeks to raise could easily have been raised as part of the first proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Appellant cites <em>Landrigan </em>as his strongest supporting precedent. But, we believe that <em>Landrigan </em>offers more support to the appellee. In <em>Landrigan </em>a plaintiff first brought and won a state court claim for assault against a police officer who broke his leg. He then sued the officer in federal court under \u00a7 1983, for the use of excessive force, and he also sued other police officers under \u00a7 1983 for having conspired to cover up the first officer\u2019s attack. We affirmed a dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 claim against the first officer, for the leg breaking was at the bottom of both the assault and the \u00a7 1983 claim. We allowed the \u00a7 1983 action against the other officers to go forward because the transaction at issue was quite different: the conspiracy did not begin until the leg was broken; it involved false arrest, false police reports and false testimony; and it could not have been made part of the first proceeding without extensive factual amendment of the complaint. Hence, the transactions differed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In this case, the new conspiracy alleged effectively embraces the acts formerly complained of and adds little that is factually different. The \u201cfailure to readmit\u201d plaintiff to law school is at the heart of both the old and the new complaints. There are numerous other factual similarities as well. These similarities lead us to conclude that the relevant transactions underlying the two complaints are the same. Hence, principles of res judicata bar the federal court complaint, and the judgment of dismissal is</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
