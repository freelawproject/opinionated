Byrons Enterprises appeal under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (West 1982) from an order directing them to reinstate plaintiff to his former position as Merchandise Manager. This order was entered after a jury found for the plaintiff on his claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 621, <em>et seq. </em>(West 1982). The issue of compensatory damages was reserved for determination by the trial court, and a final judgment has yet to be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">It is well-established that the granting of an injunction is appealable as an interlocutory order even though the trial court may have reserved its determination of remaining issues, such as compensatory damages. <em>See, e.g., Laje v. R.E. Thomason General Hospital, </em>564 F.2d 1159, 1161-62 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 905, 98 S.Ct. 3091, 57 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1978);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Williams Electronics v.

University of Puerto Rico, </em>575 F.2d 335, 337-38 (1st Cir. 1978). It is also clear that the trial court\u2019s order that plaintiff be reinstated pending a determination of damages was \u201cin the nature of an injunction.\u201d <em>Laje </em>v. <em>R.E. Thomason General Hospital, </em>564 F.2d at 1161;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see Carson v.

Miller, 16 Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Jurisdiction \u00a7 3922, at 29 (1977). We therefore hold that the reinstatement order is appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) as an interlocutory order granting an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-13\">Finding no merit in appellants\u2019 several arguments regarding the propriety of the reinstatement order, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1206-23\">. In <em>Laje, </em>the plaintiff, a psychiatrist, had been discharged from a hospital and denied staff privileges. The trial court, while reserving its decision as to the legality of the plaintiff\u2019s termination, ordered the hospital to grant him staff privileges. The court held that this order was appealable as an injunction under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). <em>See </em>564 F.2d at 1161.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
