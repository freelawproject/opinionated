On the first appeal we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Pegues\u2019 \u00a7 1983 cause of action on the basis of untimeliness, but reversed its holding that Singleton<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relief was unavailable due to Pegues\u2019 delay in bringing suit. Concluding that the mere passage of time was insufficient to bar a <em>Singleton </em>claim, we remanded with instructions to consider the preclusive effect of Pegues\u2019 delay under the aegis of the traditional doctrine of laches. <em>Pegues v. Morehouse Parish School Board, </em>632 F.2d 1279 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 987, 101 S.Ct. 2322, 68 L.Ed.2d 844 (1981) <em>(Pegues </em>I). Following a bench trial, the district court held on remand that Pegues had failed to establish that he was entitled to Singleton\u2019s remedies and that, in any event, his claim was barred by laches. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">Pegues, a black male, was employed as head football coach and teacher at the all-black Morehouse High School in Bastrop, Louisiana, for five years prior to the conversion of that school to a junior high school and the transfer of its student body to Bastrop High School in compliance with a parish-wide desegregation order in 1969. Under this order, seven parish high schools, three of which had football programs, were consolidated into three high schools, each of which had a football program. Two of the head football coaches at the newly-consolidated schools were white, and one was a black who formerly served as an assistant under Pegues. Pegues was assigned to Bastrop High as assistant football coach. The white head football coach at Bastrop High resigned in 1970 and was replaced by a white. Pegues was not informed of the vacancy, was not offered the job and made no application therefor. In 1972 and again in 1973, the head football coach at Bastrop High resigned and a white replacement was hired. Pegues was informed of neither vacancy. He orally made known his desire for the head coach job at another of the parish\u2019s high schools. In 1977 Pegues was relieved of football coaching duties and was appointed head track coach at Bastrop High. The instant complaint was filed in March 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">After trial on remand the district court rejected Pegues\u2019 complaint, finding that since the number of head football coaching positions was not reduced by the desegregation decree, Pegues\u2019 demotion did not come within the purview of <em>Singleton. </em>Assuming, however, that the <em>Singleton </em>criteria were applicable, the district court concluded that Pegues\u2019 delay in complaining about his 1969 demotion was inexcusable and presumptively prejudicial, and that defendants had therefore sustained their burden of proving laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>\n<em>Res Judicata and the Law of the Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"am0-dedup-0\">Aside from a eonclusional assertion that the district court erred in finding that no reduction in the relevant work force had occurred during the desegregation process, Pegues does not challenge the trial court\u2019s rejection of his <em>Singleton </em>claim. Rather, he contends for the first time on appeal that the district court was bound by principles of <em>res judicata </em>and the law of the case to adhere to the panel\u2019s determination in <em>Pe-gues </em>I that <em>Singleton </em>was applicable, and that his rights accruing thereunder had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">It is axiomatic that an issue not raised in the trial court will not be considered on appeal unless it involves a pure question of law, and our refusal to address it would result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. Hunt, </em>694 F.2d 1358 (5th Cir.1983). Recognizing that \u201c[t]he matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal.... \u201d is committed to the discretion of the courts of appeals the Supreme Court remarked: \u201cthere are circumstances in which a federal appellate court is justified in resolving an issue not passed on below, as where the proper resolution is beyond any doubt ... or where \u2018injustice might otherwise result\u2019.\u201d <em>Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 121, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2877, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976). Because the preclusive effect of the law of the case and <em>res judicata </em>doctrines presents a pure legal question, and being satisfied that no prejudice will accrue to the defendants, <em>see Payne v. McLemore\u2019s Wholesale &amp; Retail Stores, </em>654 F.2d 1130 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1000, 102 S.Ct. 1630, 71 L.Ed.2d 866 (1982), we exercise our discretion and address the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">As we observed in <em>Loumar </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>698 F.2d 759 (5th Cir.1983): <em>Id. </em>at 762. <em>Res judicata </em>attaches only to a final judgment on the merits, rendering that judgment conclusive and binding upon the parties in any ensuing action. <em>Loumar; </em>1B J. Moore and T. Currier, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 10.404[1] (1982). By way of contrast, the law of the case concept applies to a single proceeding, and operates to foreclose re-examination of decided issues either on remand or on a subsequent appeal. <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., </em>644 F.2d 1059 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>500 F.2d 659 (5th Cir. 1974). Unlike <em>res judicata, </em>the law of the case doctrine does not encompass issues presented for decision but left unanswered by the appellate court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">The law of the case doctrine is closely related to the principle of res judicata. The latter prevents collateral attack on the result of the completed lawsuit between the same parties; the former prevents collateral attacks against the court\u2019s rulings during the pendency of a lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">By definition, neither doctrine is applicable herein. The <em>Pegues </em>I court reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and instructed that the question of untimely filing was to be analyzed under the doctrine of laches. We did not decide whether Pegues\u2019 complaint triggered <em>Singleton </em>\u2019s protections; we did not reach that issue. Any comment in <em>Pegues </em>I regarding the merits of Pegues\u2019 <em>Singleton </em>claim was obiter dicta. There having been no judgment on the merits rendered on the <em>Singleton </em>claim, the decision in <em>Pegues </em>I may not serve as the basis for either a <em>res judicata </em>or law of the case challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">\n<em>Singleton</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Pegues assails the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Singleton\u2019s teachings do not dictate the resolution of his claim. Pegues misperceives our holding in <em>Singleton. </em>To ensure that black school personnel were not disparately impacted by staff reductions or rearrangements occasioned by the merger of previously one-race schools, in <em>Singleton </em>we promulgated detailed standards governing employment practices during the transition from a dual to a unitary educational system. Of particular relevance to the case at bar is our mandate that dismissals and demotions may-not be premised on racial or ethnic considerations and, in instances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>dismissals or demotions accomplished pursuant to objective, nondiscriminatory criteria, qualified staff members thus displaced must be given rights of first refusal with respect to subsequent vacancies. The reinstatement preference created by <em>Singleton </em>is limited to cases where a desegregation-related reduction of school staff members has been shown. <em>Fort Bend Independent School District v. City of Stafford, </em>651 F.2d 1133 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Barnes v. Jones County School District, </em>544 F.2d 804 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Although there was evidence of an overall decrease in the faculty and professional staff, the number of football coaches, both head and assistant, employed by the Morehouse Parish School Board did not diminish during the relevant period. The reduction in personnel must be measured in terms of those positions substantially similar to that held by the displaced employee. <em>Lee v. Pickins County School System, </em>563 F.2d 143, 145 n. 1 <em>(\u201cSingleton </em>refers to \u2018a reduction in the number of principals, teachers, teacher-aides, or other professional staff ... \u2019\u2019 419 F.2d at 1218. Accordingly, it is clearly appropriate to look solely to the number of principals involved instead of the total number of personnel involved.\u201d); <em>Ayers v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>555 F.2d 1309 (5th Cir.1977), <em>rev\u2019d in part sub nom. on other grounds, Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979) (counselor positions). <em>See generally Moore </em>v. <em>Tangipahoa Parish School Board, </em>594 F.2d 489 (5th Cir.1979). Pegues having thus failed to discharge his burden of proving the requisite elements of a <em>Singleton </em>violation, <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Houston Independent School District, </em>569 F.2d 1383 (5th Cir.1978), his claim was properly denied. In light of this holding, we need not address the propriety of the trial court\u2019s treatment of the laches issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">\n<em>Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Contending that Pegues\u2019 arguments on appeal are patently frivolous, defendants ask us to exercise our discretion under Fed.R.App.P. 38<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to award them double costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Even though Pegues did not succeed in establishing his right to <em>Singleton </em>relief, our examination of the record does not lead us to conclude that his assertions of a racially-motivated demotion and subsequent refusal to appoint him to several head coach vacancies at Bastrop High School are wholly devoid of merit. Nor does the rejection of his <em>res judicata </em>and law of the case arguments compel a finding of bad faith, vexatiousness, or frivolousness. We are persuaded that this is not an appropriate case for the imposition of sanctions, and deny defendants\u2019 request for damages and costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-15\">. <em>Singleton v.
