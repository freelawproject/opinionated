WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b668-24\">This appeal is from a final order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It presents a new facet of the question whether, and under what circumstances, a bankrupt\u2019s pension trust may be exempt from the \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d subject to the reach of the trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors. Debtors, Elbert Wayne Goff and Gloria Jane Schadoer Goff, seek refuge for their self-employed retirement (Keogh) plans<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under Section 541(c)(2) of the new Bankruptcy Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which exempts property subject to restrictions on alienation which are enforceable \u201cunder applicable nonbankruptcy law.\u201d The Goffs argue that this reference to \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law\u201d was intended to reach broadly by encompassing restrictions on transfer recognized in other federal statutory law as well as traditional state trust law. Their argument presents a question of first impression to this Court. The contention is that Section . 541(c)(2) exempts all pension trusts which are qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because of ERISA\u2019s restrictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>on assignment and alienation of qualified trusts. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(a)(13); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1). For the reasons set out below, we conclude that Congress did not intend Section 541(c)(2) to have the extensive reach urged by appellant-debtors and that ERISA\u2019s anti-alienation provisions do not operate by their own force to shelter pension funds in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Debtors, husband- and wife, filed a voluntary joint petition in bankruptcy, under Chapter 7 of the Code, on March 20, 1980. Pursuant to Section 522(b)(2)(A), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A), they elected to avail themselves of the state rather than the federal (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)) bankruptcy exemptions, presumably because of the high equity value of their homestead which could be retained under Texas law but not the federal law. Tex.Stat.Ann. art. 3833, 3836 (Vernon 1966 &amp; Supp.1982-1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The subjects of this appeal are the Goffs\u2019 self-employed retirement trusts (Keogh Plan), administered by City National Bank pursuant to an ERISA-qualified pension plan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the time of the proceedings below, the Keogh trusts were valued at over $90,000, including a $2,878 contribution made by the Goffs only three days prior to declaration of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The trust agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">Section XIII-MISCELLANEOUS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">Neither the assets nor the benefits provided hereunder shall be subject to alienation, anticipation, assignment, garnishment, attachment, execution or levy of any kind, and any attempt to cause such benefits to be so subjected shall not be recognized, except to such extent as may be required by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">No withdrawals were ever made although the trust agreement arguably granted Dr. Goff the right to withdraw funds prematurely, <em>i.e., </em>prior to either retirement, sale or termination of his business, or death, subject only to the ten percent tax penalty exacted by the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 72(m)(5). The Goffs excluded these Keogh-trusts from the \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d to be relinquished in bankruptcy. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">After the creditors\u2019 committee opposed a compromise proposed by the trustee in bankruptcy,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the bankruptcy court entered its Memorandum Order and Opinion from which this appeal was taken. The court denied the trustee\u2019s application to compromise, and held that the corpus of both trusts were to be considered \u201cproperty of the estate,\u201d as they were not subject to the exclusion contained in Section 541(c)(2) of the Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(2), as property subject to restrictions on alienation enforceable under \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law.\u201d We agree. Our examination of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s provisions and of discernible congressional intent reveals that applicable nonbankruptcy law was intended as a narrow reference to state \u201cspendthrift trust\u201d law and not as a broad reference to all other law, both federal and state, including ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">A. <em>\u201cProperty of the </em>Estate\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The Bankruptcy Code was intended to create a more uniform and comprehensive scope to \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d which is subject to the reach of debtors\u2019 creditors than had previously existed under the old Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under Section 70(a) of the earlier Act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the inclusion of an asset within the estate varied in accordance with (1) an individual examination of the legal nature of the asset (2) in light of the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act. This two part test reflected the dual and often conflicting policies woven into the Act. These policies were to secure for the benefit of creditors everything of value the bankrupt might possess in alienable or leviable form, but to permit a bankrupt to accumulate new wealth after the date of his petition and to allow him an unencumbered fresh start. Relying upon these competing considerations, the Supreme Court developed a rule that where property \u201cis sufficiently rooted in pre-bankruptcy past and so little entangled with the bankrupts\u2019 ability to make an unencumbered fresh start ... it should be regarded as \u2018property\u2019 [of the estate].\u201d <em>Segal v. Rochelle, </em>382 U.S. 375, 380, 86 S.Ct. 511, 515, 15 L.Ed.2d 428 (1966). <em>See Kokoszka v. Belford, </em>417 U.S. 642, 646, 94 S.Ct. 2431, 2434, 41 L.Ed.2d 374 (1974) (\u201c[T]he crucial analytical key [is] not ... an abstract articulation of the statute\u2019s purpose, but ... an analysis of the nature of the asset involved in light of those principles\u201d); <em>Lines v. Frederick, </em>400 U.S. 18, 91 S.Ct. 113, 27 L.Ed.2d 124 (1970); <em>Nunnally v. Nunnally, </em>506 F.2d 1024 (5th Cir.1975) (finding that Navy retirement benefits, under applicable Texas law, were \u201cproperty\u201d in the bankruptcy estate). <em>See also Lockwood v. Exchange Bank, </em>190 U.S. 294, 23 S.Ct. 751, 47 L.Ed. 1061 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">The enactment of the Bankruptcy Code undertook to obviate this analytical conundrum. Under Section 541 of the Code, all property in which a debtor has a \u201clegal or equitable interest\u201d at the time of bankruptcy comes into the estate, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1), This is so \u201cnotwithstanding any provision [except as recognized in subsection (2)] that restricts or conditions transfer of such interest by the debtor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541(c)(1)(A). The sweeping scope of this automatic inclusion was intended to remedy much of the old Act\u2019s perceived deficiencies: \u201c[The Act was] a complicated melange of references to State law, and [did] little to further the bankruptcy policy of distribution of the debtor\u2019s property to his creditor in satisfaction of his debts.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 175 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5963, 6136. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 82, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5868.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>B. <em>Exemption and Exclusions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZF\">Of relevance to the question posed herein, two sections of the Code \u2014 Sections 522 and 541(c)(2) \u2014 permit a debtor to retain certain assets which would otherwise remain subject to the reach of his creditors. The property exempted pursuant to Section 522 initially enters the estate, and is subsequently excluded pursuant to the section\u2019s provisions. By contrast, Section 541(c)(2) property never enters the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">1. <em>Section 522: Exemptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"ajq-dedup-0\">Section 522(b) permits a bankrupt a choice between a \u201cfederal\u201d or \u201cstate\u201d exemption system.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The debtor may elect to exempt either as the \u201cfederal\u201d exemption the property set out in subsection (d) of Section 522 of the Code, <em>or </em>as the \u201cstate\u201d exemptions the property specified as exempted under the law of his domicile, plus property exempted by \u201cFederal law, other than subsection (d).\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The election choice of federal versus state exemptions is the debtor\u2019s to make.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The choice, obviously, will hinge upon the debtor\u2019s individual assessment of which exemption system would permit him to retain a larger share of his assets. This decision, in turn, will often depend upon the type of property held by the debtor, as state exemptions may vary in kind as well as degree from the federal bankruptcy exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">In the immediate case, debtors selected the state exemption option, which does not provide in terms at least a partial exemption for Keogh plans as does the federal exemption. Under Section 522(d)(10)(E), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(10)(E), a debtor who elects the federal exemption may exempt his \u201cright to receive a payment under a ... pension ... plan ... to the extent reason-' ably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor,\u201d unless the plan demonstrates three disqualifying characteristics.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Goffs\u2019 plans did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>contain the disqualifying characteristics and would have been covered by Section 522(d)(10)(E) to the extent \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for the Goffs\u2019 support.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">2. <em>Section 541(c)(2): Exclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"AU1\">The second relevant code provision, Section 541(c)(2), is the focus of the immediate dispute. The claim of the Goffs is raised solely under this provision. Section 541(c)(1)(A) provides, with one caveat, that \u201cany provision\u201d \u201cthat restricts or conditions transfer\u201d of property by the debtor is ineffective in bankruptcy to keep the property from becoming part of the estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(1)(A). The caveat situation, in which a restriction will keep property free from the estate, is set out in subsection (2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">(2) A restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust that is enforceable <em>under applicable non-bankruptcy law </em>is enforceable in a case under this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(2) (emphasis added). The Goffs claim that their ERISA-qualified<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Keogh plans are excluded from the property of the estate by operation of this provision. The Goffs argue that the restrictions against assignment or alienation in their plans, included pursuant to ERISA, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(a)(13)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are \u201cenforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law\u201d as that latter term was intended. We find, however, that Congress did not evidence an intent, by reference to \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law\u201d to include an ERISA plan exemption. Rather, we find that Congress intended to exclude only trust funds in the nature of \u201cspendthrift trusts\u201d from the property of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">In general terms, a spendthrift trust is a trust created to provide a fund for the maintenance of a beneficiary, with only a certain portion of the total amount to be distributed at any one time. The settlor places \u201cspendthrift\u201d restrictions on the trust, which operate in most states to place the fund beyond the reach of the beneficiary\u2019s creditors, as well as to secure the fund against the beneficiary\u2019s own improvidence. Although a given state\u2019s nonban-kruptcy law of spendthrift trusts might afford protection to a particular pension trust, it is clear in the immediate case that appellant\u2019s self-settled trust did not constitute a spendthrift trust entitled to exclusion under relevant state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Our conclusion is reached through a three step analysis. First, we examine the explicitly narrow legislative intent behind the facially broad reference in Section 541(c)(2) to \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law.\u201d Second, we consider the overall congressional scheme embodied in the Bankruptcy Code; particularly the exemption system election provision, Section 522, which directly addresses the degree to which pensions may therein be exempted and also explicitly references \u201cFederal law\u201d and ERISA. Third, we assess the relationship and effect upon ERISA of the intent of the Bankruptcy Code. The indicia of legislative intent, along with existing case law, lead to the inexorable conclusion that Section 541(c)(2)\u2019s reference to \u201capplicable nonbank-ruptcy law\u201d was an acknowledgement of traditional state spendthrift trust law, and not of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">A. <em>\u201cApplicable Nonbankruptcy Law\u201d: Statutory Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The legislative history of Section 541(c)(2) indicates that Congress had something very specific in mind with its facially broad reference to \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law\u201d as the benchmark for assessing the enforceability of trust restraints on alienation in bankruptcy. In its section-by-section analysis, the House Report accompanying their bill, H.R. 8200, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXX\">Subsection (c) [of Section 541] invalidates restrictions on the transfer of property of the debtor, in order that all of the interests of the debtor in property will become property of the estate.... <em>Paragraph (2) of subsection (c), however, preserves restrictions on transfer of a spendthrift trust to the extent that the restriction is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 369 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5963, 6325 (emphasis added). Even more significant, in providing an overview comparison of the proposed Code to the old Act, the House Report said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An6\">The bill also continues over the exclusion from property of the estate of the debt- or\u2019s interest in a <em>spendthrift trust to the extent the trust is protected from creditors under applicable State law.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> The bankruptcy of the beneficiary should not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>be permitted to defeat the legitimate expectations of the settlor of the trust.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 176, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 6136 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The Senate Report, accompanying S. -2266, similarly explained that Section 541(c)(2) \u201cpreserves restrictions on a transfer of a <em>spendthrift trust . .. </em>enforceable [under] nonbankruptcy law.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 83, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5869 (emphasis added). The Senate version of the Code, however, was dissimilar to that proposed by the House, in that it limited the extent to which Section 541(c)(2) property would be insulated from the estate, to that \u201creasonably necessary for the support of a debtor and his dependents.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This even narrower Senate version was rejected in the final enacted version, which followed the position taken in the House bill.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In summary, from the legislative history of Section 541(e)(2), it is clear that Congress intended by its reference to \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law\u201d to exempt from the estate only those \u201cspendthrift trusts\u201d traditionally beyond the reach of creditors under state law. This provision carries over from the old Act the previously recognized exemption for spendthrift trusts. <em>See, eg., In re Witlin, </em>640 F.2d 661 (5th Cir.1981) (recognition, under the applicable prior Act, that spendthrift trusts were exempt pursuant to state.trust law).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">B. <em>The Overall Scheme and the Federal-State Exemption Election</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAP\">The specific legislative intent behind Section 541(c)(2) is reinforced by a consideration of the overall congressional scheme embodied in the Bankruptcy Code. Appellant debtors argue for an expansive definition of \u201cnonbankruptcy law\u201d in Section 541(c)(2) to include federal laws which prohibit alienation. We find that the other provisions of the Code negate this intent because the Code explicitly makes reference to \u201cfederal law\u201d or pension laws, including ERISA, when federal as opposed to state law is the subject of the reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">The most telling example lies with Section 522 and its legislative history. As summarized above, Section 522 provides debtors a choice between the \u201cstate\u201d or the \u201cfederal\u201d exemption systems. If the \u201cstate\u201d system is selected, a debtor may also exempt property pursuant to \u201cFederal law other than subsection (d).\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Goffs, who made the state election, did not attempt to claim exemption of their ERISA-qualified Keogh plans under this other \u201cFederal law\u201d exemption.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The applicability of this exemption, therefore, is not directly involved in this appeal. Yet we do find a consideration of this provision helpful in understanding this case because we find that Congress did not intend to do ambiguously in Section 541 that which it clearly did not do directly in Section 522, although Section 522 explicitly addresses the extent to which other \u201cFederal law\u201d and retirement benefit exemptions would be recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The House and Senate Reports, in explanation of the other \u201cFederal law\u201d provision which was subsequently enacted in Code \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A), provide a list of illustrative property which might be exempted under federal laws other than the Bankruptcy Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">Foreign Service Retirement and Disability payments, 22 U.S.C. 1104;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">Social security payments, 42 U.S.C. 407; Injury or death compensation payments from war risk hazards, 42 U.S.C. 1717; Wages of fishermen, seamen, and apprentices, 46 U.S.C. 601;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">Civil service retirement benefits, 5 U.S.C. 729, 2265;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act death and disability benefits, 33 U.S.C. 916;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">Railroad Retirement Act annuities and pensions, 45 U.S.C. 228(L);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">Veterans benefits, 45 U.S.C. 352(E); Special pensions paid to winners of the Congressional Medal of Honor, 38 U.S.C. 3101; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">Federal homestead lands on debts contracted before issuance of the patent, 43 U.S.C. 175.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">S.Rep.

The reports provide no further insight into which other, if any, federal laws were intended to be brought within this provision\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">The restrictive nature of the exemption listed is marked. Yet two recent cases have been decided in bankruptcy courts which reach diametrically opposite interpretations of the scope of this provision relative to ERISA-qualified pension plans. <em>Compare In re Graham, </em>24 B.R. 305 (Bkrtcy.N.D. Iowa 1982) (not exempt under \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A)) <em>with In re Hinshaw, </em>23 B.R. 233 (Bkrtcy.D.Kan.1982) (exempt under \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A)). In both cases, the bankruptcy courts were presented with ERISA-qualified retirement trusts, which contained provisions prohibiting assignment or alienation as required for qualification under the Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(a)(13);<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Similarly, in both cases, debtors selected the state exemption option, and then argued that the other \u201cFederal law\u201d exemption under the state election included ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">In <em>Graham, </em>the court considered the listing of statutes in the legislative history, and concluded that Congress did not intend to include ERISA within the statutory exemption. First, the court reasoned, \u201c[e]ven though ERISA was in effect at the time the Bankruptcy Code was debated and passed, ERISA is notably absent from the listing of other federal exemptions.\u201d 24 B.R. at 311-12. Second, the court compared the federal laws listed in the legislative history with the ERISA provisions at issue and found them to be significantly distinguishable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akx\">Congress, in providing for exemptions from creditors\u2019 processes [in the listed federal laws], has been very explicit. The exemption for Civil Service Retirement benefits is illustrative:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-16\">The money mentioned by this subchap-ter is not assignable, either in law or equity ... or subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, except as otherwise may be provided by Federal laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8346 (moved from 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2265). In this provision Congress directly exempted the Civil Service Benefits from creditors. In contrast, ERISA only requires that the plan contain a restriction on alienation and assignment in order to qualify for ERISA tax benefits. That requirement is not an exemption from creditors\u2019 process provided by federal law. If Congress had intended that ERISA would provide such an exemption, a provision similar to the provision quoted above could have been enacted. The fact that they did not do so leads this Court to conclude that an ERISA fund is not with-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>in the exemption from the bankruptcy estate provided by other federal law under \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A). <em>See In re Watson, </em>13 B.R. 391 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Fla.1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">By contrast, the court in <em>Hinshaw, </em>after examining the same congressional list of representative federal laws, concluded that ERISA-qualified plans were covered by the exemption. While the <em>Hinshaw </em>court similarly undertook an analysis of the statutory provisions cited by Congress, it reached a different conclusion and relied upon different statutes than did the <em>Graham </em>court. The <em>Hinshaw </em>court began its analysis by reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">Many of the statutes that have been recognized as giving rise to a federal exemption of the type here being considered may be characterized as nothing more than prohibitions against assignment or alienation. For example, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">None of the moneys mentioned in this title (citations omitted) shall be assignable either in law or equity, or be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The parallel provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">The rights of any person to any future payment under this title shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this title shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">Although ERISA plan funds are not specifically mentioned in the House Report, the similarity between the provisions of those statutes that are recognized as constituting a federal exemption and the provisions of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(a)(13) (and the accompanying Treasury Regulation) supports a conclusion that a federal exemption for ERI-SA plans was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">23 B.R. at 235.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Further, it found the analysis of the court in <em>Commercial Mortgage Insurance Inc. v. Citizens National Bank of Dallas, </em>526 F.Supp. 510 (N.D.Tex. 1981) persuasive.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> While the issue in that case was whether ERISA precluded non-bankruptcy garnishment of pension benefits, the <em>Hinshaw </em>court found the reasoning applicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-14\">In <em>Commercial Mortgage, </em>the court noted the legislative intent [of ERISA] is to ensure that benefits are available for retirement purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 518. To allow a creditor to garnish these plans would undermine the protection that Congress intended to give to the plan beneficiaries. A similar analysis of the intended effect of the federal exemption in bankruptcy results in the conclusion reached here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">23 B.R. at 236. Thus the court in <em>Hinshaw </em>concluded that tax-qualified ERISA plans were exempt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-16\">A careful evaluation of this issue leads us to the result reached by the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>court in <em>Graham. </em>We find that Congress did not intend to include ERISA-qualified plans among those \u201cexempt under Federal law,\u201d pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The failure of Congress to include ERISA in its listing of illustrative federal statutes is highly probative of congressional intent that ERISA was not within the group of \u201cfederal law\u201d based exemptions. ERISA, a comprehensive and much-debated statute with sweeping coverage was enacted in 1974; the House and Senate reports on the subsequently enacted Bankruptcy Code Section 522(b)(2)(A) were issued in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Congress knew of the previously-enacted ERISA when drafting Section 522(b)(2)(A), yet neither the House nor the Senate deemed fit to include it within their respective illustrative lists. Congress did refer to ERISA where it wanted to do so in other provisions of the Code. Of similar relevance is the specific reference in another subsection of Section 522 itself to the very ERISA provision relied upon by appellants as constituting a \u201cFederal law\u201d exemption. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(10)(E)(iii) (reference to pension benefit exemption when the federal exemptions are elected by the debtor). <em>See also </em>H.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 455 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 5963, 6411.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Certainly, therefore, Congress did not \u201coverlook\u201d ERISA. Given the extensive and general reach of ERISA-qualified plans, it is highly improbable that Congress intended their inclusion without mention in the Section 522(b)(2)(A) exemption in the midst of a listing of significantly less comprehensive and less well known statutes. The often-stated admonition that it may be treacherous to attach great weight to congressional silence in interpreting its laws does not apply in this case in light of the comprehensive consideration of this issue which is revealed by this history.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Further, we stress that ERISA\u2019s anti-assignment and alienation provisions are different in kind from those contained in the statutes listed in the Code\u2019s legislative history. We do not see across-the-board differences in the explicitness of the restraints against alienation in the listed statutes and in ERISA.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> But we do find that the contingent nature of ERISA\u2019s restraints on alienation differs markedly from the absolute prohibitions contained in the listed statutes. ERISA merely provides that <em>as a condition of obtaining qualified status </em>\u2014with its attendant tax and other benefits \u2014 a pension plan must preclude alienation or assignment of its benefits. It does not prohibit pension funds from permitting alienation or assignment; rather, while it encourages and favors qualified plans, it envisions that \u201cdisqualified\u201d plans may be formed which are still subject to ERISA\u2019s regulatory scheme but which do not restrict alienation or assignment. By contrast, the listed statutes which establish or guarantee certain benefits <em>directly preclude all </em>such benefits from alienation or assignment.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">As additional reenforcement of our view of the Section 522 exemptions, we find that \u201cproperty\u201d covered by ERISA differs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>nature from that covered under the enumerated statutes. While it is true that ERISA and the cited statutes share the common denominator of \u201cpension and welfare\u201d benefits, the <em>private pension and welfare benefits sweepingly regulated </em>by ERISA<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> differ considerably from the <em>public funded and/or created pension and welfare </em>systems,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> or the <em>few exceptional, traditionally guarded </em>industries<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> covered by the illustrative listings. We believe that these latter, narrow characteristics of the cited statutes, rather than the broad, common trait of private pension and welfare legislation, was intended as the operative thread by which other federal statutes \u2014 overlooked or yet to be enacted \u2014 might be included. Thus, we conclude that Congress did not intend to include ERISA-qualified plans within the other \u201cFederal law\u201d exemption of the Section 522 election provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">C. <em>\u201cApplicable Nonbankruptcy law\u201d under Section 541 and ERISA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Flowing out of this discussion is clear indication of a congressional intent that Section 541(c)(2) \u2014 the exemption relied upon by the Goffs\u2019 on appeal \u2014 was never intended to include ERISA in its reference to \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law.\u201d Congress made reference to federal law and pension benefits when such a characterization was intended; yet it did not do so in Section 541(c)(2). As we have pointed out above, Congress while well aware of ERI-SA, specifically considered the role of pension benefits in bankruptcy proceedings in Section 522, and did not grant a broad exemption. The only reasonable inference to draw is that Congress intended that pensions provided for by federal law be insulated from bankruptcy only to the extent recognized in Section 522. While pensions might be excludable from the property of the estate pursuant to Section 541(c)(2), the state law exemption, their exclusion under that section is provided solely by state spendthrift trust law and not by the operation of ERISA.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">It is well to make a final telling observation on the relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ERISA and the Bankruptcy Code. While ERISA preempts state law, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), it clearly was not intended to affect the operation of other federal law. It provides: \u201cNothing in this [Act] shall be construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States [except pre-existing federal pension law] or any rule or regulation issued under such law.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(d). As we have already discussed, the Bankruptcy Code was, generally, intended to broaden the \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d available to creditors in bankruptcy and, specifically, intended to limit any exemption of pension funds. These policy-based provisions of the Code would be frustrated were ERISA\u2019s anti-alienation and assignment provisions applied with a sweeping brush. Thus, ERISA\u2019s specific provision precluding interference with the operation of federal law renders the Bankruptcy Code effective over any ERISA provisions to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Having reached this conclusion we must nevertheless stop short of an arbitrary interpretation urged by the .trustee in bankruptcy. The trustee argues that the inclusion in Section 522(d) of a pension benefit exemption, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(10)(E), for those making a federal election, negatives any congressional intent to include any ER-ISA pensions at all within the ambit of Section 541. The trustee reasons that the Section 522(d)(10)(E) exemption would be surplusage if Section 541 had the effect of keeping all possible ERISA-qualified plans from ever entering the estate.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> While, as set out above, we find the wording and breadth of Section 522 enlightening of congressional intent for other reasons, we cannot agree with appellees\u2019 proffered construction. Section 522(d)(10)(E) reaches a broad array of employment benefits,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and exempts both qualified and unqualified pension plans, to the extent such benefits are reasonably necessary for the support of debtor and his dependents. Given this much broader exemption of benefits available only to those making a federal election, we find no reason to doubt that ERISA-qualified pension funds are included in Section 541 if they qualify as spendthrift trust plans under state law. <em>Cf. In re Threewitt, </em>24 B.R. 927, 930 &amp; n. 4 (D.Kan.1982) (reasoning that Section 522(d)(10)(E) is broader than Section 541, and that it is not \u201cremarkable that Congress did not bother to further complicate an already complex code by taking pains to insure that there was no overlap\u201d between sections). We thus conclude that Section 522(d)(10)(E) does not preclude consideration of qualified pension plans under the Section 541 exclusion provision so long as they qualify as a \u201cspendthrift trust\u201d under the applicable state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">We have now concluded that Section 541(c)(2) was intended to exempt only \u201cspendthrift trust\u201d assets from the bankruptcy estate. We now consider whether the Goffs\u2019 Keogh plans can fall within the spendthrift trust definition. The general rule is well established that if a settlor creates a trust for his own benefit and inserts a \u201cspendthrift\u201d clause, restraining alienation or assignment, it is void as far as creditors are concerned and they can reach the settlor\u2019s interest in the trust. <em>In re Witlin, </em>640 F.2d 661, 663 (5th Cir.1981) (see also the cases and treatises cited therein). This general proposition is the law in Texas, which in this case provides the \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Bank of Dallas v. Republic National Bank of Dallas, </em>540 S.W.2d 499 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Waco 1976, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.); <em>Glass v. Carpenter, </em>330 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>S.W.2d 530 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 San Antonio 1959, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.); <em>Long v. Long, </em>252 S.W.2d 235 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Texarkana 1952 writ ref d n.r.e.). <em>See also In re Howerton, </em>21 B.R. 621, 622 n. 1, <em>supplemented, </em>23 B.R. 58 (Bkrtcy.N.D.Tex.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Our reasoning in the <em>Witlin </em>case is persuasive. There we held that self-settled Keogh plans were not exempt under the spendthrift trust provision of the old Bankruptcy Act. We said: \u201cThere is ... a strong policy that will prevent any person from placing his property in what amounts to a revocable trust for his own benefit which would be exempt from the claims of his creditors.\u201d 640 F.2d at 662. <em>See Glass v. Carpenter, </em>330 S.W.2d 530, 534 (Tex.Civ. App. \u2014 San Antonio 1959, writ ref d n.r.e.). Here, as in <em>Witlin, </em>appellant-debtors attempted such a revokable trust for their own benefit. They retained the freedom to withdraw their Keogh plan assets, yet purported to insulate those assets from their creditors.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> If this dichotomous treatment were to be recognized, the strong common law policy of spendthrift trusts, as well as the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s intent, would be subverted. Debtors could shelter funds in Keogh plans immediately before declaring bankruptcy \u2014 as did the Goffs with at least some of their funds \u2014 and immediately after discharge of all debts withdraw such funds for their own benefit.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Whatever might be the rule in a nonbankruptcy setting involving ERISA\u2019s provisions<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> we hold that neither law nor equity would afford self-settled Keogh plans \u201cspendthrift trust\u201d exemption in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Finally, appellants argue that reliance upon traditional spendthrift trust law results in disparate treatment of self-employed and employer-created pension trusts which, in turn, offends both law and reason. Appellants contend that since ERISA requires that all qualified plans include restraints on alienation, and its provisions extend equally to guarantee all workers the benefits of their contributions in retirement years, distinctions in bankruptcy exemption status according to employment status would conflict with ERISA\u2019s statutory intention to treat all retirement plans the same way. Further, the Goffs argue, since employees may quit their employment post-bankruptcy and thus be entitled to withdraw their pension contributions under ER-ISA, any bankruptcy distinction made on the basis of the revokable, self-settled nature of self-employed pension plans is arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>We are not persuaded by appellants\u2019 arguments. In analyzing the effectiveness in bankruptcy of spendthrift provisions in pension plans, the courts have generally concluded that those contained in employer-created plans were effective<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> similar provisions in self-settled plans were not.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The latter conclusion is inescapable since, as discussed earlier, the traditional law of spendthrift trusts has rejected the notion of effective spendthrift provisions in self-settled trusts. As to the former, without passing upon the exact limits of plans which could properly be characterized \u201cspendthrift trusts,\u201d the employer-created-and-controlled nature of those plans may well make them analogous to a spendthrift trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We find that this difference is contrary to neither law nor logic. First, whether or not <em>ERISA </em>bestows equal treatment upon both types of plans is not at issue. As discussed previously, ERISA was not intended to affect the operation of other federal laws including federal bankruptcy laws. If a distinction is created by operation of bankruptcy law, which might conflict with ERISA, bankruptcy law prevails. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the court-drawn distinction conflicts with federal pension law, it is nonetheless enforceable if valid under federal bankruptcy law.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Second, we disagree with appellants\u2019 characterization that the degree of beneficiary control over both types of pension plans is indistinguishable, thus rendering their separate treatment unreasonable. Under appellants\u2019 self-employed Keogh plans considerable control, including withdrawal authority, was retained. The only limitation upon withdrawal was a ten percent tax penalty. We find this to be significantly different from the usual case of employer-created funds in which the beneficiary employee has little or no control during the term of his employment, and may only withdraw funds upon termination of employment. He must quit his job in order to gain premature access to his retirement funds. We cannot equate a \u201ctax penalty\u201d with \u201cemployment termination\u201d as equal restraints upon withdrawal of pension funds.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We thus find the court-drawn distinction a reasonable one, and appropriately made under the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">\n<em>In Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">After considering the legislative history of Section 541(c)(2) specifically, and of the Bankruptcy Code generally, as well as the statutory framework within which Section 541(c)(2) appears, it is apparent that Congress did not intend by reference to \u201capplicable nonbankruptey law\u201d to exempt ERI-SA-qualified pension plans from the bankruptcy estate by virtue of ERISA\u2019s provisions precluding assignment or alienation. Rather, it is clear that Congress intended a limited exemption for \u201cspendthrift trusts,\u201d as defined by reference to state law. Since we find that the self-settled Keogh plans at issue do not qualify as \u201cspendthrift trusts\u201d under state law, we affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s inclusion of the pension trusts in the bankrupts\u2019 estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-14\">.

Texas, the state of debtors\u2019 domicile, has not enacted such legislation. See <em>In re Cannady, </em>653 F.2d 210, 214 (5th Cir.1981). Second, the Bankruptcy Code envisions the possibility that a bankrupt, having made an improvident election, may petition to obtain relief, or have his election choice changed for him by the courts on their own motion, in the interest of justice. <em>See, e.g., </em>H.Rep.

The referenced passage is illuminating and reinforces the already-apparent House intent that \u00a7 541(c)(2) be directed narrowly towards traditional \u201cspendthrift\u201d trusts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aey-dedup-0\">5. Spendthrift Trusts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK8\">Under the existing Act, the trustee does not succeed to beneficial interests subject to spendthrift restraints. This is so since the present Act requires that the interests be alienable or amenable to creditors\u2019 process under local law and, by definition, such interests are not. There is no sound justification for permitting 6 debtor to take advantage of the Bankrupt Act and, at the same time, to shield from his creditors assets because local law does not allow creditors to reach his interest. The Commission generally recommends that these restraints not be enforceable. However, in recognition of the possibility that the spendthrift trust may be used to protect one incapable of providing for his own welfare, the debtor should be allowed to retain sufficient income to support himself and his dependents. But to the extent the beneficial interest is of a value in excess of the reasonable support needs of the debtor and his dependents, the interest should be available to the debtor\u2019s creditors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-14\">(footnotes omitted). As discussed <em>infra, </em>the Commission\u2019s reoommended limitation on the spendthrift trust exemption, to the extent of \u201creasonable support,\u201d was incorporated in the rejected Senate version but excluded in the House version which was adopted in the enacted Code. <em>See </em>124 Cong.Rec.

The Treasury Regulation referenced in the above-quoted passage, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.401(a)-13(b)(1) (1982), interprets \u00a7 401(a)(13) and provides a more expansive definition of the Revenue Code\u2019s prohibition against assignment or alienation than does the bare-bones language of the Code. The interpretative regulation provides that, in order for a plan to obtain tax-qualified status, it must provide that benefits may not be \u201canticipated, assigned (either at law or in equity), alienated or subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.401(a) \u2014 13(b)(1) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b676-17\">. <em>Commercial Mortgage, </em>which is also relied upon by appellant-debtors, involved a medical doctor-debtor beneficiary who participated in both a profit-sharing and a pension plan through his professional association.

The question addressed in <em>Commercial Mortgage </em>\u2014 of ERISA\u2019s preclusion of state creditors\u2019 from attaching pension funds \u2014 is inapposite. <em>But cf.
