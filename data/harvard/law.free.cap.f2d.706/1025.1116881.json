The complaint alleges violations of anti-rebating provisions of section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act (FAA), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381. We have jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486(a) (1976) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">Section 411 authorizes the CAB to investigate third-party allegations of \u201cunfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition\u201d in the air transportation industry \u201cif it considers that such action by it would be in the interest of the public.\u201d Thus, \u201cthe Board\u2019s jurisdiction to initiate an investigation under \u00a7 411 is expressly premised on a finding that the \u2018public interest\u2019 is involved.\u201d <em>Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 290, 302, 96 S.Ct. 1978, 1986, 48 L.Ed.2d 643 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-10\">Here, however, the CAB determined that an investigation of the allegations in Costantini\u2019s complaint would not be in the public interest. We do not conduct an independent investigation to see whether the CAB\u2019s determination was correct; we ask only whether \u201cthe Board has stayed within its jurisdiction and applied criteria appropriate to that determination.\u201d <em>American Airlines, Inc. v. North American Airlines, Inc., </em>351 U.S. 79, 85, 76 S.Ct. 600, 605, 100 L.Ed. 953 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-12\">The criteria on which the CAB based its determination here include: (1) the complaint was so lacking in specificity that no prima facie case was established; (2) the CAB has already conducted extensive investigations into rebating in the past; (3) the CAB\u2019s ongoing review of the entire market structure of air transportation already provides a sufficient degree of investigation; (4) the rebate practice complained of would not hurt the general public (as opposed to certain travel agents like Costantini) even if it did occur; (5) the previously regulated practice complained of is now undergoing deregulation; and (6) the scarce investigatory funds of the CAB are better spent elsewhere. These criteria are entirely appropriate. The CAB did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Costantini\u2019s complaint without a hearing. <em>See DHL Corp. v. CAB, </em>659 F.2d 941, 945 (9th Cir.1981); <em>REA Express Inc., </em>v. <em>CAB, </em>507 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-13\">This appeal is frivolous. The allegations in the complaint have been made by Costantini and disposed of in prior proceedings. Most recently before our court, we affirmed the CAB\u2019s dismissal of several of Costantini\u2019s complaints under remarkably similar circumstances of generalized allegations and repetitive charges. <em>Costantini v. CAB, </em>679 F.2d 896 (9th Cir.1982). Even a cursory reading of our disposition of that appeal would have indicated that the outcome of this appeal was certain and the appeal therefore frivolous. As the CAB has patiently explained to Costantini on four previous occasions, Costantini\u2019s complaints suggest essentially a private dispute with the airline industry and should be pursued, if at all, in forums other than the CAB. At some point, the free use of process becomes an abuse, for misuse diminishes our capacity to aid those who deserve access to our process. Costantini has crossed that line. We therefore assess Costantini attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>fees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and double costs on this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">The order of the Civil Aeronautics Board is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1119-15\">. The Board shall submit a record of its counsel\u2019s time expended on this appeal along with its cost bill. The amount of attorney\u2019s fees will be set by supplemental order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
