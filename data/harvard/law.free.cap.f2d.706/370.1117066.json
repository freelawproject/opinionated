Both appellants were found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and were sentenced to ten years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Appellants contend that the District Court erred in denying their motion to dismiss their indictment, and raise several questions on this appeal. They allege that the government violated their fifth amendment right to due process, and that there was prosecutorial misconduct in the grand jury proceeding. Appellant Glorioso also contends that certain evidence presented to th\u00e9 grand jury was obtained in violation of international law, Italian Law, and United States-Italian treaty obligations. Since we find all contentions of appellants meritless, we affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Nazir Nohra, an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration who previously had heroin transactions with appellant Glorioso, telephoned Glorioso in Palermo, Italy, concerning a possible sale of heroin. Nohra made the calls from New York and permitted the government to tape them there. During the second telephone call, Glorioso introduced appellant Romano to Nohra as someone interested in purchasing the \u201cmerchandise\u201d that Nohra had for sale. After a series of similar telephone calls, which dealt with the details of the proposed \u2022transaction pertaining to quality of the \u201cmerchandise,\u201d price and terms of payment, both Glorioso and Romano travelled to New York. At various times and places in New York they negotiated in person with Nohra and Anthony Wilson, a government undercover agent who posed as Nohra\u2019s American partner, for the purchase of kilogram quantities of heroin. After appellant Romano had taken samples of the government-supplied heroin, and left partial payment with Wilson and Nohra, appellants were arrested and charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The first allegation, that the government failed to afford appellants their due process rights, is without merit. In view of the overwhelming evidence of their predisposition to commit the crime charged, appellants do not here contend that they were entrapped by the government. Indeed, appellants do not attack the sufficiency of the evidence against them. Although Romano argued that there was no valid evidence of his predisposition presented to the grand jury, he does not make that claim as to the proceedings before the petit jury. They acknowledge that the defense of entrapment is unavailable \u201cwhere the predisposition of the defendant[s] to commit the crime was established.\u201d <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 484, 488-489, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 1649, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (1976). Nevertheless, they maintain that the government\u2019s conduct in \u201cinciting\u201d them to come to New York, and in providing the heroin for the proposed sale, was conduct \u201cso repugnant and excessive\u201d as to shock the conscience and deny them due process of law. <em>United States v. Alexandro, </em>675 F.2d 34, 39 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The government\u2019s conduct in this case falls far short of the \u201cdemonstrable level of outrageousness\u201d necessary to bar a conviction. <em>Hampton, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 495 N. 7, 96 S.Ct. at 1653 N. 7 (Powell, J., concurring). The fact that the drug transaction was initiated by the informant Nohra, and that the government supplied the drugs, is not \u201cthe kind of outrageous conduct which would violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Nunez-Rios, </em>622 F.2d 1093, 1097 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Hampton, supra. </em>The appellants were not \u201cincited\u201d to come to the United States. They came voluntarily, in order to complete in person a transaction which had been partially negotiated and arranged by their telephone conversations with Nohra. Furthermore, there is \u201cnot a scintilla of evidence\u201d which suggests any coercion. <em>Alexandro, supra, </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Surely, nothing in this case evokes the outrage of <em>United States v. Toscanino, </em>500 F.2d 267 (2d Cir.1974) in which the defendant, an Italian citizen, alleged that he had been kidnapped by American agents in Uruguay, brought to Brazil where he was tortured and drugged, and abducted from Brazil into the United States for the purpose of facing criminal charges here. In <em>Toscanino, </em>the allegations were so shocking to one\u2019s sense of justice that this court held that the defendant was entitled to a hearing on his allegations. Relying principally on the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>cisions of the Supreme Court in <em>Ker v. Illinois, </em>119 U.S. 436, 7 S.Ct. 225, 30 L.Ed. 421 (1886) and <em>Frisbie v. Collins, </em>342 U.S. 519, 72 S.Ct. 509, 96 L.Ed. 541 (1952), the district court had denied a motion to vacate the verdict and dismiss the indictment. Under the \u201cKer-Frisbie\u201d rule which developed from those landmark cases, \u201cdue process was limited to the guarantee of a constitutionally fair trial, regardless of the. method by which jurisdiction was obtained.\u201d <em>Toscanino, </em>500 F.2d at 272. This court concluded that the \u201cKer-Frisbie\u201d rule had been eroded, and had to yield to more recent decisions of the Supreme Court which reflected an expansion of the concept of due process. Hence, based upon more recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court which gave renewed vitality to the concept of due process, and \u201cour supervisory power over the administration of criminal justice in the district courts within our jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Toscanino </em>held that if the defendant\u2019s allegations of government misconduct and kidnapping were true, he was entitled to relief. 500 F.2d at 275-276.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Many cases have dealt with \u201cthe doctrine that criminal jurisdiction is not impaired by the illegality of the method by which the court acquires <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction .... \u201d Bassiouni,. <em>International Extradition in U.S. Law and Practice, </em>Chapter V, \u00a7 4-1, 283 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The alleged government misconduct or lawlessness in <em>Toscanino </em>was so outrageous that, if the allegations were true, the conduct violated due process and the district court would be required to divest itself of jurisdiction over the defendant. Since none of the flagrant and illegal law enforcement practices which were alleged in <em>Toscanino </em>exist here, the appellants cannot benefit from the holding and reasoning of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The reach and applicability of <em>Toscanino </em>is clearly illustrated by <em>United States v. Gengler, </em>510 F.2d 62 (2d Cir.1975). In <em>Gen-gler, </em>this court held that the allegation of abduction, even if true, was insufficient to preclude the court below from asserting jurisdiction. In discussing <em>Toscanino, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">Yet in recognizing that <em>Ker </em>and <em>Frisbie. </em>no longer provided a carte blanche to government agents bringing defendants from abroad to the United States by the use of torture, brutality and similar outrageous conduct, we did not intend to suggest that <em>any </em>irregularity in the circumstances of a defendant\u2019s arrival in the jurisdiction would vitiate the proceedings of the criminal court. 510 F.2d at 65 (emphasis in the original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">No allegation has been made in this case which can in any way compare to the alleged government misconduct of abduction which was deemed to be insufficient in <em>Gengler. </em>Appellants\u2019 references, therefore, to cases of \u201cpolice brutality and lawlessness\u201d are inapplicable and unavailing. <em>United States v. Toscanino, </em>500 F.2d at 272. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Cordero et al., </em>668 F.2d 32, 36-37 (1st Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Lira, </em>515 F.2d 68, 70-71 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 847, 96 S.Ct. 87, 46 L.Ed.2d 69 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>United States v. Twigg, </em>588 F.2d 373 (3d Cir.1978) and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>486 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 1973) is misplaced. Both cases are clearly distinguishable. In <em>Twigg, </em>the defendants were incapable of committing the crime charged, the operation of a \u201cspeed factory,\u201d without the active intervention and supervision of the government informant. The defendants in <em>Twigg </em>were not chemists and lacked the necessary knowledge and ability to build or operate such a factory. Appellants Romano and Glorioso, however, were clearly capable of conspiring to purchase and distribute heroin without the active aid and supervision of the government. In <em>Archer, </em>the government attempted to convert a state offense of bribery into a federal crime by discussing the bribe in an interstate telephone call initiated by an informant for the sole purpose of establishing the interstate activity necessary for a violation of the federal \u201cTravel Act.\u201d The effort to manufacture jurisdiction in <em>Archer </em>is vastly different from an offer to sell heroin which resulted in appellants\u2019 volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tary travel to the United States to consummate the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Appellants\u2019 second allegation of prosecu-torial misconduct before the grand jury is likewise without merit, and clearly does not warrant or justify a dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">This court has termed a dismissal of the indictment \u201cthe most drastic remedy,\u201d and is most difficult to justify in cases involving allegations of failure to make known or properly instruct the grand jury on a potential defense. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>602 F.2d 1073 at 1076 (2d Cir.1979), citing <em>United States v. Fields, </em>592 F.2d 638 (2d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 917, 99 S.Ct. 2838, 61 L.Ed.2d 284 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The basis for appellants\u2019 contention is that the prosecutor failed adequately to inform the grand jury on the legal ramifications of the defense of entrapment. In order to justify dismissing an indictment for prosecutorial misconduct, the prosecutor must have knowingly withheld \u201csubstantial evidence negating guilt ... where it might reasonably be expected to lead the jury not to indict.\u201d <em>United States v. Ciambrone, </em>601 F.2d 616, 623 (2d Cir.1979). A dismissal is warranted only in extreme circumstances, when it is necessary to eliminate prejudice to the defendants, or to ensure that the government attorney acts in accordance with the law. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>602 F.2d at 1073, 1077 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 952, 100 S.Ct. 427, 62 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979). It is significant,., however, that appellants do not contend that a full presentation of their entrapment defense would have caused the grand jury not to indict. Indeed, the trial judge has labeled that defense \u201cfrivolous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">It is fundamental that \u201c \u2018[a] grand jury proceeding is not an adversary hearing in which the guilt or innocence of the accused is adjudicated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ciambrone, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 622 (quoting <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343, 94 S.Ct. 613, 617, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974)). Furthermore, an indictment is not evidence of guilt, but only a finding of probable cause that a crime has been committed, and that the accused is reasonably believed to have committed it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Although entrapment may be a defense in a criminal trial, the prosecutor is not obligated to present all possible defenses before a grand jury. Nevertheless, an examination of the record reveals that the prosecutor did respond to the grand jurors\u2019 questioning about the entrapment defense, and gave a clear example of what constitutes the predisposition necessary to overcome it. The record also reveals that Wilson, the government\u2019s agent, testified before the grand jury that Romano stated that he made six or seven trips a year between New'York and Palermo to arrange heroin transactions. From the evidence presented and the prosecutor\u2019s responses to the inquiries of the grand jurors, it is clear that the prosecutor\u2019s actions in this case \u201cfall far short of [the] misleading conduct or deception that would call for dismissal of the indictment .... \u201d <em>Ciambrone, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Even if it were to be assumed that there was some impropriety, dismissal of the indictment is not warranted. In view of the defendants\u2019 conviction by the petit jury after a full adversarial hearing on appellants\u2019 entrapment defense, it is extremely unlikely that the grand jury would have failed to indict, even if it had been presented with all the evidence produced at trial. Since the petit jury must have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that appellants were predisposed to commit the crime and were therefore not entrapped; clearly the grand jury would also have rejected the defense in making the lesser finding of probable cause. Hence, there is no merit to appellants\u2019 allegation of prosecutorial misconduct. See <em>Ciambrone, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Finally, appellant Glorioso contends that the recording of the telephone conver-' sations' between appellants and Nohra violated international law, Italian law, and the Treaty of Friendship Commerce and Navigation, United States-Italy, 1948, 63 Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>2255, TIAS 1965. These contentions \u25a0 are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">It must be stated at the outset that in this case no peace officer or agent of the United States ever-entered Italian territory. Therefore, there was no violation of territorial sovereignty or offense to any State. Moreover, it is not suggested that Italy has asserted any violation of its rights of sovereignty. See discussion in <em>Gengler, </em>510 F.2d at 66-68, and materials on State Responsibility in Bassiouni, <em>International Extradition in U.S. Law and Practice, </em>Chapter V, \u00a7 5-2, 302 <em>et seq. </em>(1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Appellants may not claim that any norm or principle of international law is violated by a criminal trial, conducted in meticulous compliance with the law of the land, of a defendant, the citizen of another country, who commits a crime in the territory of the prosecuting state. At the trial, all of appellants\u2019 defenses here asserted were heard and considered. Surely, this is riot a case in which an alien, a defendant in a criminal trial, may assert a claim for a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d even in its broadest sense. See Henkin, Pugh, Schacter, Smit, <em>Internationa] Law </em>742-743 (1980); <em>Restatement (second), Foreign Relations Law of the United States </em>\u00a7 165, Comment (c) (1965); <em>Restatement, Foreign Relations Law of the United States (Revised) </em>\u00a7 711, Comments (a) and (b) (Tentative Draft No. 3) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In international law an alien may assert a denial of justice only upon a demonstration of grave or serious defects, such as a refusal to grant rights reasonably to be expected by an accused in a criminal trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Professor J.L. Brierly, in <em>The Law of Nations </em>286 (6th ed. 1963), states that, in a proper sense, \u201cdenial of justice is an injury involving the responsibility of the state committed by a court of justice.\u201d After citing examples \u201csuch as execution without trial ...\u201d he adds that even on a \u201cwider interpretation\u201d of the concept, \u201cthe misconduct must be extremely gross.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">No one who would read the record on this appeal could conclude that there has been such a manifest injustice as would violate any international standard of justice. In the present case, the court has concluded that the appellants were granted all of the constitutional protections, guarantees and procedural safeguards enjoyed by American citizens. Unless substantial justice has been denied, one scholar has written that \u201cit cannot be said that deviations even from municipal, law rules of evidence are deviations from the international standard.\u201d D.P. O\u2019Connell, <em>International Law </em>948 (2d ed. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">In the absence of a denial of justice, as that concept is understood in public international law, no principle of international law is violated by a state which prosecutes and punishes an alien for a crime committed in its own territory. The power of the state to punish crime is itself a fundamental principle of international law. See <em>Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co. of New Orleans, </em>127 U.S. 265, 289-90, 8 S.Ct. 1370, 1373-74, 32 L.Ed. 239 (1888); 6 M. Whiteman, <em>Digest of International Law </em>88-95, 99-100 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">The appellants voluntarily entered the United States and committed a crime within its territory. The operative facts which constituted the crime charged, and of which the appellants were found guilty, took place in the United States. Since the corpus delicti was in the United States, and the appellants were granted a fair trial in accordance with applicable principles of constitutional and procedural law, a claim that the conviction and sentence that followed violated international law is without substance or merit. '</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">Certain provisions of the Italian Code also have been cited for the contention that there has been a violation of Italian law. The Italian Penal Code provides that it is a crime for any person to \u201cgain knowledge by fraudulent means of a telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>conversation or telegraphic message between other persons, or of a communication not addressed to him.\u201d Italian Penal Code Art. 617. Article 617 <em>bis </em>prohibits the unauthorized installation of equipment for the purpose of intercepting telephonic communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In this case the equipment to intercept and record the telephonic communication was installed in New York, and not in Italian territory. Moreover, it is a basic principle of Italian law that the penal laws of Italy have no extraterritorial application except under certain well-defined exceptions. See Articles 6, 7 and 10 of the Italian Penal Code. See also A. Pagliaro, <em>Principi Di Diritto Penale </em>(Parte Generale) 140 <em>et seq. </em>(2d ed. 1980). Appellants, furthermore, may not urge the application of the Italian criminal laws in the courts of the United States. In the words of Chief Justice Marshall in <em>The Antelope, </em>23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 66, 123, 6 L.Ed. 268 (1825), \u201c[t]he courts of no country execute the penal laws of another ....\u201d See <em>Huntington v. Attrill, </em>146 U.S. 657, 666, 13 S.Ct. 224, 227, 36 L.Ed. 1123 (1892); <em>Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co. of New Orleans, </em>127 U.S. 265, 290, 8 S.Ct. 1370, 1374, 32 L.Ed. 239 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Since the recording of appellants\u2019 conversations with Nohra took place within the United States, questions of illegality under Italian law are immaterial. \u201c[I]t is not the route followed by foreign communications which determines the [applicable law]; it is where the interception took place.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotroni, </em>527 F.2d 708, 711 (2d Cir.1975). The interception here complained of took place in the United States, and, therefore, it is the law of the United States concerning the legality of wiretaps which is controlling. It cannot be contested that the taping, done with the consent of one of the parties, Nohra, was lawful, and consequently admissible as evidence in a criminal trial under United States law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c) &amp; (d); <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>574 F.2d 1373, 1377 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>579 F.2d 644, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 988, 99 S.Ct. 584, 58 L.Ed.2d 661 (1978); <em>United States v. Wright, </em>573 F.2d 681, 684 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 949, 98 S.Ct. 2857, 56 L.Ed.2d 792 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>526 F.Supp. 1198, 1201 (D.C.Hawaii 1981). See also <em>United States v. White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 749, 91 S.Ct. 1122, 1124, 28 L.Ed.2d 453 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Italian law reveals that the offense for which they have been charged and found guilty also violates strong Italian public policy. Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertions, specific provisions of Italian law permit public officials in the investigation of drug trafficking to intercept telephone conversations upon authorization by a court or public prosecutor. Code of Penal Procedure Article 226 <em>bis </em>(2). In addition to a respect for rights of privacy (see Italian Constitution, Article 15), Italy shares with the United States a deep aversion to drug trafficking. See, e.g., <em>Case against Buscetta, </em>64 Rivista di Diritto Intemazionale 174 (1981) (Corte di Cassazione, Criminal Section, February 19,1979) in which the Italian court upheld a conviction of Buscetta, an Italian national, for narcotics trafficking in the United States. See Riesenfeld, in 77 Am.J.Int.L. 164 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Finally, the recording of the conversations did not violate the United States-Italian Treaty of Friendship Commerce and Navigation. Article VI of that treaty provides, in part, that as to allegedly unlawful searches and seizures, the citizens of each high contracting party be treated no less favorably than the nationals of the other high contracting party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The cited article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>makes no reference to the interception of telephonic communications. Nevertheless, appellants here have, been accorded all the rights granted to American citizens in similar circumstances. The legality of the taping of appellants\u2019 conversations with Nohra has been determined under the same standards which would govern the taping of conversations between American citizens. Appellants have been indicted by a grand jury, have been granted a full and fair trial by jury, during which all defenses asserted were considered, and have been heard on this appeal. It cannot be questioned that United States treaty obligations have been honored in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In sum, appellants were tried and convicted of a crime committed in the United States and punishable under its laws. They have not established a deprivation of due process or prosecutorial misconduct. Furthermore, there has been no violation of international law, Italian law, or of United States-Italian treaty obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Since all contentions of appellants are without merit, we affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">.
