The railroad has already settled its claim for some $40,000 in damages with Pargas and is no longer interested in the case. The only question the two remaining parties have asked us to decide is whether Pargas may recover that money in a third-party suit against Union Tank. Although the district court answered this question in the negative, we do not reach the merits of the question presented. On our own motion, we determine that the pleadings do not properly invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts and that the case must be remanded in order to afford the parties an opportunity to correct the defect, if they can, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653 (1976).'</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The facts are not in dispute and may be found in the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>See </em>526 F.Supp. 209 (M.D.La.1981). The sole contention presented in the railroad\u2019s original complaint in this case was that Pargas owed it reimbursement for its $40,000 or so in damajges according to the \u201cterms and the conditions of the Association of American Railroads Interchange Rules, to which both [the railroad] and Pargas\u201d have subscribed. (The AAR is an association of private concerns, and is not a governmental agency.) The sole substantial issue in Pargas\u2019s third-party complaint \u2014 the issue with which the parties have presented us on this appeal\u2014 concerns the legal consequences under Illinois law of the liability disclaimer in article 7 of the tank car retrofitting contract between Pargas and Union Tank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pargas argues that the disclaimer \u201cof all indirect, special or consequential damages\u201d is not broad enough to cover damages to the property of third parties (the railroad\u2019s tracks) caused by Union Tank\u2019s own negligence; Union Tank argues that, under the particular circumstances of this case, an Illinois court would hold that it is broad enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The railroad\u2019s complaint asserted jurisdiction under one of the special federal question jurisdictional statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337. That statute gives the federal courts jurisdiction over all cases \u201carising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1337(a) (West Supp. 1983). Presumably because the third-party action was ancillary to the principal suit filed by the railroad, Pargas\u2019 third-party complaint against Union Tank asserted no independent basis for federal jurisdiction. Before the case had proceeded very far beyond these technical preliminaries, however, Union Tank successfully mov\u00e9d on the pleadings for a judgment declaring that it would not be liable to Pargas even if Par-gas was found to be liable to the railroad. The railroad then settled its suit against Pargas and consented to having its first-party suit dismissed with prejudice. Pargas has filed a timely appeal from the judgment on the pleadings dismissing its third-party suit against Union Tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Because \u201cthe trial court,\u201d as we noted in a similar case decided less than a year ago, \u201cfailed to indicate the basis upon which it presumed to exercise subject matter jurisdiction^] .. . the task falls to this Court to determine whether th[is] third-party claim[ ] properly come[s] within the scope of the federal courts\u2019 limited jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Joiner v. Diamond M Drilling Co., </em>677 F.2d 1035, 1038 (5th Cir.1982). We have raised the issue on our own motion, and have invited the two remaining parties, Union Tank and Pargas, to submit supplemental briefs on that question. We now decide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>case on the basis of subject matter jurisdiction. We consider, first, commerce-clause jurisdiction under section 1337, and second, diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Jurisdictional pleadings are governed by rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain ... a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court\u2019s jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). Whether jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship or upon a federal question \u2014 and even though a particular statute or rule need not necessarily be cited by name \u2014 it is generally agreed that \u201cthe basis upon which jurisdiction depends must be alleged affirmatively and distinctly and cannot \u2018be established argumentatively or by mere inference.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">We find no commerce-clause or other federal question in this case, and the pleadings set out no facts- that would lead us to believe that there is one. No part of this case \u201carises under\u201d federal law within the meaning of either section 1337 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (Supp. V 1981). Even the most liberal of the various tests that the Supreme Court has used to determine the statutory meaning of \u201carising under\u201d\u2014 whether the complaint shows \u201cthat the right to relief depends upon the construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the United States\u201d- \u2014 is not satisfied in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both the first-party action between the railroad and Pargas and the third-party action between P\u00e1rgas and Union Tank are founded in contract: the first-party action depends upon the AAR rules, and the third-party action upon article 7 of the tank car contract. Federal law appears not to be implicated even indirectly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The parties essentially concede that section 1337 was invoked erroneously.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They both insist, however, that we should retain jurisdiction over the case because the pleadings affirmatively show that the citizenship of the railroad is diverse from that of Par-gas (in which case Pargas and Union Tank might properly invoke the ancillary jurisdiction of the federal courts)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that Pargas and Union Tank are diverse (in which case the third-party suit could remain in federal court independently).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The federal diversity statute provides that the district courts have original jurisdiction over all civil actions between \u201ccitizens of different States,\u201d and that a corporation is a \u201ccitizen of any State by which it has been incorporated <em>and of the State where it has its principal place of business.\u201d </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (emphasis added). Thus, a complaint properly asserting diversity jurisdiction must state both the state of incorporation <em>and </em>the principal place of business of each corporate party. This much is beyond dispute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">The railroad\u2019s first-party complaint against. Pargas does not meet this test. After stating that the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad, as its name implies, is an Illinois corporation \u201cwith its principal place of business in the State of Illinois\u201d and that Par-gas is a Maryland corporation, the complaint goes on to allege only that Pargas has \u201cits registered office in Waldorf, Maryland.\u201d The term \u201cregistered office\u201d is a generally recognized legal term of art defined, among other places, in section 12 of the Model Business Corporation Act: a \u201cregistered office\u201d is simply the place where service of process can be made upon a corporation\u2019s registered agent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>nothing to do with the corporation\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business.\u201d Federal jurisdiction over the first-party suit therefore fails, and with it, ancillary jurisdiction over the third-party claim. <em>See Local Division 732, Amalgamated Transit Union v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, </em>667 F.2d 1827, 1345 n. 33 (11th Cir.1982) (stating the Fifth Circuit rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">There is also no independent jurisdiction over the third-party claim. Pargas states neither its own principal place of business, nor that of Union Tank. Union Tank\u2019s answer admits only that it is a Delaware corporation \u201cdoing business in the State of Louisiana.\u201d \u201cDoing business\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cprincipal place of business.\u201d A company can do business in many states, but it only has one principal place of business, <em>see e.g., </em>S.Rep. No. 1830, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5 (1958), <em>reprinted in </em>1958 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3099, 3102. Independent diversity jurisdiction over the third-party claim therefore also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The pleadings, in short, do not reveal whether there is (or is not) subject matter jurisdiction. We therefore remand this case to give the district court an opportunity to invite the parties to file appropriate motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653 (1976), which permits \u201camend[ments] [to] defective allegations of jurisdiction, even after judgment has been entered or an appeal taken.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark>. If, after filing appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law, the district court finds that the amended pleadings properly invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts, the case will be referred to this panel for disposition. If, on the other hand, the amendments show that there is no subject matter jurisdiction, the district court must, of course, vacate its judgment and dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The parties shall bear equally the costs of this appeal. The case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">. The full text of article 7 is set out in the district court\u2019s opinion. In pertinent part, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">Union warrants that the cars ... will be free from defects in material and workmanship. The obligation of Union under this warranty shall be limited to repairing or replacing ... any [defective] part or parts .... THIS WARRANTY IS EXPRESSLY- IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR THAT THE CARS ARE FIT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, AND SPECIFICALLY IN LIEU OF ALL INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">526 F.Supp. at 211. The parties have agreed that a federal court interpreting this provision would be bound by Illinois law. Article 9 of the contract provides, \u201cThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\">. 5 C.
