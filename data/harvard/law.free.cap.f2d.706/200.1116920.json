Superczynski sued Defendants P.T.O. Services, Inc., his employer since 1977, and Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers and Warehouse Workers Union (Independent) under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) (1947), charging wrongful termination of employment and breach by the Union of its duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">The district court granted both defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff had not established that the Union\u2019s conduct toward him was arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith. Vaca v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 190, 87 S.Ct. 903, 916, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967). The court noted that the plaintiff could not sustain a charge against his employer, P.T.O. Services, in the absence of proof that the Union breached its duty of fair representation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">The plaintiff was fired from his job with P.T.O. Services on February 1, 1978, as a result of an incident on January 28, 1978. On January 28, the plaintiff, while delivering a load of fifty percent caustic soda to one of P.T.O. Services\u2019 customers, refused either to produce or to wear a protective, waterproof coat. The plaintiff argued that he had never been required to carry such gear with him, and did not have it that night. He contended that this customer had never before required him to be so attired. Additionally, he noted that he already was wearing several layers of heavy clothing as protection from the cold weather. Nevertheless, the customer ordered the plaintiff to leave without completing the delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">The plaintiff received a letter dated February 6 informing him of his dismissal effective February 1. The plaintiff soon thereafter wrote the Union\u2019s executive director requesting assistance. In response, the Union scheduled a grievance committee hearing for February 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-18\">The plaintiff met with his field representative, John Johnson, several times before the grievance committee hearing to discuss the circumstances surrounding his firing. Johnson attempted with no success to have the plaintiff reinstated before the hearing. Johnson also instructed the plaintiff how to prepare for the hearing \u2014 for example, by securing statements of support from fellow drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">When the plaintiff arrived for the grievance committee hearing on February 24, he learned that Johnson was out of town and that another Union representative, Ray Seaman, would represent him. Johnson had anticipated his unavailability and had discussed the plaintiff\u2019s claims with Seaman. Seaman conferred briefly with the plaintiff before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">At the hearing, P.T.O. Services presented evidence to justify the plaintiff\u2019s dismissal, including letters from the customer who had refused delivery of the caustic soda and a four-page \u201cwork record\u201d summarizing incidents as far back as 1974. P.T.O. Services also offered as evidence a document signed by the plaintiff on January 5,1976, while he was an employee of K.A. Steel Chemical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Company. The document declared that the plaintiff, who had been fired by K.A. Steel, would be reinstated, but if he repeated the behavior for which he was fired, then he would be \u201cirretrievably\u201d terminated. Seaman objected to this evidence as justification for the plaintiff\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Seaman and the plaintiff, in addition to challenging P.T.O. Services\u2019 evidence, submitted evidence on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf, including statements from two drivers to the effect that P.T.O. Services had never specifically required protective apparel.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Union General Counsel William Crawford acted as hearing officer and prepared a report which was submitted to the Union\u2019s executive director. The Union and P.T.O. Services jointly determined that the plaintiff\u2019s grievance should be denied. After he was notified of the grievance committee\u2019s decision, the plaintiff requested reconsideration. His request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The plaintiff argues that the Union breached its duty of fair representation, alleging: (1) the Union failed to argue adequately that the plaintiff in fact broke no rules; (2) the Union failed to independently investigate the circumstances surrounding the January 28 incident; (3) the Union failed to advance the plaintiff\u2019s grievance-after the grievance committee unanimously found his claim to be without merit; and (4) the plaintiff was inadequately represented because Seaman, and not Johnson, appeared for him at the hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\"><em>Hoffman v. Lonza, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 519 (7th Cir.1981), is the law of this circuit regarding the proof required of a plaintiff seeking to establish a breach of fair representation in an individual grievance proceeding. Several cases recognize <em>Hoffman </em>as the controlling standard. <em>See Graf v. Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Ry., </em>697 F.2d 771, 777-78 (7th Cir. 1983); <em>United Steel Workers of America v. NLRB, </em>692 F.2d 1052, 1057 (7th Cir.1982) <em>(per </em>curiam); <em>Cote v. Eagle Stores, Inc., </em>688 F.2d 32, 34-35 (7th Cir.1982) <em>(per cu-riam </em>); <em>Rupe v. Spector Freight Systems, Inc., </em>679 F.2d 685, 695-96 (7th Cir.1982) (Peck, J., concurring). <em>Hoffman </em>holds that a union breaches its duty to fairly represent a worker if it deliberately and unjustifiably refuses to represent that worker in processing a grievance. The union\u2019s misconduct must be intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">The <em>Hoffman </em>standard is derived from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. at 190, 87 S.Ct. at 916, where the Court wrote that \u201c[a] breach of the statutory duty of fair representation occurs only when a union\u2019s conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d In <em>Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, </em>403 U.S. 274, 299, 91 S.Ct. 1909, 1924, 29 L.Ed.2d 473 (1971), the Court reaffirmed that for the respondent to make out a claim of breach by his union, \u201c[he] must have proved \u2018arbitrary or bad-faith conduct on the part of the Union.\u2019 Vaca <em>v. Sipes, supra, </em>386 U.S. at 193, 87 S.Ct. at 918. There must be \u2018substantial evidence of fraud, deceitful action or dishonest conduct.\u2019 <em>Humphrey v. Moore, </em>[375 U.S. 335, 348, 84 S.Ct. 363, 371, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964) ].\u201d The <em>Lockridge </em>Court, in a discussion of preemption principles, explained that \u201cthe duty of fair representation was judicially evolved ... to enforce fully the important principle that no individual union member may suffer invidious, hostile treatment at the hands of the majority of his coworkers.\u201d <em>Lockridge, </em>403 U.S. at 301, 91 S.Ct. at 1925; <em>see Hoffman, </em>658 F.2d at 521-22 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">The Supreme Court applied the Vaca standards in <em>Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, </em>424 U.S. 554, 96 S.Ct. 1048, 47 L.Ed.2d 231 (1976), in its discussion of whether a suit against an employer for breach of a collective-bargaining contract was properly dismissed when the accompanying complaint against the union for breach of duty of fair representation with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>stood dismissal. <em>Hines </em>restated the Vaca standards without indicating one way or another whether Vaca allows a breach of duty of fair representation claim for unintentional union conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In fact, Vaca, <em>Lockridge, </em>and <em>Hines </em>indicate that <em>Hoffman </em>correctly sets a stringent standard for proof of a union\u2019s breach of duty. <em>Lockridge </em>clearly stated that proof of \u201carbitrary or bad faith conduct\u201d requires a showing of deliberate disregard or misconduct. <em>See Medlin v. Boeing Vertol Co., </em>620 F.2d 957, 961 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">It has been suggested that our decisions in <em>Miller v. Gateway Transportation Co., </em>616 F.2d 272 (7th Cir.1980), and <em>Baldini v. Local Union No. 1095, </em>581 F.2d 145 (7th Cir.1978), hold that some level of negligence may constitute a breach of duty to fairly represent. However, this court reversed summary judgments against employees in both cases because there existed genuine issues of fact concerning the unions\u2019 conduct. The records in both cases indicated that the unions may have acted in bad faith. <em>See Hoffman, </em>658 F.2d at 521. For example, the <em>Baldini </em>court recognized the plaintiff\u2019s argument that union officials misrepresented the status of his arbitration and later told him that they could do nothing for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We put to rest the argument that <em>Miller, Baldini, </em>and more recently <em>Rupe v. Spector Freight Systems, Inc., </em>679 F.2d at 691, support a different result in this case. <em>Hoffman </em>is controlling; a union member must show that his union deliberately failed to properly pursue his claim against the company. <em>See Cannon v. Consolidated Freightways Corp., </em>524 F.2d 290, 293 (7th Cir.1975) (\u201cTo prove arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, the plaintiff must show that the Union\u2019s conduct was intentional, invidious and directed at that particular</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">employee.\u201d). Complaints about conduct that is not deliberately discriminatory or arbitrary, or in bad faith, are within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. <em>Lockridge, </em>403 U.S. at 301, 91 S.Ct. at 1925; <em>see Hoffman, </em>658 F.2d at 522 (other policy factors supporting more rigorous standard); <em>see also United Steelworkers of America v. NLRB, </em>692 F.2d at 1056-57. <em>Contra Robesky v. Qantas Empire Airways Ltd., </em>573 F.2d 1082 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">No evidence in this case suggests that the Union acted in bad faith toward the plaintiff. In fact, Union representatives adequately prepared for the grievance committee hearing and vigorously defended the plaintiff\u2019s position before that tribunal. Union Representative Johnson discussed the case several times with the plaintiff, who was counselled as to what evidence would be helpful at the hearing. Representative Seaman challenged P.T.O. Services\u2019 evidence during the hearing, especially arguing that the reinstatement letter the plaintiff signed for a former employer was immaterial to the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Our examination of the record also indicates that the plaintiff was not entitled under the existing collective-bargaining agreement to an automatic appeal from the grievance committee\u2019s decision. The agreement established appeal procedures for use only when the Company and the Union failed to reach agreement at the first. stage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here P.T.O. Services and the Union agreed that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">None of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations casts doubt on the Union\u2019s claim that it acted conscientiously on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">Finally, we note that the district court dismissed the complaint against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>P.T.O. Services on the grounds that an employee cannot maintain an action against his employer for wrongful discharge under these circumstances unless he first proves a breach of his union\u2019s duty of fair representation. We affirm that ruling. <em>See Cote v. Eagle Stores, Inc., </em>688 F.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">. Several other allegations by the plaintiff concerning the Union\u2019s handling of the grievance and its relationship with P.T.O. Services are without merit, and we summarily affirm their dismissal by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">. The relevant section of the collective-bargaining agreement states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">Section 1. All grievances relating solely to the discharge or discipline of an employee shall be processed as follows: (a) The Employer and the Union having jurisdiction over the Employee shall within five (5) working days after notice of the grievance meet as a grievance committee and reach a settlement which shall be final and binding, (b) If the parties fail to reach a settlement within the aforesaid time, then within five (5) working days thereafter the matter shall be submitted to the permanent Joint Grievance Committee constituted as set forth in Section 2(b) of this Article....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
