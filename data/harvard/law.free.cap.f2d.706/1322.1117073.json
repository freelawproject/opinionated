RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Rex C. Cauble appeals his conviction on a ten-count indictment charging him with violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (RICO) and the Travel Act and with misapplication of bank funds. Cauble, a wealthy Texas businessman, was in effect accused of being the range boss of the highly publicized \u201cCowboy Mafia,\u201d a loosely-knit group responsible for importing and distributing over 147,000 pounds of marijuana from 1976 through 1978.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The indictment charged Cauble with substantive violations of RICO<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based on conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity and investment of income from racketeering activity in an interstate enterprise; conspiracy to violate RICO; three violations of the Travel Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and four counts of misapplication of bank funds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury convicted him on all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>counts and found that Cauble\u2019s share of Cauble Enterprises should be forfeited. The trial judge imposed a five-year sentence on Count One and concurrent five-year sentences on the other counts and ordered the forfeiture. Cauble\u2019s appeal raises myriad challenges to the indictment, the sufficiency of the evidence adduced at trial, and the legality of the forfeiture. Having reviewed the sixteen-volume' record, we conclude that the trial was fair, the evidence was sufficient, and the assertions of error are without merit. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of conviction and forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">I. The RICO Claims</p>\n<p id=\"AHib\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-5\">Congress adopted the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations provisions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cto provide a blueprint for federal action against organized crime....\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although it suffered initially from limited use, RICO is now a frequently-employed arrow in the federal prosecutor\u2019s crime-fighting quiver. RICO\u2019s application and effectiveness have been enhanced by the judicial consensus that it may be used even though no organized crime activity is charged<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that it applies not only to legitimate enterprises conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity, but to wholly illegitimate enterprises as well.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-16\">1. What RICO Prohibits</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-17\">RICO\u2019s purpose is \u201cthe imposition of enhanced criminal penalties and new civil sanctions to provide new legal remedies for all types of organized criminal behavior, that is, enterprise criminality \u2014 from simple political corruption to sophisticated white-collar crime schemes to traditional Mafia-type endeavors.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> RICO does not, however, criminalize conduct that was legal before its enactment. Its application depends on the existence of racketeering activity violating some other criminal statute, state or federal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-18\">Section 1962(a) of the statute prohibits the use of illegally-derived funds to acquire or maintain an interest in an enterprise by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>legal means.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 1962(c) proscribes the illegal use of an enterprise. Section 1962(d) makes illegal a conspiracy to violate RICO\u2019s substantive provisions, requiring the government to prove that the defendant agreed to participate in the enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering. Each section requires that the enterprise affect interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">The government establishes a \u00a7 1962(a) violation by proving the existence of an enterprise, the defendant\u2019s derivation of income from a pattern of racketeering activity, and the use of any part of that income in acquiring an interest in or operating the enterprise. The government establishes a \u00a7 1962(c) violation by proving the existence of an enterprise, the defendant\u2019s employment by or association with that enterprise, and the defendant\u2019s conduct of or participation in the conduct of the enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because this case requires us to examine the proof necessary to demonstrate both the existence of an enterprise and the connection of a defendant to it, we discuss each element briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">2. Enterprise</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-7\">The statute states: \u201c \u2018enterprise\u2019 includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has held that this language encompasses both wholly legal entities and completely illegal associations-in-fact.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But \u201c[t]he \u2018enterprise\u2019 is not the \u2018pattern of racketeering activity\u2019; it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, in every case the government must prove not only that there was a pattern of racketeering activity but that it was conducted through an enterprise as thus defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-17\">In this ease the indictment charged that Cauble Enterprises, a legal partnership consisting of Cauble, his wife, and his son, was the enterprise used in violation of both \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a) and (e).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-18\">3. Pattern of Racketeering Activity</p>\n<p id=\"AC5\">The statute defines a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d as \u201cat least two acts of racketeering activity .. . the last of which occurred within ten years ... after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cRacketeering activity\u201d includes an array of crimes that violate either state or federal law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-19\">4. Nexus Between the Enterprise and the Racketeering Activity</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-20\">RICO criminalizes the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>ing activity and not merely the defendant\u2019s engaging in racketeering activity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, there must be a nexus between the enterprise, the defendant, and the pattern of racketeering activity. The mere fact that a defendant works for a legitimate enterprise and commits racketeering acts while on the business premises does not establish that the affairs of the enterprise have been conducted \u201cthrough\u201d a pattern of racketeering activity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Similarly, a defendant\u2019s mere association with a lawful enterprise whose affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity in which he is not personally engaged does not establish his guilt under RICO.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">In several opinions we have discussed the requirement that there be a nexus between the enterprise and the racketeering activity. We have not, however, formulated a test to determine whether the requisite nexus has been established by the government\u2019s proof.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Even in our most recent discussion of legal enterprises, <em>United States v. Dozier, </em>672 F.2d 531 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, -U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 256, 74 L.Ed.2d 200 (1982), we did not define the nexus required but concluded that \u201cthe nexus is clear\u201d because \u201c[o]nly [the defendant\u2019s] position in the [enterprise] and his control over its affairs enabled him to hawk its services for personal gain.\u201d 672 F.2d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-12\">Two courts have held that the test for determining whether the government has met the nexus requirement is whether it has proved that \u201c(1) [the defendant] is enabled to commit the predicate offenses solely by virtue of his position in or control over the affairs of the enterprise, or (2) the predicate offenses are related to the activities of that enterprise.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> ' This test appears to us essentially to combine the two required connections under part (1) of the inquiry. Because the enterprise-racketeering nexus should be distinct from the defendant-racketeering connection, we find it necessary to modify this formulation. A defendant does not \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201cpartici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>pate in the conduct\u201d of a lawful enterprise\u2019s affairs, unless (1) the defendant has in fact committed the racketeering acts as alleged; (2) the defendant\u2019s position in the enterprise facilitated his commission of the racketeering acts, and (3) the predicate acts had some effect on the lawful enterprise.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">B. <em>Challenges to the Indictment \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">Cauble challenges each RICO count on the ground that it fails to state an offense against the United States.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Count One of Cauble\u2019s indictment, the conspiracy charge, details the predicate offenses and overt acts with great specificity. It alleges that as part of the conspiracy Cauble Enterprises\u2019 \u201clands, buildings, automobiles, air-crafts [sic], employees and assets\u201d would be used. It then lists thirty-seven overt acts, alleging that Cauble and Cauble Enterprises loaned money to, financed travel by, and provided ranches and an airplane for use by the conspirators. Cauble nonetheless contends that this count is defective because its charging portion does not include references to the particular means by which Cauble Enterprises\u2019 affairs were conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity. He also contends that the allegation that he acted \u201cindividually and doing business as Cauble Enterprises\u201d \u201cleaves a question whether some agency theory more arcane than contemplated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 is being invoked.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Finally, he charges that the count is too vague to permit a clear answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-11\">The indictment\u2019s purpose is to inform the accused of the charges; it must be read in the light of that purpose. An indictment is sufficient if it contains the elements of the offense charged, fairly informs the defendant what charge he must be prepared to meet, and enables the accused to plead acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. <em>Stratton, </em>649 F.2d at 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-12\">In <em>Stratton, </em>the defendant argued that the indictment was defective because it alleged too broad an enterprise. We stated: \u201cThe agreements which were part of the alleged conspiracy, the \u2018overt acts\u2019 in furtherance of the conspiracy, and the substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>tive racketeering offenses are all related in great detail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We, therefore, concluded that the indictment left no room for doubt about the charges lodged against each defendant and protected them from double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">Count One of this indictment, whose detail we have already summarized, is sufficient to inform Cauble of the charges against him and to permit him to answer these charges. Furthermore, the list of overt acts adequately specifies the means by which Cauble Enterprises\u2019 affairs were conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">Count Two, brought under \u00a7 1962(a), charges Cauble with aiding and abetting six incidents of marijuana smuggling and with committing or aiding and abetting various acts of travel as part of a pattern of racketeering activity. It charges that Cauble received income from these activities and invested it in Cauble Enterprises. Cauble claims that this count fails to state an offense because it can be read consistently with innocence and fails to give notice of the amount of racketeering income invested in the enterprise and the nature of its investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">The indictment charges Cauble with investing income derived from racketeering activity in an interstate enterprise. It lists the acts alleged as the pattern of racketeering activity. These are the essential elements of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">Cauble nevertheless contends that the indictment did not put him on notice of the \u201csource, amount, and nature of the \u2018income\u2019 ... and the destination, amount and nature of the \u2018investment\u2019 ... . \u201d But the substantive offense charged is the \u201cinvestment\u201d of \u201cincome\u201d in an enterprise and the indictment\u2019s wording makes clear that this is the charge against which Cauble must defend. The defendant is entitled to a \u201cplain, concise statement of the <em>essential </em>facts constituting the offenses charged,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> but the indictment need not set forth every evidentiary detail necessary to establish the elements of the offense.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-14\">Count Three, brought under \u00a7 1962(c), charges Cauble with conducting the affairs of Cauble Enterprises through a pattern of racketeering activity and incorporates by reference the allegations in Count Two that Cauble aided and abetted smuggling and acts of criminal travel. It thus puts Cauble on notice first that he is charged with conducting Cauble Enterprises\u2019 affairs through a pattern of racketeering and second that the acts of racketeering are those set forth in Count Two. Cauble argues that this count is vague because it fails to explain how its allegations are related to the holdings of Cauble Enterprises sought to be forfeited. The indictment is clear to all but the captious. It plainly and concisely states the charge and that suffices.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-15\">Cauble contends that Count Two, charging investment in the enterprise, and Count Three, charging conduct of the enterprise, are multiplicitous.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Rule 12(b)(2) requires that defenses and objections based on defects in the indictment be raised before trial. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bradsby, </em>628 F.2d 901, 905-06 (5th Cir. 1980), we held that a failure to raise the multiplicity argument before trial did not waive the right to object to multiple sentences. We reasoned that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>should not be forced to serve an erroneous sentence imposed on each count of a multi-plicitous indictment because of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-4\">In this case, however, Cauble received a concurrent sentence on the allegedly multi-plicitous counts. Therefore, this claim is arguably waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">Even if not waived, this contention lacks merit. To sustain a conviction on Count Two the government must prove that the defendant derived and invested income. To convict on Count Three the government must satisfy the three-pronged test we have set out above.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> These are plainly different offenses, requiring proof of different elements, so the counts are not multiplicitous.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">C. <em>The </em>Evidence<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-7\">The government\u2019s proof focused on a series of smuggling episodes involving the shrimp boats MONKEY, JUBILEE, BAYOU BLUES, and AGNES PAULINE and their connection to Cauble\u2019s trusted ranch foreman, Charles \u201cMuscles\u201d Foster.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The issue, as both trial counsel repeatedly stressed to the jury, was whether Cauble knew of the smuggling activities; no one contested that the smugglers used many of Cauble Enterprises\u2019 assets. Much of the government\u2019s evidence came from the mouths of \u201cCowboy Mafia\u201d members and former Cauble Enterprises employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-13\">1. January-February 1977: the Preliminaries</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-14\">Raymond Hawkins, a confessed drug smuggler, met Foster in 1972 and the two became reacquainted in 1976.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Foster flew by commercial airliner to Thomasville, Georgia, near Hawkins\u2019 home, on February 1, 1977; Cauble Enterprises paid for the ticket. When Cauble made a $25,000 loan to Foster from Cauble Enterprises\u2019 funds on February 9, 1977, Foster told Cauble that the money was to be reloaned to Hawkins. Hawkins flew to New Jersey the next day to lease trucks to haul marijuana. Cauble Enterprises paid for the ticket and Hawkins used all or part of the $25,000 to pay for the trucks.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Foster helped unload marijuana from the MONKEY on or about February 21, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-15\">2. Febru\u00e1ry-June 1977: the MONKEY</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-16\">The smugglers decided to move the operation from Georgia to Texas. Hawkins met with Foster and Carlos Gerdes<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> several times to plan the new operation; Foster flew to these meetings aboard Cauble Enterprises\u2019 private plane.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-17\">On February 26, 1977, Foster, Gerdes, Cauble, and Ms. Fern Lynch flew from Denton to Houston; Cauble and Ms. Lynch deplaned in Houston and Cauble told the pilot to continue to Orange. On March 2, 1977, Foster flew to Thomasville to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>Hawkins and Gerdes. Gerdes gave Foster $250,000 cash for setting up the Texas operation.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> On March 4, Foster repaid his $31,-000 debt to Cauble Enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">From March through May Cauble Enterprises loaned Foster $18,000. Cauble Enterprises also paid for Foster\u2019s travel to Houston on May 11-13,1977. The proceeds of a loan made on May 11 were used to reimburse Hawkins for building a privacy fence at Sneed\u2019s Shipyard in Orange, Texas, where the MONKEY was to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">The MONKEY arrived in Orange on May 31, 1977. Foster had arranged for trucks and drivers<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> to haul the load to the L.R. Ranch near Meridian, Texas. The L.R. Ranch is owned by Cauble Enterprises. Foster paid the ranch foreman to take a vacation and the smugglers used the ranch for approximately two weeks in distributing the marijuana.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">Hawkins decided to move to Texas because smuggling was becoming more difficult in Florida and Georgia. He agreed to buy the Cherokee Ranch from Cauble Enterprises and paid Cauble $100,000 down, in cash, which Cauble agreed not to report on his income tax return.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Hawkins also testified that he met Foster, Cauble, and Ms. Lynch in Cauble\u2019s bedroom three weeks after the MONKEY arrived and paid Foster $250,000 in Cauble\u2019s presence; Foster then gave Cauble the money.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-11\">3. June 1977 \u2014 May 1978: the BAYOU BLUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-12\">After he split with Gerdes, Hawkins set up his own marijuana smuggling venture. He bought the BAYOU BLUES through Martin Sneed, Sr.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> He and Foster used the Cauble Enterprises plane to set up the deal.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>On September 12, 1977, Cauble flew to Las Vegas with Hawkins and others.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Cauble arranged for Hawkins to launder $100,000 and, on his return to Denton, deposited the money in Hawkins\u2019 account at the Western State Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">On May 2, 1978, the BAYOU BLUES arrived at Sneed\u2019s Shipyard in Orange, Texas. Foster became involved in transporting and storing the marijuana at the last minute when one of the trucks did not appear. The smugglers took the marijuana to the Crockett Ranch in Crockett, Texas, which is owned by Cauble Enterprises. The next day, however, Foster told Hawkins to get the truck off the ranch. Also on May 2, Foster flew to Tampa at Cauble Enterprises\u2019 expense to buy a small boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">On May 4, 1978, Cauble flew to Las Vegas. Foster had told Willis Butler, whom he owed $50,000, that Butler could have the money in old bills or \u201cthe old man can go to Las Vegas and clean it up for you.\u201d Butler received $50,000 in new $100 bills and later used some of them to pay his lawyer. Twenty-five of the bills had been delivered by the Federal Reserve Bank to the Valley Bank of Nevada on May 4, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">4. June 1977 \u2014 April 1978: the JUBILEE</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-8\">While the BAYOU BLUES, operation was underway, Gerdes\u2019 organization was also planning more smuggling, ventures. On July 20, 1977, Gerdes, Foster, and others flew to Las Vegas aboard Cauble Enterprises\u2019 plane to launder money.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Gerdes and others returned to Texas on July 26 and had breakfast with Cauble at Cauble\u2019s home; Cauble ordered the Cauble Enterprises pilot to fly Gerdes to his home in Knoxville, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-13\">Gerdes\u2019 organization sought a new boat in October 1977. Foster was looking for a boat at the same time, allegedly to begin a shrimping business. Cauble called two boat brokers on October 5, 1977, seeking a shrimp boat, and later sent Foster to look at a boat in Aransas Pass, Texas. Gerdes\u2019 lieutenants bought the JUBILEE in November 1977, after meeting Foster while looking for a suitable boat.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1417-14\">The JUBILEE smugglers met in November 1977 at a Houston apartment leased by Cutter Bill\u2019s Western Wear, a business owned by Cauble Enterprises. In late 1977 Foster asked Cauble\u2019s lawyer\u2019s assistance in leasing a site suitable for a shrimping operation. The lawyer and Foster looked. at several places and in January 1978 rented a site at High Island, Texas.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Foster had a large metal structure built at the water\u2019s edge..</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-15\">On December 26, 1977, Foster flew aboard Cauble Enterprises\u2019 plane to Sarasota and picked up Gerdes. They then flew to Memphis and on to Houston; from there they boarded a commercial plane and flew to Las Vegas. On December 30 Cauble flew to Las Vegas. On January 1, 1978, Cauble delayed his party\u2019s takeoff from Las Vegas to converse with Gerdes at the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-16\">The JUBILEE arrived at High Island on January 27,1978. Eight smugglers, including Gerdes, Foster, and three Cauble Enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>prises\u2019 employees<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> awaited the JUBILEE\u2019S arrival for a week-at the Cutter Bill\u2019s apartment. The marijuana was unloaded and driven to the Crockett Ranch. Butler and Washington then took one truckload to the Mercer Ranch, near Fort Worth.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Cauble Enterprises also owns the Mercer Ranch. The smugglers distributed the marijuana from the Crockett Ranch during the next two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">During February and March 1978, the Cauble Enterprises plane made three trips to Alcoa, Tennessee, near the home of John Ruppel.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> On March 21, 1978, Foster and Gerdes flew by commercial aircraft to Memphis and Cauble Enterprises paid their fare.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">On April 4,1978, the JUBILEE arrived at High Island. For the week before its arrival, the smugglers had again resided at the Cutter Bill\u2019s apartment. Butler and Washington again trucked the marijuana to the Crockett Ranch and the smugglers distributed it during the next two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">In April or May 1978 Larry Washington called Cauble to find out whether Foster had left Washington $5,000 due him from the second JUBILEE load. Washington asked whether Foster had left a package for him and Cauble said: \u201cNo. What was it?\u201d Washington replied: \u201cMoney.\u201d Cau-ble told Washington to come to the ranch for the money. When he arrived, Cauble gave him a briefcase, which Washington had given to Foster, containing $5,000; Cauble asked Washington if it was a loan or if Foster owed him the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-10\">5. June-November 1978: the AGNES PAULINE</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-11\">During June and July 1978, Foster flew to Tampa, Florida, Beaumont, Texas, and Knoxville, Tennessee, at Cauble Enterprises\u2019 expense. Foster, Butler, Washington, and James Holland discussed smuggling another load of marijuana in August 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-12\">During August or September 1978, Cau-ble told Washington that Carlos had called to warn Cauble that Foster was talking too much and to say that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do any more business with\u201d Foster. Cauble also warned Butler and Washington not to have any more dealings with Foster. Foster disappeared during August 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-13\">The AGNES PAULINE arrived in Port Arthur, Texas, on November 29, 1978. It was seized by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-14\">6. The Cash Deposits</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-15\">During late 1976 and early 1977, Cauble Enterprises was burdened with debt. The partnership lost money during each of the years involved here except 1978, in which it broke even. In January 1978 Cauble Enterprises\u2019 special account at Western State Bank was $100,000 overdrawn; it also showed a deficit balance on March 1, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-16\">On April 8, 1978, Cauble flew to Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker. He lost his $10,000 entry fee but, when he returned to Texas, he told John Gray, Chairman of the Board of the Dallas International Bank, that he had won $260,000 in a side game and wanted it worked into his accounts at the bank.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Gray suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>that Cauble take the money to \u201chis own bank in Denton.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">At Western State Bank, Cauble Enterprises was on a list of persons and businesses exempt from the requirement that all cash deposits exceeding $10,000 be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Cauble Enterprises deposited $113,900 cash to its Western State Bank Special Account in April 1978; $182,000 cash in May, and $124,300 cash in June. Cash deposits in 1978 totaled more than $692,000; cash deposits in 1977 amounted to approximately $220,000; in 1976 cash deposits were $14,-600.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">D. <em>Challenges to the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8-\">1. The Predicate Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">Cauble contends that the proof of the RICO predicate offenses was insufficient because the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he aided and abetted either the smuggling episodes or the acts of travel. In determining whether the evidence is sufficient, we inquire whether a reasonable juror might have been convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">To prove a person guilty of aiding and abetting, the government must show that the defendant associated himself with an unlawful venture, participated in it with the desire of accomplishing the illegal end, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The defendant must intend to commit the offense and participate in some manner to aid its commission, but need only aid and abet, rather than commit, each element of the crime.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-14\">Cauble\u2019s brief states that the proof \u201cnowhere discloses\u201d that he was or could have been aware of any of the specific smuggling episodes or of the purpose of the airplane flights. This assertion is flatly contradicted by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-15\">Both Hawkins and Washington testified that, in their opinion, Cauble knew about the smuggling. McKesson testified that Foster told him that Cauble knew about the smuggling. Although this evidence was contradicted, a reasonable juror might have believed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-16\">Furthermore, there was voluminous circumstantial evidence of Cauble\u2019s knowledge. This included several large loans to Foster from Cauble Enterprises, including one that was to be reloaned to Hawkins; Cauble\u2019s communications with Carlos Gerdes; his trips to Las Vegas; his paying for Foster to look for a boat; and his making significant changes in the business practices of Cauble Enterprises during the years in which the smuggling occurred.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>was also repeated testimony that only Cau-ble could authorize the use of the airplane. One pilot was dismissed for flying the plane to have it cleaned -without Cauble\u2019s permission. This testimony provided support for the possible inference that Cauble knew of the various uses of the plane.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">A reasonable jury might have concluded on the record evidence that Cauble knew of the drug-smuggling activities and knew the purpose of the acts of travel. Having reached the decision to reject Cauble\u2019s lack-of-knowledge defense, it might have concluded that Cauble was associated with, participating in, and seeking the success of a series of smuggling incidents. It might have decided that activities leading up to the ultimate acts of smuggling included the many acts of travel charged. In short, we are unable to say that a reasonable person would necessarily have entertained a reasonable doubt, after hearing the government\u2019s proof, that Cauble aided and abetted the acts of travel and the smuggling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">2. The Enterprise Element</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-6\">Cauble argues that all of his RICO convictions must be set aside because the government failed to prove that he was in any way culpably connected with any enterprise. We treat this as a challenge to both the government\u2019s proof that there was a RICO enterprise and that there was a nexus between the enterprise, the racketeering activities, and Cauble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-7\">Cauble contends that the government\u2019s proof demonstrated only that the racketeering activities were committed by and related to an enterprise-in-fact, the \u201cCowboy Mafia.\u201d Thus, he suggests, the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to show that Cauble Enterprises was the RICO enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-13\">In <em>Turkette, </em>the Supreme Court held that the existence of an enterprise \u201cis proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In cases in which the government charges that a legal entity is the enterprise, proof that the entity has a legal existence satisfies the enterprise element. This is because, by definition, a legal organization such as a partnership has an ascertainable structure, operates as a continuing unit, and has a purpose common to its members and employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-14\">The government\u2019s proof demonstrated that Cauble Enterprises is a limited partnership organized under the laws of Texas. It proved that the partnership has a formal organization and has operated continuously since 1972 for the purpose of seeking maximum long-term appreciation of the partners\u2019 capital. It demonstrated that Cauble Enterprises is an entity different from both the person, Rex C. Cauble, and the pattern of racketeering activity it sought to punish. Having shown that this entity existed, the government met the burden of proving the enterprise element.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>3. \u201cConducting\u201d the Enterprise\u2019s Affairs \u201cThrough\u201d A Pattern of Racketeering Activity</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">Cauble contends that the government\u2019s proof demonstrated a nexus between the smuggling activity and the \u201cCowboy Mafia,\u201d rather than Cauble Enterprises. Therefore, he contends, the evidence was insufficient to prove that he \u201cconducted\u201d Cauble Enterprises\u2019 affairs \u201cthrough\u201d acts of racketeering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">Because we have concluded that a reasonable jury might have believed that Cauble aided and abetted the commission of the charged racketeering acts, we inquire whether his position in Cauble Enterprises facilitated the commission of the acts and whether the acts affected Cauble Enterprises. Based on the evidence, a reasonable jury might have concluded that none of the acts of travel would have occurred but for Cauble\u2019s ability to dispatch the Cauble Enterprises airplane and to use Cauble Enterprises\u2019 assets to pay for commercial flights. Furthermore, a jury might reasonably have concluded, that Cauble\u2019s position in Cauble Enterprises made it possible for him to make available the funds for loans, the ranches, and the other assets of the enterprise that the smugglers used. Therefore, the government\u2019s proof was sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the defendant\u2019s position in the enterprise facilitated the commission of the racketeering acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">Finally, there is the question whether the racketeering acts affected the enterprise. In this case a reasonable juror might have concluded that the racketeering acts led directly to the successful smuggling venture's, which, in turn, led to the large cash deposits to Cauble Enterprises\u2019 account at Western State Bank. This is a sufficient effect to satisfy the test. We, therefore, conclude that the government successfully shouldered its burden of proving that Cauble conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-11\">4. The Conspiracy Count</p>\n<p id=\"aq0-dedup-0\">Cauble was charged with conspiracy to conduct and participate in the conduct of Cauble Enterprises\u2019 affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. He contends that his conviction under \u00a7 1962(d) must be reversed because the government failed to prove that he \u201cagreed to join an enterprise by means of committing two predicate acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-12\">Our decisions establish that a \u00a7 1962(d) conviction requires proof of the enterprise and racketeering elements plus the defendant\u2019s objective manifestation of intent to participate, either directly or indirectly, in the affairs of the enterprise.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> As we stated in <em>Phillips, </em>in order to prove a RICO conspiracy the government must prove \u201cthe additional element of agreement.\u201d 664 F.2d at 1012.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-13\">A reasonable jury might have concluded that Cauble agreed to conduct Cauble Enterprises\u2019 affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. It might have believed the direct testimony of Hawkins and Washington that Cauble was involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>the smuggling and, therefore, concluded that Cauble agreed to commit or aid and abet the smuggling predicates.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> It might have believed the circumstantial evidence that Cauble used Cauble Enterprises\u2019 assets to loan money to the smugglers and to finance their travel and, therefore, that Cauble agreed to commit or aid and abet the acts of travel. It might also have believed the circumstantial evidence that Cauble was aware that other assets were being used to arrange marijuana smuggling deals, to provide a haven for the smugglers, and to store and distribute marijuana. The evidence is sufficient to support Cauble\u2019s conviction on the conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">5. The Investment Count</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">Cauble next contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict on the \u00a7 1962(a) count. He contends that the government failed to prove that he gained \u201cincome\u201d from a pattern of racketeering activity. He also maintains that the government failed to prove that particular funds invested in the enterprise were derived from a particular unlawful transaction in which he was culpably involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-6\">Cauble argues that he derived no income because money advanced or loaned to the smugglers and later repaid was not \u201cincome.\u201d We need not decide the validity of this contention<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> because a reasonable juror might have concluded that Cauble received \u201cincome\u201d based on the substantial cash deposits to Cauble Enterprises\u2019 special account during 1977 and 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-11\">Cauble also argues that the government must do more to support a \u00a7 1962(a) conviction than prove that the income was derived from a pattern of racketeering activity. He contends that RICO\u2019s legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended to require the government to \u201ctrace\u201d illicitly-derived funds from a particular unlawful act to the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-12\">Cauble relies on the Justice Department\u2019s observation on a related bill that \u201ctracing of funds known to be derived from racketeering activities to their eventual investment in a business enterprise [is required] in establishing a violation of subsection (a) of Section 1962.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> He also relies on a law review article by one of RICO\u2019s primary sponsors stating \u201conly one of the three prohibitions in Title IX requires tracing of funds.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-13\">We do not impart to the word \u201ctracing\u201d as used in these statements the same precision as does Cauble. If the prosecution had demonstrated that Cauble made substantial, unexplained cash deposits into his personal account but not that the money was ever used in any way related to Cauble Enterprises, it would have failed to meet its burden of \u201ctracing.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> But the prosecution need prove only that illegally derived funds flowed into the enterprise;<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> it need not follow a trail of specific dollars from a particular criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-14\">The government presented evidence of large cash deposits to Cauble Enterprises\u2019 account and of marijuana smuggling in which Cauble and Cauble Enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>prises\u2019 employees played a role. The jury might reasonably have inferred that there was a sufficient nexus between- the money and the enterprise to satisfy the \u201cinvestment\u201d- requirement of \u00a7 1962(a).<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">E. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">Cauble challenges several of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. Because his lawyers lodged no objection to the charge below, we review each of the allegedly defective instructions only for plain error.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> This means that we will not reverse unless the instruction is so clearly wrong that our failure to notice it would result in a miscarriage of justice or would seriously affect the integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">Cauble first claims that the trial judge erred in charging the jury on the enterprise element. He contends that the judge\u2019s instructions failed to make clear that the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Cauble Enterprises was the RICO enterprise whose affairs were conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity. This instruction, Cauble claims, amounted to a directed verdict of guilt on the enterprise element.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-18\">The trial, judge defined \u201centerprise\u201d by reading the statutory definition to the jury.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> He then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-19\">The \u201centerprise\u201d charged in this case in Counts 1, 2 and 3 is Cauble Enterprises. Cauble Enterprises is a limited partnership formed pursuant to the laws of Texas with Rex C. Cauble as the sole general partner. Under the Texas Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as the general partner, Rex C. Cauble has the right to control and manage the affairs of Cauble Enterprises and is liable for all debts and obligations of Cauble Enterprises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1423-20\">The judge then instructed the jury on the three substantive RICO counts. He prefaced his charge on each count with the admonition that \u201cthe Government must prove each of the following essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Each charge included the enterprise element and in no charge did the judge tell the jurors that Cauble Enterprises was the RICO enterprise.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>In short, the judge\u2019s instructions adequately conveyed to the jury the requirement that they conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Cauble Enterprises was the RICO enterprise. The judge told the jurors that the enterprise <em>charged </em>was Cauble Enterprises; he never told them that the RICO enterprise was Cauble Enterprises. The directive left the jury free to conclude that the government failed to prove that Cauble Enterprises was the RICO enterprise. Accordingly, it was not plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">Cauble nevertheless argues that the trial judge\u2019s instruction on Count Three was wrong because it impermissibly combined the RICO enterprise and Cauble Enterprises.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> But this part of the instruction was merely a summary of the indictment and not a direction to the jury. As our previous discussion of the charge demonstrates, the trial judge made a distinction between Cauble Enterprises and the RICO enterprise in instructing the jury about the elements of the offense. There was no plain error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">Cauble next faults the district judge\u2019s failure to define the word \u201cincome\u201d in the \u00a7 1962(a) count instructions. He argues that the failure was particularly prejudicial because \u201cfund sources were a critical issue at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-6\">This ingenious transition from <em>sources </em>of income to <em>existence </em>of income points up the weakness of Cauble\u2019s argument. The defense did not dispute at trial and does not dispute now that Cauble Enterprises\u2019 Special Account received substantial deposits of cash. It disputed whether the funds came from drug smuggling or cattle sales. The judge\u2019s failure to define this word of common usage and meaning did not fall to the level of plain error.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-12\">Cauble next challenges the trial judge\u2019s charge on the RICO predicates. He suggests that the judge\u2019s instruction that the jury could consider \u201cany act\u201d in violation of the Travel Act as an instance of racketeering activity impermissibly amended the indictment by allowing the jury to consider the Travel Act violations alleged in Counts Four, Nine, and Ten as RICO predicates even though they were not charged as such.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-13\">The trial judge should have made it clear to the jurors that only the predicate acts alleged in the RICO counts could support a RICO conviction.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> His failure to do so was not plain error, however, in view of his instruction to the jury that: \u201cA separate crime or offense is charged against the Defendant in each count of the Indictment. Each offense and the evidence pertaining to it should be considered separately.\u201d We find no miscarriage of justice in the trial judge\u2019s failure to make explicit what was implicit.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>Cauble finally assaults the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that its verdict on the RICO predicates had to be unanimous. The judge stated that the government had to prove two acts of racketeering activity beyond a reasonable doubt, that it had to prove every essential element of each count beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the jury\u2019s verdict had to be unanimous.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> It might have been better practice to reinforce this by telling the jury that the jurors must be unanimous on each predicate, but had trial counsel made such a request the trial judge would have been able to consider it and likely would have granted it. When counsel sits idly by, the trial judge is not given the opportunity to reassess the charge. In the absence of objection, it was not necessary for the judge to elaborate this phase of the charge because he gave an express instruction that each juror had to agree to the verdict. No miscarriage of justice resulted from this omission.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-12\">II. The RICO Forfeiture</p>\n<p id=\"acd-dedup-0\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-13\">American antipathy for the English common law\u2019s \u201cforfeiture of estate,\u201d which disinherited those unfortunate enough to be kin to felons, dates from the founding of the nation.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Criminal forfeiture has, therefore, been largely unknown in the United States.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-14\">Congress added the forfeiture provisions<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> to RICO in order to attack the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>sources of economic power of organized crime<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> in addition to removing from power and imprisoning those individuals who violate the statute. It viewed the sanctions and remedies against organized crime then available to the government as \u201cunnecessarily limited in scope and impact.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> As enacted the forfeiture provisions are meant to reach \u201cthe illgotten gains of criminals where they enter or operate an organization through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d <footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">B. <em>Claims of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"aqr-dedup-0\">After finding Cauble guilty on the RICO counts, the jury responded to special interrogatories regarding the forfeiture of his interest in Cauble Enterprises.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Cauble now launches a barrage of attacks against the validity of the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">1. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">. Cauble first contends that the forfeiture violates the due process clause because it affects property rights of the limited partners of Cauble Enterprises, neither of whom were given notice of the forfeiture and an opportunity to be heard. He claims that the government may not partition the undivided partnership interest and remove the general partner without a finding against all owners that partnership property was used or acquired in violation of law.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1426-18\">Neither of the limited partners has sought to be heard in this case. Their remedy, as we made explicit in <em>United States v. L\u2019Hoste, </em>609 F.2d 796 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 833, 101 S.Ct. 104, 66 L.Ed.2d 39 (1980), is to petition the Attorney General for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture. As we stated in that case, \u201cCongress plainly addressed the possible hardship that forfeiture could cause to those innocent parties holding an interest in forfeited property and gave responsibility to the United States, not the district court, to alleviate the hardship.\u201d 609 F.2d at 812.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> This directive applies with equal force to the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-19\">Cauble asks that we distinguish <em>L\u2019Hoste </em>on the grounds that it involved freely transferable corporate shares rather than undivided partnership interests and that it involved inchoate rather than vested property rights. These distinctions lack substance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>The former would permit a defendant to avoid RICO forfeiture by forming a partnership, but not a corporation, with an innocent party; the latter would make the validity of federal RICO forfeitures subject to the nuances of state property law. Therefore, <em>L\u2019Hoste </em>squarely controls this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">2. Conflict of Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">Cauble next contends that, because Cau-ble Enterprises\u2019 property interests were affected by the trial and consequent forfeiture, it was entitled to separate representation. He claims that trial counsel made an insufficient effort to demonstrate that there was no connection between the drug-smuggling conspiracy and Cauble Enterprises because he was more concerned with proving Cauble\u2019s lack-of-knowledge defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\">If Cauble Enterprises had been charged as a RICO defendant instead of or in addition to being charged as the enterprise, it would have been entitled to separate counsel.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> But Cauble Enterprises was charged with no crime and suffers no punishment as a result of Cauble\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-8\">The forfeiture in this case is of Rex C. Cauble\u2019s property interest in Cauble Enterprises. It is <em>in personam, </em>imposed directly on a guilty person, rather than <em>in rem, </em>imposed on \u201cguilty\u201d property. Therefore, Cauble Enterprises had no stake in the proceeding and was not entitled to separate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-9\">3. Defects in the Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">Cauble next claims that the notice of forfeiture failed to advise him of the nature, cause, and extent of the forfeiture sought. These claims focus on the allegedly confusing character of the notice, were not presented to the district court, and do not assert that the indictment failed to charge an offense. Therefore, they are waived.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Even if not waived, however, these claims would not support a reversal. The purpose of the notice of forfeiture in the indictment is to inform the defendant that the government seeks forfeiture as a remedy.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Bare-bones pleading suffices so long as it puts the defendant on notice that the government seeks forfeiture and identifies the assets subject to forfeiture with sufficient specificity to permit the defendant to marshal evidence in their defense.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> This the indictment did by noticing that the government sought to forfeit \u201cthe interests [sic] of Rex C. Cauble in Cauble Enterprises\u201d and by listing thirteen assets included in Cauble Enterprises\u2019 holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-16\">4. Jury Instructions and Special Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"acx-dedup-0\">Cauble challenges the judge\u2019s charge to the jury and the adequacy of the special verdict form the jury completed in ordering the forfeiture. He claims that the instructions failed to inform the jury of its role in determining the scope of the defendant\u2019s interest in the enterprise, in effect directing a verdict on the extent of the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-17\">The judge explained the forfeiture allegation in the indictment to the jury, stated that the government sought to forfeit only Cauble\u2019s one-third interest in Cauble Enterprises, and re-summarized the allegations of all three RICO counts. He then read the forfeiture provision, \u00a7 1963(a), to the jury and added: \u201c[I]f you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>any of the offenses charged in Counts 1, 2 or 3 of the Indictment, it will be your duty to determine whether the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Rex C. Cauble\u2019s interest in Cauble Enterprises is subject to forfeiture to the United States.\u201d The judge also gave the jury the special forfeiture verdict.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">Before considering Cauble\u2019s claims of error, we pause to explain briefly how some of the complaints he raises can be avoided in future RICO trials. The substantive jury charge in these trials is ordinarily extremely long<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> and requires the jurors to pay close attention to a number of definitions and elements. Therefore, it is not surprising that the instructions on forfeiture, which ordinarily come at the end of the substantive charge, are often brief \u2014 perhaps excessively so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">To ease the jurors\u2019 task in determining guilt or innocence, the forfeiture issue should be withheld from them until after they have returned a general verdict. At that time the trial judge can instruct the jurors fully about forfeiture and submit the special verdict to them. Such a bifurcated trial \u2014 using, of course, only one jury \u2014 is not only convenient for the judge and fairer to the defendant. It also prevents the potential penalty of forfeiture from influencing the jurors\u2019 deliberations about guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">That practice was not followed here, but Cauble made no objection to the judge\u2019s method, instructions, or special verdict form. We, therefore, review only for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">Cauble argues that the instructions failed to inform the jury that only interests \u201cacquired or maintained\u201d in violation of \u00a7 1962 or \u201caffording a source of influence over the enterprise\u201d are subject to forfeiture. He claims that the instructions and verdict form made it appear that a RICO conviction carried a penalty of automatic forfeiture of his entire interest in Cauble Enterprises. This claim is belied, however, by the fact that the judge read \u00a7 1963(a) to the jury and, therefore, used the precise words Cauble emphasizes in defining the interest subject to forfeiture. Furthermore, the special verdict specifically asked the jury whether Cauble\u2019s interest in Cau-ble Enterprises afforded him a source of influence over the enterprise. Although the judge might have expanded the entire forfeiture charge and emphasized this point in his instructions, the charge he gave, read together with the special verdict form, accurately presented the relevant legal issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">Cauble next argues that the jury was not informed that it had to find a nexus between the racketeering activity and the property claimed. We agree that proper jury instructions should \u201cinclude language that suggests that a jury may find an interest or contractual right forfeitable if there is evidence linking the defendant\u2019s conduct to the property interest and the government has proved such a nexus beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the omission of this charge did not amount to plain error. The substantive RICO instructions required the government to prove that Cauble conducted the enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Therefore, the jury had already found beyond a reasonable doubt a link between Cauble\u2019s conduct, the enterprise, and the racketeering activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-15\">Furthermore, the second question in the special verdict form required the jury again to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Cau-ble \u201cconducted\u201d the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The jury answered the question affirmatively and, therefore, found the nexus required. The omission of the nexus instruction from the forfeiture charge was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>Cauble next claims that the charge made it impossible for the jurors to render anything but a blanket verdict of forfeiture because they were not furnished a list of Cauble Enterprises\u2019 assets so that they might forfeit only those that were the basis for Cauble\u2019s control and were not asked to determine what \u201cmanner of forfeiture\u201d would deprive him of his influence over the enterprise.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Cauble emphasizes the minor role of some of Cauble Enterprises\u2019 assets and the absence of evidence that some assets were involved at all. This argument, however, is based on an incorrect view of the operation of RICO\u2019s forfeiture provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">The RICO forfeiture is <em>in person-am: </em>a punishment imposed on a guilty defendant. It deprives that defendant of all of the assets that allow him to maintain an interest in a RICO enterprise, regardless whether those assets are themselves \u201ctainted\u201d by use in connection with the racketeering activity. Thus, in <em>United States v. Hess, </em>691 F.2d 188, 190-91 (4th Cir.1982), the court held that the jury may not find that less than the full amount of the defendant\u2019s interest in an enterprise is subject to forfeiture because \u00a7 1963 is mandatory. The court concluded that the only issues for the jury are whether the defendant violated RICO and what interest the defendant held in the enterprise.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">In <em>United States v. Huber, </em>603 F.2d 387, 396 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 927, 100 S.Ct. 1312, 63 L.Ed.2d 758 (1980), the jury was \u201crequired to specify which corporations were part of the enterprise and the percentage of [the defendant\u2019s] interest in each.\u201d The indictment in that case, however, charged an enterprise-in-fact composed of a number of corporations. Therefore, it was necessary for the jury to decide which corporations were, in fact, part of the enterprise.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-11\">In this case, however, the enterprise charged was a single pre-existing legal entity. Once Cauble was convicted his interest in that entity was subject to forfeiture in accordance with \u00a7 1963(a). The jury was not required to select only certain of that entity\u2019s assets for forfeiture, just as the jury in <em>Huber </em>was not required to determine which assets or divisions of the several corporations were subject to forfeiture.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">5. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AVaN\">Cauble\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting forfeiture reargues his claim that there is no culpable connection between Cauble\u2019s conduct and the forfeited property. For the reasons stated in our discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the substantive RICO convictions, we conclude that a reasonable jur- or might have been persuaded of such a nexus beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-13\">Cauble further argues that, even if the evidence supports a connection between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>bank accounts, assets, and entities, this proof does not justify forfeiture of Cauble\u2019s entire undivided interest in Cauble Enterprises. We reiterate that property forfeited under RICO need not be \u201cguilty.\u201d RICO forfeiture is aimed at divorcing guilty persons from the enterprises they have corrupted. A reasonable juror might have been persuaded that this task would be accomplished by forfeiting Cauble\u2019s share of Cauble Enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">6. Character of Cauble\u2019s Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-5\">Cauble finally argues that, because his general partnership interest in Cauble Enterprises is \u201cnot exercisable or transferable for value by the United States,\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> it is subject only to expiration and not to forfeiture. He argues that a forfeiture order installing the United States as general partner of Cauble Enterprises is impermissible under both the partnership articles and Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">The language in \u00a7 1962(c) on which Cauble relies has been construed only once.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> In that case we noted that the defendant\u2019s offices in various unions and employee benefit plans could not meaningfully be transferred to the United States and were, therefore, subject only to termination.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-7\">Every court that has considered the broader question what \u201cinterests\u201d are subject to forfeiture has concluded that \u00a7 1963(a) requires forfeiture of interests in the nature of ownership of or control over an enterprise.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Cauble\u2019s general partnership interest in Cauble Enterprises is a source both of ownership and control. This interest is a property interest, valuable and heritable. It is not merely a \u201cposition.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-17\">The forfeiture provision of RICO is designed to prevent a convicted defendant from being replaced by the enterprise or from exercising control over the enterprise\u2019s affairs <em>in absentia.</em><footnotemark><em>109</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>McNary, </em>the court upheld forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s partnership interest in a family-owned travel service. 620 F.2d at 622, 628-29. In <em>L\u2019Hoste, </em>we upheld forfeiture of a stockholder\u2019s interest in a corporation. 609 F.2d at 809, 812.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> There is no reason to make the effect of a forfeiture depend on the form of the enterprise\u2019s organization. Accordingly, we hold that Cauble\u2019s general partnership interest in Cauble Enterprises is forfeitable to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-18\">III. The Travel Act Counts</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-19\">Counts Four, Nine, and Ten charge Cau-ble with aiding and abetting or causing acts of travel in violation of \u00a7 1952. Count Four alleges as a violation Foster\u2019s flight from Denton to Thomasville on March 3, 1977. Count Nine alleges the Foster-Gerdes flight from Las Vegas to Denton on July 26, 1977. Count Ten alleges a flight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>from Denton to Bogata, Colombia on December 12, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">Cauble claims that Count Four is multiplicitous of the RICO predicate charging a Travel Act violation based on Foster\u2019s return flight from Thomasville to Denton. This contention is arguably waived for the reasons we have discussed above.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">The contention, if not waived, is meritless. First, each act of interstate travel constitutes a separately punishable offense.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> Second, even if this indictment in fact charged the same trip as a RICO predicate and a substantive offense, an indictment charging RICO predicates as separate offenses is not multiplicitous.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1431-7\">Cauble next contends that the indictment failed to charge an offense because it did not allege the conduct or omission constituting the violation of the law. The essential elements of a Travel Act violation are travel in interstate commerce, specific intent to promote, manage, establish, or carry on \u201cunlawful activity,\u201d or to distribute the proceeds of unlawful activity, and knowing and willful commission of an act in furtherance of that intent subsequent to the act of travel. Because the statute fully and unambiguously sets out the essential elements of the offense, indictments drafted substantially in its language are sufficient.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1431-11\">Cauble finally claims that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction on these counts. The district judge limited the jury\u2019s consideration to aiding and abetting, for the evidence demonstrated that Cauble did not travel on any of these occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-12\">Cauble argues that his conviction on Count Four cannot stand because there was no evidence he knew Foster was traveling to distribute marijuana proceeds or was involved in marijuana smuggling in 1977. A reasonable jury might, however, have believed the testimony of William McKesson that Foster told him or implied to him that Cauble knew about the smuggling activities. It could also have believed from the other evidence detailed above<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> that Cauble was associated with and participating in the venture and, by paying for tickets, loaning money, and allowing use of the airplane, was acting to make it succeed. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to convict on Count Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-13\">Cauble claims that the evidence was insufficient to convict on Count Nine because he merely furnished the airplane to Foster without knowledge that it would be used .for criminal purposes.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> He suggests that his testimony that he made repeated phone calls inquiring why Foster had not returned proves that he did not know of the activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>The jury, however, apparently chose not to believe Cauble\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> It instead seems to have believed Pilot Crownover\u2019s testimony that Cauble told him to \u201chang tight\u201d for six days. A reasonable jury might have concluded from the evidence that Cauble knew the purpose of the trip and was guilty as an aider and abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">Cauble argues that his conviction on Count Ten must be reversed because Cauble Enterprises\u2019 mere payment for a ticket, for which it was later allegedly reimbursed, is insufficient to \u201ccause\u201d an act of travel absent evidence of Cauble\u2019s knowledge of or participation in a marijuana smuggling scheme. The evidence supporting this conviction is Hawkins\u2019 testimony that Foster told him that he was going to Colombia to set up a gig, Cauble Enterprises\u2019 payment for the ticket, and its loan of $3,500 to Foster on December 10, 1976. Cauble claimed that the loan was for a vacation and that the price of the ticket was repaid.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Although the question is a close one, we conclude that a reasonable juror might infer from this evidence that Cauble knew the purpose of the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">IV. The Bank Misapplication Counts</p>\n<p id=\"aie-dedup-1\">Cauble challenges the convictions under \u00a7 656 on the ground that the indictment, fails to state an offense and the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction. Each count is predicated on a bank loan made to Charles Foster at Cauble\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">Count Five charges that Cauble willfully misapplied $37,706 of Western State Bank\u2019s funds on March 13, 1978. Count Six charges that Cauble willfully misapplied $10,000 of South Main Bank\u2019s funds on March 31, 1978. Count Seven charges that Cauble willfully misapplied $50,000 of Western State Bank\u2019s funds on May 2,1978. Count Eight charges that Cauble willfully misapplied $50,000 of South Main Bank\u2019s funds on May <em>SO, </em>1978. Each loan was ultimately repaid in full; Cauble personally guaranteed the $37,000 loan and the $50,000 South Main loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-12\">Cauble argues that the indictment fails to charge a crime because it does not allege what acts constituted the \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d subjecting him to criminal liability. The essential elements of a violation of \u00a7 656 are that the accused was a bank officer, the bank was connected in some capacity with a national bank, the accused willfully misapplied bank funds, and the accused acted with intent to injure or defraud the bank;<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> We have long held that an indictment framed in. the statutory language charges an offense under \u00a7 656 and that the term \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d is not so vague as to require supplementation by further averment.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> This claim of error is, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-13\">Cauble next claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. He contends first that consent by the bank to a loan is a defense to the charge of willful misapplication. Therefore, he urges, the board of directors\u2019 approval of the loan charged in Count Seven and the loan committee\u2019s approval of the loan charged in Count Eight compel reversal of these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>Although some eases state that the bank\u2019s consent to a loan is a complete defense to a willful misapplication charge,<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> it is not clear that consent alone is an absolute bar. Thus, in <em>Mulloney v. United States, </em>79 F.2d 566, 583 (1st Cir.1935), <em>cert. denied, </em>296 U.S. 658, 56 S.Ct. 383, 80 L.Ed. 468 (1936), the court said: \u201cIt is, no doubt, true that consent by a bank to a loan would be a defense to the crime of willful misapplication, since there could be no conversion of funds if there was a valid consent by the bank or its board of directors.\u201d The court found no valid assent, however, because a disinterested majority of the board had never approved the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">However, in a number of other cases courts have held that knowledge,<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> ratification,<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> and consent<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> are not <em>per se </em>defenses to the charge. Instead these are evidentiary matters that may be considered as part of the defense that there was either no willful misapplication or no intent to injure the bank. As the court stated in <em>United States v. Breese, </em>173 F. 402, 410 (C.C.W.D. N.C.1909), <em>aff\u2019d </em>203 F. 824 (4th Cir.1913), \u201cThe most formal vote of the board of directors could not authorize the embezzlement, abstraction, or willful misapplication of the funds of the bank.\u201d In <em>Mann, </em>we rejected the contention that the indictment must allege that the misapplication was without the consent of the bank or its directors. We stated, citing <em>Mulloney </em>and <em>United States v. Klock, </em>210 F.2d 217 (2d Cir.1954): \u201cconsent is a.matter of defense.\u201d 517 F.2d at 268. In <em>United States, v. Riley, </em>550 F.2d 233 (5th Cir.1977), the trial court excluded evidence that-the bank frequently allowed other persons to conduct business as the defendant had. We reversed the conviction, reasoning that although \u201ca general practice is not an absolute defense to criminality ... the wiser ... approach is to let the jury consider the practice in determining whether [the defendant] intended to injure and defraud the bank.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. We stated that <em>Mann </em>had \u201cimplicitly recognized\u201d th\u00e1t the jury should consider whether the bank\u2019s consent vitiated the def\u00e9ndant\u2019s intent to injure or defraud the bank and.added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-9\">The government\u2019s contention that [the defendant] was the chief executive officer of the bank and therefore could not rely on this [authorization] defense is a jury argument, not a legal one. The jury might have rejected this defense as a sham. It might have considered the alleged policy to be [the defendant\u2019s] cynical generosity to a few cronies at the expense of others, but that was for the jury to resolve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1433-10\">In <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>654 F.2d 319 (5th Cir.1981), the defendant contended that a series of loans could not constitute criminal misapplication because they were authorized by the bank\u2019s board of directors. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-11\">[W]hile valid consent by a bank\u2019s board of directors may be a defens\u00e9 to a charge of misapplication, no such board can vitiate a fraud on the bank. Thus, if the [defendants] . .. had an intent to defraud, \u201capproval of the board of directors is no longer material to whether there was a misapplication of bank funds.\u201d The jury ... found such an intent; the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>the board of directors may have reviewed the loan at some point does not absolve the [defendants] from culpability.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoU\">Patently an entire bank board, acting unanimously, could not without violating the statute invest bank funds to purchase a boatload of marijuana or make a loan secured only by a chattel mortgage on a kilogram of cocaine. Approval by the bank is a factor, indeed an important one, to be considered in deciding whether the making of the loan itself constituted a misapplication and whether a defendant had the intent to injure or defraud the bank required to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 656. But it is not a complete defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">Cauble next argues that his personal guarantee of the loans charged as misapplications in Counts Five and Eight serves as a complete defense. He contends that, because the purpose of \u00a7 656 is to protect national banks, their customers, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from losses,<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> there can be no violation of the statute when the loan is guaranteed by a solvent party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-5\">Conviction under \u00a7 656 does not require proof that the bank suffered a loss.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> But the government must demonstrate more than that the defendant was guilty of maladministration or that funds were irregularly or improperly used.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> Nonetheless, ultimate restitution is not a defense to the crime of willful misapplication because the crime is complete at the time the misapplication occurs.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> The gravamen of the offense under \u00a7 656 is the defendant\u2019s depriving the bank of \u201cits right to have custody of its funds, that is, the right to make its own decisions as to how the funds are used.\u201d <em>United States v. Dreitzler, </em>577 F.2d 539, 546 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 921, 99 S.Ct. 1246, 59 L.Ed.2d 473 (1979).<footnotemark>130</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1434-10\">Therefore, that the defendant personally guaranteed a misapplied lqan does not absolve him absolutely from criminal responsibility. The bank is deprived of custody of and control over its funds when the loan is made and remains so deprived until either the borrower or guarantor repays the money. The existence of a personal guarantee is certainly relevant in determining whether the - defendant acted with intent to injure or defraud the bank, but it does not negate such an intent as a matter of law.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>Intent in a \u00a7 656 case is \u201cbasically a question for the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> It exists if the defendant acts knowingly and the natural result of his conduct is or may be to injure the bank; there is no requirement that the accused desire the injury.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\">Here a reasonable juror might have inferred Cauble\u2019s intent to defraud from all of the circumstances. These include Foster\u2019s financial incapability<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> and mental instability;<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> the illicit purpose of the loan, which the jury might reasonably have concluded Cauble knew; Cauble\u2019s cash-poor situation and the weakness of his guarantee, given his involvement in a major smuggling operation; the diversion of the bank\u2019s assets, and Cauble\u2019s disregard for the bank\u2019s routine procedures.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> A reasonable jury might have concluded that Cauble\u2019s personal guarantee and the directors\u2019 or committee\u2019s consent was simply insufficient to negate an inference of intent from these facts.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-12\">Cauble finally argues that the jury was permitted to convict him of misapplication on a \u201creckless disregard\u201d standard. In <em>United States v. Adamson, </em>700 F.2d 953 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc), we held that the proper <em>mens rea </em>for a \u00a7 656 conviction is \u201cknowledge\u201d rather than \u201creckless disregard.\u201d We added, however: \u201cWhere sufficiency is at issue, a finding that the accused acted recklessly may be enough to sustain a jury verdict, because a jury may properly <em>infer </em>the requisite intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-13\">Although this case was tried before <em>Adamson </em>was decided, the jury instruction on intent precisely stated this standard.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> Cauble nevertheless argues that the instruction on reckless disregard permitted the jury wrongly to convict him solely because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>he authorized loans to Foster, who was emotionally unstable. This claim of error essentially asks us to reinterpret the facts and conclude that Cauble\u2019s actions were not, after all, reckless. We decline this invitation. A reasonable jury might have concluded that Cauble acted with intent to injure or defraud the banks. That is the limit of our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Cauble had a fair trial. Trial counsel was able and diligent. The trial court\u2019s rulings were considered and impartial. After appraising the post-conviction attack on virtually every aspect of the complex proceeding, we are satisfied that the indictment properly charged offenses punishable under the laws of the United States, and that the evidence sufficed to persuade a reasonable jury. Its verdict is, in the ancient words, the verdict of the country. The judgment of conviction and forfeiture entered on that verdict is, accordingly, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">.
