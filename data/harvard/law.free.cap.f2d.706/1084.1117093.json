App.P. 34(a); Tenth Circuit R. 10(e). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-28\">James Cook, Thomas Heggy, and Lloyd Grambling (appellants), defendants below, appeal from a judgment denying their motion filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988 to set a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be taxed as costs against John Campbell (Campbell), plaintiff below. At all times relevant hereto Campbell, a black, was a sergeant in the Oklahoma City police department, Cook was the city manager of Oklahoma City, and Heggy and Grambling were, respectively, the police chief and assistant police chief of Oklahoma City.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>During the latter part of 1979 and early 1980 Campbell, in addition to his duties as a sergeant for the Oklahoma City police department, worked on an off duty basis in providing security for a number of apartment complexes owned by Champion Financial Corp. (Champion). In so doing, Campbell employed a number of junior officers employed by the police department to provide on-site security for the apartment complexes for which the officers would receive free housing at the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">In hiring the junior officers, Campbell requested, and received, a fee of $50 or $75 from the officers which Campbell stated would be paid to Champion for processing their applications and for apartment preparations. When several officers questioned Champion as to the necessity of the fee, they were informed that Champion had not required such a fee and that Campbell had not been authorized to charge a fee. Several officers thereafter filed complaints against Campbell with the Oklahoma City police department alleging that Campbell had violated the police code of ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">After an initial, routine review by the internal affairs section of the police department, and a hearing before the police disciplinary review board (board), the board determined that: Campbell had acquired money from junior officers under false pretenses; Campbell had conducted his private security business while on duty and had used police department property and equipment in the process. The board recommended that Campbell be demoted to patrolman and placed on one year\u2019s probation. This recommendation was forwarded to Heggy as police chief. Heggy accepted the recommendation and ordered Campbell demoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">Campbell subsequently appealed the board\u2019s decision to the city personnel grievance committee. After a hearing, the committee determined that although Campbell had made certain misrepresentations to the junior officers, the board\u2019s proposed demotion and one year\u2019s probation was too severe. The committee, accordingly, recommended that Campbell retain the rank of sergeant but at a lower pay grade. This recommendation was sent to Cook as city manager, who ordered that Campbell be reinstated to the rank of sergeant at a lower pay grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">Thereafter, Campbell brought an action under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 against appellants alleging that the disciplinary action taken against him was predicated solely on the basis of his race. In accordance with 51 O.S.A. \u00a7 162,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the municipal counselor of Oklahoma City entered an appearance on behalf of appellants and assumed their defense. The case was tried to a jury during the course of which Campbell testified that he felt he had been discriminated against. Campbell acknowledged that he had obtained a fee from several junior officers by misrepresentation and that he had utilized city equipment and property while on duty to conduct his private security business. After brief deliberations the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of appellants. After the verdict was returned, the district court observed that the action was totally without merit and that it should never have been pursued. Within its judgment the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-14\">It is Ordered and Adjudged that the plaintiff take nothing, that judgment is rendered in favor of the defendants on the merits, and that defendants recover of the plaintiff their costs of action, the amount of which to be determined by the Court at a later date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-15\">[R., Vol. I at p. 41].</p>\n<p id=\"Ap9\">Appellants thereafter moved for attorney fees. The motion stated, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-17\">COMES NOW the defendants, James Cook, Tom Heggy and Lloyd Grambling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>by and through their attorney of record, Daniel T. Brummitt, Assistant Municipal Counselor, and respectfully move this Honorable Court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, to set a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be taxed as costs against the plaintiff, John Campbell, and to be paid to The City of Oklahoma City as indemnitor to the named defendants herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-4\">The defendants are the prevailing parties in this litigation by way of jury verdict rendered on April 22, 1981 and are therefore entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as a part of the taxable costs of this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-5\">WHEREFORE, defendants pray that the Court examine the documents filed in support of this motion and set a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in the amount of $1850.00 to be taxed as costs against the plaintiff John Campbell to be paid to The City of Oklahoma City along with such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">[R., Yol. I at p. 42],</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">The district court overruled appellants\u2019 motion, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-8\">The Motion To Set Reasonable Attorney Fees by the Defendant in the above styled case is hereby overruled. Even though the trial judge considered the suit of the Plaintiff frivolous, the City of Oklahoma City was not a party in interest and Title 51 Section 162 of the Oklahoma Statutes had no application in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">[R., Vol. i at p. 55],</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">On appeal appellants contend that the City of Oklahoma City as the statutory indemnitor of the appellants may recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees taxed as costs under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988 where they were the prevailing defendants in a 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. action in which the court specifically found the action to be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">Within his response Campbell contends that: the award of attorney fees is totally within the discretion of the court; the City of Oklahoma City was not a party to the action, did not seek to become a party by intervention and, accordingly, is not allowed to recover attorney fees; and, since he received a notice of a right to sue from the Justice Department, if his suit was groundless or frivolous, the United States is responsible for the payment of any attorney fees to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">Under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988, \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d A prevailing defendant, however, may be awarded attorney fees only when the plaintiff\u2019s underlying claim is \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\u201d <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980); <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978); <em>Glass v. Pfeffer, </em>657 F.2d 252 (10th Cir. 1981); <em>Prochaska v. Marcoux, </em>632 F.2d 848 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied </em>451 U.S. 984, 101 S.Ct. 2316, 68 L.Ed.2d 841 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">This standard was repronounced in <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) in which the court, citing to <em>Christiansburg, supra, </em>opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-15\">To take the further step of assessing attorney\u2019s fees against plaintiffs simply because they do not finally prevail would substantially add to the risks inhering in most litigation and would undercut the efforts of Congress to promote the vigorous enforcement of the provisions of Title VII. Hence, a plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees unless a court finds that his claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-16\">449 U.S. at pp. 14-15, 101 S.Ct. at p. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-17\">Once a determination has been made that a defendant, as a prevailing party, is entitled to attorney fees, the fact that his legal representation was undertaken by a public service firm or association is irrelevant. <em>Love </em>v. <em>Mayor, City of Cheyenne, Wyoming, </em>620 F.2d 235 (10th Cir.1980); <em>Watkins v. Mobile Housing Board, </em>632 F.2d 565 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Leeds </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>630 F.2d 674 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Brown v. Stanton, </em>617 F.2d 1224 (7th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>It is uncontested that appellants were the prevailing parties herein and that the district court considered Campbell\u2019s suit frivolous. Under such circumstances we hold the district court erred in overruling appellants\u2019 motion for attorney fees. The fact that appellants\u2019 motion requested that the attorney\u2019s fee be paid to the City of Oklahoma City is of no moment, when, as here, appellants properly moved for attorney fees as prevailing parties in an action found to be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Upon remand, the district court shall review appellants\u2019 request for attorney fees to determine their reasonableness. <em>Higgins v. State of Oklahoma, et al., </em>642 F.2d 1199 (10th Cir.1981). The fees to be awarded appellants must be in line with those traditionally received from fee paying clients, <em>Gurule v. Wilson, </em>635 F.2d, 782 (10th Cir. 1980), and should not be lower than those customarily paid to private practitioners. <em>Dennis v. Chang, </em>611 F.2d 1302 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">The parties shall pay their respective costs and attorney fees on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">. 51 O.S.A. \u00a7 162 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-10\">A.
