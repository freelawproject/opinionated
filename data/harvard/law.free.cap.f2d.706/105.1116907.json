Diamond appeals from the November 22, 1982, judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York (David N. Edelstein, Judge) entered upon a plea of guilty to participating in an interstate conspiracy to defraud commodities investors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u00a7 371 (1976), and to making an interstate telephone call in furtherance of the conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (1976). The District Court sentenced Diamond to a term of one year and one day of imprisonment to be followed by two years of probation. Diamond challenges his sentence, claiming that the Government violated its plea-bargaining agreement by presenting the District Court with a sentencing memorandum that implicitly recommended a sentence of imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In its plea agreement with Diamond, the United States Attorney promised not to \u201crecommend any specific sentence to the sentencing judge,\u201d but reserved the right to inform the sentencing judge of \u201c(1) this agreement; (2) the nature and extent of Diamond\u2019s activities with respect to these cases; (3) the full nature and extent of Diamond\u2019s cooperation with this Office and the date when such cooperation commenced; and (4) all other information in its possession relevant to sentence.\u201d Prior to sentencing, the Government presented the District Court with a sentencing memorandum containing the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ait\">[Diamond] teamed up with others ... to commit an enormous fraud. Their lies cost innocent victims over $1,000,000 out of pocket and tore deeply into the moral fabric of our society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">In imposing sentence in these cases the government respectfully urges the Court to consider the need for both specific and general deter[r]ence, since many boiler-room operators who have had connection with these defendants will look to their sentences when contemplating their own possible criminal acts. In addition, we urge the Court to consider the need for punishment, since the damage inflicted by these defendants on the investing public was so substantial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Before sentence was imposed, Diamond\u2019s trial counsel complained to the District Court that the Government had violated its plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Cor-sentino, </em>685 F.2d 48 (2d Cir.1982). The Government, while denying any violation, offered Diamond the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea if it had been entered on the basis of a misunderstanding about the plea agreement. The District Court gave Diamond a week to consider this option. When Diamond declined to withdraw his guilty plea but persisted in contending that the Government had breached its agreement, the District Court issued a memorandum opinion ruling that the Government\u2019s sentencing memorandum did not violate the plea agreement. 550 F. Supp. 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The question raised on this appeal is whether the Government\u2019s conduct in this case is consistent with the standard recently set forth by this Court in <em>United States v. Corsentino, supra. </em>In <em>Corsentino, </em>we ruled that a plea bargain containing a Government commitment to \u201ctake no position\u201d at sentencing must be strictly observed, and such an agreement was violated when a prosecutor opposed the defendant\u2019s request for a sentence that permitted early parole eligibility. We noted, however, that if the Government wishes to refrain only from recommending a specific sentence, the prosecutor should make that limited commitment clear in the plea agreement and retain the right \u201cto present facts and arguments bearing upon sentencing,\u201d 685 F.2d at 51, or use other words to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Although the Government drafted its plea agreement with Diamond several months before <em>Corsentino </em>was decided, the agreement and the prosecutor\u2019s conduct at sentencing comports with the <em>Corsentino </em>standard. The Government promised not to recommend \u201cany specific sentence\u201d in this case, but reserved the right to present the trial court with \u201crelevant information\u2019-\u2019 at sentencing. No specific sentence was recommended, and the substance of the sentencing memorandum was \u201crelevant\u201d to the sentencing decision. Perhaps clarity would have been increased if the prosecutor had explicitly retained the right to present \u201cargument\u201d in addition to \u201cinformation,\u201d but in the circumstances of this case we do not think the distinction amounts to a breach of the plea bargain. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>565 F.2d 1273 (3d Cir.1977) (per cu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>riam), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 959, 98 S.Ct. 3076, 57 L.Ed.2d 1125 (1978). The adverse information the prosecutor reserved the right to present inevitably carried with it an implied argument in favor of a significant sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
