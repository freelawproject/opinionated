We also upheld the seizure of $38,394<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found in White\u2019s apartment because the arresting Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents could reasonably have believed that the money was the fruit of prior heroin sales and consisted in part of pre-recorded government funds. However, we left open the question whether the search of White\u2019s apartment was lawful (660 F.2d at 1184 and n. 8) and remanded the case for such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-26\">Since the episode in question is fully described in our prior opinion, we will only repeat facts sufficient for disposition of White\u2019s motion for return of the $38,394 under Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Criminal Procedure, which was renewed in the Government\u2019s forfeiture suit after we disposed of the prior app\u00e9al. The search in question took place on March 11,1980, when Chicago police officers and DEA agents arrived at the apartment house at 4732- West Washington Street, Chicago. On this occasion, White and co-defendants Rogers and Council were arrested. While all three defendants were in the first-floor apartment, White agreed to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Shortly afterwards on the back porch of that apartment, he gave consent to Sergeant Cline of the Chicago Police Department and DEA agent Gallagher to search his third-floor apartment for heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Thereafter, Cline, Gallagher and other officers knocked on the door of the' third-floor apartment and told Zenobia Anderson, who identified herself as White\u2019s wife, that White had been arrested on narcotics charges and had consented to a search of the apartment which' he and Anderson shared. After they entered the apartment to commence their search, Cline asked Anderson if there was any money, jewelry or any similar expensive item in the apartment. She replied that there was some money in the closet and pointed to a flight bag there. When Cline picked up- the bag and asked Anderson how much was in it, she told him $40,000. The bag was then opened in the kitchen and found to contain $42,194 in cash, including the pre-recorded government f\u00fcnds used in prior purchases of heroin by government employees. In the same eloset the agents discovered stolen \u25a0property, narcotics paraphernalia and approximately ten guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">In its May 28,1982, memorandum opinion and supplemental opinion of June 9, 1982, 541 F.Supp. 1114, 1119 (N.D.Ill.), the district court held that although White consented to the search of the apartment, the search of the travel bag and the seizure of the currency were unlawful; he therefore granted White\u2019s motion for return of the property. The court also dismissed as moot the government\u2019s civil forfeiture action under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 which permits the government to retain moneys used in exchange for narcotics. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">\n<em>Voluntariness of Consent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Defendant has cross-appealed as to the district court\u2019s finding that White\u2019s consent to search the third-floor apartment was voluntary. Judge Shadur found the following factors persuasive:</p>\n<p id=\"AYcQ\">First, in addition to permitting the search, White waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights though his co-conspirators did not under identical conditions. Second, the consent took place during a quiet conversation on the back porch. Matters would have been very different had White been asked to consent just after the arrest in the living room, while he was faced by 12 agents,,many with guns drawn. Finally, White has a long arrest record and has been in similar situations before. As part of the congeries of factors, those items particularly demonstrate White was able to choose voluntarily whether to let the agents undertake the search. 541 F.Supp. at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">These factors are sufficient to support the district court\u2019s conclusion of voluntariness. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 424-425, 96 S.Ct. 820, 828, 46 L.Ed.2d 598; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>475 F.2d 723, 730-731 (5th Cir.1973), certiorari denied, 414 U.S. 841, 94 S.Ct. 96, 38 L.Ed.2d 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">To support his coercion argument, White relies primarily upon <em>United States v. Gillespie, </em>650 F.2d 127 (7th Cir.1981) (per cu-riam), certiorari denied,-U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 3495, 73 L.Ed.2d 1374. However, there five FBI agents and police officers with drawn shotguns and revolvers confronted Gillespie at his door, stating that they were looking for fugitives. In contrast, White gave his consent with no guns being drawn, while conversing on a back porch with two officers and after waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">Our decision in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Jaramillo, </em>637 F.2d 1094 (7th Cir.1980), certiorari denied, 449 U.S. 862, 101 S.Ct. 166, 66 L.Ed.2d 79 is also inapt because that defendant\u2019s consent was the result of an illegal detention and, as then Judge Tone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>stressed in his concurring opinion, defendant had been roused out of bed naked in his darkened bedroom by an agent with a flashlight and a gun, and his consent to search his suitcases was obtained while he was surrounded by agents already searching the apartment. No such factors were present here. Therefore, we uphold Judge Shadur\u2019s voluntariness ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">\n<em>Intent of Searching Officers Is Not Controlling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The government challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the search of the flight bag was invalid. According to the district court, White consented to let the agent search his third-floor apartment for heroin. Officer Cline, however, did not start the search until after asking Zenobia Anderson whether there was any money, jewelry or anything expensive in the apartment. This led the district court to invalidate the search because \u201cit was Cline\u2019s specific subjective intent to search for money,\u201d which went beyond the scope of White\u2019s consent, 541 F.Supp. at 1118. But the, \u201csubjective intent\u201d standard was rejected in <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 138, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 where the Supreme Court established \u201ca standard of objective reasonableness without regard to the underlying intent or the motivation of the officers involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Applying this standard, we hold Cline\u2019s subjective intent to be immaterial. White consented to a search for narcotics, and the district court found that it would have been reasonable to think that heroin could be hidden in the flight bag. White\u2019s consent to search therefore extended to the flight bag. In the search for narcotics, the flight bag would of course have been opened, disclosing the cash, so that the \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d of the <em>Scott </em>test was satisfied. The situation is therefore unlike <em>United States v. Dichiarinte, </em>445 F.2d 126 (7th Cir.1971), where we held that it was proper for government agents to-look through defendant\u2019s personal papers to discover hidden narcotics but disapproved their reading and seizing those papers as an intrusion upon his right of privacy. In contrast to <em>Dichiarinte, </em>the search of White\u2019s flight bag constituted no greater privacy intrusion than what was authorized by his consent to a search for narcotics. Since the officers could reasonably consider that heroin was in the flight bag, the search of the bag was within the scope of White\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Instead of being controlled by <em>Dichi-arinte, </em>this case resembles the more recent case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scherer, </em>673 F.2d 176 (7th Cir.1982), certiorari denied, 457 U.S. 1120, 102 S.Ct. 2935, 73 L.Ed.2d 1334. There a government agent and an informer posed as cousins and were given permission to look around defendant\u2019s grounds and barn for wood to build duck blinds. The agent knew before the visit that two Thompson submachine guns were lying in the barn. Despite that knowledge and the deception used to gain consent, we upheld the search although the consent had been limited to wood. White has not attempted to reconcile this case with <em>Scherer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">We note Justice Stevens\u2019 statement in <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 820, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2170, 72 L.Ed.2d 572, that \u201c[a] lawful search of fixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility that separate acts of entry or opening may be required to complete the search.\u201d Here the consensual search of the third-floor apartment extended to the entire area, including the flight bag in which narcotics could be found. It would be an absurd result to invalidate this seizure because of Cline\u2019s remark that he was looking for cash, since the money would have been shortly discovered anyway in the course of the agents\u2019 valid search for narcotics in the third-floor apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">The district court\u2019s orders granting White\u2019s Criminal Rule 41(e) motion and dismissing the government\u2019s forfeiture action are reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-27\">. The total amount seized was $42,194 but $3,800 of that amount consisted of pre-record-ed funds belonging to the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
