(\u201cUPS\u201d) had committed certain unfair labor practices under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-169 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981) (\u201cAct\u201d). The Board held that UPS had violated section 8(a)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1976), by promulgating, maintaining, and enforcing an unlawfully broad no-distribution of literature rule. It also held that UPS had violated sections 8(a)(1), 8(a)(3), and 8(a)(4) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4) (1976), by unlawfully discharging Robert W. Bowlds and David E. Perkins, two UPS employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">This action is a petition for review and a cross-application for enforcement of that order. For the- reasons stated herein we will enforce in part, and we will remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">\n<em>A. Driver Robert Bowlds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AF4\">Bowlds was originally hired by UPS in 1965. For the six or seven years prior to the instant unfair labor proceeding, he worked as a \u201cfeeder driver\u201d out of UPS\u2019s Owensboro, Kentucky facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bowlds also served as the Teamsters Local 89 steward at the Owensboro terminal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his position as steward Bowlds filed grievances, participated in grievance hearings, and assisted the Professional Drivers Council (\u201cPROD\u201d), a Teamsters\u2019 organization. Since 1975 Bowlds had also been a member of \u201cUPSurge,\u201d a nationwide organization of UPS employees dedicated to improving their wages, hours, and working conditions. Bowlds testified that he had been openly involved with both UPSurge and PROD at the Owensboro terminal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and had distributed their literature in the presence of UPS supervisors. App. at 413a-15a, 419a-23a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-13\">Bowlds had a running history of disputes with UPS. On April 24, 1978, UPS discharged Bowlds, assertedly because he falsified his timecard and overextended his rest breaks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 8, 1978, as a result of a contractual grievance proceeding, Bowlds was reinstated, and the discharge was converted into a suspension. On May 24, 1978, Bowlds was issued a \u201cfinal warning\u201d for taking excessive time on his breaks. That warning was rescinded on June 14,-1978, also after a grievance proceeding. On August 4, 1978, UPS discharged Bowlds for a second time, again asserting that he had overextended his breaks and falsified his timecard. On October 3, 1978, a grievance panel reduced the discharge to a \u201cDisciplinary Suspension and Final Warning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-14\">Both the May 24, 1978 final warning letter and the August 4, 1978 discharge were the subject of an unfair labor practice proceeding brought by the General Counsel against UPS. The Board held that those actions violated sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act. <em>United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>252 N.L.R.B. 1015, 1019 (1980), <em>enforced, </em>677 F.2d 421 (6th Cir.1982) (\u201c <em>United Parcel Service f\u2019).</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Board issued a cease and desist order, awarded Bowlds back pay, and ordered the May 24, 1978 warning letter expunged from his file. <em>United Parcel Service I, </em>252 N.L.R.B. at 1016, 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-15\">UPS claims that in July and August of 1979 it again became concerned about Bowlds\u2019 consistent late arrival at the Ow-ensboro Center. The Company decided to observe Bowlds on the night of August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>27-28 during one of his normally scheduled runs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the supervisors who trailed him, Bowlds overstayed his allotted rest periods on that run by forty-three minutes. On the next night the Company suspended Bowlds allegedly for overextending his breaks and falsifying his timecard. Three days later UPS informed Bowlds that he was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">\n<em>B. Driver David Perkins</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-t\">Perkins has been employed at UPS\u2019s Campbellsville, Kentucky facility as a feeder driver since 1971 and, like Bowlds, has actively been involved with union activity. He testified that he had openly distributed UPSurge and PROD material at Campbells-ville several times, and that he had collected money and solicited signatures for the class action suit brought by Bowlds against UPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">On February 14, 1979, Perkins filed a grievance protesting UPS\u2019s alleged failure to assign him sufficient work. That grievance was resolved against him. App. at 90a; 648a \u2014 50a. Perkins testified that two weeks later he had a conversation with Tom Mouser, the Campbellsville Terminal Manager, about obtaining some work pants. According to Perkins, Mouser stated: \u201cPerkins, we\u2019re trying to figure out a way to fire your ass anyway. We won\u2019t have to get you any.\u201d App. at 652a. That statement was made in front of two other employees, Bobby Pierce and Eddy O\u2019Banion, who both corroborated Perkins\u2019 version of events. App. at 150a; 224a-25a, 234a-35a, 652a-53a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Perkins also stated that in February or March of 1979, Mouser approached him at the Campbellsville facility and brought up the subject of UPSurge. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqbC\">[Mouser] asked me if I had been distributing some papers around Campbells-ville, and I said yes. And I told him we had the right to as long as the man wasn\u2019t on the clock working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-11\">And he responded, \u201cWell, I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">App. at 643a. At the time Mouser made his statement, Perkins was not distributing literature. Perkins testified that despite Mouser\u2019s statement, he continued to distribute UPSurge material at least two more times- over the next few months. App. at 644a \u2014 15a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-13\">UPS contends that throughout the summer of 1979, Perkins habitually returned late to Campbellsville after completing his regularly scheduled route. In conjunction with its observation of Bowlds, UPS decided to observe Perkins on the night of August 27-28. Company supervisors testified that they followed Perkins to a rest stop where they observed him overstay his rest break. On the next evening Perkins\u2019 supervisor told him that he was suspended for overextending his rest break and falsifying his timecard. On August 30, 1979, Perkins was formally told that he was being discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-14\">\n<em>C. The Grievance Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">Both Bowlds and Perkins filed grievances over their discharges under the grievance procedures in their union contract. An initial meeting was held on Bowlds\u2019 grievance on September 11, 1979. Bowlds\u2019 grievance was read into the record,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Bowlds stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>ed that he was innocent of the UPS\u2019s charges. UPS presented testimony supporting its claim that Bowlds had overextended his breaks and falsified his timecard. The panel deadlocked, and the grievance was referred to the state level. The grievance was heard before the state panel on October 9,1979, but the parties again deadlocked. On October 30,1979, the Joint Area Conference heard Bowlds\u2019 grievance but the parties again were unable to resolve the dispute. Finally on November 20,1979, the grievance was placed on the Joint Area Conference\u2019s \u201cDeadlocked Agenda,\u201d and after a hearing Bowlds\u2019 discharge was upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Perkins\u2019 grievance was also initially heard on September 11, 1979. A UPS supervisor testified that Perkins had been observed taking a thirty-two minute break although his timecard only reflected a fifteen minute break. Perkins\u2019 grievance was read,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and two affidavits were submitted in his defense. The hearing was deadlocked, and Perkins\u2019 grievance was referred to the state level. After a hearing before the state panel, Perkins was granted immediate reinstatement without backpay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">Following their discharges both Bowlds and Perkins filed charges with the Board\u2019s Regional Director claiming that UPS had unlawfully discriminated against them because of their protected activities. On October 24, 1979, the Regional Director issued a consolidated complaint charging UPS with unfair labor practices. The complaint alleged that UPS had violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act by unlawfully promulgating and enforcing a rule prohibiting distribution of UPSurge\u2019s written material on UPS property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Order Consolidating Cases, Consolidated Complaint and Notice of Hearing 15, 9, 11, app. at 3a, 4a. It also alleged that UPS had violated sections 8(a)(1), 8(a)(3), and 8(a)(4) of the Act by unlawfully discharging Bowlds and Perkins. <em>Id. </em>at H 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, app. at 3a, 4a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">An Administrative Law Judge held hearings and issued a decision on October 3, 1980. He initially determined that the General Counsel\u2019s complaint should not be dismissed on <em>Spielberg </em>deferral grounds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Turning to the merits he found that in February and March of 1979, UPS had promulgated, maintained, and enforced an \u201cambiguous\u201d written rule prohibiting distribution of literature on UP\u2019S property at any time. The ALJ found that Mouser enforced this rule, pointing specifically to Mouser\u2019s statement of \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t do it,\u201d made to Perkins concerning the distribution of UPSurge material. App. at 156a-57a.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>Based on. these facts the ALJ held that UPS had violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Turning to the discharges of Bowlds and Perkins, the ALJ found not credible the supervisors\u2019 testimony that Bowlds and Perkins had overextended their breaks. App. at 160a, 162a. He determined that, as a general matter, late returns by Bowlds and Perkins were due to delays in getting out of other terminals. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ also found that Bowlds and Perkins had been singled out for \u201cextraordinary surveillance\u201d because of their union activity. <em>Id. </em>While the ALJ did find some discrepancies on the two employees\u2019 timecards, he held that they were of a \u201cminor nature.\u201d App. at 162a.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak5C\">The ALJ concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-6\">In the instant case, I have found that the General Counsel made a <em>prima facie </em>showing sufficient to support the inference that protected conduct was the motivating factor in the suspension and discharges of Bowlds and Perkins, and in my view the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that such actions would have taken place in the absence of the protected conduct. In accordance therewith, the Respondent is in violation of sections 8(a)(1), (3), and (4) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">App. at 163a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">UPS filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision on December 12, 1980. On May 21, 1982, the Board issued a decision and order adopting the findings and conclusions of the ALJ. <em>United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>261 N.L. R.B. No. 134 (1982) (\u201c <em>United Parcel Service II\u201d). </em>The Board, however, slightly changed the basis for its finding of an 8(a)(1) violation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-9\">In affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Sec. 8(a)(1) of the Act by promulgating, maintaining, and enforcing an unlawfully broad no-distribution rule, we refer solely to the implied restrictions against distribution on nonworking time</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajz-dedup-0\">which Supervisor Mouser communicated to employee Perkins in a February or March 1979 conversation. We find no need to decide whether Respondent\u2019s written no-solicitation, no distribution rules also violated Sec. 8(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 2 n. 3. The Board specifically upheld the ALJ\u2019s \u201cbroad\u201d remedial order that the Company cease and desist \u201cin any like or related manner\u201d from interfering with employees\u2019 section 7 rights. The Board found that the award was warranted because \u201cRespondent has shown a proclivity to violate the Act and has engaged in such egregious and widespread misconduct as to demonstrate a general disregard for the employees\u2019 fundamental Sec. 7 rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 n. 4; <em>see NLRB </em>v. <em>Local 483 and Local 11, </em>672 F.2d 1159, 1168 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-14\">UPS filed a petition to review the Board\u2019s decision on July 8,1982. The Board filed a cross-application for enforcement on August 17, 1982.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-15\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-16\"><em>A. \u25a0 The Section 8(a)(1).Violation </em>\u2014 Distri<em>bution of UPSurge Literature</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASEM\">UPS contends that we should not enforce the Board\u2019s order holding that UPS violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act. First UPS asserts that Mouser\u2019s statement, relied upon by the Board for its finding of a section 8(a)(1) violation, was not part of the General Counsel\u2019s consolidated complaint nor the basis for the ALJ\u2019s decision. UPS claims that the Board\u2019s \u201celeventh hour modification\u201d of the issue prejudiced it from properly asserting a defense to the Board\u2019s charges because at the evidentiary hearings it focused its efforts on disproving the alleged written policy rather than on rebutting any alleged individual coercion by Mouser. The Board claims that UPS did have adequate notice of the charges against it. It argues that paragraphs 5(c) and 9 of the consolidated complaint<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> adequately in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>formed UPS of the allegation that Mouser\u2019s statement violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">Both the Administrative Procedure Act and the Board\u2019s own rules require that a complaint properly inform a charged party of any asserted violation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(b)(3) (1976); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.15 (1982).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThe Board may not make findings or order remedies on violations not charged in the General Counsel\u2019s complaint or litigated in the subsequent hearing.\u201d <em>George Banta Co. v. NLRB, </em>686 F.2d 10, 17 (D.C.Cir.1982) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Blake Construction Co., </em>663 F.2d 272, 279 (D.C.Cir. 1981) (citing cases)), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>51 U.S.L.W. 3554 (U.S. Jan. 10, 1983) (No. 82-1162); <em>see Soule Glass and Glazing Co. v. NLRB, </em>652 F.2d 1055, 1073-75 (1st Cir. 1981). Even where evidence supporting a remedial order is in the record, courts have refused to grant enforcement of a Board order in the absence of either a supporting allegation in the complaint or a meaningful opportunity to litigate the underlying issue before the ALJ. <em>See, e.g., Blake </em>663 F.2d at 279; <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>385 F.2d 760, 763-64 (8th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Although the thrust of the original complaint was that UPS\u2019s written policy violated the Act, it specifically referred to the actions Mouser took in March of 1979 to enforce the no-distribution rule. More importantly, UPS had a meaningful opportunity to litigate the issue of whether Mouser actually made the alleged statement or, if made, whether the statement was coercive. On direct examination by UPS, Mouser specifically denied that he had ever made the disputed statement to Perkins. App. at 1015a-16a. In reaching its conclusions, the Board merely accepted the AU\u2019s findings crediting Perkins\u2019 testimony over Mouser\u2019s. <em>United Parcel Service II, </em>261 N.L.R.B. No. 134, at 2 n. 2; <em>see </em>app. at 156 n. 14. Based on this record we find that UPS had sufficient notice about Mouser\u2019s statement to defend adequately the charge that that statement constituted a section 8(a)(1) violation under the Act and therefore was not unduly prejudiced by the Board\u2019s holding, <em>cf. Soule, </em>652 F.2d at 1074 (test is one of fairness under the circumstances of each case).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-18\">UPS\u2019s second argument against enforcement is that the Board\u2019s conclusion that Mouser\u2019s statement violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act is not supported by substantial evidence. UPS asserts that Mouser\u2019s \u201cinnocuous\u201d statement should not be considered coercive because the utterance was extremely short and because there is no evidence that it was made in a threatening tone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-19\">Section 8(a)(1) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section [7] of this title.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1976). To establish a violation of that section, \u201cit need only be shown that <em>\u2018under the circumstances existing, </em>[the employer\u2019s conduct] may reasonably tend to coerce or intimidate employees in the exercise of rights protected under the Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States Steel Corp. v. NLRB, </em>682 F.2d 98, 101 (3d Cir.1982) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Armcor Industries, Inc., </em>535 F.2d 239, 242 (3d Cir.1976) (quoting <em>Local 542 v. NLRB, </em>328 F.2d 850, 852-53 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>379 U.S. 826, 85 S.Ct. 52, 13 L.Ed.2d 35 (1964)); see <em>NLRB v. Keystone Pretzel Bakery, Inc., </em>696 F.2d 257, 259-60 (3d Cir. 1982) (en banc). Our standard of review is whether there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole, including any evidence detracting from the Board\u2019s view, to support the Board\u2019s finding of a violation. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>United States Steel Corp., </em>682 F.2d at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">In affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination that UPS violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act, the Board relied solely on Mouser\u2019s statement to Perkins that he would \u201crather not\u201d have Perkins distribute literature. 261 N.L. R.B. No. 134, at 2 n. 3. We have recently held that where an incident of alleged interference with the distribution of literature is trivial and isolated and only imposes a negligible burden on employees\u2019 rights, it will not rise to the level of a violation of the Act. <em>Graham Architectural Products Corp. v. NLRB, </em>697 F.2d 534, 542 (3d Cir.1983). The Board argues that Mouser\u2019s statement is not an isolated comment but rather part of a long-standing pattern of restraining the distribution of literature during nonworking time. It asserts that when Mouser\u2019s statement is examined against the \u201cbackdrop of .. . hostility\u201d to section 7 rights, it should be considered coercive and therefore violative of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Viewing all the circumstances, we hold that substantial evidence exists in the record to uphold the Board\u2019s finding of a section 8(a)(1) violation. It is true that Mouser\u2019s statement, on its face, could be considered noneoercive. Perkins, however, had recently filed a grievance against Mouser and UPS. App. at 648a-50a; <em>see </em>app. at 90a. On February 28, 1979, in the presence of two other employees, Mouser said to Perkins \u201cwe\u2019re trying to figure out a way to fire your ass.\u201d App. at 150a; 652a. The ALJ took official notice that the Board had previously determined that UPS and its supervisors had engaged in various unfair labor practices, in connection with UPS\u2019s opposition to employee involvement with UPSurge. App. at 142a-43a. In light of these facts we think that the record supports the Board\u2019s finding that Mouser\u2019s statement tended to impose unlawful restrictions on Perkins\u2019 right to distribute literature.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s holding that the statement violated section 8(a)(1).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\"><em>B. The Sections 8(a)(1), 8(a)(3), and 8(a)(4) Violations </em>\u2014 The <em>Discharges of Bowlds and Perkins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">UPS urges us to reject the Board\u2019s conclusion that the discharges of Bowlds and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Perkins violated sections 8(a)(1), 8(a)(3),4 <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and 8(a)(4)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of the Act. First, it argues that the Board abused its discretion by refusing to defer to the grievance panel decisions concerning the discharges of Bowlds and Perkins. Second, it argues that if we find that the Board properly exercised its jurisdiction, we should not enforce the Board\u2019s order because the General Counsel failed to meet its threshold burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of unlawful discrimination. Finally, it argues that, even assuming establishment of a <em>prima facie </em>case, the Board\u2019s order can not be enforced because the ALJ erroneously shifted to UPS the burden of proving that the discharges were not discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">\n<em>1.

The General Counsel\u2019s Prima Facie Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\">UPS contends that even if the Board properly refused to defer to the grievance panel\u2019s decision, we should not enforce the Board\u2019s order. It asserts that the General Counsel, when presenting his case to the ALJ, failed to meet his threshold burden of making a <em>prima facie </em>showing of unlawful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, the General Counsel must present sufficient evidence to support the inference that protected conduct was a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s decision. <em>Behring International, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>675 F.2d 83, 88, 90 (3d Cir.1982), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>51 U.S. L.W. 3199 (U.S. Sept. 13,1982) (No. 82-438). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aek-dedup-1\">[T]he prima facie case \u201craises an inference of discrimination only because we presume these acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors.\u201d Establishment of the prima facie case in effect creates a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee. If the trier of fact believes the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and if the employer is silent in the face of the presumption, the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff because no issue of fact remains in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUu\"><em>Id. </em>at 254, 101 S.Ct. at 1094 (quoting <em>Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978)) (footnote omitted). The burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case is not onerous. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. at 1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">We do not think that the ALJ erred in holding that the General Counsel established a <em>prima facie </em>case of unlawful discrimination. The General Counsel produced evidence that UPS knew that Bowlds and Perkins were involved in widespread protected activity, including organizing efforts for UPSurge. The General Counsel also presented evidence that Bowlds and Perkins, at the time of their discharges, were involved in another unfair labor practice proceeding concerning alleged discrimination for union activity. Bowlds and Perkins both testified that, contrary to reports by UPS\u2019s supervisors, they did not overextend their breaks on the night of August 27-28. Evidence corroborating their testimony was introduced by the General Counsel.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Those facts are sufficient to support an inference that UPS discharged Bowlds and Perkins for their protected activities. Accordingly, we hold that the General Counsel met his threshold burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">\n<em>3. The Burden of Proof Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AKp\">UPS\u2019s final contention is that, assuming establishment of a <em>prima facie </em>case, the ALJ improperly shifted to UPS the burden of proving that Bowlds and Perkins would have been discharged regardless of their protected activity. In <em>Behring International, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>we outlined the appropriate burdens of going forward and of proof to be applied in a discriminatory discharge case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-10\">Under our formula, once the General Counsel has established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory discharge, the employer should rebut this with evidence of a legitimate business reason for its action. The ultimate burden of proof does not shift from the General Counsel and does not devolve upon the employer at any stage. Therefore, no violation may be found unless the Board determines that the General Counsel has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer\u2019s anti-union animus was the real cause of the discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">675 F.2d 83, 90 (3d Cir.1982), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>51 U.S.L.W. 3199 (U.S. Sept. 13, 1982) (No. 82-438); <em>see NLRB v. Blackstone, </em>685 F.2d 102, 105 (3d Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>51 U.S.L.W. 3512 (U.S. Dec. 30, 1982) (82-1105). UPS argues that the Board failed to apply that test when it determined that UPS had violated the Act by discharging Bowlds and Perkins. UPS contends that the Board instead applied its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number><em>Wright Line </em>test, which shifts the burden of persuasion on the issue of motive to the employer once the General Counsel establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of discriminatory discharge. <em>See Wright Line, a Division of Wright Line, Inc., </em>251 N.L.R.B. 1083 (1980), <em>enforced, </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 989, 102 S.Ct. 1612, 71 L.Ed.2d 848 (1982).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, UPS urges us to deny enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">We agree that the ALJ and the Board misallocated the burden of persuasion in the instant case. In his decision the ALJ clearly shifted to UPS the burden of proving that the discharges would have taken place in the absence of any protected conduct. App. at 163a. The Board specifically affirmed the ALJ\u2019s rulings, findings, and conclusions. Because the ALJ\u2019s and the Board\u2019s decisions are in contravention of our holding in <em>Behring, </em>we cannot enforce the Board\u2019s order and must remand to the Board for reconsideration. <em>Blackstone, </em>685 F.2d at 106; <em>Behring, </em>675 F.2d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">We will vacate the Board\u2019s order reinstating Bowlds and Perkins and awarding them backpay and other benefits, and we will remand the case for further proceedings.

In its opening brief and in its reply brief, UPS raised a third argument against enforcing the Board\u2019s order. It asserted that the Board\u2019s \u201cre-characterization\u201d of the \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation presented a statute of limitations problem under \u00a7 10(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b) (1976), because Mouser\u2019s alleged statement occurred more than six months prior to the filing of the unfair labor practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">On December 6, 1982, the Board filed a motion to strike UPS\u2019s statute of limitations defense because it had not been properly presented to the Board. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1976). In response to the Board\u2019s motion, UPS argues that it did raise the issue, pointing to one sentence in its brief submitted in support of its exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision. The Board\u2019s regulations, however, state that a matter must be included in a party\u2019s <em>exceptions </em>before it will be considered by the Board. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.46 (1982); see <em>also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.34(b) (brief filed in support of exceptions not included in record of case). UPS concedes that it did not raise the issue in its formal exceptions, and thus under \u00a7 10(e) of the Act and the Board\u2019s regulations, it is barred from raising that issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"ada-dedup-0\">UPS further argues that even if it did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 10(e), it should not be precluded from raising the statute of limitations issue because \u201cthe issue was not interjected into the litigation until the NRLB\u2019s final order.\u201d <em>Cf. NLRB v. Richards, </em>265 F.2d 855, 862 (3d Cir. 1959) (party not barred from raising before court issue of law initially created by the Board\u2019s order). The ALJ\u2019s holding, however, specifically based the \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation on activity in February and March of 1979. App. at 157a. Thus the statute of limitations issue could have been raised by UPS before the Board in response to the ALJ\u2019s finding of when a violation occurred.

Note that in <em>Behring </em>we approved that part of the Board\u2019s <em>Wright Line </em>opinion which placed the initial burden on the General Counsel to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of unlawful discrimination.

(per curiam), <em>cert. granted, </em>-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 372, 74 L.Ed.2d 506 (1982), to resolve the conflict between the Board and various courts of appeals on the burden of proof issue.'</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1075-8\">ROSENN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AIqs\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">I agree with the majority that because the Board improperly allocated the burden of proof in determining that the discharges of Bowlds and Perkins were discriminatory, the case must be remanded for further consideration of this charge. But I believe that the majority has erred in its separate holding that United Parcel Service (UPS) violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act by its overly broad rule against the distribution of union literature. The Company has raised an important statute of limitations challenge to the Board\u2019s finding of this unfair labor practice, and I think this challenge also warrants further consideration on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-13\">The Board determined that UPS violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act entirely on the basis of the incident in which Supervisor Mouser told employee Perkins that \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t\u201d distribute literature on company property. The testimony indicated that this statement was made sometime in February or March 1979. Since the Administrative Law Judge had found a violation of section 8(a)(1) under a different theory, he made no finding as to precisely when Mouser\u2019s statement was made. Yet the date of the statement became a crucial item of information under the Board\u2019s theory of the case. Section 10(b) of the Act precludes the Board from issuing a complaint unless formal charges were filed with the Board within six months of the alleged unfair labor practice. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b). Because Perkins filed his charge on September 12, 1979, the General Counsel could only issue a complaint concerning events taking place after March 12, 1979. Thus, section 10(b) would require the Board to ascertain precisely when the Mouser-Perkins conversation occurred before the conversation could serve as the basis of an unfair labor practice finding. The Board did not consider this problem in making its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-14\">The majority disposes of this statute of limitations defense on the ground that it was not adequately raised before the Board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>and that therefore this court may not consider it now. Under section 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), the court of appeals may not consider any argument that an employer failed to raise before the Board unless \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exist. <em>See Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>456 U.S. 645, 665, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982). The Company argues that it adequately raised the issue before the Board because in its brief to the Board filed in support of its exceptions to the Regional Director\u2019s report, it clearly stated that \u201cthe section 10(b) limitations preclude any ... finding\u201d that Mouser\u2019s statement violated the Act. The majority does not consider this adequate to raise the defense because the argument was not made in the Company\u2019s formal exceptions but only in its supporting brief. <em>See </em>maj. op., <em>supra, </em>at 979 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">To my mind, this is an unduly technical and unreasonable disposition of this issue. The majority refers to regulations of the Board requiring parties to include in their exceptions all matters that are to be argued before the Board, and limiting the brief to matters within the scope of the exceptions. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.46. It is undeniable, however, that the Board was informed of the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">We have previously held that a technical failure to comply with the Board\u2019s procedural rules governing objections will not bar an employer from making his argument to the court of appeals so long as the Board was \u201cadequately appraised\u201d of the employer\u2019s position. <em>NLRB v. Capital Bakers, Inc., </em>351 F.2d 45, 48 (3d Cir.1965). <em>See also NLRB v. Blake Construction Co., </em>663 F.2d 272, 283-84 (D.C.Cir.1981) (\u201cWe do not think section 10(e) requires such a triumph of technical pleading over fundamental fairness.\u201d). Especially in the instant case, where the Board itself saw fit to reformulate the section 8(a)(1) issue at the last minute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I am very reluctant to adopt the excessively technical approach to section 10(e) that the majority does. As we recently have observed, \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 10(e) is to ensure against piecemeal appeals to the courts by requiring that the parties first give the Board an opportunity to rule upon all material issues in a case.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Cardox Division of Chemetron Corp., </em>699 F.2d 148, 153 n. 10 (3d Cir.1983). In the instant case, the Board had such an opportunity. I cannot conceive of any purpose that would be served by foreclosing the Company from arguing its statute of limitations defense on the ground that, though it made the argument to the Board in very explicit terms, it did so on the wrong page.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">I therefore think that the statute of limitations issue was adequately raised below and may be considered by the court on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record suggests that this defense quite possibly has merit, since Mouser\u2019s statement may have been made in February or the first few days of March. Accordingly, upon remand of the case, the Board should also be. directed to ascertain whether Mouser\u2019s statement took place within the statutory six-month period of section 10(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I therefore dissent on this statute of limitations issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">. The Administrative Law Judge found a continuing violation of section 8(a)(1) arising out of a posted work rule pertaining to distribution of literature in the plant, and apparently viewed Mouser\u2019s statement as simply one instance of the implementation of this work rule. The Board, however, relied solely on Mouser\u2019s statement to Perkins as the basis for the unfair labor practice finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">. The Company maintains that, assuming it did not adequately meet the requirement of section 10(e) that the statute of limitations issue be specifically raised before the Board, it should be excused for not having done so, because it was only when the Board reformulated the position of the ALJ that the statute of limitations issue became crucial. This argument might have had some merit, were it not for the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>456 U.S. 645, 665, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982), where the Court suggested that the section 10(e) bar applies even where an issue is injected into the proceedings by the Board\u2019s decision, since the opposing party still has the option of filing a motion for reconsideration with the Board. But, as noted above, I believe that the Company adequately urged its statute of limitations objection before the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">. Since the case is being remanded to the Board on the discriminatory discharge issue, no further delay or inconvenience to the parties would be caused by remanding on the 8(a)(1) issue as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
