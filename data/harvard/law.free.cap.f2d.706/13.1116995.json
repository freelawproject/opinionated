Bustamante was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1), which makes it unlawful for any person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">who is under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Bustamante moved to dismiss the federal indictment on the ground that he had not previously been \u201cconvicted\u201d of a serious crime. He admits that in 1979 he pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to a Rhode Island charge of assault with a dangerous weapon, an offense punishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment, and that the Rhode Island court placed him on probation. But, in Bustamante\u2019s view, this event did not amount to a \u201cconvictpon]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 922(h)(1). A Rhode Island state court held as much, for the purposes of a Rhode Island gun control statute paralleling \u00a7 922(h)(1), when it dismissed a state charge against Bustamante virtually identical to the current federal charge. <em>See State v. Bustamante, </em>No. 81-2510 (R.I.Super.Ct. Mar. 17, 1982), <em>construing </em>R.I.Gen. Laws \u00a7 11-47-5. The federal district court accepted Bustamante\u2019s argument and dismissed the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">After oral argument here, the Supreme Court decided <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, </em>Inc.,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 986, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983). The parties then provided us with the Supreme Court briefs in the <em>Dickerson </em>case and with some additional argument. We conclude that <em>Dickerson </em>controls and requires reversal. In <em>Dickerson, </em>the Supreme Court held that a person who pleads guilty to a state offense punishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment and who is sentenced to probation has been \u201cconvicted\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 922(h)(1) even if state l\u00e1w expunges his record upon the successful completion of probation. The Court began with the proposition that \u201c[wjhether one has been \u2018convicted\u2019 within the meaning of the [federal] gun control statutes is necessarily ... a question of federal, not state, law, despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the state.\u201d -U.S. at-, 103 S.Ct. at 990. The Court ruled that it was immaterial that the state court did not make a written finding of \u201cguilty\u201d (presumably because the state court was waiting to see if the defendant would complete probation successfully). The Supreme Court wrote that \u201cone cannot be placed on probation if the court does not deem him guilty of a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 103 S.Ct. at 992. The Court agreed that the state \u201cexpunging\u201d statute might nullify totally defendant\u2019s conviction for the purposes of the state\u2019s own gun control law. <em>Id. </em>at-n. 9, 103 S.Ct. at 992 n. 9. That fact made no difference, however, in light of the strong federal interest in uniform criminal laws and the typical failure of \u201cexpunging\u201d statutes to \u201cfocus\u201d on \u201cwhether the convicted person is fit ... to possess a firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 103 S.Ct. at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-20\">We can find no meaningful distinction between this case and <em>Dickerson. </em>Busta-mante\u2019s strongest argument \u2014 the fact that Rhode Island itself does not consider him to have been previously \u201cconvicted\u201d for purposes of Rhode Island\u2019s own gun control statute \u2014 was explicitly considered and rejected by the <em>Dickerson </em>Court. <em>Id. </em>at-n. 9,103 S.Ct. at 992 n. 9. The reasoning of the Justices suggests that prior \u201cnolo\u201d pleas should be treated like prior \u201cguilty\u201d pleas; indeed, even the dissenters, in defining relevant federal law, noted that some federal statutes explicitly bring the \u201cnolo\u201d plea within the scope of the word \u201cconvicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 103 S.Ct. at 996. This similar treatment would seem to extend to a nolo plea followed by probation, for, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Court stated, \u201cone cannot be placed on probation if the court does not deem him guilty of a crime\u201d \u2014 in this case a crime punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at-, 103 S.Ct. at 990; <em>accord Johnson v. Mullen, </em>390 A.2d 909, 912 (R.I.1978) (quoting R.I.Super.Ct.R.Crim.P. 11); <em>cf. Lott v. United States, 367 </em>U.S. 421,426-27, 81 S.Ct. 1563, 1566-67, 6 L.Ed.2d 940 (1961) (imposition of sentence following plea of <em>nolo </em>constitutes \u201cdetermination of guilt\u201d under pri- or Fed.R.Crim.P. 34).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In sum, given the reasoning of <em>Dickerson, </em>we cannot draw a meaningful line between: 1) a guilty plea followed by probation and later expunged (Dickerson); and 2) a nolo plea followed by probation (Bustamante). We therefore hold that Bustamante has been \u201cconvicted\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 922(h)(1). And, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
