Lackawanna contends the district court should have vacated a portion of the award because the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority by interpreting a section of the collective bargaining agreement not placed in issue by the parties. The Union cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees, claiming entitlement to fees on grounds that Lackawanna wrongfully refused to comply with the arbitration award. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>1. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">On March 11, 1980, Lackawanna served one of its employees, Charles Hodges, with a written notice of poor work performance. The notice reflected Lackawanna\u2019s dissatisfaction with Hodges\u2019 operation of a hide-shaving machine. Upon receiving the warning, Hodges also received a notice of discharge, pursuant to section 8.4 of the collective bargaining agreement then in effect. Section 8.4 provided in pertinent part: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">An employee, who during the course of a years [sic] period, receives three written notices in relation to inefficiency, abses-enteeism. [sic], etc. shall be immediately discharged upon receipt of the third notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Lackawanna discharged Hodges because he had received two prior notices, one for an unexcused absence, and one for excessive tardiness, in less than a year\u2019s time.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The Union filed a grievance on behalf of Hodges, contending that Lackawanna did not issue the warning notice and discharge for justifiable cause under the labor agreement, and that Lackawanna\u2019s action, in fact, was taken in retaliation for Hodges\u2019 refusal to take vacation time rather than draw unemployment during a recent plant shutdown. After the initial grievance procedure proved unsuccessful, the parties submitted the grievance to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Following a hearing, the arbitrator found that although Lackawanna had justifiable cause for issuing the warning notice, it had wrongfully discharged Hodges. The arbitrator held that section 8.4 of the collective bargaining agreement allowed discharge only when the employer issued three written notices for the same type of infraction. Because Hodges had not received any prior notices for poor work, the arbitrator held that Hodges should not have been discharged and ordered him reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Lackawanna filed a complaint in the district court claiming the arbitrator both exceeded his authority by interpreting section 8.4, when neither side had placed the meaning of section 8.4 in issue, and interpreted section 8.4 incorrectly. Lackawanna sought an order either vacating and correcting that portion of the award dealing with section 8.4, or, in the alternative, reopening arbitration in order to allow it to present evidence regarding the meaning of section 8.4. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Union, and Lackawanna appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">A. <em>Arbitrator\u2019s Scope of Authority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">Lackawanna contends the arbitrator exceeded his authority in interpreting section 8.4 because neither the Union nor Lacka-wanna disputed the meaning of section 8.4 or placed its interpretation in issue. Lacka-wanna argues that the Union and Lacka-wanna had always understood section 8.4 to allow discharge after the employee received three written notices of any combination of infractions. According to Lackawanna, the only issue placed before the arbitrator involved whether Lackawanna properly issued a poor work notice to Hodges. Consequently, Lackawanna argues, that portion of the arbitrator\u2019s award which interprets section 8.4 incorrectly must be vacated. We disagree. In our judgment, the record demonstrates that the arbitration award properly rests on the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">An arbitrator\u2019s award must be upheld as long as it \u201cdraws its essence\u201d from the collective bargaining agreement. <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 596-97, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1360-61, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960); <em>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers, Local No. 222, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Iowa Beef Processors, Inc., </em>683 F.2d 283, 285 (8th Cir.1982). In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his authority, the agreement must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>be broadly construed with all doubts being resolved in favor of the arbitrator\u2019s authority. <em>Resilient Floor and Decorative Covering Workers, Local Union 1179, v. Welco Mfg. Co., </em>542 F.2d 1029, 1082 (8th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Lackawanna claims that the arbitrator acted outside his jurisdiction because neither party ever submitted the \u201cproper interpretation\u201d of section 8.4 to him. That argument is seriously flawed. Whether the arbitrator erred in reaching a particular result is irrelevant to the determination of whether the arbitrator acted within his jurisdiction. The central issue is whether the arbitrator acted within his jurisdiction in interpreting section 8.4. We hold that he did so act.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Lackawanna\u2019s justification for discharge required that it establish a factual and contractual basis for the discharge. Similarly, the Union\u2019s challenge of the discharge required that it establish a factual and contractual basis for its challenge. The record demonstrates that both parties supported their relative positions by relying on the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The grievance letter filed by the Union contended that Hodges\u2019 warning notice and discharge were \u201cnot for justifiable cause <em>as per the labor agreement. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added). Lackawanna introduced evidence during the arbitration hearing that Hodges\u2019 discharge was in accordance with company policy <em>and the collective bargaining agreement. At </em>the outset of the case, the arbitrator outlined the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">Did the Company have proper cause to warn and <em>terminate </em>Charles Hodges for poor work on March 7, 1980? If not, what is the proper remedy? [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Thus, the arbitrator considered each element of the issue separately, asking, first, whether Hodges\u2019 conduct justified a warning notice, and, second, whether a warning notice properly made would justify the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">After concluding that Hodges\u2019 conduct justified a warning notice, the arbitrator considered Lackawanna\u2019s right to terminate Hodges. The arbitrator first recognized Lackawanna\u2019s position \u201cthat under Section 8.4 discharge is automatic upon receipt of a third warning notice for any reason.\u201d Next, after observing that neither party introduced any evidence regarding the interpretation of section 8.4, and that \u201c[a] Company witness testified that the discharge of Hodges was in accord with Company policy, but no prior instances of the administration of such a policy were introduced[,]\u201d the arbitrator referred to the usual interpretation given provisions similar to section 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The arbitrator observed that provisions such as section 8.4 are common in collective bargaining agreements and that such provisions are commonly interpreted to require multiple notices of specific offenses in order to justify discharge. The arbitrator construed section 8.4 to require three notices of inefficiency to justify discharge. Here, the company gave Hodges only one such notice. Thus, by determining the meaning of section 8.4, the arbitrator addressed the precise issue presented to him in the grievance letter: whether the warning notice and discharge constituted justifiable cause \u201cas per the labor agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">That the parties failed to introduce evidence regarding the interpretation of section 8.4 does not constitute a valid ground for vacating the award. A provision such as section 8.4 and its ordinary interpretation must be reached in any decision made by an arbitrator interpreting a collective bargaining agreement. Without evidence as to the meaning of the contract clause in question, an arbitrator may properly give that clause a reading ordinary to similar labor contracts, to hold otherwise relieves the employer of its burden of showing that its actions were justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">The Supreme Court has held that an arbitrator does not exceed the scope of the issue presented to him as long as the arbitrator \u201c[stays] within the areas marked out for his consideration.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., supra, </em>363 U.S. at 598, 80 S.Ct. at 1361. In applying this principle to the instant case, District Judge Schatz reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"At0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>It is clear that the Union wished the arbitrator to decide whether Mr. Hodges\u2019 \u201cwarning notice and his discharge of March 11,1980 is ... for justifiable cause as per the labor agreement.[\u201d] Absent a formal submission of the issue, this grievance letter of March 12, 1980, served to present the issue to the arbitrator. The Court notes that very little, if any, evidence was presented at the arbitration hearing with regard to the past interpretations of section 8.4. However, that is not dispositive. What is dispositive is the fact that the Company relied on section 8.4 to discharge Mr. Hodges, and the grievance submitted to the arbitrator asked whether there was just cause' for the warning <em>and </em>discharge. In <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., supra, </em>an arbitrator\u2019s award was challenged as going beyond the scope of the submission. The court held that he had not, noting that \u201che had stayed within the areas marked out for his consideration.\u201d 363 U.S. at 597 [80 S.Ct. at-1361]. In the instant case, Lack-awanna may not have agreed with [the arbitrator\u2019s] construction of Section 8.4 of the CBA, but it cannot be said that the arbitrator went outside the areas marked for his consideration. \u201cIt is the arbitrator\u2019s construction which was bargained for, and so far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different from , his.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., supra, </em>363 U.S. at 599 [80 S.Ct. at 1362]. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">This Court will not review the reasoning of the arbitrator; it has merely determined that [the arbitrator] reached a rational conclusion based on the terms of the CBA and the grievance submitted to him. * * * Therefore, the defendant Union is entitled to have the arbitrator\u2019s decision enforced. <em>[The Lackawanna Leather Co. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int\u2019l Union, AFL-CIO, &amp; CLC, District Union No. 271, etc., </em>No. 80-0-398, slip op. at 5-7 (D.Neb. Nov. 24, 1981) (footnotes omitted).]</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">After reviewing the record, we agree with the reasoning of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Lackawanna also raises the equitable doctrines of \u201cunclean hands\u201d and equitable estoppel in contesting enforcement of the award. Lackawanna claims that the Union should not benefit from the arbitrator\u2019s award after refusing to agree to reopen the arbitration hearing when it knew the arbitrator\u2019s decision was wrong. This argument lacks merit. Lackawanna carried the burden of proving its actions were justified under the labor contract. Regardless of the graciousness or ungraciousness of the Union\u2019s actions, Lackawanna cannot relieve its burden by asserting equitable doctrines in this proceeding. The Union did not mislead Lackawanna or make false representations regarding its claim upon which Lackawanna relied. <em>See United States v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>480 F.2d 1095, 1099 (8th Cir.1973) (estoppel not available for protection of one suffering loss solely by reason of own failure to act).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">B. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In its cross-appeal, the Union seeks attorneys\u2019 fees, contending that Lackawanna acted without justification in refusing to comply with the arbitrator\u2019s award. Attorneys\u2019 fees are ordinarily not recoverable by the prevailing party in federal litigation unless authorized by statute or justified by circumstances in which the losing party has acted in bad faith. <em>General Drivers, Helpers and Truck Terminal Employees, Local No. 120 v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>535 F.2d 1072, 1077 (8th Cir.1976). Attorneys\u2019 fees are not authorized by statute in suits to enforce arbitration awards. <em>Id. </em>The district court found that Lackawanna did not act in bad faith in questioning the arbitrator\u2019s award. Because we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination, we affirm the court\u2019s denial of the Union\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">III. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">We affirm the judgment of the district court and order that the arbitrator\u2019s award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>be enforced. In addition, we uphold the district court\u2019s denial of the Union\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. Costs are awarded to appellee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-15\">. The Honorable Albert G. Schatz, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-10\">. Initially, a divided panel reversed the district court. On December 17, 1982, however, we issued an order granting a rehearing <em>en banc. </em>The parties reargued the case before the court <em>en banc </em>on January 13, 1983. The effect of this opinion serves to vacate the panel opinion previously filed on November 10, 1982 and reported at 692 F.2d 536.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b325-4\">JOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">concurring in part and dissenting in part, with whom FLOYD R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge, and ROSS, Circuit Judge, join.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">I concur in Part II.B of the majority opinion. I respectfully dissent from Part II.A because, in my view, the question of the proper interpretation of section 8.4 of the collective bargaining agreement was never submitted to the arbitrator for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">On March 12, 1980, the Union filed a written grievance on behalf of Hodges. The grievance letter provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">This letter is to be considered an official grievance on behalf of Charles Hodges\u2019 warning notice and discharge. It is the position of Mr. Hodges and the Union that the warning notice and his discharge of March 11, 1980 is not for justifiable \u25a0cause as per the labor agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">Be further advised that it is Mr. Hodges\u2019 and the Union\u2019s position that this action is directly connected to the fact that Mr. Hodges refused to take his vacation and elected to draw unemployment during the recent plant shutdown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">Therefore, it is the request of Mr. Hodges and this Union that he be reinstated to his position with full back pay and seniority and the warning notice be removed from his file.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The majority opinion concludes that the language \u201cnot for justifiable cause as <em>per the labor agreement \u201d </em>placed interpretation of section 8.4 in issue. I disagree. A fair reading of the letter does no more than indicate that the warning notice and discharge was not for justifiable cause under the labor agreement. Read in its entirety, the letter does no more than place into issue the propriety of the warning notice and the applicability of section 8.4. The letter does not, however, raise the question of that section\u2019s <em>meaning </em>and <em>interpretation, </em>and the language on which the majority bases its opinion, \u201cas per the labor agreement,\u201d when read in the context of the letter, does not create such an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Although the Union now contends that the proper interpretation of section 8.4 was part of the arbitration submission, this after-the-fact rationalization is belied by the Union\u2019s own conduct. The only issue disputed at either the informal grievance proceeding or the arbitration hearing was whether the written notice for poor work issued on March 11, 1980 was factually justified. Neither side, however, raised any issue, made any argument, or presented any evidence on whether Lackawanna could combine written notices for different types of infractions under section 8.4 in automatically terminating Hodges. Patently, neither party even thought that the interpretation of section 8.4 was in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">At the completion of the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator ruled that Lackawanna was justified in issuing the poor work notice. This conclusion is not contested here. What is contested is the arbitrator\u2019s further holding that section 8.4 of the CBA required three written notices for the <em>same </em>infraction and that Hodges\u2019 dismissal was improper since his three written notices were for <em>different </em>infractions. The arbitrator ordered Hodges to be reinstated but his warning notice for poor work to remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">Although a reviewing court gives deference to an arbitrator\u2019s decision, judicial deference does not grant carte blanche approval to any decision that an arbitrator might make. <em>Piggly Wiggly Operators\u2019 Warehouse, Inc. v. Piggly Wiggly Operators\u2019 Warehouse Independent Truck Drivers Union, Local No. 1, </em>611 F.2d 580, 583 (5th Cir.1980) (citing <em>International Association of Machinists </em>v. <em>Hayes Corp., </em>296 F.2d 238, 243 (5th Cir.1961), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>316 F.2d 90 (5th Cir.1963) (per curiam)). An arbitrator can bind the parties only on issues that they have agreed to submit, and whether the arbitrator has exceeded those bounds is a proper issue for judicial determination. <em>International Association of Machinists, District 776 v. Texas Steel Co., </em>639 F.2d 279, 283 (5th Cir.1981) (citing <em>Piggly Wiggly Op</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>erators\u2019 Warehouse, Inc. v. Piggly Wiggly Operators\u2019. Warehouse Independent Truck Drivers Union, Local No. 1, </em>611 F.2d at 583). A court may vacate a labor arbitration award if the arbitrator exceeds the scope of the submission by ruling on issues not presented to him by the parties. <em>See, e.g., Kansas City Luggage &amp; Novelty Workers Union, Local No. 66 v. Neevel Luggage Manufacturing Co., </em>325 F.2d 992, 994 (8th Cir.1964); <em>Local Union No. 2-477, Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers, International Union v. Continental Oil Co., </em>524 F.2d 1048, 1050 (10th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 936, 96 S.Ct. 1668, 48 L.Ed.2d 177 (1976); <em>Textile Workers Union of America, Local Union No. 1886 v. American Thread Co., </em>291 F.2d 894, 900-01 (4th Cir.1961); <em>cf. Totem Marine Tug &amp; Barge, Inc. v. North American Towing, Inc., </em>607 F.2d 649, 651-52 (5th Cir.1979) (commercial arbitration award may be vacated if arbitrator awards on matter not submitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>R. Gorman, <em>Basic Text on Labor Law, Unionization, and Collective Bargaining </em>588 (1976); D. Nolan, <em>Labor Arbitration Law and Practice in a Nutshell </em>88-92 (1979); St. Antoine, <em>Judicial Review of Labor Arbitration Awards: A Second Look at </em>Enterprise Wheel <em>and its Progeny, </em>75 Mich.L.Rev. 1137, 1150-52 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">There is no dispute in this appeal as to whether the interpretation of section 8.4 is an arbitrable issue. The basic issue raised, is whether the arbitrator exceeded the scope of the submission by construing the meaning of section 8.4 of the CBA and deciding that the three notices for work infractions required by section 8.4 to terminate an employee had to be for the same type of infraction. Careful review of the record can only justify a conclusion that interpretation of section 8.4 was not an issue that was \u201cspecifically or necessarily included in the subject matter submitted to arbitration,\u201d and that the arbitrator, by construing section 8.4, exceeded the scope of the submission. <em>Kansas City Luggage &amp; Novelty Workers Union, Local No. 66 v. Neevel Luggage Manufacturing Co., </em>325 F.2d at 994; <em>cf. Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Union Local 784 v. Ulry-Talbert Co., </em>330 F.2d 562, 566 (8th Cir.1964) (arbitrator exceeds jurisdiction when award goes beyond limitation contained in collective bargaining agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">The Union makes two primarily factual arguments (which the district court found dispositive) to sustain the arbitrator\u2019s authority in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">First, the Union contends that the inclusion of the phrase \u201cand discharge\u201d in the grievance letter, <em>supra, </em>implicated the interpretation of section 8.4 as an issue at arbitration. I disagree. As stated previously, the grievance letter, when read in its entirety, does no more than raise the applicability of section 8.4, not its meaning and interpretation. Thus, the Union\u2019s narrow focus on the quoted phrase is misplaced. By itself, the phrase is so ambiguous and vague that it would not have put the parties fairly on notice that the proper interpretation of section 8.4 was being submitted to arbitration. <em>Cf. Totem Marine Tug &amp; Barge, Inc. v. North American Towing, Inc., </em>607 F.2d at 651 (parties to commercial arbitration entitled to notice). Adequate notice of the issues is a prerequisite to a fundamentally fair hearing, for without such notice the parties would be effectively denied an opportunity to prepare and present their case at arbitration. I believe that the grievance letter in this case failed to provide the parties with such adequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">Moreover, the record shows no evidence that the parties had any understanding to the contrary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the opposite obtains. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Testimony from the deposition of Arbitrator Doyle shows that neither party raised any issue or presented any evidence to the effect that Lackawanna could not combine written notices for different types of infractions under section 8.4 in automatically terminating Hodges. Affidavits submitted by Lackawanna are further confirmation of \u25a0 the same. Finally, in its Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, even the Union concedes that \u201cSection 8.4 was not challenged at the hearing ... . \u201d Altogether, this is persuasive evidence that the interpretation of section 8.4 was not within the contemplation of the arbitration submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Secondly, the Union contends that the arbitrator was required to interpret section 8.4 by virtue of Lackawanna\u2019s reliance on that section in terminating Hodges. This argument assumes, however, that the parties understood there to be an issue in the first instance. In light of the evidence considered above to the contrary, the Union\u2019s argument is unsound. The company\u2019s reliance on section 8.4 does not demonstrate the company had notice that the <em>interpretation </em>of section 8.4 was in issue; rather, it tends to show merely that the company was automatically applying to Hodges what had been a long-standing and uniform company practice concerning the termination of employees under that section.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Steelworkers Trilogy </em>sets forth the principles which are to govern the arbitration process. The question of whether the arbitrator erred in reaching his result is not before us. Nor are we concerned with whether the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract may differ from what we believe it should be. Rather, the sole question before us, under <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 598, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960), is whether the arbitrator went beyond those \u201careas marked out for his consideration.\u201d I believe the arbitrator has exceeded those boundaries and, in doing so, has denied the parties their rightful opportunity to prepare and present their case. The result is a clear deprivation of industrial due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Accordingly, we should reverse and remand to the district court to order the arbitration hearing to be re-opened on the question of the proper interpretation of section 8.4.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-5\">. The <em>Totem </em>court, in vacating a commercial arbitration award, relied on the United States Arbitration Act \u00a7\u00a7 10(c)-10(d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10(c)-10(d) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">. In determining the scope of an arbitration submission, courts consider a number of factors to be relevant, including correspondence between the parties, arguments and discussion during arbitration, and evidence of confusion, uncertainty, or dissent in the record. <em>See Local Union No. 2-477, Oil, Chem. &amp; Atomic Workers, Int\u2019l Union v. Continental Oil Co., </em>524 F.2d at 1050; <em>Kroger Co. v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, Local No. 661, </em>380 F.2d 728, 731-32 (6th Cir.1967); <em>Sweeney v. Morganroth, </em>451 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>F.Supp. 367, 369-70 (S.D.N.Y.1978); <em>Delta Lines, Inc. v. Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 85, </em>409 F.Supp. 873, 875-76 (N.D.Ca.1976); <em>College Hall Fashions, Inc. v. Philadelphia Joint Bd., Amalgamated Clothing Workers of Am., </em>408 F.Supp. 722, 729 (E.D.Pa.1976). The majority concludes, without citing any support, that the failure to present any evidence is not a \u201cvalid ground.\u201d It is illogical to single out a particular factor as \u201cinvalid\u201d when a variety of factors need to be considered in determining the scope of an arbitration submission. Here, when the failure to present evidence is considered along with other circumstances, it is evident that neither party presented any evidence on the interpretation of section 8.4. because neither party thought that was an issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-13\">.

However, there is absolutely nothing in the record to indicate that the union, the company, or the arbitrator thought the same offense question was at issue at the time of the hearing. The company reasonably had no idea there was a same offense issue; neither did the union. The arbitrator <em>sub silentio </em>sprung his own interpretation on this non-issue in his award without an iota of evidence in the record to support it, all in apparent direct conflict with past company practices as recognized by all the parties. The sandbagging that occurred in this case is simply a miscarriage of justice, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>makes the arbitration proceeding in this case a farce.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">It is difficult for me to fathom why the union and a majority of this court are fearful of a remand so that the now decisive issue in this case can be fairly and fully presented to an impartial arbitrator.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
