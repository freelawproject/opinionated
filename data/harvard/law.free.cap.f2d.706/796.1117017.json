CAMPBELL, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b889-19\">This is an appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the defendants in a case challenging the constitutionality of Wisconsin\u2019s procedures for determining the residency of individuals for tuition purposes at state universities. This case has been the subject of a state action, <em>Lister v. Board of Regents, </em>72 Wis.2d 282, 240 N.W.2d 610 (1976); and two federal appeals, <em>Lister v. Lucey, </em>575 F.2d 1325 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. den. </em>439 U.S. 865, 99 S.Ct. 190, 58 L.Ed.2d 175 (1978); <em>Lister v. Hoover, </em>655 F.2d 123 (7th Cir.1981). Based on the remand on the last appeal, the only issue before the district court was whether the Committee of Appeals at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) was required by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to give written reasons for its denial of a student\u2019s request to be classified as a state resident for tuition purposes. Upon cross motions for summary judgment, the district court answered the question in the negative and the plaintiffs appealed to this Court. We conclude that the district judge properly analyzed the issue raised and hereby affirm and adopt its opinion which is reprinted in the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b889-20\">SWYGERT, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAU8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-21\">The plaintiffs in this case are three former students of the University of Wisconsin at Madison who sought to be classified as Wisconsin residents for tuition purposes during 1971 and 1972, after residing in the state for more than one year. Wisconsin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>state law then in force established different tuition rates for residents and nonresidents, Wis.Stat. \u00a7 36.16 (1971) (current version at Wis.Stat. \u00a7 36.27 (1979-80)), and provided, with sortie exceptions, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 36.16(l)(a)-(ak), that \u201c[a]ny student who has not been a resident of the state for one year next preceding the beginning of any semester for which such student registers at the university\u201d must pay the nonresident rate, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 36.16(l)(b). If nonresidency at the time of enrollment raised an irrebuttable presumption of continued nonresidency during a student\u2019s entire educational career, the statute would be unconstitutional as a denial of due process. <em>See Vlandis </em>v. <em>Kline, </em>412 U.S. 441, 448, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 2234, 37 L.Ed.2d 63 (1973). The Wisconsin statute, as interpreted by the district court, avoided this pitfall by providing students an opportunity to rebut the presumption of continued non-residency by applying for reclassification. In particular, the statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-4\">In determining bona fide residence, filing of state income tax returns in Wisconsin, eligibility for voting in this state, motor vehicle registration in Wisconsin, and employment in Wisconsin shall be considered. Notwithstanding par. (l)(a), a student from another state who is in this state principally to obtain an education will not be considered to have established a residence in Wisconsin by virtue of attendance at educational institutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">Wis.Stat. \u00a7 36.16(3) (1971) (current version at Wis.Stat. \u00a7 36.27(2)(e) (1979-80), making the rebuttability of the presumption explicit). The plaintiffs sought to show bona fide residence in accordance with this section by demonstrating that they met all or nearly all of the nonexclusive listed criteria, and by submitting additional evidence of bona fide residency such as local home ownership, membership in local organizations, or the reclassification of a spouse as a resident. Each plaintiff was at least initially denied reclassification, and each challenged the procedure by which residency determinations are made. On this appeal the only issue is whether the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires the Appeals Committee, which reviews determinations of residency by the Registrar, to provide to unsuccessful applicants a statement of reasons for denial. Because I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that no statement of reasons is required, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Analysis of every due process claim requires a two-part inquiry: first, the identification of a life, liberty, or property interest entitled to procedural protection, and second, the determination of what process is due before the government may take action affecting that interest. <em>See Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 569-70, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2705, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). No one disputes that in the present case the plaintiffs\u2019 claimed entitlement to lower tuition constitutes a property interest; the sole question before the court is what process is due. Although the standards for identifying appropriate procedures are inexact, I believe that Supreme Court decisions requiring statements of reasons as the minimal degree of process necessary for determining factual issues control the result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The framework for determining the necessary level of procedures was explicated in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976): a court must consider the nature and weight of the private and public interests involved, and the- value of additional procedural safeguards. The individual interest in not paying the difference between nonresident and resident tuition rates, even if considered in one-semester increments (although I wonder whether the state could by this reasoning slice the plaintiffs\u2019 interest ever finer simply by allowing continuous reclassification requests), is weightier than the majority admits. Although the amount of money at issue may not be great on an absolute scale, the court must consider its importance to the individual. <em>See id. </em>at 341, 96 S.Ct. at 905; <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 261-63, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1016-18, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). Requiring a resident student to pay the nonresident rate may delay or foreclose educational opportunities, which are an important interest even if not a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d <em>See Goss v. Lopez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>419 U.S. 565, 575, 576, 95 S.Ct. 729, 736, 737, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975). At the same time, the majority overstates the government\u2019s interest. Wisconsin\u2019s interest in maintaining the quality of its universities and preserving its financial resources by collecting higher tuition from nonresidents, although probably legitimate, <em>see Vlandis v. Kline, </em>412 U.S. at 445, 93 S.Ct. at 2232, is not the interest at stake. Nor is Wisconsin\u2019s interest in controlling its treasury, out of which refunds may be paid to students whose classifications as nonresidents are reversed, at issue: if those students are determined to be residents, Wisconsin\u2019s interest in collecting higher tuition from them was disclaimed by the enactment of Wis.Stat. \u00a7 36.16 (1971), which permitted the tuition preference for residents. <em>Cf. Vlandis </em>v. <em>Kline, </em>412 U.S. at 448-49, 93 S.Ct. at 2234-35. Wisconsin\u2019s only interest is in avoiding the administrative burden of providing statements of reasons. This interest is small because the Appeals Committee already conducts individualized hearings, at which it is obliged to make reasoned and nonarbitrary decisions. \u201cIt simply is not unduly \u2018burdensome to give reasons when reasons exist. Whenever an application ... is denied ... there should be some reason for the decision. It can scarcely be argued that government would be crippled by a requirement that the reason be communicated to the person most directly affected by the government\u2019s action.\u2019 ... And an inability to provide any reasons suggests that the decision is, in fact, arbitrary.\u201d <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 39 \u201440, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2120, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1978) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 591, 92 S.Ct. at 2716 (Marshall, J., dissenting)). This deduction that the burden of stating existing reasons cannot be crushing is confirmed by the state\u2019s example in other cases. The Appeals Committee has in the past stated reasons for denials, <em>see Zalucha v. Board of Regents, </em>99 Wis.2d 806, 301 N.W.2d 461, slip op. at 10 (Wis.App.1980), and the Registrar has stated reasons for decisions granting reclassification, <em>see </em>letter from T.H. Hoover to James S. Thiel (Jan. 7,-1972), App. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The defendants argue, however, that the state has a further interest in not providing statements of reasons: they fear that if the residency standards are made so explicit, students will be able to comply and thereby thwart the state\u2019s interest in charging them the nonresident rate. This argument raises the third <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>consideration, the value of the proposed procedure. The short answer to the argument would seem to be \u201cso what?\u201d: if students do comply with the criteria for residency the state has no legitimate interest in classifying them as nonresidents, as <em>Vlandis v. Kline, </em>412 U.S. at 448-49, 93 S.Ct. at 2234-35, demonstrates. Indeed, one of the benefits of statements of reasons generally is that they enable people to conform their conduct to the law\u2019s requirements. <em>Cf. Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. at 346, 96 S.Ct. at 908 (procedures that include a statement of reasons for the cutoff of disability benefits satisfy due process because they \u201cenable the recipient to \u2018mold\u2019 his argument to respond to the precise issues which the decisionmaker regards as crucial\u201d). But the defendants argue that this answer mistakes the object of the administrative inquiry: the Wisconsin statute focuses on the student\u2019s intent, which could be falsified if the Appeals Committee were required to evaluate it by a rigid list of objective indicia. The defendants stress that the inquiry demanded by the statute cannot be so confined because subjective intent is nebulous and not quantifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">I find this argument unpersuasive for several reasons. First, the defendants\u2019 assumption that a statement of reasons would have to specify objective criteria of intent and thereby attempt to quantify the unquantifiable is unwarranted. The decision-maker need not build up a hypothetical successful case, but only specify the faults in the actual case that make it unsuccessful. The statute\u2019s list of four possible indicia of residency (payment of state income tax, voter registration, motor vehicle registration, and local employment) indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>those criteria may be sufficient. If a student demonstrates that he satisfies those or other similar criteria and yet is classified as a nonresident, it must be because the deci-sionmaker perceived some positive reason to doubt the student\u2019s sincerity, not because the student failed to reach some unspecified prima facie threshold. If the decisionmaker cannot state those positive reasons we are left with the impression that the decision is either unreasoned or based on illegitimate reasons. Indeed, the statutory scheme of review under Wisconsin\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), Wis.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 227.-01-227.26 (1979-80), appears to require the recordation of the facts that tarnished the positive evidence presented by the student. The APA makes decisions of the kind at issue here reviewable by the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 227.20. If the only evidence in the record is that presented by the student, and not the factual evaluations of credibility and the like made by the decisionmaker, review by the appropriate standard will be frustrated. <em>Cf. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 420, 91 S.Ct. 814, 825, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (\u201c[SJince the bare record may not disclose the factors that were considered or the Secretary\u2019s construction of the evidence it may be necessary ... to require some explanation in order to determine if the Secretary acted within the scope of his authority and if the Secretary\u2019s action was justifiable under the applicable standard.\u201d). The value of reviewability has been recognized as a reason to impose the procedural requirement of a statement of reasons. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-65, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2978-79, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). <em>See also Hewitt v. </em>Helms,-U.S. -,-, 103 S.Ct. 864, 883, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (Stevens, J.-, dissenting); Morgan, <em>The Constitutional Right to Know Why, </em>17 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 297, 300-05 (1982). At the same time, the inability to conduct searching review caused by the lack of a statement of reasons demonstrates, for purposes of <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>balancing, that the existing review procedure does not constitute an independent safeguard against error. <em>See Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. at 581 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. at 740 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Second, the object of the inquiry \u2014 the student\u2019s intent \u2014 is subjective only on the part of the student, not on the part of the decisionmaker; the issue is factual, not discretionary. In many cases involving similar kinds of factfinding the Supreme Court has held that statements of reasons are required as the skeletal level of process due. <em>See id. </em>at 581, 95 S.Ct. at 739 (due process \u201crequires at least [the] rudimentary precaution ]\u201d of, inter alia, a statement of reasons before school discipline is imposed); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. at 563, 94 S.Ct. at 2978 (revocation of prisoner\u2019s good-time credits); <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1759, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973) (revocation of probation); <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 483-84, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2601, 2604, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (revocation of parole); <em>Willner v. Committee on Character &amp; Fitness, </em>373 U.S. 96, 105, 83 S.Ct. 1175, 1181, 10 L.Ed.2d 224 (1963) (bar certification). <em>See also Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. at 346, 96 S.Ct. at 908 (procedure of providing statements of reasons satisfies minimal process due). The minimal nature of the process demanded in these cases is especially notable in those involving prisoners, because the Court has held their liberty interest to be so narrow as to require only abbreviated procedures. <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>- U.S. at -, 103 S.Ct. at 871. <em>See also </em>2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7\u00a7 13.1-13.15 (2d ed. 1979) (urging a requirement of a statement of reasons even when very little process is due); Rabin, <em>Job Security and Due Process: Monitoring Administrative Discretion Through a Reasons Requirement, </em>44 U.Chi. L.Rev. 60, 74-93 (1976) (same). In most of thes\u00e9 cases the central factual inquiry was not crisp or quantifiable. <em>See, e.g., Morris-sey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. at 483-84, 92 S.Ct. at 2601 (distinguishing discretionary and factual elements of decisions to revoke parole). But only when the Court has characterized a decision as purely discretionary has it held that no statement of reasons is required, because then the value of that procedure is diminished. See <em>Hewitt </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Helms,-U.S. at-, 103 S.Ct. at 872 (transfer to administrative segregation pending investigation); <em>Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, </em>452 U.S. 458, 464-66, 101 S.Ct. 2460, 2463-65, 69 L.Ed.2d 158 (1981) (commutation of sentence); <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 15-16, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2107-08, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1978) (denial of parole); <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 322-23, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 1559-60, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976) (disciplinary proceedings in prison). Indeed, the Court sometimes imposes reasons requirements as an administrative matter even when the decision at issue is reviewable only for abuse of discretion. <em>See Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 571-74, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1859-61, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975); <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. at 420, 91 S.Ct. at 825; <em>see generally </em>3 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7\u00a7 14.21-14.-29 (2d ed. 1980). In the present case the state\u2019s power to reclassify students is not discretionary, but must be exercised in accordance with a specific statutory criterion. Rudimentary due process therefore requires that statements of reasons explaining particular exercises of that power be furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Finally, statements of reasons have other social values that weigh in the <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>balance. In addition to the \u201cinstrumental values\u201d of reviewability, clarity, and consistency, furnishing such statements would promote \u201cprocess values\u201d by fostering a sense of participation and fairness. In short,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-7\">this requirement would direct the deci-sionmaker\u2019s focus \u201cto the relevant ... criteria and promote more careful consideration of the evidence. It would also enable [students] to detect and correct inaccuracies that could have a decisive impact. And the obligation to justify a decision publicly would provide the assurance, critical to the appearance of fairness, that the [Appeals Committee\u2019s] decision is not capricious.\u201d ... A written statement of reasons would facilitate administrative and judicial review and might give the [student] an opportunity to [alter] his conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azh-dedup-0\"><em>Hewitt v.

Determining whether due process requires a statement by the Committee of its reasons for denying resident status for tuition purposes requires the consideration and balancing of three distinct factors: first, \u201cthe private interest that will be affected by the official action\u201d; second, \u201cthe government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the statement would entail\u201d; and third, \u201cthe risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any,\u201d of a statement of reasons. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-24\">\n<em>Private interest affected</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b894-25\">Residents of Wisconsin enjoy a property interest in the tuition advantage available to them. <em>Lister v. Hoover, </em>No. 71-C-409 (W.D.Wis., May 9, 1980); <em>see Vlandis v. Kline, </em>412 U.S. 441, 453, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 2237, 37 L.Ed.2d 63 (1973). The property interest at stake is limited to the difference between resident and nonresident student tuition for a single semester, because the student has an opportunity each semester to seek reevaluation of nonresident status. This, difference varied from $770 for autumn 1970 to $780 for spring 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-26\">It is important to note what interests of plaintiffs are not at stake. Even if there were a right to a higher education, which there is not <em>(Sturgis v. State of Washington, </em>368 F.Supp. 38 (W.D.Wash. 1973), <em>aff\u2019d mem. </em>414 U.S. 1057, 94 S.Ct. 563, 38 L.Ed.2d 464 (1973); <em>see San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973), <em>rehearing denied, </em>411 U.S. 959, 93</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>APPENDIX \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"aq_-dedup-0\">S.Ct. 1919, 36 L.Ed.2d 418 (1973)), plaintiffs are not permanently disabled from taking courses. This case does not involve a denial of the opportunity to enter a certain profession. <em>Willner </em>v. <em>Committee on Character and Fitness, </em>373 U.S. 96, 83 S.Ct. 1175, 10 L.Ed.2d 224 (1963) (holding that petitioner was denied due process when he was denied admission to the Bar without a hearing on the charges filed against him). Finally, denial of nonresident status does not bestow a badge of disloyalty or infamy or otherwise stigmatize plaintiffs\u2019 reputation, with an attendant foreclosure from other employment or educational opportunities. <em>Cafeteria Workers </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>367 U.S. at 898, 81 S.Ct. at 1750; <em>see Wieman </em>v. <em>Updegraff, </em>344 U.S. 183, 190-191, 73 S.Ct. 215, 218, 97 L.Ed. 216 (1952); <em>Joint Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath, </em>341 U.S. at 140-141, 71 S.Ct. at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">However large and important the tuition reduction may seem to students on a tight budget, and possibly without income, in a constitutional perspective plaintiffs\u2019 interest is slight. In <em>Michelson v. Cox, </em>476 F.Supp. 1315, 1321 (S.D.Iowa, 1979), responding to a claim that a state university\u2019s review committee\u2019s failure to render detailed findings of fact in denying to reclassify student plaintiffs as residents for tuition purposes violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">... the property interest that plaintiff or any University of Iowa student has in the difference between the resident and nonresident tuition rate is slight both in an absolute monetary sense and relative to the other types of rights protected by the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 interests are not nearly as significant as the expectation of conditional freedom on parole urged by plaintiffs as an analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">\n<em>Government interest and function</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The governmental interest involved is the state\u2019s \u201clegitimate interest in protecting and preserving the quality of its colleges and universities and the right of its own bona fide residents to attend such institutions on a preferential tuition basis.\u201d <em>Vlan-dis v. Kline, </em>412 U.S. at 453, 93 S.Ct. at 2237. This interest is of broad significance because it implicates not only the financial resources of the state but also the opportunity of all Wisconsin high school graduates to obtain a college education.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">The governmental function involved is the state\u2019s fiscal management of its own internal affairs. Because a student will often be required to pay nonresident tuition while awaiting action by the Committee, the Committee\u2019s reversal of a Registrar\u2019s decision of nonresident status often requires disbursement from the state treasury. <em>Cf. Lister v. Board of Regents, </em>72 Wis.2d 282, 240 N.W.2d 610 (1976). Should the Committee affirm the Registrar\u2019s decision, the student must make a claim to the state legislature for refund of tuition overpayment under Wis.Stat. \u00a7 285.01 before filing an action on the debt in court. <em>Lister v. Board of Regents, </em>72 Wis.2d at 297, 240 N.W.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">Section 285.01 constitutes a consent by the state to be sued, a waiver of sovereign immunity, upon the condition that the claim be presented to the legislative claims committee. <em>Lister </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>72 Wis.2d at 297, 240 N.W.2d 610. This waiver suggests that in ordering a refund pursuant to reclassification, the Committee function is analogous to one which is traditionally immune from external interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Cases in which the government\u2019s control of others\u2019 activities is challenged are distinguishable on this point. From a practical perspective, the government need not regulate the commercial exchange of green stamps <em>(Federal Trade Commission v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 92 S.Ct. 898, 31 L.Ed.2d 170 (1972)) or stockyard rates <em>(Morgan v. United States, </em>304 U.S. 1, 58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. 1129 (1938)), for example, but it must regulate its treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>APPENDIX \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The burden imposed on the government by a requirement of a statement .pf reasons would presumably include the preparation of at least some minimal findings of fact in each case and some explanation of the reasoning by which the committee reached its decision on the basis of those facts. Because of the large number of appeals (four hundred eighty-eight in the two year period in question) and the large number of facts submitted by students in support of their appeals, \u201cthe preparation of detailed findings of fact in every case would entail considerable administrative expense and delay.\u201d <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>476 F.Supp. at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Because analysis of a student\u2019s intent as to bona fide residency is \u201cincapable of purely objective definition\u201d <em>(Lister v. Hoover, </em>655 F.2d at 126), often the Committee\u2019s reasons could not be expressed in a few objective factors or succinct principles. In order not to mislead, the Committee would be obliged to indicate somehow the weight to be given any objective factor mentioned. This would be a demanding task, because the \u201crelative weight to be given each objective factor is not capable of quantification.\u201d <em>Hooban v. Boling, </em>503 F.2d 648, 652 (6th Cir.1974) <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 920, 95 S.Ct. 1585, 43 L.Ed.2d 788 (1975). An adequate explanation would also entail a discussion of the student\u2019s demeanor and other facts affecting credibility. This would involve further administrative burdens and delay. These administrative burdens necessarily have an attendant financial cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">In sum, a requirement of a statement of reasons would impose significant administrative and fiscal burdens on the state in the management of its own internal fiscal affairs, an essential function traditionally immune from interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">\n<em>Probable value of requirement of statement of reasons</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Analysis of the probable value, if any, of a statement of reasons, begins with an evaluation of the risk of an erroneous deprivation of plaintiffs\u2019 property interest through the procedures now used. There are presently four opportunities for reclassification, each before a different body of decision-makers. Reconsideration of initial classification may be sought not only from the Registrar and the Committee, but from two other, independent branches of state government: the legislature and the state courts. The student has an opportunity to present to the Registrar and the Committee evidence not considered in the original classification. Before the Committee, at least, the student has an opportunity to appear and evidence his demeanor, credibility and any other subjective manifestations of intent. The Committee is not limited to a review to determine whether the Registrar\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious or not supported by any substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">Because the central issue of intent is subjective, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of plaintiffs\u2019 interests is incapable of objective qualification. I am convinced, however, that the four occasions for reclassification before several independent bodies, and the opportunities to present new evidence and to be heard, reasonably reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation to a slight chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">Plaintiffs assert that a statement of reasons would reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation in three ways: first, an explanation of reasons would permit plaintiffs to make better presentations and thus diminish the risk of erroneous deprivation in subsequent semesters; second, a requirement that reasons be given would lead to a higher incidence of correct decisions by the very body giving the reasons; third, an explanation of reasons would provide a sounder basis for review of the Committee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">Even if guiding future conduct is within the <em>concerns of </em>due <em>process, intent </em>remains the dispositive issue in a determination of residency. Informing a student that \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d are lacking, so that the student can</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>APPENDIX \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"AJu\">proceed to do \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d may well leave his or her intent unaffected. Evidence of changed conduct in response to an earlier Committee statement of reasons would have an uncertain effect on the accuracy of Committee decisions in subsequent semesters.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Because there is no substantial factual dispute in plaintiffs\u2019 case, and in residency cases in general, the utility of findings of fact would be quit\u00e9 small in practice, in minimizing erroneous decisions by the Committee itself. <em>Michelson, supra, </em>476 F.Supp. at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Legislative or judicial review of decisions is not an essential ingredient of the due process guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment. There is, for example, no federal constitutional right to state appellate review of state criminal convictions. <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em>351 U.S. 12, 18, 76 S.Ct. 585, 590, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956), <em>rehearing denied, </em>351 U.S. 958, 76 S.Ct. 844, 100 L.Ed. 1480 (1956); <em>Ross v. Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 610-611, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 2443-2444, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974). \u201cDue process of law guarantees \u2018no particular form of procedure; it protects substantial rights.\u2019 <em>N.L.R.B. v. Mackay Radio &amp; Tel. Co., </em>304 U.S. 333, 351 [58 S.Ct. 904, 913, 82 L.Ed. 1381]\u201d (1938); <em>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 610, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 1901, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974). Even when, as here, legislative and judicial review of the Committee\u2019s decisions is provided, the subjective nature of the dispositive issue of intent means that the risk of erroneous decisions by these reviewing bodies is unlikely to be significantly reduced by a Committee statement of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">In sum, the plaintiffs\u2019 property interest is relatively slight; the government\u2019s interest is significant; the governmental function is essential and traditionally immune from interference; to impose the requirement that reasons be given would be to impose significant administrative and fiscal burdens on the state; and the risk of erroneous decision under the procedures now used is reasonably minimized.</p>\n<p id=\"AtaC\">My conclusion that due process does not require that the Committee state reasons for a denial of resident status for tuition purposes is supported both by <em>Michelson v. Cox, </em>476 F.Supp. 1315, holding that due process does not demand findings of fact for denial of resident tuition status, and <em>Linwood v. Board of Education, City of Peoria, School District Number 150, Illinois, </em>463 F.2d 763 (7th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1027, 93 S.Ct. 475, 34 L.Ed.2d 320 (1972). Because Linwood was expelled from high school for gross disobedience and misconduct for allegedly attacking and striking other students, his interest is more significant than that of plaintiffs. Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit held that due process did not require that the decision be made in the form of a written opinion incorporating findings of fact upon which the decision is based. <em>Id., </em>at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">\n<em>Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Upon the basis of the entire record herein, it is ordered that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-11\">(1) Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-12\">(2) Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is granted, and this action is dismissed on its merits as to all claims by all plaintiffs against all defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-13\">Entered this 25th day of February, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-14\">By The Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-15\">/s/ James E.
