KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">Milan Bagaric, Mile Markich, Ante Lju-bas, Vinko Logarusic, Ranko Primorac, and Drago Sudar appeal from judgments of conviction in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, after a trial before Chief Judge Motley and a jury. Appellants urge reversal, relying not only on a series of claimed infirmities of the usual sort, but also upon this court\u2019s recent refusal to permit prosecution of a terrorist organization pursuant to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, where the Government failed to allege the group or its activities possessed any financial dimension or purpose. <em>See United States v. Ivic, </em>700 F.2d 51 (2d Cir.1983). We are asked to expand that holding to the facts of this case. We decline to do so, since the overwhelming proof at trial showed that the defendants, acting through their criminal enterprise, perpetrated an extensive international extortion scheme using the United States and foreign mails. In addition, the defendants directed numerous acts of violence against certain supporters of Yugoslavia. Because we also reject appellants\u2019 myriad other contentions, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-16\">The massive, complex and convoluted record of this thirteen-week trial established that appellants were members of a Croatian terrorist group operating principally in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, with participants in Cleveland, San Francisco, Toronto, South America, and Europe. Acting through their criminal enterprise, they perpetrated an international extortion scheme against \u201cmoderate Croatians\u201d and persons they believed to be supporters of the government of Yugoslavia, resorting to multiple acts of violence against those not sufficiently sympathetic to their cause. We chronicle the history of their activities in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">Operating from his home base in Chicago, Ante Ljubas began in late 1974 to recruit and hire persons to commit murders and bombings. In each case, the intended victim was to be an individual considered unsympathetic to the cause of Croatian independence from Yugoslavia. In time, Ljubas approached a long-time acquaintance, Frank Korenic, inquiring whether Korenic could obtain explosives, and requesting that Korenic introduce Ljubas to one Joe Neary. Neary, a notorious Chicago gangster, was a frequent customer at a restaurant where Korenic\u2019s ex-wife was a waitress, and the two men had known one another since 1973. Korenic took Ljubas to Neary\u2019s home, where Ljubas was introduced to Neary and another local gangster, Louis Almeida. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Ljubas told these two men he \u201cwas working with other people,\u201d and would be willing to pay well for a series of contract killings. He offered $20,000 for the first murder, and $10,000 for each of approximately ten additional assassinations. Neary and Almeida agreed to perform the killings. Accordingly, Ljubas gave them a photograph and the address of the first intended victim, John Badovinac. At that time, Badovinac was president of the Croatian Fraternal Union in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, an organization Ljubas regarded as pro-Yugoslavian.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In February, 1975, Neary and Almeida travelled to Pittsburgh, and went to Bado-vinac\u2019s office. Uncertain whether that was the best locale at which to carry out the murder, they drove to Badovinac\u2019s home address and \u201clook[ed] the place over[,] trying to figure out how ... to assassinate him there.\u201d Still undecided, they telephoned Badovinac\u2019s office, only to discover, from his secretary, that Badovinac was out of town attending a meeting. Neary and Almeida returned to Chicago to tell Ljubas of their frustration. The three men met at a restaurant near Ljubas\u2019s home, where Ljubas expressed his unhappiness that Neary and Almeida had not \u201c[gotten] the job done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In March, Neary and Almeida set off to Pittsburgh a second time. En route, they were stopped by Ohio police for speeding. A search of their car turned up a .38 Colt firearm with a four-inch barrel, a .380 automatic Barretta, a .380 Walther PPKS with silencer, and a photograph of Badovinac. Shortly after his arrest on firearms charges, Almeida told Illinois state police that Ante Ljubas had approached Neary and Almeida and hired them to murder a man in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Undeterred by the intervention of fate which spared Badovinac, Ljubas sought out co-appellant Milan Bagaric, and had Bagaric introduce him to Ante Caran.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bagaric and Ljubas demonstrated to Caran the nature and seriousness of their endeavor. Bagaric showed him explosives the two men were storing in Bagaric\u2019s basement, and Ljubas instructed Caran on techniques of bomb construction. Shortly thereafter, apparently convinced of Caran\u2019s <em>bona tides, </em>Ljubas asked Caran if he would be willing to recruit two men to bomb the Pittsburgh home of Milan Vranes, an officer of the Croatian Fraternal Union. Ljubas provided Caran with the address of Vranes\u2019s home in Pittsburgh and told Caran to pick up the bomb at Bagaric\u2019s apartment. Caran acquired the services of two friends, Andrija Skrabo and Vjelko Jaksic.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The three men went to Bagaric\u2019s home, where they were shown a bomb and timer device built by Bagaric. Skrabo and Jaksic drove to Pittsburgh with the bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">In Pittsburgh, the two men had difficulty locating Vranes\u2019s home. After consulting a local telephone directory, they drove to an address other than that provided by Ljubas. They set the timer on the bomb and left it in a snowbank near the sidewalk of that house, later learning from a radio broadcast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>that the bomb had exploded. Soon after, Bagaric informed them they had bombed the wrong house.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">This series of misadventures in Pittsburgh seems reminiscent of Inspector Clouseau-style bumbling. Unfortunately, tragedy soon replaced what had appeared to be a comedy of errors. Ljubas and Bagaric, undaunted, continued their private war, taking on new soldiers along the way. Beginning in early 1977, the members of the criminal enterprise began an operation to stockpile dynamite in the United States and to transport it for use in various cities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ljubas asked Caran to arrange for the use of an automobile \u201cto go to Canada to bring some explosive[s].\u201d Caran secured the assistance of Mico Jaksic, brother of Vjelko.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ljubas, Caran, and Mico Jaksic drove to Canada in Jaksic\u2019s car. Their destination was a small rural town, Elliott Lake, Ontario, site of the huge Dennison uranium mines, the ex-employer of appellant Mile Markich.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Upon arrival in Elliott Lake, Ljubas departed alone in the car. He rejoined Caran and Mico Jaksic twenty minutes later, with a bag containing approximately twenty sticks of dynamite which he showed the two men. The dynamite was manufactured by CIL Inc., a Canadian company, bore the coded manufacturing date D7 (signifying April, 1977 manufacture), and had been shipped in April and May of 1977 to Denni-son Mines. Ljubas, Caran, and Jaksic then drove to the Toronto area, where they stopped at the home of Milan Rukavina, a Croatian acquaintance of Caran. To ensure they would not be observed, they drove into Rukavina\u2019s garage, where Jaksic packed the dynamite into the door panels of the car. Blasting caps, also obtained by Ljubas, were separated from the dynamite and were stored \u201cunderneath the dashboard so they would blend in with the rest of the wires.\u201d Ljubas left the two men at this point, after instructing them to transport the contraband across the United States-Canada border and deliver it to Markich in Skokie, Illinois. Several days later, Caran travelled to Skokie, telephoned Markich to receive directions to the latter\u2019s home, and brought most of the dynamite and blasting caps to Markich, retaining some for his own use.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After Markich hid the explosives, the two men spoke briefly \u201c[a]bout Croatia and [the] Croatian cause.\u201d Caran returned to his home in Milwaukee, and later travelled to San Francisco. There, he went to the home of one Mile Boban, and left the explosives he had not given Markich. Bagaric came to San Francisco and wired the explosives into bombs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Also in mid-1977, appellants formalized and commenced their principal operation, a scheme to extort money from so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d Croatians in the United States. Ljubas travelled to West Germany, where he and others committed to the violent overthrow of the Belgrade government determined to adopt a tactic which had previously been employed by Algerian terrorists seeking independence from France. They would send letters to \u201cbad Croatians,\u201d demanding they provide financial support for appellants\u2019 criminal enterprise and also stating that, if they balked, reprisals would be carried out against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">Appellant Ranko Primorac headed up the extortion operation in the Los Angeles area, where a number of successful Croatians re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>sided. Primorac compiled a list of potential wealthy victims, and threatened \u201cto squeeze that [sic] people financially, and if they refuse, to be punished [sic] for example for rest of Croatians.\u201d Among other possible targets, Primorac named Steven B\u00fabalo, Krizan Brkic, Marko Zubcic, Frank Strisko-vitch, and Walter Rasic, all of whom later received extortion letters. The letters demanded that a specified sum of money, generally between $5,000 and $20,000, be mailed to a post office box in Asuncion, Paraguay, or \u201cyou will ... compel us to set a horrible example by making you the first object of the disciplinary rules.\u201d Miro Bar-esic, an unindicted co-racketeer, who participated in the enterprise\u2019s affairs during 1977 and 1978, <em>see infra, </em>maintained a box in the same postal office.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Having established, and set in motion, the extortion scheme, appellants proceeded on two fronts. First, they continued their bombing activities, as well as trafficking in firearms, committing arsons, and attempting additional murders independent of the extortions. At the same time, they began to carry out reprisals against a number of persons who had failed to heed the warnings in the extortion letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In April, 1978, Caran received a telephone call from Los Angeles. The caller instructed Caran to retrieve the explosives he had first stored at Boban\u2019s home, and later used in the unsuccessful attempt on the Yugoslavian Consulate, and to deliver them to Pri-morac and two other men, Miro Biosic and Baresic, in Los Angeles. Skrabo and a man named Ante Sisko delivered the bomb materials on Caran\u2019s behalf. After making the delivery, Skrabo joined Baresic, Primo-rac and several others, and together these men set fire to the Yugoslavian American Club in San Pedro, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Several months later, some of the Canadian dynamite turned up on the East Coast. On August 14, 1978, members of the New York City Bomb Squad disarmed and dismantled two bombs which had been placed in a library at the United Nations and in a locker at Grand Central Station. In a communique left with both bombs, a Croatian terrorist group claimed credit for the attempted bombings, and indicated they were intended to protest West Germany\u2019s decision to extradite to Yugoslavia one Stipe Bilandzic, a Croatian nationalist and close associate of Ljubas, Markich, and Primorac. The nine sticks of dynamite used in the two New York bombs were Cilgel D7 dynamite, a rare brand, yet precisely the one obtained by Ljubas during the Elliott Lake trip, and bearing the same date code. The electrical tape on the United Nations bomb was discovered to exhibit an \u201cend match\u201d with tape utilized in a bombing of the factory of one of the extortion victims, <em>see infra, </em>that is, both bombs were made with contiguous pieces cut from a single roll of black electrical tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">In mid-1978, Vjelko Jaksic, then residing in Milwaukee, planned a summer vacation in the San Francisco area. Caran asked him to pick up \u201csomething,\u201d which turned out to be a handgun equipped with silencer which Ljubas had offered to provide Caran. Ljubas had arranged for Bagaric to turn over the gun in Chicago. Vjelko and Mico Jaksic left Milwaukee for Chicago. Upon arrival, they spoke with Ljubas and Bagaric, and were informed that the weapon had been hidden in Markich\u2019s apartment. The Jaksics picked up the gun and silencer from Markich. In June, 1978, Vjelko Jaksic went to San Francisco for his holiday, stopping long enough to meet with Caran to deliver the gun and silencer. Caran later tried to use the gun, unsuccessfully, in an attempt to kill the Yugoslavian consul.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Nor did Vjelko Jaksic return to the mid-west empty handed. In late May or early June, Primorac had met with Caran in California, and asked Caran to transport weapons to New York. Primorac provided a Westchester telephone number, which Car-an was to call upon arrival in the metropolitan area, to be informed of the exact destination for the assorted rifles, machineguns, and ammunition he would be carrying. If Caran were unable to travel to the East Coast, he was to deliver the arsenal to the home of Ivan Misetic in Chicago. As it turned out, Vjelko Jaksic was the courier, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>rather than Caran. He brought the weapons to Chicago, en route to his home in Milwaukee. Eventually, the cache made its way to Irvington, a town in Westchester, and to Bridgeport, Connecticut. After Primorac had attempted to use one of the guns to murder a New York critic of the extortion scheme, Joseph Badurina, agents of the Joint Terrorism Task Force seized the weapons from Caran\u2019s home in Bridgeport, and from the Irvington home of Ivan Cale and Stipe Ivkosic, associates and fellow terrorists involved in the principal New York based faction of appellants\u2019 enterprise.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The violence threatened in the extortion letters began in the fall of 1978, several months after their mailing. On September 28, Westchester businessman Anthony Ciko-ja, who had received a letter but refused to pay, was shot and killed on his front lawn. Six weeks after Cikoja\u2019s murder, Chicago factory owner Danilo Nikolic, who had also received an extortion demand, narrowly missed becoming the second victim when a bomb exploded near the section of his plant where flammable liquids were stored. The bomb used in this attempt was prepared in the identical fashion, using the same roll of electrical tape, as the bombs made of Canadian Cilgel dynamite discovered at the United Nations and Grand Central Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In Los Angeles, attacks were carried out on several targets of the extortion scheme. Just after Labor Day, 1978, Primorac had asked Caran to leave his work in Sacramento for one week, to kill one Mario Forgiari-ni, a wealthy recipient of an extortion letter. Three weeks later, Primorac\u2019s roommate, Miro Biosic, met Caran at the Los Angeles airport, and after informing Caran that Primorac had decided to remain out of town because \u201che don\u2019t [sic] want to be around if anything is happening,\u201d handed Caran a gun and silencer and drove him to Forgiarini\u2019s house. Forgiarini never appeared. Despite Caran\u2019s failure to carry out the attempt on the life of Forgiarini, Primorac paid him the $700 week\u2019s wages Caran lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">In November, 1978, Caran moved to Los Angeles. There, he was introduced by Pri-morac to another Croatian named Mari jan Rudela. Acting on Primorac\u2019s instructions, Rudela asked Caran to assist him in murdering Forgiarini. This time, Caran declined, apparently having decided the proper approach was to \u201ckill some Yugoslavs, some enemy of our people, not the Croatians.\u201d Caran did not balk several days later, however, when Rudela suggested an alternative target, Marko Zubcic, another successful businessman who had been the recipient of an extortion letter. Caran and Rudela waited near Zubcic\u2019s place of business, intending to ambush him, but Zubcic never emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The next morning, Rudela suggested yet another victim, Krizan Brkic. Rudela drove to Brkic\u2019s residence and handed Caran the same gun and silencer that had previously been provided Caran by Primorac\u2019s roommate, Biosic, for the unsuccessful attempt on Forgiarini. Caran hid in bushes outside Brkic\u2019s home, and when Brkic appeared in the yard, Caran shot and killed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Over the next several months, a new form of violence was employed against the Los Angeles victims. On April 6, 1979, identical pipe bombs, constructed to explode upon impact and scatter metal shrapnel, caused property damage to the homes of Forgiarini and Frank Striskovitch, both of whom, along with Brkic and Zubcic, had been threatened by Primorac. On May 23, 1979, Rudela and another Croatian were killed in the process of arming yet another pipe bomb which detonated prematurely. At the time, Rudela was sitting in an automobile parked seventy feet from the home of extortion victim Martin Balov. According to Bagaric, \u201cWe had made a mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">In 1979, appellants conceived of still an additional reprisal tactic, the mailing of \u201cbook bombs,\u201d that is, hardcover books hollowed out, filled with a stick of dynamite and a blasting cap, and wired in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>fashion that the two naked wire ends would join as the book was opened, setting off a powerful explosion designed, in the words of Richard M. Rogers, a special agent examiner in the FBI Explosives Unit, simply \u201cto kill a human being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">On February 19, 1979, two of these book bombs were mailed, from Akron, Ohio, to Joseph Badurina, a Queens, New York journalist, and Father Timothy Majic, a Catholic priest in Milwaukee. Both men were Croatian nationalists, of significant influence in their home communities, who had taken explicit and adamant editorial positions against the use of violence. Remarkably, Father Majic was being interviewed by an FBI agent on the morning of February 26, when his mail arrived. The agent, seeing the priest about to open the cover of a black book and observing what appeared to be wires inside, seized the book instantly and threw it into a snowbank in the church courtyard. A police officer from the Milwaukee bomb squad separated the blasting cap from the dynamite, losing part of his hand in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">One week later, Badurina received a similar package. Aware of the unsuccessful attempt to kill Majic, Badurina alerted the FBI. The New York City bomb squad removed the package and disarmed the book.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">On April 4, detectives of the Cleveland Police Department obtained a warrant and searched the residence of appellant Vinko Logarusic. The search turned up a metal toolbox containing more than eight hundred rounds of ammunition and batteries, as well as a hollowed out book containing wires, a battery and a light bulb. This book, described by an FBI expert as the \u201cprototype, or perhaps test book, which was manufactured prior to the other two book bombs,\u201d was the same size as the ones mailed to Badurina and Father Majic, with a depth of exactly one and one-half inches, permitting a stick of dynamite to be placed flat inside. The glue in all three books was of the same chemical composition, the wire was the same gauge, the wires in all three were twisted into loops and L-shaped hooks, and, finally, all three books employed solder, rather than standard battery connectors, to hook the wire to the power source. Laboratory tests showed the same pair of pliers had been used to cut a wire in the bomb sent to Badurina and the one found in Lo-garusic\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">In August, 1979, Caran moved his family to Bridgeport, Connecticut. That autumn, he was approached by Ljubas in the Croatian Center in Manhattan. Ljubas asked whether Caran would be interested in learning to make bombs and teaching others, apparently primarily for use in Europe but in this country as well. Caran assented. Several months later, Caran was telephoned at work by appellant Drago Sudar, who informed Caran he had been sent by Lju-bas. After Caran picked up Sudar at the Croatian Center, the two men drove to Fairfield, Connecticut to purchase wires, a clock, a soldering iron, and gloves. From there they went to the apartment of a friend of Caran\u2019s in Bridgeport, where Su-dar taught Caran how to put together a time bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Caran\u2019s lesson could not be completed, however, because the two men had been unable to purchase blasting caps in Fair-field. Several weeks later, Ljubas, who had come to the East Coast, offered to have blasting caps delivered to Caran (as well as arranging for Caran to be paid $2,000 to travel to Europe to pass on the skills he had acquired from Sudar). On July 5, 1980, Bagaric\u2019s wife delivered to Caran, at the latter\u2019s Bridgeport home, two blasting caps.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">In September, 1980, Sudar returned to Bridgeport to resume the bomb construction lessons. After detailing his recent trip to California to teach bombmaking to other Croatians (including the brother of Marijan Rudela), Sudar described to Caran \u201chow to make bombs in the drawer, in the door, in the car, and in the book. In the book ... is most dangerous, you got to be very, very careful to make a bomb.\u201d Sudar demonstrated to Caran the preparation of time bombs.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">On June 25, 1981, Sudar was arrested at his home in Toronto, Canada, on an extradition warrant. Detectives of the Peel Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>gional Police Department searched his home, discovering and seizing a watch, batteries, light bulbs for automobile directional signals, tape, and coiled and color coded wires. One of the nine-volt batteries seized had its terminals filled with solder, in a manner similar to that used in the book bombs from the United Nations, Grand Central Terminal, and Logarusic\u2019s home. <em>The Indictment, Racketeering Counts and Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">By indictment S 81 Cr. 402, superseding and consolidating two earlier instruments and filed on June 30, 1981, Bagaric, Markich, Ljubas, Logarusic, Primorac, and Sudar were charged with violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Count One charged conspiracy to violate the racketeering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961, 1962(d), and Count Two alleged a substantive violation, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1961, 1962(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On July 8, the United States Government filed with Canadian authorities an application for the extradition of Sudar, and on September 11, a warrant of committal was entered by a Canadian court, ordering Sudar\u2019s extradition on Count One of S 81 Cr. 402 only. On July 28, a second superseding indictment, SS 81 Cr. 402, had named all appellants in the same two counts as S 81 Cr. 402. But, as Sudar had been formally extradited on S 81 Cr. 402, he could not be tried on SS 81 Cr. 402. Accordingly, on January 21, 1982, the district court ordered consolidation of the two indictments, Fed.R.Crim.P. 13; <em>see United States v. Halper, </em>590 F.2d 422, 428-29 (2d Cir.1978).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Trial commenced on February 16, 1982, and continued for thirteen weeks. On May 15, after approximately six days of deliberations, the jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts against Ljubas, Markich, Pri-morac, and Bagaric. Sudar was convicted of the single conspiracy count on which he was tried. Logarusic was convicted of conspiracy and acquitted on the substantive offense. The district court sentenced Lju-bas and Primorac to terms of imprisonment of twenty years on each count, to run consecutively. Markich and Bagaric received prison terms of twenty years under Count One and ten years under Count Two, such terms also to be served consecutively. Lo-garusic and Sudar were both sentenced to terms of imprisonment of twenty years on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the conspiracy count. All convicted defendants have appealed, raising a multitude of contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The difficult threshold question posed for consideration is whether, in light of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Ivic, supra, </em>the conduct charged in the indictment and proved at trial constituted an offense under RICO. In <em>Ivic, </em>a panel of this court concluded that a prosecution may not properly be brought pursuant to \u00a7 1962(c) when the Government does not charge that either the enterprise, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4), or the predicate acts which make up the alleged pattern of racketeering activity, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1961(1), (5), possess some financial purpose. <em>United States v. Ivic, supra, </em>at 64. In this case the charges and proof all relate to a terrorist organization, \u201cmotivated\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by political as well as economic goals, and claimed to have engaged in economic crimes \u201cto obtain money to further [its] activities,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 61 n. 6 (reserving issue of applicability of RICO to such cases). We are called upon to decide whether this case, falling somewhere between the complete absence of financial purpose or activity, on the one hand, and an enterprise engaged solely in siphoning monies from, and infiltrating, legitimate businesses, <em>e.g., United States v. Scotto, </em>641 F.2d 47 (2d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 961, 101 S.Ct. 3109, 69 L.Ed.2d 971 (1981), on the other, is within the purview of RICO. For several reasons, we conclude it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Relying on isolated language in <em>Ivic, </em>appellants argue the Government is required to prove an ultimate and overriding financial motive to secure a RICO conviction. The <em>Ivic </em>court nowhere stated, however, that economic gain must be the sole motive of every RICO enterprise. Such a rule, we believe, would run counter to fundamental principles of criminal law and risk the politicization of criminal trials. We reject appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Although evidence of motives or purposes underlying criminal behavior is normally admissible, provided certain criteria of reliability are met, Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d 934, 939 (2d Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Houlihan, </em>332 F.2d 8, 15 (2d Cir.) (financial motive), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 828, 85 S.Ct. 56, 13 L.Ed.2d 37 (1964), motive itself is not generally an element of a particular offense. <em>Compare United States v. Pomponio, </em>429 U.S. 10, 11, 97 S.Ct. 22, 23, 50 L.Ed.2d 12 (1976), <em>with United States v. Cioffi, </em>493 F.2d 1111, 1119 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 917, 95 S.Ct. 195, 42 L.Ed.2d 155 (1974). And, when Congress has required proof of motive, it has generally done so for behavior not deemed blameworthy absent the immoral motive, and not otherwise punishable. So, for example, it may be permissible under various circumstances to communicate with a judge to offer mitigating information relevant to sentence, <em>e.g., United States v. Fasolino, </em>449 F.Supp. 586, 587 (W.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>586 F.2d 939 (2d Cir.1978), but \u201can endeavor to exploit\u201d a friendship with the judge may be found to be a \u201ccorrupt\u201d motive, 586 F.2d at 941 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">RICO demands no such inquiry. The offenses it proscribes are, in the main, activities punishable irrespective of motives for performance, and accordingly they are provable by showing mens rea in the typical fashion. Hence, no additional scienter requirement is imposed by the statute. <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>ed States v. Boylan, </em>620 F.2d 359, 361-62 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 833, 101 S.Ct. 103, 66 L.Ed.2d 38 (1980). To carry out a deeper inquiry into long-term or ultimate motive would be to require adjudication of a factor traditionally deemed not exculpatory. <em>E.g., United States v. Starks, </em>515 F.2d 112, 124 (3d Cir.1975) (Hobbs Act applies to extortions committed for religious \u201cpurposes\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977); <em>United States v. Cullen, </em>454 F.2d 386, 392 (7th Cir. 1971) (Stevens, J.) (\u201cAppellant\u2019s professed unselfish motivation, rather than a justification, actually identifies a form of arrogance which organized society cannot tolerate.\u201d). Moreover, such an exercise would embroil courts and jurors in a controversy essentially irrelevant to the purpose of the statute under consideration. Whether appellants extorted money for the long-term political purpose of effecting the separation of Croatia from Yugoslavia, whether this formed part, but not all, of their \u201cmotivation,\u201d or whether the freedom of their former province is an issue they care about not at all, the effect of their activities on the national economy is identical. The <em>Ivic </em>court described RICO as a device to prevent (and reverse) \u201cthe draining of] billions of dollars from America\u2019s economy by unlawful conduct,\u201d <em>United States v. Ivic, supra, </em>at 62. This effect is accomplished whatever considerations compel the creation and execution of an extortion scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">RICO\u2019s liberal construction provision, Pub.L. No. 91-452, \u00a7 904(a), 84 Stat. 922, 947, was deemed irrelevant in <em>Ivic, </em>\u201csince ... construing RICO to cover terrorist activities ... would in no way \u2018effectuate its remedial purposes,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 65 n. 8, where there is no allegation or proof the enterprise\u2019s \u201cactivities generate monies which can serve as a \u2018springboard into the sphere of legitimate [business],\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 63. In the case before us today, it is clear that, irrespective of the motive which appellants would have us believe spurred them to action, the remedial purposes of RICO are directly implicated. Pursuant to the direction of section 904(a), we decline to add an element of proof which would hamper the effective implementation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Further, investigation into motive would serve only to politicize, and otherwise inflame, RICO prosecutions. As discussed in greater detail <em>infra, </em>defense counsel sought to inject peripheral political and religious considerations into -the trial of this case, implying that appellants\u2019 anti-Communism or Catholicism, or their persecution by American and Yugoslavian officials acting in concert, justifiably drove them to commit the acts of extortion and violence charged in the indictment. These suggestions\u2014 which ultimately formed no part of the defense case of appellants who testified or presented witnesses \u2014 were, viewed charitably, misguided. They can only have served to patronize the jury and to add a distracting element of emotionalism to the proceedings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An interpretation of RICO requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ing proof of long-term pecuniary objectives which in some sense can be said to supersede accompanying political or religious ones would invite a repetition of this conduct. It would authorize the admission of evidence of political beliefs, racial animosities, and family and blood feuds as justifications for criminal acts. Because we believe Congress, and the traditions of our criminal law, contemplate trials free of consideration of such issues, we reject appellants\u2019 argument that economic motive must surmount all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Appellants appear to argue also that the enterprise itself, rather than the predicate acts of racketeering, must be shown to yield financial gain. This contention is supported neither by a careful reading of the <em>Ivic </em>opinion nor by reference to the underlying purposes of RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-20\">The literal terms of the narrow <em>Ivic </em>holding require no more than an objective appraisal that some economic purpose was to be accomplished by the crime charged: \u201cWe hold that when an indictment does not charge that an enterprise <em>or </em>the predicate acts have <em>any </em>financial purpose, it does not state a crime under [RICO].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65 (emphasis supplied). Additionally, this court has recognized that the nature of the misconduct often provides the best clue toward defining the enterprise. We have upheld application of RICO to situations where the enterprise was, in effect, no more than the sum of the predicate racketeering acts. <em>United States v. Mazzei, </em>700 F.2d 85 at 88-89 (2d Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Errico, </em>635 F.2d 152, 156 (2d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>453 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 3142, 69 L.Ed.2d 994 (1981); <em>United States v. Altese, </em>542 F.2d 104, 106 (2d Cir.1976) (per curiam), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1039, 97 S.Ct. 736, 50 L.Ed.2d 750 (1977). These decisions reflect the common sense recognition that a group of individuals may join together, and therefore be \u201cassociated in fact,\u201d \u00a7 1961(4), although not a legally cognizable entity in one of the traditional forms, <em>id., </em>solely for the purpose of conducting their activities. That is, it is logical to characterize any associative group in terms of what it <em>does, </em>rather than by abstract analysis of its structure. <em>See also United States v. Chovanec, </em>467 F.Supp. 41, 44-45 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (enterprise need not be a group having characteristics of \u201corganized crime,\u201d since Congress enumerated acts \u201cwith no restrictions limiting [RICO] to persons with particular affiliations\u201d); <em>United States v. Vignola, </em>464 F.Supp. 1091, 1095-97 (E.D.Pa.) (same), <em>aff\u2019d without opinion, </em>605 F.2d 1199 (3d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, 444 </em>U.S. 1072, 100 S.Ct. 1015, 62 L.Ed.2d 753 (1980); <em>cf. United States v. Roselli, </em>432 F.2d 879, 885-86 (9th Cir.1970) (rejecting contention that \u201cbusiness enterprise,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952, reaches only \u201cbusinesses] ... associated with or controlled by a clandestine criminal organization\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Moreover, even where the enterprise is one of the legal entities listed in \u00a7 1961(4), and proof of that element diverges from the proof of a pattern of racketeering, we think the requisite economic dimension may be demonstrated through the latter. Section 1961(4) appears to contemplate application of RICO to enterprises which, for example, are not themselves profit-making, or reinvest all their funds. <em>Cf. United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 580-81, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (in \u00a7 1961(4), use of word \u201cany\u201d in clause dealing with unions and individuals associated in fact signals congressional intent to impose no restriction upon associations embraced by definition; illegitimate associations therefore included); <em>United States v. Angelilli, </em>660 F.2d 23, 30-31 (2d Cir.1981) (New York City Civil Court held a RICO \u201centerprise;\u201d use of word \u201cany\u201d indicates intent to make list all-inclusive, and \u201cany being whose existence is recognized by law is within the term \u2018enterprise\u2019 \u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1442, 71 L.Ed.2d 657 (1982). The situation reached by \u00a7 1962 may thus not always be one in which the enterprise \u201cmakes money\u201d for its members. Yet, even absent a requirement that the enterprise be a profit-making one, the section implements the principal congressional purpose, \u201cthe elimination of the infiltration of organized crime and racketeering into legitimate organizations operating in interstate commerce,\u201d S.Rep. No. 617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 76 (1969), in two significant ways. First, by \u201cstriking at the source of the problem,\u201d <em>United States v. Turkette, supra, 452 </em>U.S. at 593, 101 S.Ct. at 2533, that is, proscribing the racketeering activities demonstrably capable of providing \u201ca springboard into the sphere of legitimate enterprise[s],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 591, 101 S.Ct. at 2533, whether \u201cprofit-making\u201d or otherwise, Congress sought to make RICO preventive as well as remedial. Second, since non-profit corporations (as well as entirely illegitimate associations of individuals, <em>see id. </em>at 588-93, 101 S.Ct. at 2531-33; <em>United States v. Maz-zei, supra, </em>at 88-90) compete within the economy for funds and services, it would have been counter-productive to exempt from the statute those invested in, acquired, or maintained through a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Accordingly, the Government may meet its obligation to show \u201cfinancial purpose\u201d through either the enterprise or the predicate acts of racketeering.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">We recognize that, read in isolation, language in <em>I vie </em>can be taken to support a requirement that, quite apart from the nature of the predicate acts, the enterprise itself must be \u201cthe sort of entity one joins to make money.\u201d <em>United States v. Ivic, supra, </em>at 60. The court noted the usage of \u201centerprise\u201d in other parts of \u00a7 1962, concluded it referred to \u201cthe sort of entity in which funds can be invested and a property interest of some sort acquired,\u201d <em>id., </em>and applied the same definition to subsection (c). Initially, we note this language is dictum, and differs from the holding of the case, which stated only that because <em>neither </em>the acts charged <em>nor </em>the purpose of the enterprise was economic, the indictment was outside the scope of \u00a7 1962(c). More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>significantly, the context in which it was employed persuades us the panel had no intention of insisting the necessary showing of economic purpose be confined to the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><em>Ivic </em>involved a group of individuals associated in fact. That phrase is defined in the portion of \u00a7 1961(4) designed to bring within \u00a7 1962 the commission of criminal acts related, in any one of several ways, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(a), (b), (c), to enterprises with ascertainable associative structures but not one of those enumerated in the other part of \u00a7 1961(4). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Huber, </em>603 F.2d 387, 394 (2d Cir.1979) (group of corporations not legally related may be \u201cgroup of individuals associated in fact;\u201d otherwise \u201c[o]ne could simply transfer assets from the corporation whose affairs had been conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity to another corporation whose affairs had up to that point not been so conducted\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 927, 100 S.Ct. 1312, 63 L.Ed.2d 758 (1980). If the statute did not include this definition of enterprise, there might occur \u201cthe anomolous [sic] result that a large scale underworld operation which engaged solely in trafficking of heroin would not be subject to RICO\u2019s enhanced sanctions, whereas small-time criminals jointly engaged in infrequent sales of contraband drugs and illegal handguns arguably could be prosecuted under RICO.\u201d <em>United States v. Mazzei, supra, </em>at 89. And, as noted, we have sanctioned RICO prosecutions where the enterprise and the predicate acts of racketeering, although of course separate and necessary elements of \u00a7 1962(c), need not be proved by distinct and independent proof. The <em>Ivic </em>panel\u2019s consideration of the meaning of \u201centerprise\u201d in subsections (a) and (b) therefore amounted to no more than support for its ultimate conclusion that economic purpose must be shown in <em>either </em>the proof of enterprise <em>or </em>the proof of predicate acts. In <em>Ivic, </em>the two were functionally equivalent, and \u201cthe proof used to establish [them] ... coalesce[d],\u201d <em>United States v. Turkette, supra, </em>452 U.S. at 583, 101 S.Ct. at 2528. The problem for the Government was that no proof established (nor did the indictment allege) that the group\u2019s \u201cactivities [were] designed to obtain, [or] in fact yield[ed], any money whatsoever.\u201d <em>United States v. Ivic, supra, </em>at 63.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">This case fits well within the principles we have enunciated. The core of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>enterprise was the commission of more than fifty acts of the classic economic crime of extortion, and many of the violent crimes perpetrated were in aid of the extortion scheme. They were carried out either to compel payment or in retaliation for refusal to meet appellants\u2019 extortionate demands. Indeed, the Assistant United States Attorney said in his opening statement to the jury that appellants sought to extort money from \u201cmoderate Croatians [to] help finance [their] criminal enterprise,\u201d and emphasized that \u201cthis extortion scheme ... is one of the centerpieces of this criminal case.\u201d The first ten Government witnesses were extortion victims or widows of murdered extortion victims and proof of economic crimes continued throughout the lengthy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The indictment and proof in this prosecution were consistent with the language and purposes of RICO. We decline to impose upon the Government an obligation to show pure or ultimate economic motive in any of the various formulations urged by appellants. Although we have previously noted, <em>United States v. Huber, supra, </em>603 F.2d at 395-96, and we repeat the admonition here, \u201cthat the potentially broad reach of RICO poses a danger of abuse [when the statute is] applped] ... to situations for which it was not primarily intended,\u201d our obligation is \u201cto rule on actual, as opposed to hypothetical, applications of the statute,\u201d <em>United States v. Weisman, </em>624 F.2d 1118, 1123 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 871, 101 S.Ct. 209, 66 L.Ed.2d 91 (1980), and it is clear to us that the present one was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Numerous claims unrelated to the <em>I vie </em>issue have been advanced. We shall first consider those applicable to all appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Alleging repeated and persistent instances of improper prosecutorial comment, appellants claim they were deprived of a fair trial. They challenge a number of statements as derogatory of defendants or their counsel, as injecting into the trial the prosecutor\u2019s personal belief the defendants were lying, or as exceeding the appropriate bounds of cross-examination. Although appellants have fashioned a superficially impressive compilation of alleged misconduct, and although some remarks by the Government were perhaps ill-advised,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> when read in the context of the entire record of this thirteen-week trial, <em>United States v. Socony Vacuum Oil Co., </em>310 U.S. 150, 242, 60 S.Ct. 811, 853, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940); <em>United States v. Bivona, </em>487 F.2d 443, 446-47 (2d Cir.1973); see <em>United States v. White, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>pra, </em>486 F.2d at 206 (prejudice less likely in \u201clong and hotly contested trial\u201d), the Government\u2019s statements did not prejudice appellants\u2019 right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The Assistant\u2019s opening remarks to the jury were concise and free of rhetoric. Apart from a single remark that this case \u201cis important ... because the office [the prosecutors] represent is responsible for enforcing .. . federal laws,\u201d into which appellants manage to read an appeal to the jury\u2019s patriotism, the prosecutor adhered closely to the facts and indictment. He ended by asking the jury to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">approach your responsibilities as jurors in this case in the spirit of the utmost seriousness and fairness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">... I urge you to listen carefully as the proof is presented in this case. Again, I remind you to be patient, that only one witness can testify at a time. I am confident that you are going to do that and I am equally confident that you are going to see that the defendants on trial here have a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In marked contrast, appellants\u2019 counsel began, before a single witness had testified, to interject extraneous and potentially inflammatory considerations into the proceedings. Ljubas\u2019s trial attorney, for example, told the jury that Ljubas was the victim of \u201cthe Communists and the Secret Police of Yugoslavia, which was trained by the Russian Secret Police;\u201d \u201cthat attempts [on Lju-bas\u2019s life] were made by the Communist Secret Police known as UDBA, which is the Communist Secret Police of Yugoslavia that has agents throughout this country and in various Yugoslavian embassies throughout this country;\u201d \u201cthat [Ljubas] was [in Rome in 1970] as a devout Catholic;\u201d and that \u201c[t]he first Croatian Saint was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1970 and there were many Croatians that went to Rome.\u201d The Government\u2019s witnesses, yet to testify, were characterized as \u201ctraitors, double agents, or Communist Secret Police, trying to infiltrate and destroy people in good standing.\u201d This collection of statements reflects the substance of the entire opening, which takes up only five pages in the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The second defense counsel, representing Markich, continued this approach. Markich was labelled a victim of the \u201cYugoslavian Police.\u201d Counsel then implied the Government\u2019s case served only to advance goals of the Yugoslavian Secret Police force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">... You are going to hear how [Mar-kich] is victimized. You are going to hear about the entire story, why he is here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">Now, [Ljubas\u2019s trial counsel] has told you about the Secret Police. That\u2019s going to be part of this entire trial. It\u2019s going to be part of it from the beginning to the end. You are going to hear it from the government\u2019s own witnesses, about the Yugoslavian Police, and what they do and how they do it and how they get their goals, and the object of those individuals who are here or over there are to suppress the people who speak out for freedom. That is the greatest crime of Mr. Markic [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Counsel for Primorac ended his, also brief, opening with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">I submit to you that [Primorac] wasn\u2019t part of any conspiracy or criminal enterprise of worldwide or local or of any import, but rather that he is himself a victim of political persecution, and unfortunately the evidence will show that the United States Government through the offices of [the two prosecutors] is being used to persecute this man, and this is being done by a foreign country, a communist country, if you will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">Each of the remaining defense attorneys engaged in similar conduct, including references to political or religious persecution in Yugoslavia and the alleged victimization of their clients in this country. More than oblique hints were given that the United States Government was acting at the behest of officials in Belgrade:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">Somehow [Logarusic] has been put into the [prosecution], either by the government informant or by the government itself or God knows, and somebody said, by the secret police. And if you think that was made up, listen carefully to the evidence in this case, because more things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>go on in this heaven and earth than you would suspect, especially in a case that involves foreign countries and American foreign policy and our relationships with European countries and communist countries in 1982, in 1981, in 1980.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Thus, from the first, defense counsel sought to put in question the legitimacy of this prosecution and the Government\u2019s reasons for pursuing it, as well as presenting irrelevant and potentially prejudicial political and religious matters. We have repeatedly held that the Government is ordinarily permitted to respond to arguments impugning the integrity of its case, <em>e.g., United States v. Miller, </em>478 F.2d 1315, 1318 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 851, 94 S.Ct. 144, 38 L.Ed.2d 100 (1973), and to \u201creply with rebutting language suitable to the occasion.\u201d <em>United States v. Praetorius, </em>622 F.2d 1054, 1061 (2d Cir.1979) (citations omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>449 U.S. 860, 101 S.Ct. 162, 66 L.Ed.2d 76 (1980). We thus consider the specific categories of alleged prosecutorial conduct, mentioned above, as having occurred in the unfortunate context of appellants\u2019 own making. <em>United States v. LaSorsa, </em>480 F.2d 522, 526 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 855, 94 S.Ct. 157, 38 L.Ed.2d 105 (1973).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The instances where the prosecutor is alleged unfairly to have engaged in name-calling or disparagement of defendants all constitute fair comment. For example, references to appellant Ljubas as a \u201cman of peace\u201d or \u201cthe Croatian Albert Schweitzer\u201d were direct responses to defense counsel\u2019s effort, on direct examination, to portray Ljubas as a religious figure whose sole diversions were participation in the affairs of his church and religious pilgrimages. The Government had a right to rebut this defense tactic, <em>cf. United States v. Marrale, supra, </em>695 F.2d at 667 (\u201cpermissible desire to dispute defense histrionics\u201d), and the use of rhetorical devices such as sarcasm was permissible, <em>United States v.

(\u201cTo shear [the prosecutor] of all oratorical emphasis, while leaving wide latitude to the defense, is to load the scales of justice; it is to deny what has always been an accepted incident of jury trials, except in those jurisdictions where any serious execution of the criminal law has yielded to a ghostly phantom of the innocent man falsely convicted.\u201d), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>268 U.S. 706, 45 S.Ct. 640, 69 L.Ed. 1168 (1925).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Similarly without merit is the contention the prosecutor relied on the prestige of his office to improperly vouch for the credibility of the Government\u2019s case, or attack that of the defense. The long list of examples of alleged misbehavior is not only lifted from the cold record of an eleven-hour summation which comprises over three hundred transcript pages, <em>see United States v. White, supra, </em>486 F.2d at 206, but it includes only one statement which arguably implied the existence of extraneous proof, or of a requirement that special credence be accorded the office of the United States Attorney, <em>United States v. Modica, supra, </em>663 F.2d at 1179. All other arguments and characterizations were confined to the proof, and were \u201cfairly based on record evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Canniff, </em>521 F.2d 565, 571 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1059, 96 S.Ct. 796, 46 L.Ed.2d 650 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The cross-examination techniques employed by the Assistant were also proper. Characterizations of Ljubas as \u201ca man of peace\u201d already have been discussed. And supposed attempts to compel defendants to rebut the veracity of the Government\u2019s witnesses in fact amounted to no more than requests that they characterize testimony already in evidence, concerning events in which they were alleged to have participated, as accurate or inaccurate. Indeed, on direct examination, the same or similar questions were asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In sum, although we believe the Government would have been better advised to avoid entirely the use of words and phrases such as \u201clie,\u201d \u201cpreposterous,\u201d \u201csham,\u201d and \u201cinsulting to [the jury\u2019s] intelligence,\u201d <em>but see United States v. Hysohion, </em>439 F.2d 274, 277-79 (2d Cir.1971), its conduct here was largely responsive to the prosecutor-baiting tactics chosen by appellants, and involved almost exclusively characterizations of record testimony rather than appeals to Government expertise or extrinsic, unutilized evidence. Viewed in context, the Government\u2019s remarks constituted fair argument, and if errors were committed, they were neither significant nor did they prejudice appellants. <em>United States v. Socony Vacuum Oil Co., supra, </em>310 U.S. at 239-40, 60 S.Ct. at 851-52. The jury\u2019s discriminating acquittal of four defendants (and partial acquittal of Logaru-sic) demonstrates it was able to rely on the evidence adduced. <em>United States v. White, supra, </em>486 F.2d at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\n<em>The Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Appellants contend the indictment was defective. They argue the pattern of racketeering failed to particularize the predicate acts in which each defendant was alleged to have been involved. This lack of specificity is claimed to have deprived appellants of notice of the charges against them and thereby to have thwarted effective trial preparation. This argument is without merit. An indictment need only track the language of the statute and, if necessary to apprise the defendant \u201cof the nature of the accusation against him,\u201d <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 765, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 1047, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962), state time and place in approximate terms. <em>United States v. Salazar, </em>485 F.2d 1272, 1277. (2d Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 985, 94 S.Ct. 1579, 39 L.Ed.2d 882 (1974). The indictment in this case clearly met this requirement. So, for example, subparagraphs 13.B. and C. allege \u201c[the following] acts [or] threats ...: B. Arson with explosives of the home of Milan Vranes, in the vicinity of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on and [sic] about January 4, 1977. C. Transportation of dynamite from Canada to the vicinity of Chicago, Illinois, in and [sic] around the spring, 1977.\u201d The remaining paragraphs are similarly sufficient. <em>See </em>Joint App. at A-56 to -59.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The claim that preparation for trial could not be undertaken without knowledge of which defendants were to be tied to the individual racketeering acts is more appropriately addressed to a bill of particulars, Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(f); <em>United States v. Murray, </em>297 F.2d 812, 819 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 U.S. 828, 82 S.Ct. 845, 7 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962), and in any event precisely this information was provided by the Government six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>months before trial. A letter was sent listing each of the subparagraphs of paragraph 13 of the indictment and attributing each racketeering act to one or more defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<em>The Jury Charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Several elements of the jury charge are said to have been in error. First, appellants contend the jury was led to believe that conspiracy to commit the predicate acts constituted conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1962(c). We think Chief Judge Motley\u2019s instruction on conspiracy to violate RICO, which appears in large part to have followed the Supreme Court\u2019s recent elucidation of the statutory elements, <em>see generally United States v. Turkette, supra, </em>452 U.S. at 578-83, 101 S.Ct. at 2526-28, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The- court first charged that \u201ca criminal enterprise as defined in the statute [must have] existed,\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant you have under consideration [must have been] associated with that enterprise.\u201d \u201cEnterprise\u201d was defined in detail. The jury was informed that the enterprise need not have a name, or be a commonly recognized legal entity, but could be a \u201cgroup of individuals who are associated in fact although not a legal entity. Thus, any group of persons who associate together in order to achieve common illegal purposes can constitute a criminal enterprise under the statute.\u201d <em>Compare id. </em>at 583, 101 S.Ct. at 2528 (\u201cThe enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.\u201d) And, the court stated that the jury \u201cmust find that a group of individu\u00e1is in fact associated together for the purposes charged in the indictment \u2014 that is, to carry out a pattern of murders, arsons, extor-tions, and racketeering travel \u2014 and that the defendant you have under consideration was one such individual who associated himself with that criminal enterprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Turning to the conspiracy element here under attack, the judge stated that this necessitated the defendant \u201cunlawfully, knowingly and willfully conspired with others to conduct the enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,\u201d language derived directly from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d), and further distinguished from conspiracy merely to commit predicate acts of racketeering by the language which immediately followed: \u201cthat is, that the defendant conspired to commit at least two acts or threats ... in aid of racketeering in the course of the activities of the enterprise.\u201d This instruction was well within the meaning of our cases. <em>See United States v. Scotto, supra, </em>641 F.2d at 54 (one conducts activities of enterprise through pattern of racketeering when predicate offenses are simply related to activities of enterprise); <em>United States v. Weisman, supra, </em>624 F.2d at 1122 (pattern of racketeering activity must be done \u201cin the conduct of the affairs of an \u2018enterprise\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Appellants also argue the court was obliged to charge the elements of the penal codes of the various states where acts of racketeering occurred, and was not permitted to rely upon generic definitions of murder, arson, and extortion. We disagree. Under RICO, as under the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952; <em>see United States v. Nardello, </em>393 U.S. 286, 289-95, 89 S.Ct. 534, 536-39, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969), \u201c[s]tate offenses are included by generic designation.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4007, 4032. \u201cCourts construing the racketeering statutes have found that the references to state law serve a definitional purpose, to identify generally the kind of activity made illegal by the federal stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ute.\u201d <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>564 F.2d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 951, 98 S.Ct. 1577, 55 L.Ed.2d 800 (1978); <em>see United States v. Frumento, </em>563 F.2d 1083, 1087 n. 8A (3d Cir.1977) (\u201cSection 1961 requires, in our view, only that the <em>conduct </em>on which the federal charge is based be typical of the serious crime dealt with by the state statute, not that the .particular defendant be \u2018chargeable under State law,\u2019 at the time of the federal indictment.\u201d) (emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1072, 98 S.Ct. 1256, 55 L.Ed.2d 775 (1978). Absent an allegation that the racketeering act is not prohibited <em>at all </em>under state law, <em>cf. United States v. Nardello, supra, </em>393 U.S. at 295, 89 S.Ct. at 539, a claim obviously not available to appellants here, accurate generic definitions of the crimes charged were sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Finally, the court\u2019s charges on \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d and the \u201cknowledge\u201d element of conspiracy were detailed and correct. The language for the former came from the statute, and was similar to instructions we have upheld. <em>E. g., United States v. Scotto, supra, </em>641 F. 2d at 53-54. As to \u201cknowledge,\u201d the charge provided precisely the protection appellants now claim was lacking, since the district court first defined the objective of the \u201coverall\u201d conspiracy, <em>United States v. Tramunti, </em>513 F.2d 1087, 1111-12 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 832, 96 S.Ct. 54, 46 L.Ed.2d 50 (1975), and then required the Government to demonstrate \u201can agreement as to the objective of the conspiracy. This does not mean that the conspirators must be shown to have agreed on the details of their criminal enterprise, but it does mean that the essential nature of the plan must be shown to have been agreed upon.\u201d And, \u201cmere knowledge by a defendant of the conspiracy or any illegal act on the part of an alleged co-conspirator is not sufficient to establish his relationship in the conspiracy. You must find ... actual knowing participation of [the] defendant [under consideration] in the agreement .... \u201d <em>See United States v. Gleason, </em>616 F.2d 2, 16-17 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1082, 100 S.Ct. 1037, 62 L.Ed.2d 767 (1980).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>We turn to an examination of the claims raised by individual appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\n<em>Bagaric</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Bagaric advances two contentions. Initially, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. Viewing the evidence most favorably to the prosecution, and crediting every inference in its favor as we must at this stage of the case, <em>United States v. Singh, </em>628 F.2d 758, 759, 765-66 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1034, 101 S.Ct. 609, 66 L.Ed.2d 496 (1980), we conclude the evidence elicited from four accomplice witnesses (Caran, Skrabo, Vjelko Jaksic, and Mico Jaksic), <em>see United States v. Bermudez, </em>526 F.2d 89, 99 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 970, 96 S.Ct. 2166, 48 L.Ed.2d 793 (1976), was more than sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Bagaric\u2019s participation in the enterprise commenced as early as 1975. That year, he showed Caran weapons and explosives he and Ljubas were storing in Bagaric\u2019s basement. Caran testified Bagaric concealed the explosives in a mound of coal. Efforts were made on cross-examination to ridicule this testimony (by, for example, suggesting Bagaric did not heat his home with coal, Caran had not seen a shovel or furnace, and the pile of coal never became smaller), but a former manager of Bagaric\u2019s building testified that in 1977, when he assumed responsibility for the building, he too saw a pile of coal in the corner of the basement. This certainly served to strengthen Caran\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Further accomplice testimony showed Ba-garic was the bomb-maker in two of the bombing incidents charged in the indictment as acts of racketeering. In 1976, Ba-garic gave Skrabo and Vjelko Jaksic a time-bomb to carry to Pittsburgh to use at the home of Milan Vranes. In 1977, Bagaric travelled to San Francisco to wire bombs in Mile Boban\u2019s home. Later that year, Caran used one of the bombs in his unsuccessful</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">attempt to bomb the Yugoslavian consulate in that city.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">This evidence, standing alone, was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. When combined with other testimony implicating Bagaric, along with Baresic and Mico Jaksic, in an aborted attempt on the life of Father Majic; tying him to the transportation of guns and ammunition from California to New York, via Chicago, and to the delivery of blasting caps to Caran; and otherwise demonstrating his allegiance to and knowledge of the operations of the enterprise, the evidence of Bagaric\u2019s guilt was more than ample.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">Bagaric\u2019s other claim is that the district court erred by admitting evidence of an act not alleged in the indictment as one of the predicate acts of racketeering. Specifically, he objects to the testimony of Mico Jaksic, that Jaksic met with Bagaric and Baresic in 1978, and the latter two men indicated they planned to bomb the church of Father Majic, only to be dissuaded by Jaksic. Bagaric contends this testimony was prejudicial, not significantly probative, and he was denied an opportunity to rebut it.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">It is clear the Government may offer proof of acts not included within the indictment, as long as they are within the scope of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>518 F.2d 727, 733 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 926, 96 S.Ct. 270, 46 L.Ed.2d 252 (1975). Here, the testimony was properly admitted as proof of Bagaric\u2019s membership in the racketeering enterprise, and was clearly relevant to the alleged acts of racketeering. Father Majic was a critic of the extortion scheme and, in 1979, was a target of one of the book bombs, mailed to him at the same church Bagaric and Baresic told Jaksic they intended to bomb in the summer of 1978. <em>See United States v. Tramunti, supra, </em>513 F.2d at 1118; <em>United States v. Persico, </em>425 F.2d 1375, 1384 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 869, 91 S.Ct. 102,27 L.Ed.2d 108 (1970). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Nor was Bagaric denied an opportunity to rebut this evidence. The proffered testimony of Father Svetozar Kraljevic, to the effect that Bagaric had always expressed love for Father Majic, was Bagaric\u2019s \u201cown prior statement [offered] for the truth of the matter asserted, [and therefore] hearsay, and . .. not admissible.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marin, </em>669 F.2d 73, 84 (2d Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\n<em>Markich</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">As we have discussed, the proof showed that in May, 1977, Caran, Ljubas, and Mico Jaksic travelled to Elliott Lake, Ontario, Canada, and there obtained dynamite from Dennison Mines for later delivery to Markich in Skokie, Illinois. The Government was permitted to' introduce documentary evidence showing Markich had lived in Elliott Lake in 1967 and was employed, at that time, by Dennison Mines. Markich objects to the introduction of this evidence on the ground it fell outside the scope of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">This claim is entirely without merit. There is no requirement that all the Government\u2019s evidence fall within the time period of the indictment, providing it is relevant to the charges. <em>See United States v. Del Purgatorio, </em>411 F.2d 84, 86-87 (2d Cir.1969). Here, the evidence admitted was plainly relevant to show a relationship between Markich and the source of the dynamite in Elliott Lake, and to corroborate Caran\u2019s testimony that Markich received the dynamite after its importation from Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\n<em>Primorac</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Appellant Primorac testified at trial. In the course of direct examination, he stated he had sought and been denied political asylum in the United States. On cross-examination, the prosecutor followed up on this issue, and Primorac admitted he had testified under oath at a deportation proceeding in 1979, at which time he had submitted the political asylum application. Over defense objection, the Government was permitted to inquire whether the Immigration Judge had \u201cfound [Primorac\u2019s] testimony and evidence ... not to be credible.\u201d (In fact, the Immigration Judge had stated that \u201chis evidence regarding agents of Yugoslav Secret Police lurking around him for the last six years because of his pro-Croatian activities [was] not credible.\u201d) Primorac denied knowledge of the Immigration Judge\u2019s findings. He now contends this line of questioning was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 608(b), the trial judge may permit cross-examination into specific acts of misconduct if \u201cprobative of truthfulness or untruthfulness.\u201d Although in this case the previous \u201cmisconduct\u201d may have involved something less than a judicial finding of perjury, <em>see Walker v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>412 F.2d 60, 63-64 (2d Cir.1969), it is clear that the prior misconduct need not have created criminal liability or resulted in a conviction, and in any event we have recently observed that \u201c[p]roof that a judge ... before whom [the witness] had testified ... had found that [the witness] had \u2018guessed under oath\u2019 was probative of the weight to be accorded his testimony,\u201d <em>United States v. Terry, </em>702 F.2d 299 at 316 (2d Cir.1983). Accordingly, we reject Primorac\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">\n<em>Logarusie</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">Logarusie raises a number of claims, beginning with the argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish his participation in the conspiracy. This contention is refuted by the record. The single most damaging evidence introduced against Logarusie was the hollowed-out book found in the search of his Cleveland home on April 4,1979. According to expert testimony for the Government, Logarusic\u2019s book, which had wires, a battery, and a light bulb inside, was the \u201cprototype or perhaps test book\u201d for the book bombs mailed to Joseph Badurina and Father Timothy Majic. As noted above, the similarities were more than striking. The cavities in all three were of identical size, just large enough to accommodate a stick of dynamite; the glue was the same chemical composition; the wires were the same gauge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>and were arranged in the same fashion; and the wires were soldered to the battery rather than fastened with a standard battery connector. This tangible evidence was overwhelming proof of Logarusic\u2019s involvement in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The Government also offered telephone toll records suggesting Logarusic had communicated with other appellants, and tool mark testimony showing the same pair of pliers had been used to cut a wire in Logarusic\u2019s book and to cut a wire in a time-bomb found in a search of the home of Franjo Ivic, one of the New York-based co-racketeers, convicted in the earlier trial before Judge Pollack. The jury also had before it Logarusic\u2019s explanation for the presence of the hollowed-out book in his home. Appellant claimed it had been left there by a man he had never before seen and has not seen since, and Logarusic did not regard as suspicious the cavity or wiring. The jury had a right to consider the credibility of this story, <em>United States v. Callabrass, </em>607 F.2d 559, 565 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 940, 100 S.Ct. 2163, 64 L.Ed.2d 794 (1980), and we consider it hardly surprising it preferred, based on the evidentiary materials just summarized, the tale told by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Appellant\u2019s next argument, obviously critical in light of the significance we have attributed to the items seized in the Cleveland search, is that the trial judge should have suppressed them. With regard to the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant, which principally detailed facts providing a basis for believing Logarusic had bombed a pro-Yugoslav bookstore, Logarusic states first that it fell short of satisfying the standards of <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), which together establish that the \u201csupporting affidavits in an application for a search warrant must attest to the credibility of an informant and reliability of his information.\u201d <em>United States v. Burke, </em>517 F.2d 377, 380 n. 2 (2d Cir.1975). Here, both criteria were met. The confidential police informant had provided information in the past that, on at least one occasion, had led to an arrest and indictment, <em>see United States v. Gazard Colon, </em>419 F.2d 120, 122 (2d Cir.1969) (per curiam), and his reliability was further buttressed by independent corroborative accounts provided the police, and also included in the affidavit. The affidavit also satisfied the credibility prong of the test; it described as the basis for the informant\u2019s information his personal observations of Logarusic\u2019s activities at the scene of the bombing. <em>See United States v. Zucco, </em>694 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The affidavit is next challenged on the ground it failed to justify a finding of probable cause. Viewing the affidavit in a common sense fashion, <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 745, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965), and paying substantial deference to the authorizing and reviewing judge, <em>United States v. Zucco, supra, </em>694 F.2d at 46, 50, we believe the affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause. It placed Logarusic at the scene of a pre-dawn bombing just before it took place; showed him inspecting the damage shortly after the explosion; demonstrated he had prepared, and placed in the window of the bookstore, a sign expressing contempt for the political and business affiliations of the store\u2019s owner with the present government of Yugoslavia; linked Logarusic to a Croatian nationalist group which had engaged in a series of similar terrorist acts against persons sympathetic to the Yugoslav regime; and noted Logarusic was a named suspect in two other bombings. Under the circumstances, we consider it entirely reasonable for the magistrate to have determined the explosives, used at 5:18 A.M., had been brought from Logarusic\u2019s home, and therefore that his residence was the likely location at which would be found the traces of bomb-making activity sought.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Haala, </em>532 F.2d 1324, 1326-28 (10th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Appellant challenges several evidentiary rulings of the district court. Initially, he objects to the introduction of a pistol, registered to one Razov, who lived in the same two-family dwelling as Logarusic. The pistol had been discovered in Razov\u2019s car. Logarusic argues that the fact that the gun had been purchased by an official of the Paraguayan embassy at the time Baresic was employed there is insufficient to link Logarusic to Baresic. This claim is not insubstantial, as it points up the Government\u2019s dependence upon a chain of inferential reasoning perhaps too weak to support a determination of relevancy. <em>See United States v. Ravich, </em>421 F.2d 1196, 1204-05 &amp; n. 10 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 834, 91 S.Ct. 69, 27 L.Ed.2d 66 (1970). That is, Baresic did not buy the gun, but is tied to its purchase by virtue of his and the buyer\u2019s common employer; and Logarusic is not found to have been in possession of the gun, but is instead joined with its owner, Razov, by their common place of residence. These inferred relationships, together, are offered as proof of the association of Logarusic and Baresic. But, while the better course might have been to exclude the gun as prejudicial, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403, we will not overturn the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit it absent a clear abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Robinson, </em>560 F.2d 507, 512-16 (2d Cir.1977) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 905, 98 S.Ct. 1451, 55 L.Ed.2d 496 (1978). In any event, any prejudice to Logarusic was minimal, in light of the virtual arsenal of weapons and ammunition seized from his home during the above described search, the relevancy of which is not challenged, and any error was therefore harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Logarusic challenges the admission of additional evidence linking him to Bare-sic. We refer to a letter discovered during a consent search of Logarusic\u2019s home on April 3, 1981, after his arrest. Appellant claims the letter was not properly authenticated. Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). We disagree. The requirement of authentication \u201cis satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter is what its proponent claims,\u201d <em>id. </em>This finding may be based entirely on circumstantial evidence, including \u201c[a]ppearance, contents, substance ... and other distinctive characteristics\u201d of the writing, <em>id. </em>901(b)(4). Here, the letter was addressed to Logarusic and postmarked Asuncion, Paraguay, where Baresic resided. It began with the salutation \u201cDear Vinko\u201d and ended \u201cyour Miro Baresic ... your Miro Toni.\u201d \u201cToni Saric\u201d was the alias Baresic had used in gaining entry into the United States. The letter referred to \u201cour people in Chicago,\u201d where four of the defendants lived, and it asked Logarusic to contact \u201cCrni,\u201d which the proof showed was Ljubas\u2019s sobriquet among his confederates. It also contained references to \u201cMercedes,\u201d a friend of Logarusic who testified on his behalf and admitted knowing Baresic, and to \u201cthe Razov family,\u201d Logarusic\u2019s landlord. Finally, the letter stated that \u201c[t]he Swedes, Americans, and Yugoslavs are requesting expulsion because I am a terrorist and dangerous,\u201d a fact confirmed by testimony that Baresic was a fugitive from Sweden where he was sought for the murder of the Yugoslavian ambassador. In sum, as Chief Judge Motley found, there was ample demonstration \u201cthat the letter was in fact what the Government claimed, i.e., a letter from Miro Baresic to Vinko Logarusic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Logarusic\u2019s remaining contentions can be dealt with briefly. His acquittal on the substantive RICO count, even assuming it is in some sense \u201cinconsistent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>with conviction on the conspiracy count, a proposition we dispute, does not require the latter be set aside. <em>E.g., Harris v. Rivera, </em>454 U.S. 339, 345-46, 102 S.Ct. 460, 464, 70 L.Ed.2d 530 (1981); <em>United States v. Zane, </em>495 F.2d 683, 690 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 895, 95 S.Ct. 174, 42 L.Ed.2d 139 (1974). Permitting cross-examination of Logarusic\u2019s wife concerning her possible antipathy toward the Government, based upon its prosecution of her brother for air piracy, was entirely proper. Mrs. Logarusic was a key witness in her husband\u2019s defense, and the potential for bias was self-evident. <em>See United States v. Harvey, </em>547 F.2d 720, 722-23 (2d Cir.1976). And, the district court informed the jury of the limited nature of the inquiry. <em>See United States v. DeLillo, </em>620 F.2d 939, 947 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 835, 101 S.Ct. 108, 66 L.Ed.2d 41 (1980). Finally, Logarusic had no right to production of Mrs. Logarusic\u2019s grand jury testimony. <em>See United States v. Percevault, </em>490 F.2d 126,128-31 &amp; n. 4 (2d Cir.1974); <em>United States v. Ostrer, </em>481 F.Supp. 407, 417 (S.D.N.Y.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\n<em>Sudar</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Of Sudar\u2019s claims, only four require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Appellant argues the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction on the Count One conspiracy charge, claiming the proof demonstrated only \u201cthat he contacted Caron [sic]\u201d and was shown to be, at most, a \u201c \u2018casual facilitator\u2019 whose conduct is ancillary to that of the principles [sic].\u201d He ignores substantial record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">For example, Sudar admitted to Caran that he had previously travelled to a motel in San Diego where he taught bomb-making to Croatians, including the brother of Marijan Rudela, who was proved to have been one of those responsible for the series of extortion-related bombings in the Los Angeles area. Sudar also taught Caran the technique for bomb construction, making two trips to Connecticut in this connection. Independent evidence showed telephone calls which the jury was entitled to conclude were between Sudar and Logarusic, at the time of the mailing of book bombs to Badurina and Majic, to which Logarusic was connected. Moreover, in a search of Sudar\u2019s residence, Toronto police discovered various items, including wires, batteries, and a pipe end, which resembled various bomb paraphernalia linked to the enterprise at trial. An FBI expert witness specifically testified that a nine-volt battery discovered in Sudar\u2019s home was soldered in an unusual manner unique to the Croatian bombings proved at trial. This matrix of circumstantial evidence linking Sudar to the enterprise and its activities was sufficient to support the conspiracy conviction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Sudar challenges two aspects of the Government\u2019s use of evidence obtained during a Canadian investigation of his activities. First, he urges that the district court erred in admitting into evidence bomb-making paraphernalia that was found in the search of his residence on June 25,1981, the day of his arrest. He contends this evidence was \u201cother crimes evidence,\u201d inadmissible pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). This contention is wide of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The seized items are simply not within Rule 404(b), since the possession of batteries, wires, watches and plastic bags, by itself, \u201c[does] not ris[e] ... to the level of a federal crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Bermudez, supra, </em>526 F.2d at 95 n. 3. Rather, the search, conducted after the termination of the conspiracy, yielded evidence plainly relevant to prove its existence and appellant\u2019s participation. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 95 (lactose, a set of scales, and other items seized in post-indictment search); <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>409 F.2d 888, 895-96 (2d Cir.) (same), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 852, 90 S.Ct. 113, 24 L.Ed.2d 101 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Sudar also complains of the introduction of his admission, to Detective Rea of the Peel Regional Police Force, made during the search, that the items were his. Appellant claims the statements were taken in violation of <em>Miranda v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964). Be that as it may, the fact remains they were taken by a Canadian official, during his lawful pursuit of a separate and valid Canadian investigation into Sudar\u2019s activities, and there is no contention advanced that they were obtained either by duress or in violation of Canadian law. Therefore, the exclusionary rule does not apply. <em>United States v. Busic, </em>592 F.2d 13, 23 (2d Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Nagelberg, </em>434 F.2d 585, 587 n. 1 (2d Cir.1970) (dictum), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 939, 91 S.Ct. 935, 28 L.Ed.2d 219 (1971). Sudar\u2019s reference to close cooperation between American and Canadian officials is insufficient to upset Chief Judge Motley\u2019s finding that Detective Rea conducted the search on his own country\u2019s authority and in connection with an ongoing Canadian investigation. We do not decide, therefore, the circumstances under which the relationship between American and foreign authorities might amount to a joint willful attempt to evade the strictures of <em>Miranda </em>or <em>Massiah, see United States v. Busic, supra, </em>592 F.2d at 23 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Appellant also urges his trial should have been severed from that of his co-defendants. We reject this claim. Virtually by definition, the pattern of racketeering alleged in this case constituted a \u201cseries of acts or transactions\u201d sufficiently intertwined to permit a joint trial of all defendants, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(b). <em>United States v. Weisman, supra, </em>624 F.2d at 1129. Nor has Sudar made out a showing of substantial prejudice, as he is required to do, to be deserving of a separate trial pursuant to Rule 14. <em>Id. </em>at 1129-30; <em>see United States v. DeSapio, </em>435 F.2d 272, 280 (2d Cir.1970) (defendant must demonstrate more than greater level of involvement and culpability of co-defendants or \u201ca better chance of acquittal\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 999, 91 S.Ct. 2170, 29 L.Ed.2d 166.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">. As will be seen, Caran, a key witness for the Government in this case, was a major participant in the affairs of appellants\u2019 criminal enterprise. He was convicted in an earlier trial of the principal New York based members of the group, and began cooperating with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office and the Joint Terrorism Task Force, which brings together agents and detectives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York City Arson Squad. During debriefing by the Government, Caran confessed to the murder of Krizan Brzic in Los Angeles, see <em>infra. </em>Because Caran had not been promised immunity for murder, the United States Attorney informed California authorities of Caran\u2019s admission. In exch\u00e1nge for a promise of nonprosecution by the Los Angeles District Attorney, Caran waived venue and pleaded guilty to an information before Judge Motley charging Caran with having conspired to deprive Brzic of his civil rights, resulting in the latter\u2019s death, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241. At the trial of this case, Caran testified for the Government pursuant to a standard cooperation agreement, and faced a possible maximum sentence of life, <em>id., </em>plus thirty-five years, the maximum aggregate prison term for the violations in the previous trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">On July 9, 1982, Judge Pollack, before whom the sentencings of Caran were consolidated, sentenced him to fifteen years imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-15\">.

Sudar\u2019s claim that Judge Motley erred in consolidating the two indictments is discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\">. We purposely highlight our use of the word \u201cmotivated.\u201d As the text makes clear, we are troubled by the notion, advanced by appellants, that the Government will be required to prove the animating or long-run objective of a RICO enterprise was economic, apparently to the exclusion of other, collateral \u201cmotives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">It is clear that \u00a7 1962 does not, by its terms, require proof of ultimate improper economic motive, as does, for example, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (\u201ccorrupt\u201d motive to obstruct investigation). We think it simplifies matters to state at the outset our belief that the term \u201cmotive\u201d has been used imprecisely throughout these proceedings, as it suggests an inquiry into mens rea. <em>See </em>text <em>infra. </em>The issue is whether an objective assessment of the crimes charged and proved in this case demonstrates an economic dimension sufficient to bring them within the language and intention of \u00a7 1962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b146-4\">. In response to appellants\u2019 opening statements, the Government\u2019s chief prosecutor drafted, and asked the court to issue, an order which would have precluded reference to (1) religious beliefs and convictions, see Fed.R. Evid. 610; <em>Virgin Islands v. Petersen, </em>553 F.2d 324, 329 (3d Cir. 1977); (2) foreign policy issues; (3) activities of foreign sovereigns not related to specific proof that \u201ca foreign government had some involvement in the performance of an act of racketeering in this country that is charged in [the] indictment, or unless the defense counsel has competent proof that a foreign government has some involvement with one of [the government\u2019s] witnesses,\u201d Tr. 189; and (4) hearsay newspaper or magazine articles. Judge Motley declined to issue such a \u201cblanket\u201d preclusion order, preferring to rule on the admissibility of individual items of evidence as they were offered. This course was proper. Although much of what appellants\u2019 counsel had to say bore no relation to any theory of defense or the crimes charged, there was at least a question whether some remarks would prove relevant. For example, Ljubas\u2019s trial attorney stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">We will show that Mr. Ljubas did do a lot of traveling, he made a lot of speeches throughout the world on behalf of an independent Croatian [sic] to get away from Communist Yugoslavia. You will hear testimony that there are millions and millions of Croatians throughout the world. You will hear testimony that there were over a million that came to this country to escape the Communist regime in Yugoslavia.</p>\n<p id=\"A6y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Tr. 43.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">There will be testimony that Mr. Ljubas did a lot of traveling on behalf of Croatia, to free Croatia from the Communists. The testimony will be that he went to Sweden .... he wasn\u2019t even in Germany, in West Germany in 78, 79, or \u201980.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Tr. 44.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">This could have been intended to indicate Ljubas would present evidence to rebut the Government\u2019s theory he travelled, in 1977, to West Germany, where he met with other Croatians and devised the extortion scheme. <em>See </em>Tr. 3306-07 (testimony of Government witness Andrija Skrabo). And Ljubas\u2019s testimony appears to amount to a denial he was even permitted to enter West Germany in 1977. <em>See </em>Tr. 8014-15 (direct testimony of Ljubas):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">Q Did you ever have any problems while traveling in West Germany?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-12\">A Only one time I had a problem with the West Germany and the border.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-13\">Q When was that, what year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-14\">A 1977.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-15\">Q What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-16\">A Well, on \u2014 I was in France, in Lourdes, and after I was in Spain and Lourdes, France, so 1 was stopped on the border.

It was on French and German border, small town.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b149-5\">. Other factors, relied upon in <em>Ivic, </em>comport with this reading. The title of the statute, \u201cRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations,\u201d <em>see United States v. Ivic, supra, </em>at 61, insofar as it \u201cmay furnish some aid in showing what was the mind of the legislature,\u201d <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 610, 631, 4 L.Ed. 471 (1818), supports inclusion of terrorist groups which finance their violent activities \u2022 through extortionate means. \u201cCorrupt\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (5th ed. 1977) as \u201ccharacterized by bribery, the selling of political favors, or other improper conduct.\u201d Even more directly on point, a \u201cracketeer\u201d is \u201cone who extorts money or advantages <em>by threats of violence, </em>by blackmail, or <em>by unlawful interference with business or employment\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Precisely these tactics were employed by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Similarly, the statement of findings which prefaces RICO evinces an intent to put a halt to the \u201cwidespread\u201d illicit operation of groups, made more powerful by the sophistication and diversification which accompany organization. Their activities were said to \u201cdrain[ ] billions of dollars from America\u2019s economy by unlawful conduct and the illegal use of force, fraud, and corruption.\u201d Apart from the reference to \u201corganized crime,\u201d an amorphous concept popularly associated with groups different from the one in the instant case, but not meant to limit applicability of the statute to persons within its ranks, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Vignola, supra, </em>and other cases cited, this description of congressional concern clearly covers the conduct of appellants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Finally, the contention advanced at oral argument by Ljubas\u2019s counsel, that because Congress was primarily concerned with the \u201cinfiltration\u201d of legitimate businesses, the Government must prove more than either the potential for such penetration or the diversion of monies from the legitimate sphere, has been rejected by this court, <em>United States v. Barton, </em>647 F.2d 224, 227 (2d Cir.) (struggle between rival illegal underworld factions to gain control of unlawful enterprises), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 857, 102 S.Ct. 307, 70 L.Ed.2d 152 (1981), and, in a slightly different context, by the Supreme Court, <em>United States v. Turkette, supra, </em>452 U.S. at 593, 101 S.Ct. at 2533 (wholly illegitimate criminal organizations whose \u201cactivities .. . give rise to .. . concerns about infiltration\u201d within RICO).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b150-5\">. For example, we have disapproved the use of the terms \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201clie\u201d to characterize the testimony of defense witnesses, also used the Assistant United States Attorney in this case. <em>United States v. Drummond, </em>481 F.2d 62 (2d Cir.1973). In <em>Drummond, </em>however, we were compelled to reverse the conviction only because of the cumulative effect of a series of flagrant abuses. The prosecutor had been warned by the district judge in the first trial of the same case that his conduct approached impropriety, and he repeatedly vouched for the credibility of the Government\u2019s witnesses and indicated his disbelief of defendant\u2019s witnesses during cross-examination \u201cwith such statements as \u2018were you lying then or now?\u2019, \u2014 \u2018Were you lying at that time?\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Was that the truth or is this the truth?\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Have you now changed your story three times?\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 63. The Assistant attempted to inform the jury that mere association with the Government guaranteed the credibility of one of its witnesses, and he misrepresented testimony and evidence adduced at trial (alone creating a presumption of prejudice, <em>id. </em>at 64 (citation omitted)). \u201c[Tjhe combination of [these factors left] us no other course [but to reverse].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">The conduct of the prosecutor in this case does not begin to approach the egregious behavior we have held sufficient to require reversal, as our discussion in the text makes clear. But, while we recognize the need for language which is \u201cblunt and to the point,\u201d <em>United States v. Gottlieb, </em>493 F.2d 987, 994 (2d Cir. 1974), we reiterate our often expressed admonition that prosecutors have an obligation to avoid statements which may have the effect of appealing to the jury\u2019s emotions, <em>e.g., United States v. Marrale, </em>695 F.2d 658, 667 (2d Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1434, 75 L.Ed.2d 793 (1983), and we reject the Government\u2019s contention that \u201cthere is no meaningful distinction between the word \u2018lie\u2019 [and] its more genteel synonym, \u2018falsehood,\u2019 \u201d Brief for the United States at 60 n.*. <em>See United States v. White, </em>486 F.2d 204, 206 n. 8 (2d Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 980, 94 S.Ct. 1569, 39 L.Ed.2d 876 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\">. Defense counsel did not, during the course of trial, waver from a willingness to employ improper tactics. We will not catalogue examples. We confine ourselves to noting that 1) the Government several times suggested techniques which might prevent the proceedings from degenerating completely, including the proposed protective order, <em>see </em>note 12 <em>supra, </em>and, to avoid strident attorney colloquies in front of the jury, a practice of writing out objections for presentation to the judge rather than arguing in open court; and 2) while the Government did not hesitate to use strong language in characterizing the credibility of the testimony presented by the defense, it never resorted to the use of such terms as \u201cdangerous, sick, vicious people,\u201d \u201cpathological liar,\u201d \u201cgarbage,\u201d and \u201craving maniac,\u201d to choose several especially colorful examples employed by defense counsel to describe Government witnesses. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>480 F.2d 726, 741-42 n. 23 (2d Cir.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">. To the extent the prosecutor on rare occasions expressed his frustration, he was responding to the atmosphere created by appellants. For example, we are directed to an instance when the Assistant referred to cross-examination of a Government witness as \u201cMcCarthyism translated to 1980.\u201d Appellants neglect to inform us, however, that this outburst occurred only after the witness had been asked, or counsel had tried to ask, whether he was \u201cpro-Russian\u201d or \u201cpro-Communist,\u201d whether he had edited a Socialist newspaper, whether he had written a book which had a red cover, whether he had written for a magazine which displayed \u2014 along with pictures of Gerald Ford \u2014 pictures of Lenin and a hammer and sickle, and whether he had written for a publication which used red colors. The Assistant repeatedly objected to this line of questioning. Ultimately, Judge Motley agreed the witness and prosecutor had been provoked by defense counsel, and denied an application for a mistrial based upon the \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d comment. We will not overrule this decision, absent a demonstration the district court was not \u201cin a better position than we to evaluate subtle behavioral defense tactics,\u201d <em>United States v. Mar-rale, supra, </em>695 F.2d at 667.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\">. Similarly without merit is appellants\u2019 related argument. They note the Government charged, as part of the alleged conspiracy, but not in the substantive RICO allegations, acts agreed to in the course of the enterprise\u2019s activities but never completed. Based upon this difference, they claim the Government\u2019s theory under \u00a7 1962(d) was a conspiracy merely to perform the individual acts. But, in charging only completed racketeering acts in the substantive RICO count, the Government was simply following the dictum in <em>United States v. Weisman, supra, </em>624 F.2d at 1123-24, that a \u00a7 1962(c) conviction must include proof of consummated acts of racketeering and not conspiracies or attempts, unless conspiracies or attempts to commit the substantive crimes included within \u00a7 1961(1)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\">. Remaining contentions applicable to more than one appellant merit only brief consideration. The assertion that the Government should not have extradited unindicted co-racketeer Miro Baresic to Sweden rings hollow in light of appellants\u2019 failure to show his availability would have assisted the defense. <em>United States v. </em>Valenzuela-Bernal,-U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 3450, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982). Moreover, Baresic\u2019s present whereabouts are known and secure (he is serving a life sentence in Sweden for the murder of the Yugoslavian ambassador to that country), yet appellants have never submitted an affidavit from Baresic setting forth his proposed exculpatory testimony, nor did they move in the district court to take his deposition, Fed.R.Crim.P. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Concerning the claim that the proof at trial demonstrated multiple conspiracies, we have long held that the issue is a \u201cquestion of fact for a properly instructed jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Alessi, </em>638 F.2d 466, 472 (2d Cir. 1980) (collecting cases). Long duration, change in membership, or \u201ca shifting emphasis in its locale of operation,\u201d <em>United States v. Vila, </em>599 F.2d 21, 24 (2d Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>444 U.S. 837, 100 S.Ct. 73, 62 L.Ed.2d 48 (1979), do not transform a single conspiracy into several. Here, the jury was correctly instructed, and the evidence amply supported its conclusion that the mailing of a series of identical extortion letters \u2014 followed by reprisals engineered by various of the appellants; the common exchange of weaponry and explosives; the scientific evidence demonstrating most bombs were constructed in the same fashion; the numerous meetings and phone conversations among appellants, and their employment of various other persons to transport weapons and messages from one appellant to another, all taken together, established a common criminal enterprise in which each played a role.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">Finally, demonstrably reliable \u201ctool mark\u201d identification testimony, which showed various bombs were constructed using the same implements, was properly admitted, <em>United States v. Williams, </em>583 F.2d 1194, 1198 (2d Cir.1978), cert. <em>denied, </em>439 U.S. 1117, 99 S.Ct. 1025, 59 L.Ed.2d 77 (1979); a chart summarizing telephone calls among the defendants was admissible and clearly caused no prejudice, since included among those named on the chart were several who were acquitted; the district court reasonably exercised its discretion in choosing to reread portions of the charge, rather than furnishing the jury with written copies of the charge for use during deliberations; and the plain language and different elements of \u00a7 1962(c) and \u00a7 1962(d), <em>see Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), combined with the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intention, support the imposition of consecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>tive sentences for violation of both subsections. <em>See Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 336-42, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1140-43, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981); <em>United States v. Barton, supra, </em>647 F.2d at 234-38 (cumulative sentences proper for RICO conspiracy and general conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. Logarusic\u2019s challenge to the scope of the search is clearly without merit, as all the items seized were in plain view. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 234, 236, 88 S.Ct. 992, 993, 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968); <em>United States v. Ochs, </em>595 F.2d 1247, 1256 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 955, 100 S.Ct. 435, 62 L.Ed.2d 328 (1979). Also without merit is the argument that the nighttime search of Logarusic\u2019s premises requires suppression. Even assuming there was no \u201creasonable cause\u201d for the nighttime entry, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(c)(1), we will not exclude the seized items unless \u201c(1) there was \u2018prejudice\u2019 in the sense that the search might not have occurred or would not have been so abrasive if [nonconstitutional rule 41] had been followed, or (2) there is evidence of intentional and deliberate disregard [of the rule],\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burke, supra, </em>517 F.2d at 386-87. Here, Logarusic has failed even to allege prejudice or misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">. Appellant\u2019s related argument, that the evidence of his participation was slim enough to require an instruction on what he contends is the \u201clesser-included\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 conspiracy, is misplaced. Section 371 is not a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 1962(d). <em>United States v. Barton, supra, </em>647 F.2d at 236-37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">. Along the same lines, Sudar claims he should have been granted a continuance, arguing he could have better prepared his cross-examination and further time would have assisted him in \u201cundoubtedly numerous other ways.\u201d This vague allegation is insufficient, <em>see United States v. Lewis, </em>565 F.2d 1248, 1252-53 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 973, 98 S.Ct. 1618, 56 L.Ed.2d 66 (1978), to persuade us the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Sudar\u2019s other claims may be considered summarily in this footnote. The refusal to charge the jury that it must find the existence of a racketeering enterprise known as the Croatian National Resistance (of which Sudar was not a member) was not error, since the prosecution quite clearly went forward on an enterprise-in-fact theory. Any reference in the first superseding indictment (under which Sudar was extradited, and which was consolidated with the second) to the formal organization was mere surplusage, see <em>United States v. Cirami, </em>510 F.2d 69, 72-73 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 964, 95 S.Ct. 1952, 44 L.Ed.2d 451 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">Sudar\u2019s efforts to obtain Detective Rea\u2019s internal memoranda of communications among Canadian Police officers \u2014 which dealt not with Sudar\u2019s statements at the time of the search of his home, but instead concerned police procedures to be followed in carrying out the search \u2014 were properly rejected by Chief Judge Motley. See <em>United States v. Cotroni, </em>527 F.2d 708, 712 (2d Cir. 1975) (construing Fed.R. Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A)), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 906, 96 S.Ct. 2226, 48 L.Ed.2d 830 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
