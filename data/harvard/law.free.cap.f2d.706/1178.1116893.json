The district court dismissed Johnston\u2019s suit for want of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that Johnston was neither \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d nor \u201cengaged in the production of goods for commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C. Sec. 203, 206, 207. Finding that Johnston was engaged in the production of goods for commerce, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">Spacefone hired Johnston as a designer/draftsman to assist in the development of a \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d cordless telephone. Johnston\u2019s specific responsibilities included constructing dies, trimming plastics, drafting parts, laying out electronic circuitry and some testing. At the time of trial Space-fone\u2019s project remained in the experimental stage. Although Spacefone developed an unperfected prototype that was transported interstate in an attempt to solicit investors for the project, it had not yet begun mass production of a finished product. Whether such production will ever occur is a matter of uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-15\">Johnston initially worked for Spacefone as a part-time employee but he soon began to work full-time. Johnston alleges that despite the absence of a formal written contract, the parties agreed that Johnston was to receive $250 per week for his services. He alleges that while he sometimes received the agreed upon sum, he sometimes received nothing at all. Johnston now seeks to invoke FLSA to recover minimum wages and overtime pay. The only issue on appeal is whether Johnston meets the FLSA\u2019s jurisdictional requirements because he was either \u201cengaged in production of goods for commerce\u201d or \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d while employed by Spacefone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-16\">As the statute\u2019s language suggests, Johnston can demonstrate FLSA\u2019s applicability by showing that he was engaged in (1) \u201cproduction\u201d of (2) \u201cgoods\u201d (3) \u201cfor commerce.\u201d In determining whether Johnston was so engaged, we must focus on Johnston\u2019s activities, rather than the general nature of his employer\u2019s business. <em>See Mitchell </em>v. <em>Lublin, McGaughy &amp; Associates, </em>358 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 260, 3 L.Ed.2d 243 (1959).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-17\">According to the Act, an employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed in producing, manufacturing, mining, handling, transporting, or in any other manner working on such goods, or in any closely related process or occupation directly essential to the production thereof....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-18\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 203(j). An employee thus \u201cproduces\u201d goods if he is engaged either in actual production or in a \u201cclosely related process\u201d that is \u201cdirectly essential to\u201d actual production.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-19\">Equating actual production with physical work on the employer\u2019s final prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>uct, Spacefone argues that Johnston was not engaged in actual production. It further contends that because actual production, so defined, has never begun, Johnston cannot have been engaged in a \u201cclosely related process ... directly essential\u201d to actual production.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">The critical flaw in Spacefone\u2019s argument lies in its premise that actual production is confined to physical work on the final project. In <em>Borden Co. v. Borella, </em>325 U.S. 679, 683, 65 S.Ct. 1223, 1225, 89 L.Ed. 1865 (1945), the Supreme Court defined actual production more broadly to encompass the planning stages as well as final physical production of the product. The Court there held that FLSA covers maintenance employees who worked in an office building staffed by Borden\u2019s executive and administrative employees. No physical production on the final goods occurred in the building but the Court held that executive and administrative employees who planned the product were engaged in actual production stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-6\">Economic production, in other words, requires planning and control as well as manual labor, [footnote omitted] He who conceives or directs a productive activity is as essential to that activity as the one who physically performs it. From a productive standpoint, therefore, petitioner\u2019s executive officers and administrative employees working in the central office building <em>are actually engaged in the production of goods for commerce </em>just as much as are those who process and work on-the tangible products in the various manufacturing plants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">325 U.S. at 683, 65 S.Ct. at 1225 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court held that the maintenance employees performed tasks \u201cnecessary to\u201d the actual production of the administrative and executive employees and could claim the benefit of FLSA\u2019s provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">In light of <em>Borden\u2019s </em>broad definition we hold that Johnston was engaged in actual production. Like the administrative and executive employees in <em>Borden, </em>Johnston was actively involved in the planning stages of Spacefone\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">The more difficult steps in our analysis concern whether Johnston was engaged in producing \u201cgoods\u201d \u201cfor commerce.\u201d Although Spacefone fully intends to produce cordless telephones for interstate distribution, the preliminary planning process in which Johnston was involved has not yet come to fruition. Spacefone accordingly argues that because it has not yet produced and distributed a finished cordless telephone, Johnston could not have been engaged in producing \u201cgoods\u201d \u201cfor commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-12\">The district courts that have addressed this issue have reached opposing conclusions. In <em>Krill </em>v. <em>Arma Corp., </em>76 F.Supp. 14, 17 (E.D.N.Y.1948), the FLSA plaintiff, an engineer, was involved in the experimental development of fire control and navigational instruments for ships. Noting that there was no evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s developmental work was ever used to produce a tangible product, the court held that FLSA did not apply. In <em>Tormey v. Kiek-haefer Corp., </em>76 F.Supp. 557, 559 (E.D.Wis. 1948), an engineer had worked on an experimental aircraft engine that was never put into production. The district court held that the plaintiff was engaged in the production of goods for commerce, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alj-dedup-0\">It would indeed be a novel construction of [FLSA] to hold that one was not entitled to the overtime pay benefits of the Act because the project on which he worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>did not measure up to expectations and was eventually abandoned before any of the product designed was shipped across State lines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\"><em>See also Wirtz v. Koch, </em>301 F.Supp. 957 (D.S.D.1969) (architectural plans, drawings and blueprints sent out-of-state constituted \u201cgoods\u201d even though plans were not ultimately used).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">Guided by the underlying purposes of FLSA\u2019s jurisdictional provisions, we believe that <em>Tormey </em>states the more reasonable result. By denying coverage to employees who merely \u201caffect\u201d commerce, Congress chose not to extend FLSA\u2019s coverage to the constitutional maximum. \u201cHowever, within the tests of coverage fashioned by Congress, the Act has been construed liberally to apply.to the furthest reaches consistent with congressional direction.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Lublin, McGaughy &amp; Associates, </em>358 U.S. 207, 211, 79 S.Ct. 260, 263, 3 L.Ed.2d 243 (1959). Congress\u2019s primary purpose in refusing to extend FLSA\u2019s coverage to its constitutional maximum was to leave regulation of \u201clocal\u201d business to the states. <em>See </em>Conference Rep. No. 1453, 81st Cong. 1st Sess. (1949) <em>reprinted in </em>1949 U.S. Code Cong. Service 2241, 2251, 2252-54 (listing examples of \u201clocal\u201d businesses); <em>10 E. 40th St. Building, Inc. v. Callus, </em>325 U.S. 578, 582-83, 65 S.Ct. 1227, 1229, 89 L.Ed. 1806 (1945); <em>Kirschbaum v. Walling, </em>316 U.S. 517, 520-21, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 1118, 86 L.Ed. 1638 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">Johnston\u2019s activities here are plainly not the type of local activity that Congress wished to exclude from FLSA. First, Johnston was employed in the improvement of an instrumentality of commerce. <em>See Mitchell </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>292 F.2d 71, 75 (6th Cir. 1961) (\u201cIt is settled law that the production of materials for use in the improvement ... of ... instrumentalities of interstate commerce constitutes the production of goods for commerce\u201d) (citing <em>Alstate Construction Co. v. Durkin, </em>345 U.S. 13, 73 S.Ct. 565, 97 L.Ed. 745 (1953)). Second, Spacefone used its unperfected prototype to solicit investors interstate. Finally, Spacefone fully intends that a completed product will eventually be distributed in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-11\">In light of these considerations we hold on these facts that it is not necessary that the employer\u2019s product actually have been distributed in interstate commerce. Using the test adopted in <em>Wirtz v. Ray Smith Transport Co., </em>409 F.2d 954, 957 (5th Cir.1969), Johnston was engaged in producing \u201cgoods\u201d \u201cfor commerce\u201d because Spacefone \u201creasonably expectfed its] product to move or cause movement in interstate commerce. ...\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See U.S. v. Darby, </em>312 U.S. 100, 118, 61 S.Ct. 451, 459, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-12\">We reach the same result on the basis of a theory that treats Spacefone\u2019s prototype as a \u201cgood\u201d for purposes of FLSA. Even accepting arguendo Spacefone\u2019s narrow definition of actual production as physical work on the final product, Johnston was involved in actually producing the prototype. He <em>inter alia </em>trimmed plastic for the prototype and tested the product.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, the prototype constituted a \u201cgood\u201d within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>the meaning of Sec. 203(i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The former Fifth Circuit and other courts have held that plans prepared by surveyors, draftsmen and the like are goods within the meaning of FLSA. <em>See Wirtz v. A.S. Giometti &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>399 F.2d 738, 739 (5th Cir.1968); <em>Shultz v. Merriman, </em>425 F.2d 228 (1st Cir.1970); <em>Wirtz v. Koch, supra. </em>The prototype telephone, the physical embodiment of Spacefone\u2019s unperfected plans, falls into the same category. Third, the prototype was produced \u201cfor commerce\u201d because Spacefone, by circulating the prototype interstate to investors, attempted to sell it interstate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Shatel Corp. v. Mao Ta Lumber and Yacht Corp., </em>697 F.2d 1352, 1355-1356 (11th Cir.1983) (By soliciting orders interstate, manufacturers caused product to \u201center into commerce\u201d within meaning of Lanham Trade Mark Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">We accordingly hold that Johnston was engaged in the production of goods for commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">. See <em>also Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Lenroot, </em>323 U.S. 490, 503, 65 S.Ct. 335, 341, 89 L.Ed. 414 (1945) (\u201cproduction\u201d includes \u201call steps whether manufacture or not, which lead to readiness for putting goods into the stream of commerce\u201d). Echoing <em>Borden, </em>the applicable regulations define actual production to include \u201cthe administration, planning, management, and control of the various physical processes 29 C.F.R. Sec. 776.16(d) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1273-15\">. When <em>Borden </em>was decided 29 U.S.C. Sec. 203(j) covered employees engaged in processes \u201cnecessary to\u201d actual production. The present version covers employees engaged in processes \u201cclosely related\u201d and \u201cdirectly essential\u201d to actual production.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">. So interpreted, FLSA is within Congress\u2019s constitutional power to regulate matters that \u201caffect\u201d commerce. <em>See e.g., Wickard v. Filburn, </em>317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942); <em>U.S. v. Darby, </em>312 U.S. 100, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941). Congress may constitutionally regulate production aimed at improving or changing instrumentalities of interstate commerce, <em>see Alstate Construction Co. v. Durkin, </em>345 U.S. 13, 73 S.Ct. 565, 97 L.Ed. 745 (1952), even if the production is in preliminary stages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1274-8\">. \u201cproduction for commerce\u201d ... includes at least production of goods, which, at the time of production, the employer, according to the normal course of his business, intends or expects to move in interstate commerce although, through the exigencies of the business, all of the goods may not thereafter actually enter interstate commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1274-14\">. Under Spacefone\u2019s definition of \u201cactual production,\u201d Johnston\u2019s other activities such as drafting layouts of electronic schematics and building dies for the vacuum form machine, if not actual production, were closely related and directly essential to the actual production of the prototype.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">. Congress defined \u201cgoods\u201d broadly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-10\">\u201cGoods\u201d means goods (including ships and marine equipment), wares, products, commodities, merchandise, or articles or subjects of commerce of any character, or any part or ingredient thereof, but does not include goods after their delivery into the actual physical possession of the ultimate consumer thereof other than a producer, manufacturer, or processor thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">29 U.S.C. Sec. 203(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-12\">While FLSA requires the production of good s, Spacefone produced only one prototype. We decline to interpret the statute literally because to do so would frustrate FLSA\u2019s purposes. See <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1275-17\">. The perhaps more typical situation is where the plan is sold to a third party who, based on the plan, carries out the actual production or construction. Here Spacefone, rather than a third party, intends to produce goods based on the plan it has conceived. This does alter the fact that Spacefone in effect attempted to sell its plan interstate to third parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1275-7\">RONEY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"agm-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">I respectfully dissent. Since the employer never produced goods for commerce, Johnston could not have been engaged in such production. This case is unlike those relied upon by the Court which hold that where the employer is engaged in the production of goods for commerce, the support personnel, so to speak, are engaged in that effort, even if they are engaged in research and development, maintenance, or office and administrative work. <em>E.g., Borden v. Borella, </em>325 U.S. 679, 65 S.Ct. 1223, 89 L.Ed. 1865 (1945); <em>Tormey v. Kiekhaefer Corp., </em>76 F.Supp. 557 (E.D.Wis.1948). In those cases the employees\u2019 activities contributed in some way to the employers\u2019 actual production of goods for commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-14\">Here, however, Spacefone Corporation was formed for the sole purpose of developing and marketing a cordless extension telephone. It never accomplished that, nor did it manufacture and sell any other product. Thus plaintiff never aided in any way, directly or indirectly, the production of any good sold in interstate commerce. Even under the most expansive interpretation of the statute, he was not \u201cengaged in the production of goods for commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 206-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-15\">Nor was Johnston engaged in interstate commerce, even if his employer was not, to bring him within the principle of <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Lublin, McGaughy &amp; Associates, </em>358 U.S. 207, 211, 79 S.Ct. 260, 263, 3 L.Ed.2d 343 (1959). Johnston introduced evidence that he spent a substantial amount of time using an instrumentality of commerce, the telephone, in connection with his job for Space-fone. The regular and recurrent use of the mails and other channels of communication by an employee as a part of his duties is sufficient to demonstrate that the employee is engaged in commerce, <em>Montalvo v. Tower Life Building, </em>426 F.2d 1135, 1143-44 (5th Cir.1970), but \u201c[tjhis does not mean that any use by an employee of the mails and other channels of communication is sufficient to establish coverage.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 776.10(b) (1981). The trial court found that Johnston\u2019s interstate telephone calls \u201cwere not part of his regular duties, were incidental to his primary employment, and did not constitute a substantial portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>plaintiffs time.\u201d 4 While the amount of usage is not determinative, utilization of the channels of interstate communication must be a regular and recurrent part of the employee\u2019s responsibilities under <em>Montalvo </em>and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 776.10(b) (1981). The trial court\u2019s finding of fact is not clearly erroneous. Johnston failed to prove he was \u201cengaged in commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 206-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
