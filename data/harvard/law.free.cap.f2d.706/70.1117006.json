Schwartz appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Jack B. Weinstein, <em>Chief Judge, </em>insofar as it dismissed Schwartz\u2019s counterclaim and failed to order that the other defendants pay a total of 70% of the United States\u2019 judgment \u2014 entered in the sum of $214,039.95, plus interest \u2014 against Schwartz.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant Donald Goldberg appeals from so much of the court\u2019s judgment as granted Schwartz\u2019s cross-claim against him in the sum of $273,-449.98, plus interest. For the reasons below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">A. <em>The Claims of Woodcrest for Reimbursement from the Secretary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">The controversy concerns the operations of Woodcrest, as a \u201cprovider\u201d under Part A of the Medicare Program of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395c to 1395\u00cd-2 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980), from August 30, 1968, through April 19, 1969, and Wood-crest\u2019s claims for reimbursement for services rendered to it during that period by the Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Institute (\u201cORI\u201d). During that period, Woodcrest was a general partnership whose partners were Schwartz, Goldberg, Lawrence Peirez, and defendants Irwin M. Rosenthal and Jack E. Bronston. Under the partnership agreement as amended in November 1968, Goldberg was the managing partner of Woodcrest, having full charge of its operations and sole power to enter into contracts on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">Goldberg was also the owner of ORI, from which Woodcrest purchased services. Under Medicare regulations, since Goldberg owned ORI and an interest in Woodcrest, ORI was considered \u201crelated\u201d to Woodcrest, <em>see </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427(b), set forth in note 3 <em>infra, </em>and Woodcrest therefore normally would not be entitled to reimbursement from the Secretary for more than the actual cost to ORI of providing the services to Woodcrest. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>of these regulations, the partners reached a special agreement with respect to services supplied to Woodcrest by ORI, as reflected in a memorandum dated November 29,1968 (hereinafter \u201cORI Repayment Agreement\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">[i]n the event[] that the United States of America or its appropriate governmental sub-division, or any appropriate insurance carrier or fiscal agent or agency, under and pursuant to the Medicare or similar successor program, determines at any time, up to and including the annual audit for any year, but not thereafter, that any charge or charges made by the Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Institute, during such year to the Woodcrest Nursing Home, for care rendered to patients of the nursing home are by virtue of incorrect or inappropriate rate, not reimbursable in part, then such amount or amounts so determined to be excessive or non-reimbursable, will be borne by the Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Institute and repaid to the General Partnership within thirty (30) days after such determination by such governmental or other Agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In accordance with the general statutory scheme governing Medicare reimbursement, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h, Woodcrest designated a private insurance carrier, to wit, Travelers Insurance Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d), to serve as the fiscal intermediary through which Woodcrest was to receive payments from the Secretary for the \u201creasonable costs\u201d incurred to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries. Woodcrest provided services, some of which it purchased from ORI, and Travelers made both interim payments to Woodcrest based on the estimated cost of services furnished, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395g; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.454(e) (1981), and current financing payments, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 405.-454(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Eventually Woodcrest submitted to Travelers detailed claims of reimbursable costs for the period in question, which included $171,442 in payments it had made to ORI. Travelers engaged the accounting firm of Peat, Marwick and Mitchell (\u201cPeat, Mar-wick\u201d) to audit Woodcrest\u2019s claims and advised Peat, Marwick that ORI was an organization \u201crelated\u201d to Woodcrest and that ORI\u2019s costs would therefore have to be determined by auditing ORI\u2019s books and records.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">ORI, however, refused to make its books and records available for audit. Accordingly, in light of the statutory provision that \u201cno [reimbursement] payments shall be made to any provider unless it has furnished such information as the Secretary may request in order to determine the amounts due such provider,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395g, Woodcrest\u2019s claims for reimbursement for its payments to ORI were disal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>lowed. Initial notice of the denial was given in August 1971; the decision became final in 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In October 1973, Schwartz and Goldberg (who by then were no longer partners, see <em>infra) </em>appealed Travelers\u2019 decision to an intermediary hearing panel, arguing that Woodcrest\u2019s ORI claims should have been granted pursuant to the statutory exception to the general rule limiting reimbursement to ORI\u2019s actual costs, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427, see note 2 <em>supra. </em>They contended that Woodcrest was entitled to receive the full amount of ORI\u2019s charges because \u201ca substantial part of [ORI\u2019s] business activity of the type carried on with [Woodcrest] [was] transacted with others than [Woodcrest] and organizations related to [ORI] by common ownership or control .... \u201d \u00a7 405.-427(d). Travelers responded that ORI\u2019s records would have to be made available to substantiate these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In the meantime, on April 19, 1969, Schwartz had purchased the partnership interests of the other Woodcrest partners, and in April 1971 Goldberg filed a demand for arbitration against Schwartz, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>an accounting for Goldberg\u2019s share of Woodcrest\u2019s profits. Schwartz counterclaimed, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>payment from Goldberg under the ORI Repayment Agreement. Eventually, the arbitrators awarded Goldberg $82,168 on his claim, dismissed Schwartz\u2019s counterclaim without prejudice, and directed Goldberg to cooperate in Woodcrest\u2019s quest for reimbursement from the Secretary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">[njothing in this AWARD shall preclude Gerald Schwartz from making a claim on the memorandum dated November 29, 1968 amending the General Partnership Agreement for the operation of Woodcrest, but only upon the final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that charges made by the Orthopedic and Rehabilation [sic] Institute (\u201cORI\u201d) and paid by Woodcrest to ORI should not be reimbursed by the appropriate agency by virtue of incorrect or inappropriate rate. <em>Dr. Goldberg is directed to cooperate fully in the process of effecting such determination.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Opinion of Arbitrators dated August 1,1975 (\u201cArbitrators\u2019 Opinion\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">Proceedings on the intermediary appeal, begun in 1973, continued into 1977, and included discovery, conferences, and a hearing. ORI made available to the hearing panel certain of its books and records but withheld documents that would have allowed the panel to determine such questions as the extent of ORI\u2019s services to unrelated entities and whether ORI\u2019s charges to Wood-crest were in line with its charges to the general public. Accordingly, the panel held that Woodcrest had not met its burden of showing the applicability of the statutory exception. In so ruling the panel noted that the ORI records that had been supplied indicated that \u201ca substantial part of ORI\u2019s activity was conducted with Woodcrest Nursing Home and not as called for by regulations, with parties unrelated to the provider by common ownership or control.\u201d Intermediary Hearing Decision No. T-26 dated May 5, 1977, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">B. <em>Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaV\">As a result of the denial of Woodcrest\u2019s claims for reimbursement for its payments to ORI, Woodcrest\u2019s entitlement to Medicare reimbursement was some $76,000 less than the amount of current financing payments made to Woodcrest by Travelers for the period in question. Accordingly, in January 1977, the United States commenced this action to recover overpayments made to Woodcrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Schwartz interposed a counterclaim for $171,442, the amount of Woodcrest\u2019s disallowed payments to ORI, contending that Travelers\u2019 determination that Woodcrest was not entitled to reimbursement for its payments to ORI was arbitrary and capricious. Schwartz cross-claimed against Goldberg in the same amount, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that if Woodcrest\u2019s payments to ORI were not reimbursable, Goldberg was liable to Schwartz under the ORI Repayment Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Following an exchange of pleadings and motions for summary judgment, the district court remanded to Travelers its May 1977 determination for further findings and reconsideration. On remand, several discovery requests were made to Woodcrest and ORI. ORI provided some of the data requested of it, but not others. As a result, although the panel found that ORI had performed services for Woodcrest and for others unrelated to ORI, the panel was unable to determine whether the part of ORI\u2019s business activity that was conducted with the latter group was \u201csubstantial\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 405.427(d), since the ratio of ORI\u2019s services for Woodcrest to ORI\u2019s services for others could not be determined. As to each category of services the panel stated that \u201c[t]he extent of the services ... ha[d] not been established by convincing evidence to the satisfaction of ... Travelers.\u201d Remand Decision dated June 6, 1980, at 3, 5. The panel thus, concluded that Woodcrest was not entitled to receive reimbursement for its payments to ORI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">In order that reimbursement for such services may be a part of Woodcrest\u2019s Medicare reimbursable costs thereby permitting a payment to ORI which would be considered reimbursable as a Medicare cost there must be an auditable basis for making a determination of said costs. The burden of proof is not on the intermediary auditor.... [TJhere is no sound auditable way to make the cost determination because the necessary records were not made available to the Intermediary. The Panel does not find that the Intermediary has erred and must therefore sustain the original Panel decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0h\"><em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">After receiving Travelers\u2019 new findings, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the United States against Schwartz but dismissed its claims against all other defendants. The court dismissed Schwartz\u2019s counterclaim against the United States, but granted summary judgment in favor of Schwartz on his cross-claim against Goldberg \u201cfor failure to cooperate under the arbitration decision.\u201d Order dated May 24, 1982. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">On appeal, Schwartz argues chiefly that the judgment should be reversed insofar as it dismissed his due process counterclaim challenging the procedures for review of Travelers\u2019 rejection of Woodcrest\u2019s reimbursement claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Goldberg contends chiefly that the court erred in granting judgment against him because Schwartz\u2019s cross-claim was barred by principles of res judicata. Finding no merit in any of the appellants\u2019 challenges to the judgment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">A. <em>Schwartz\u2019s Due Process Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Part A of the Medicare Program, entitled \u201cHospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395c to 1395i-2, is a government-financed program designed to provide insurance, principally for persons over the age of 65, against the cost of institutional health services, such as hospital and nursing home fees. Part B, entitled \u201cSupplementary Medical Insurance Benefits for the Aged and Disabled,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395j to 1395w (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980), is a voluntary program funded partly by contributions of the individuals enrolled and partly by the government, and is designed to reimburse persons who are disabled or over the age of 65 for a portion of the cost of certain medical expenses not covered by Part A, such as physician services, outpatient physical therapy, x-rays, and laboratory tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">Schwartz\u2019s principal claim on appeal is that he was denied due process because he was afforded no review by the Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>with respect to Travelers\u2019 rejection of Woodcrest\u2019s ORI claims and because the panel that rendered that ultimate decision was appointed by the same entity, <em>i.e., </em>Travelers, that made the initial decision to deny those claims. While we recognize that Woodcrest was a provider of services under Part A of the Medicare Program, we conclude that Schwartz\u2019s contention must be rejected on the basis of the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Schweiker v. McClure, </em>456 U.S. 188, 102 S.Ct. 1665, 72 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), rejecting similar claims on behalf of beneficiaries of Part B. Only Schwartz\u2019s claim that there should have been review by the Secretary merits extended discussion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">1. <em>Part B and </em>McClure</p>\n<p id=\"AEi\"><em>McClure </em>arose out of decisions by hearing officers denying the claims of three individuals seeking reimbursement for their expenditures for certain services under Part B. The claimants contended that the fact that the Secretary provided no review of the decision of the hearing officers denied them due process of law. After a detailed review of the existing procedures, the Supreme Court rejected this contention. 456 U.S. at 200, 102 S.Ct. at 1672. The Court noted that in order to make the administration of Part B more efficient, Congress had authorized the Secretary to contract with private insurance carriers to administer the payment of qualifying claims. <em>Id. </em>at 190, 102 S.Ct. at 1667. Part B claimants submit claims to the carrier for reimbursement for services they have received; the carrier decides initially whether the services were medically necessary, whether the charges are reasonable, and whether the claim is otherwise covered by Part B. <em>Id. </em>at 191, 102 S.Ct. at 1667; <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.803(b) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">A claimant who is dissatisfied with the initial determination has one or more opportunities to appeal. First he is entitled to a \u201creview determination,\u201d in which he may submit written evidence and arguments of fact and law to a carrier employee other than the initial decision-maker; this employee then reviews the record and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>written submissions and either affirms or adjusts the initial determination. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.807-405.812 (1981). If the claimant is still dissatisfied and if the amount in dispute is $100 or more, the claimant has a right to an oral hearing before a hearing officer, appointed by the carrier, who has not previously participated in the case. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(C); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.820 \u2014 405.835 (1981); <em>Schweiker v. McClure, supra, </em>456 U.S. at 191,102 S.Ct. at 1667. Unless the carrier or the hearing officer decides to reopen the proceeding, the hearing officer\u2019s decision is \u201cfinal and binding upon all parties to the hearing ....\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.835. Neither the statute nor any regulation makes provision for further review of the hearing officer\u2019s decision. <em>See United States v. Erika, Inc., </em>456 U.S. 201, 102 S.Ct. 1650, 72 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The Court pointed out that there is a \u201cstrong presumption in favor of the validity of congressional action,\u201d <em>Schweiker v. McClure, supra, </em>456 U.S. at 200, 102 S.Ct. at 1672, and that the Court had recognized Congress\u2019s \u201c \u2018solicitude for fair procedure,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 693, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 2553, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1973)), and it concluded that the <em>McClure </em>claimants had not shown that the Part B procedures were unfair.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Court noted that the district court, in holding that due process required additional review by a government hearing officer, had analyzed the three factors made relevant by <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), to such a due process inquiry, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903. The Supreme Court found that its own analysis of the second <em>Mathews </em>factor led it to the opposite conclusion. Referring to the first and third <em>Mathews </em>factors, the Court assumed the correctness of the district court\u2019s view that the private interest in Part B payments was \u201c \u2018considerable,\u2019 though \u2018not quite as precious as the right to receive welfare or social security benefits,\u2019 \u201d and the district court\u2019s estimate that the additional cost and inconvenience of providing administrative law judges \u201cwould not be unduly burdensome.\u201d <em>Schweiker v. McClure, supra, </em>456 U.S. at 198, 102 S.Ct. at 1671. As to the second <em>Mathews </em>factor, however, the Supreme Court rejected the district court\u2019s views (1) that the existing procedures were constitutionally inadequate because the carriers\u2019 hearing officers were not required to have law degrees or other formal training and (2) that more stringent requirements would reduce the risk of erroneous determinations. The Court stated that the record does not support these conclusions. The Secretary has directed carriers to select as a hearing officer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_9\">\u201can attorney or other <em>qualified </em>individual with the ability to conduct formal hearings and with a general understanding of medical matters and terminology. The [hearing officer] must have a <em>thorough knowledge </em>of the Medicare program and the statutory authority and regulations upon which it is based, as well as rulings, policy statements, and general instructions pertinent to the Medicare Bureau.\u201d App., 22, quoting Department of Health and Welfare Services, Medicare Part B Carriers Manual, p. 12-21 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">The District Court did not identify any specific deficiencies in the Secretary\u2019s selection criteria. By definition, a \u201cquali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>fied\u201d individual already possessing \u201cability\u201d and \u201cthorough knowledge\u201d would not require further training. The court\u2019s further general concern that hearing officers \u201care not required to satisfy any threshold criteria\u201d overlooks the Secretary\u2019s quoted regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 199, 102 S.Ct. at 1672 (footnote omitted). In sum, the Court concluded that the availability of appellate review by new hearing officers, together with the Secretary\u2019s criteria for the selection of these officers, provided sufficient procedural protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">2. <em>Part A and Woodcrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3s\">We see no significant difference in the Part A procedures under which Wood-crest\u2019s reimbursement claims were determined here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The structure \u2014 the Secretary relying on carriers or other intermediaries to review reimbursement claims \u2014 was the same; the initial decisionmaking processes of the carriers were parallel; and the appellate procedures were not materially different.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Part A of the Medicare Program provides that if any group or association of providers wishes to have its Part A payments made through a public or private agency or organization such as Travelers and nominates such an agency or organization for this purpose, the Secretary is authorized to enter into an agreement providing for the determination by the agency or organization- of payments to be made to the providers. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h(a). Thus, just as Part B claimants request reimbursement from the carrier on the basis of their expenditures for services, Part A providers such as Woodcrest seek reimbursement from the fiscal intermediary on the basis of the cost of their services. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.453(f) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Within a reasonable time after receipt of a Part A provider\u2019s cost report, the intermediary analyzes the report, undertakes any necessary audit of the report, and furnishes the provider and any related organization of the provider a notice that reflects the intermediary\u2019s determination of the amount of reimbursement; if the intermediary\u2019s determination differs from the claim submitted, the notice states the reasons for the difference. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 405.1803. Thus, just as Part B carriers determine whether claims are for reasonable amounts for medically necessary services and are otherwise covered by Part B, the Part A intermediaries determine whether and to what extent the providers\u2019 claims are for reasonable costs that are reimbursable under Part A.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Finally, the appeal procedure for claims of Part A providers differs from the appeal procedure for Part B beneficiaries in that the preliminary step of a written appeal to an employee of the carrier is omitted. If a Part A provider is dissatisfied with the intermediary\u2019s claim determination, and the amount in dispute is at least $1,000, the provider is entitled immediately to request a hearing before a hearing officer, or a panel of such officers. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 405.-1811(a). These appellate officers are appointed by the intermediary; they must have had no prior role in the decision, and they must be \u201cpersons knowledgeable in the field of health care reimbursement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.1817. The appellate procedures per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>mit the parties to conduct prehearing discovery, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 405.1821, to call and cross-examine witnesses, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 405.1825, and to present documentary evidence and arguments, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 405.1823. The hearing officers are required to make a de novo determination of the claims after \u201cinquiring] fully into all of the matters at issue and ... receiving] into evidence the testimony and any documents which are relevant and material to such matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.1819. The officers are empowered to call for such additional evidence as they deem relevant and material. <em>Id. </em>The hearing officers render a written decision, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 405.1831, and unless they decide to reopen their determination, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 405.1885(a), the decision is \u201cfinal and binding upon all parties to the hearing . ... \u201d <em>Id. % </em>405.1833. Neither the statute nor any regulation makes provision for further review of the hearing officer\u2019s decision as to such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">These procedures seem adequately designed to provide a fair opportunity for providers to obtain full and meaningful review of the carriers\u2019 determinations, and Schwartz has pointed out to us no respect in which they are unfair.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The availability of procedures for the prehearing discovery of evidence, the opportunity to present all relevant and material evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to present all pertinent arguments to hearing officers knowledgeable in the health care reimbursement field, together with the obligation imposed on those officers to make a full-scale inquiry and de novo determination, provide adequate safeguards against the risk that the carrier has made an erroneous initial determination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not regard the difference between these appellate procedures and those for Part B beneficiaries as material. It is true that the availability under Part B of an initial appeal to an employee of the carrier, prior to the final appeal to a hearing officer, automatically increases the chance of a favorable decision on the claim. But this initial appeal is limited to the presentation of written materials, and its omission under Part A seems insignificant beside the expansive opportunities before the final hearing panel. We note, finally, that there was no suggestion in <em>McClure </em>that the Court\u2019s conclusion as to the adequacy of the Part B procedures turned upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the opportunity to make a written presentation to a carrier employee or even upon the fact that two appellate steps, rather than one, were available. In short, we conclude that the procedures followed by Travelers in determining Woodcrest\u2019s claims and the fact that there was no further review of the appellate panel\u2019s decision did not deprive Schwartz of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">B. <em>Goldberg\u2019s Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The district court granted judgment in favor of Schwartz on his cross-claim against Goldberg under the ORI Repayment Agreement, finding that Goldberg had failed to cooperate as ordered by the arbitration decision. Goldberg challenges this portion of the judgment on a number of grounds. His principal contention is that the issues raised by Schwartz\u2019s cross-claim had previously been submitted to arbitration, and that the arbitrators\u2019 award, which was confirmed by the appropriate state courts, became res judicata on these issues. This argument must be rejected on the basis of the Arbitrators\u2019 Opinion itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In 1975 the arbitrators rejected Schwartz\u2019s claim that Goldberg was liable to him under the ORI Repayment Agreement. At that time, however, although Travelers had denied Woodcrest\u2019s claims for reimbursement for its payments to ORI, there was pending the appeal by Schwartz and Goldberg, seeking payment of those claims under the exception provided by 42 C. F.R. \u00a7 405.427(d). Accordingly, Schwartz\u2019s claim in 1975 was premature, and in dismissing it the arbitrators stated explicitly that nothing in their award was to preclude Schwartz from asserting such a claim against Goldberg upon a final judicial determination<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that Woodcrest should not be reimbursed for its ORI payments by virtue of incorrect or inappropriate rates. See Arbitrators\u2019 Opinion set forth in full in Part I.A. above. Hence nothing could be clearer than the fact that the arbitrators\u2019 award was not a final determination of the rights of Schwartz and Goldberg under the ORI Repayment Agreement. The court confirmed the award without modification, and the fact that the award was judicially confirmed does not imbue it with any greater finality, on this undecided issue, than the arbitrators intended it to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">As to the merits of Schwartz\u2019s cross-claim, we are unpersuaded that the entry of judgment against Goldberg was improper. The arbitrators did not simply decline to decide the question of Schwartz\u2019s rights under the ORI Repayment Agreement; they also \u201cdirected\u201d Goldberg \u201cto cooperate fully\u201d in the adjudication of these reimbursement claims. <em>Id. </em>It is entirely proper for arbitrators \u201cto direct such conduct of the parties as is necessary to the settlement of the matters in dispute,\u201d <em>Ruppert v. Egelhofer, </em>3 N.Y.2d 576, 581, 170 N.Y.S.2d 785, 788, 148 N.E.2d 129, 131 (1958); <em>accord </em>6 C.J.S. <em>Arbitration </em>\u00a7 110, at 342 (1975), and the district court\u2019s finding here that Goldberg\u2019s conduct violated the arbitrators\u2019 directive was not error. Apparently there was no dispute in the district court as to the fact that Goldberg did not fully cooperate\u2014 even after remand by the court for reconsideration \u2014 in the hearing panel\u2019s review of Woodcrest\u2019s claims regarding its ORI payments. At every stage, the hearing officials stated that ORI had withheld needed information, with the result that its costs\u2014 the maximum rate of reimbursement normally allowed under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427(a) \u2014could not be determined. In the circumstances, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\">. Although the notice of appeal filed by Schwartz is styled an appeal by both Schwartz and Woodcrest, the judgment entered in favor of the United States ran only against Schwartz. Hence we refer to the appeal as that of Schwartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Schwartz\u2019s notice of appeal stated that he appealed from so much of the judgment as (1) granted the claim of the United States against him, (2) dismissed his counterclaim against the United States, (3) dismissed the claim of the United States against defendants other than Schwartz and Woodcrest, and (4) failed to award him judgment against defendants Goldberg, Rosenthal, Bronston and the Peirez defendants. Schwartz\u2019s brief, on appeal pursues only the second and fourth of these challenges, as he argues that (A) the dismissal of the counterclaim should be reversed, and (B) if the dismissal of the counterclaim is affirmed, he should be granted judgment against the other defendants for a total of 70% of the amount of the United States\u2019 judgment against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-17\">. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.427 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-18\">(a) <em>Principle. </em>Costs applicable to services, facilities, and supplies furnished to the provider by organizations related to the provider by common ownership or control are includa-ble in the allowable cost of the provider at the cost to the related organization.

An additional claim was asserted against Schwartz with respect to a later period, for overpayment due to various accounting deficiencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\">. Schwartz\u2019s additional complaint that the court erred in failing to grant him judgment against his codefendants for 70% of the United States\u2019 judgment against him is baseless. Although the \u201cWHEREFORE\u201d clause of Schwartz\u2019s answer requested judgment \u201c[ajdjusting the claims among the defendants,\u201d Schwartz had not asserted a cross-claim against any defendant other than Goldberg. He therefore was not entitled to judgment against any other defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">. Schwartz\u2019s claim that the panel that eventually denied Woodcrest\u2019s claims was improperly constituted because it was appointed by Travelers is squarely foreclosed by <em>Schweiker v. McClure. </em>While recognizing that \u201cdue process demands impartiality on the part of those who function in judicial or quasi-judicial capacities,\u201d the <em>McClure </em>Court noted that there is a presumption that the hearing officers who decide Part B claims are unbiased. See <em>Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 47 [95 S.Ct. 1456, 1464, 43 L.Ed.2d 712] (1975); <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 421 [61 S.Ct. 999, 1004, <em>85 </em>L.Ed. 1429] (1941). This presumption can be rebutted by a showing of conflict of interest or some other specific reason for disqualification. See <em>Gibson v. Berryhill, </em>411 U.S. 564, 578-579 [93 S.Ct. 1689, 1697-1698, 36 L.Ed.2d 488] (1973); Ward <em>v. Village of Monroeville, </em>409 U.S. 57, 60 [93 S.Ct. 80, 83, 34 L.Ed.2d 267] (1972).. .. But the burden of establishing a disqualifying interest rests on the party making the assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 195-96, 102 S.Ct. at 1670 (footnote omitted). The Court noted that under Part B, carriers follow prescribed federal procedures and pay all allowed Part B claims out of funds provided by the federal government, not from their own funds. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 102 S.Ct. at 1670. If disappointed claimants seek review, the carrier appoints as intermediate reviewers and ultimate hearing officers persons who have not participated in any prior stage of the claim\u2019s adjudication, <em>id. </em>at 191, 102 S.Ct. at 1667, and the salaries of these hearing officers are paid by the federal government, <em>id. </em>at 196, 102 S.Ct. at 1670. Thus, the <em>McClure </em>Court, having noted that there was no claim of \u201cactual\u201d bias on the part of the hearing officers, <em>id. </em>at 195 n. 8, 102 S.Ct. at 1670 n. 8, rejected this portion of the due process claim stating that, \u201c[i]n the absence of proof of financial interest on the part of the carriers there is no basis for assuming a derivative bias among their hearing officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197, 102 S.Ct. at 1671.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">Schwartz\u2019s contention in the present case is indistinguishable. Under Part A, as under Part B, the intermediaries such as Travelers reimburse providers from federal, and not their own, funds. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395g. The fees and expenses of the hearing officers are paid by the federal government. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(g)(1), 1395h(c), 1395i(h). And the providers operate under contracts that require compliance with standards prescribed by the statute and the Secretary. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 421.100, 421.110, 421.126 (1981). Thus there is no basis \u201cfor assuming a derivative bias\u201d on the part of Travelers\u2019 hearing panel. As Schwartz has alleged no financial' interest or conflict of interest on the part of Travelers, nor any other reason for disqualification of the hearing panel, this claim was properly rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">. The <em>McClure </em>Court\u2019s observations, as to the availability of noncarrier appellate review under Part A, see 456 U.S. at 198 &amp; n. 12, 102 S.Ct. at 1671 &amp; n. 12, are not pertinent to the present case. Such review is not available for provider claims relating to cost-reporting periods that ended prior to June 30, 1973. <em>See </em>note 8 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\">. With respect to the period covered by Wood-crest\u2019s ORI claims, i.e., August 30, 1968 to April 19, 1969, intermediary claim review procedures were not governed by statute or regulation. The first regulations by the Secretary of intermediaries\u2019 procedures for review of their initial determinations became effective on May 27, 1972, and applied only to cost-reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 1971. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1801(c). See <em>generally </em>37 Fed.Reg. 10,722-25 (1972) (codified at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.490-.499i (1973), \u201c[r]equir[ing] intermediaries to institute review procedures for providers dissatisfied with intermediaries\u2019 determinations on cost reports\u201d). These regulations were soon augmented by more detailed specifications as to the appellate procedures to be followed by intermediaries. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.1801-.1833; <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 405.1881-.1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">The appellate review of Woodcrest\u2019s ORI claims was commenced in October 1973 and extended to May 1977. Although it was not required to do so, Travelers apparently followed the procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 405.-1801-1833 in reviewing its determination of these pre-1971 claims. Hence we discuss the adequacy of the procedures provided by those sections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b170-5\">. We reject Schwartz\u2019s contention that Congress\u2019s enactment in 1972 of legislation establishing a Provider Reimbursement Review Board to provide agency review of Part A provider claims for cost-reporting periods ending on or after June 30, 1973, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>oo; </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.1835-.1877, bespoke a belief by Congress that the earlier procedures were constitutionally deficient. We have found no such deficiency, and the legislative history indicates only that Congress thought that further review was \u201cdesirable,\u201d <em>see </em>H.R.Rep. No. 92-231, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4989, 5094, not that it was constitutionally necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We also reject Schwartz\u2019s effort to distinguish <em>McClure </em>on the basis that there are far fewer Part A providers than Part B beneficiaries, and hence that the burden on the government of allowing review of Part A claims would not be heavy. The difference in the numbers of anticipated Part A and Part B appeals is hardly pertinent, however, since the <em>McClure </em>Court assumed that even Part B review \u201cwould not be unduly burdensome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 102 S.Ct. at 1671.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. The <em>McClure </em>Court noted that its conclusions as to the adequacy of the Secretary\u2019s criteria for selection of hearing officers were confirmed by the evidence in the record as to the qualifications of nine hearing officers: \u201c[t]wo were retired administrative law judges with 15 to 18 years of judging experience, five had extensive experience in medicine or medical insurance, one had been a practicing attorney for 20 years, and one was an attorney with 42 years experience in the insurance industry who was self-employed as an insurance adjuster.\u201d 456 U.S. at 200 n. 15, 102 S.Ct. at 1672 n. 15. Our conclusion in the present case that the procedures afforded Woodcrest did not result in a deprivation of due process is similarly buttressed by the evidence of record as to the qualifications of the Travelers-appointed hearing panel that reviewed Woodcrest\u2019s claims. The panel was composed of one person with 18 years\u2019 experience in the health service industry, including many years as auditor or comptroller of various hospitals; one person trained as an accountant who had several years\u2019 experience in Medicare reimbursement matters; and one person who was then a hospital comptroller with fifteen years\u2019 association with the health care field and six years of practice with a major accounting firm. Two of the three panel members had a total of nineteen years\u2019 experience as members of the Hospital Financial Management Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">. We reject as meritless Goldberg\u2019s contention that Schwartz\u2019s cross-claim was premature because Schwartz had not yet sustained loss or damage for which he was entitled to be indemnified. The cross-claim was raised conditionally, as Schwartz asserted that \u201cin the event\u201d he was held liable on the United States\u2019 claim he was entitled to payment pro tanto from Goldberg. Nor was judgment on the cross-claim entered without the necessary predicate of judgment in favor of the United States against Schwartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">We have also considered and rejected Goldberg\u2019s other contentions. They do not merit discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
