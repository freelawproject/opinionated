SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Appellants, plaintiff-intervenors in the District Court, represent a class of white male employees who negotiated a consent decree with appellees, the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the General Services Administration (GSA), regarding certain alleged reverse discrimination actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the District Court approved their consent decree, appellants learned that appellees proposed to enter into a potentially conflicting agreement with a group of minority and female employees. They successfully intervened in that litigation and succeeded in having changes made to the proposed decree. Appellants then filed a petition under Section 706(k) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) (1976), for attorney fees incurred in the intervening litigation. The District Court denied the petition because appellants were not \u201cprevailing parties\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We find that the District Court applied an improper standard in determining appellants\u2019 \u201cprevailing parties\u201d status. Therefore, we vacate its decision and remand for further proceedings on the attorney fees petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">This attorney fees petition arose out of an alleged conflict between two independent Title VII discrimination suits. The first suit began in May of 1973 when a class representing black and female employees\u2014 the <em>Miller </em>class<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 initiated legal action alleging that appellees had discriminated by using racial and sexual criteria in their employment actions. Because plaintiffs\u2019 earlier administrative complaints were resolved against them,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the District Court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary motions for class certification and summary judgment, thereby forcing the action into hibernation. In 19,77, however, an intervening Supreme Court decision<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prompted the District Court to reverse itself and stirred the class to resume its action. On proper motion, the court ordered discovery to commence and officially certified the plaintiff class.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">Meanwhile, in March of 1978 another class of GAO/GSA employees, representing white males (the <em>Smith </em>class), filed suit, alleging reverse discrimination in employment. <em>See Smith et al. v. Staats, </em>Civil Action No. 78-0098 (D.D.C.1979). After numerous hearings concerning the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>reverse discriminatory policies and practices were held,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the parties agreed to settle their dispute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They proposed a broad consent judgment in which appellees would agree not to discriminate on the basis of race,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would assure that any affirmative action programs did not adversely impact the promotional opportunities of white males,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and would apply their personnel policies openly and evenhandedly in the future.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The District Court approved this settlement in March 1979. App. 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The concurrent <em>Miller </em>litigation was rapidly moving forward.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In December 1980, however, after exhaustive discussions, the parties finally agreed to enter into a consent decree of their own. This decree provided, in pertinent part, that GAO would establish a settlement fund in lieu of all monetary claims,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> would develop and implement job-related performance standards,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> would establish certain promotional goals for minority and female employees,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> would develop and implement training programs,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and would allow plaintiffs to monitor GAO\u2019s compliance with the decree through stipulated reporting mechanisms.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On December 19, 1980 the District Court preliminarily approved the consent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">As provided in the decree, the <em>Miller </em>settlement was circulated among appellees\u2019 employees to give them an opportunity to object to any part of the agreement. App. 366. When they received the proposed decree, various members of the white male class became concerned. Their counsel alerted appellees that the proposed <em>Miller </em>decree might be in conflict with the <em>Smith </em>decree,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but these warnings apparently fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>on deaf ears and went unheeded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Worried that the District Court would approve conflicting settlements, <em>Smith </em>counsel next sought to intervene<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in the <em>Miller </em>litigation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Both the <em>Miller </em>class plaintiffs and appellees vigorously resisted this intervention.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On July 14, 1981 the District Court allowed the <em>Smith </em>class<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> to intervene in the <em>Miller </em>litigation. It further ordered the parties to meet and to \u201cattempt to resolve their differences over paragraph 21 of the Proposed Consent Decree * * App. 161. The parties did meet, but could not obtain a mutually satisfactory resolution. On August 6, 1981 the District Court further admonished the parties to settle their differences and, as a result, agreement was finally reached. App. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">On August 10, 1981 the District Court approved a final Consent Decree in the <em>Miller </em>litigation. This final order included all of the changes that the <em>Smith </em>plaintiffs, the <em>Miller </em>plaintiffs, and appellees had agreed upon on August 6. For example, the \u201cminimum\u201d <em>qua </em>\u201cminimum\u201d promotional goals and the requirement that appellees justify their failure to meet such goals were deleted from Paragraph 21.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, the <em>Smith </em>plaintiffs were accorded substantial rights to receive reports and continue monitoring the decree.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> With these and other demands met,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the <em>Smith </em>class offered no more objections to the entrance of the <em>Miller </em>decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Appellants subsequently filed their petition for attorney fees and costs, asking $26,-023.75 for legal services and $2,449.24 for costs. App. 84. Appellees opposed the petition on the ground that appellants were not \u201cprevailing parties\u201d within the meaning of Title VIT\u2019s attorney fees provision. App. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">On May 27, 1982 the District Court denied appellants\u2019 petition for attorney fees. The court noted that appellants, as full parties to the action, \u201cdid, in some sense, prevail in the underlying case by virtue of the fact that they succeeded in having the affirmative action provisions of that consent decree modified * * *.\u201d App. 3. Nonetheless, it found that appellants were not \u201cprevailing parties\u201d within the meaning of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-13\">First, there is no way of establishing that the proposed affirmative action provisions were originated by any actions of this defendant; on the contrary, it seems quite likely that such provisions were requested by the original plaintiffs during the settlement discussions. Since the proposed decree was negotiated among and entered into by <em>all </em>of the original parties, why should this particular defendant be required to assume the costs of the plaintiff-intervenors\u2019 efforts to modify the decree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-14\">Second, even if defendant GAO could be charged with some degree of responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>bility as a result of its originally consenting to the proposed affirmative action provisions, there has been no determination made that these provisions would in fact have resulted in legally cognizable and actionable discrimination against those represented by plaintiff-interve-nors. Instead, all the court has before it are the facts that the plaintiff-interve-nors believed the provisions would result in discrimination against their clients and that the original negotiators of these provisions agreed to modify them after discussions with the plaintiff-intervenors; these facts appear insufficient to support a threshold finding by this court that the provisions in issue did, in fact, propose and/or authorize actual discrimination against white males at GAO. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">App. 5-6 (emphasis in original). Thus, even though \u201cplaintiff-intervenors may well have performed valuable services to both their clients and * * * the public by intervening in this proceeding,\u201d App. 6, the District Court would not award attorney fees because appellants had not \u201cproven the defendant guilty, to some degree, of discrimination * * *.\u201d App. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Plaintiff-intervenors filed this petition for review on June 7,1982. We now vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Under Title VII the District Court must award attorney fees to the prevailing party in civil rights litigation unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust. <em>New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980); <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978); <em>Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975); <em>see also Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 88. S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968) (same under Title II). It is well recognized that the attorney fees provisions are to be liberally applied because the private \u201cplaintiff is the chosen instrument of Congress to vindicate a \u2018policy that Congress considered of the highest priority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. </em>v. <em>EEOC, supra, </em>434 U.S. at 418, 98 S.Ct. at 698 <em>(quoting Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>390 U.S. at 402, 88 S.Ct. at 966).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> District Courts, therefore, have only narrow discretion to deny fee awards<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and must find that parties have \u201cprevailed\u201d whenever their actions have arguably advanced the purposes of Title VII.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u201cThe statutory reference to the court\u2019s \u2018discretion\u2019 does not authorize a refusal to award any fees to a prevailing plaintiff unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Kulkarni v. Alexander, </em>662 F.2d 758, 766 n. 18 (D.C.Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The keynote case in this circuit, one which most appropriately places the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d within this scheme, is <em>Comm\u2019rs Court of Medina County, Texas v. United States, </em>683 F.2d 435 (D.C.Cir.1982). In <em>Medina </em>the court endorsed granting at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>torney fees to defendant-intervenors whose case had become moot under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Medina </em>outlined a liberal, two-pronged test for determining fee claimants\u2019 \u201cprevailing party\u201d status. In the first prong the court must determine that the fee claimant has substantially received the relief sought. <em>Id. </em>at 440. Fee claimants can satisfy this inquiry by showing that the \u201cfinal result represents, in a real sense, a disposition that furthers\u201d their interests. <em>Id. </em>at 441.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In the second, prong the court must determine that \u201cthe <em>lawsuit </em>was a catalyst motivating defendants to provide\u201d the requested relief, <em>id. </em>at 442 (emphasis in original), or that the \u201clawsuit was a necessary factor in obtaining the relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To satisfy this second prong fee claimants must demonstrate that their claims were \u201cnot wholly insubstantial\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and that these claims contributed to their obtaining the resulting relief.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Having satisfied these two prongs, fee claimants are entitled to attorney fees unless the court finds special circumstances that would render the award unjust. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AniD\">In this case the District Court determined that appellants were not \u201cprevailing parties,\u201d and thus were not entitled to attorney fees. Though it clearly found that appellants had achieved their objective<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and were the cause of the results obtained,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>denied appellants \u201cprevailing party\u201d status because they had not proved \u201cany sufficient threshold showing of real discrimination * * to justify allowing [them] to shift their counsel fees to this defendant agency.\u201d App. 6. Though claimants clearly \u201cbelieved the provisions would result in discrimination against their clients and * * * the original negotiators * * * agreed to modify [these provisions] after discussions with\u201d the fee claimants, the court did not find facts sufficient \u201cto support a threshold finding * * * that the provisions in issue did, in fact, propose and/or authorize actual discrimination against white males at GAO.\u201d App. 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On its face, the District Court\u2019s \u201cthreshold of discrimination\u201d test, based as it is on sufficient facts in the record, see <em>id., </em>appears to hold fee claimants to a higher standard than the law requires.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Fee claimants do not have to show facts proving defendants \u201cguilty, to some degree, of discrimination,\u201d see App. at 3-4, to establish their \u201cprevailing party\u201d status. To the contrary, for purposes of the attorney fees provisions, they need only allege a claim that is colorable under the civil rights laws \u2014 that has some minimum basis in law. <em>See </em>note 31 <em>supra. </em>This is a question of law, not fact.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">However, we hesitate to find that claimants were \u201cprevailing parties\u201d on the basis of the appellate record alone. Despite some broad statements that seemingly imposed an overly-demanding burden on appellants, <em>see </em>pages 339-340 <em>supra, </em>the .District Court also found that claimants had not demonstrated that \u201cthese provisions would in fact have resulted in legally cognizable and actionable discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340. Arguably, this statement can be read as a conclusion, by the District Court, that fee claimants had not alleged a claim with colorable merit in Title VII law. On the other hand, the District Court\u2019s broader statements indicate that it may have been looking for something more than a non-frivolous claim. Thus we think a remand is appropriate so that the District Court can more carefully consider the petition in light of the appropriate standards of law, and thus clear up the confusion that now exists in its analysis.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Of course, even if the District Court determines that appellants stated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>not wholly insubstantial Title VII claim, it might still find special circumstances that would render an award of attorney fees unjust. <em>See Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>390 U.S. at 401, 402, 88 S.Ct. at 966. In deciding whether such special circumstances exist, the District Court can, for example, consider the \u201cpyrrhic\u201d nature of plaintiffs\u2019 victory.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>See Comm\u2019rs Court of Medina County, Texas v. United States, supra, </em>683 F.2d at 443. Similarly, it can consider whether claimants\u2019 intervention was timely<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and whether their intervention was necessary to protect the policies embodied in Title VII.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> But the District Court should <em>not </em>consider the absence of a finding of wrongdoing or the possibility that defendant was not motivated by bad faith.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Attorney fees are not designed merely to penalize defendants, but to encourage injured individuals to seek relief. <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>390 U.S. at 402, 88 S.Ct. at 966. Thus the determinative factor must be the role of plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, not the motivations of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">When the District Court applies an improper standard to a petition for attorney fees, this court must order the lower court to remedy its error. <em>Foster v. Boorstin, </em>561 F.2d 340 (D.C.Cir.1977). We believe that the District Court\u2019s \u201cthreshold of discrimination\u201d standard may have held appellants to a higher standard than is appropriate. Accordingly, we remand to the District Court for further proceedings on fee claimants\u2019 petition. The District Court must decide whether appellants have stated a not wholly insubstantial claim and, if they have, whether special circumstances exist that would render an award of attorney fees unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-16\">.

The court thus noted that the proper inquiry must initially focus on the precise factual/legal condition that the fee claimant has sought to change, and then determine if the outcome, compared to this original condition, confers an actual benefit or relief from a burden. <em>Comm\u2019rs Court of Medina County, Texas v. United States, supra </em>note 29, 683 F.2d at 441. <em>See also Bonnes v. Long, </em>599 F.2d 1316 (4th Cir.1979). <em>Medina </em>specifically rejects the notion that fee claimants must show \u201cthat they have prevailed on every aspect of the case or that their proposed plan was adopted in order to be found \u2018prevailing parties.\u2019 \u201d 683 F.2d at 441. Rather, the only question at this point in the inquiry is whether fee claimants have received any benefit at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\">. This \u201csubstantiality\u201d standard is set out in the legislative history of a related attorney fees statute, the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-559, 90 Stat. 2641 (1976), <em>codif\u00eded at </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1976), <em>see </em>H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 n. 7 (1976) (in instances where courts reluctant to resolve merits of claim; fees may be awarded if the underlying claim meets the \u201csubstantiality\u201d test of <em>Hagans v.

La-vine, supra, </em>and ensures that the alleged discrimination claims have at least colorable merit when analyzed in light of established Title VII theory. The standard requires courts to dismiss fee claims based on wholly frivolous lawsuits, but simultaneously constrains them from holding a full trial, or from making <em>ad hoc </em>predictions about plaintiffs chance for success, on the merits. The court may only consider whether claimant\u2019s action is \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\u201d <em>Nadeau v.

The substantiality of the claims was not at issue in <em>Medina.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b433-12\">. In making this causal inquiry, <em>Medina </em>instructs courts to \u201cconsider the chronological sequence of events and draw conclusions from the facts at hand.\u201d 683 F.2d at 442. <em>See also Robinson v. Kimbrough, </em>652 F.2d 458, 466 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, supra </em>note 31. From this sequence of events the court must determine whether it is more likely than not that fee claimants\u2019 participation contributed to defendant\u2019s action \u2014 so that the relief granted cannot be ascribed to other influences. <em>Cf. </em>W. Prosser, Law of Torts 236-241 (4th ed. 1971) (discussing \u201cbut for\u201d causation standard).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b433-13\">. <em>See </em>App. at 3 (\u201cplaintiff-intervenors did, in some sense, prevail * * * by virtue of the fact they succeeded in having the affirmative action provisions of the consent decree modified\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b433-14\">. <em>See </em>App. at 2 (affirmative action provisions and other parts of decree modified after plaintiff-intervenors protested their preliminary approval); App. at 5-6 (original negotiators agreed to modify proposed decree in response to fee claimants\u2019 intervention).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-15\">The District Court did state at one point that the original parties could have agreed to modify the provisions for any number of reasons. <em>See </em>App. at 6 n. 5.

See note 31 <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b434-6\">. The District Court derived the \u201cthreshold of discrimination\u201d test from two prior decisions in the courts of this circuit. In <em>Grubbs v. Butz, </em>548 F.2d 973 (D.C.Cir.1976), this court reversed a District Court ruling that plaintiff could not proceed to lawsuit without exhausting certain administrative remedies. When plaintiff petitioned for attorney fees on the basis of this procedural victory, the court denied the petition on the ground that claimant had not made a threshold showing of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 975-976. But the court was clearly referring to the fact that plaintiffs initial victory was on a procedural, interlocutory issue \u2014 prior to trial on any of her discrimination claims \u2014 and thus she had not prevailed, at that point, on any claims advancing the policies underlying Title VII. Similarly, in <em>Brown v. Boorstin, </em>471 F.Supp. 56 (D.D.C.1978), the District Court denied attorney fees to a plaintiff complaining he was prejudiced by the Library of Congress\u2019 practice of recruiting and promoting on the basis of certain \u201cpreselection\u201d criteria. But it was undisputed that none of these \u201cpreselection\u201d criteria offended Title VII, and thus the District Court found the attorney fees provisions to be inapplicable. <em>Id. </em>at 57. Again, attorney fees were denied because plaintiff\u2019s claims had not advanced to a point, in trial or otherwise, where policies underlying Title VII had arguably been implicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\">. <em>Johnston v. Jago, supra </em>note 31, 691 F.2d at 286; <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, supra </em>note 31. It is especially important that this inquiry be kept to relevant law where settlements are involved. Parties might otherwise continue litigating past the point where they would otherwise agree to end the suit to establish the necessary facts. <em>See Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\"> In all fairness to the District Court, it did not have the benefit of our discussion on these issues in <em>Medina. </em>The District Court decided this case on May 27, 1982, and we issued our opinion in <em>Medina </em>on July 2, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b435-5\">. Even if fee claimants state a not wholly insubstantial claim, see note 31 <em>supra, </em>the net result obtained might be so insignificant that it would be unjust to shift plaintiffs\u2019 counsel fees to the defendant agency. See <em>Comm\u2019rs Court of Medina County, Texas v. United States, supra </em>note 29, 683 F.2d at 442 \u2014 143. Many of appellees\u2019 arguments in this case concern the significance of the benefits obtained. <em>Compare </em>brief of appellees at 13-16 (changes effectuated were insignificant) <em>with </em>brief of plaintiffs-inter-venors-appellants at 37-40 (changes were significant) <em>and </em>reply brief of plaintiffs-interve-nors-appellants at 13-17 (same). If, on remand, the District Court determines that fee claimants were prevailing parties, it can properly take these arguments into account in deciding whether special circumstances exist that would make the award unjust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b435-6\">. It appears to us, however, that appellants acted in a prompt and reasonable fashion in this litigation. Appellees make much of the fact that the <em>Miller </em>litigation began in the early 1970\u2019s, and that appellants filed their objections on the last day that comments could be filed. <em>See </em>brief for appellees at 2-3, 7, 13. But it seems equally clear that the <em>Miller </em>litigation went into a long period of dormancy, <em>see </em>notes 2-4 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text, and that appellants had no reason to know that it was alive again. Furthermore, appellants\u2019 supposed \u201celeventh hour\u201d intervention was preceded by their desirable resort to formal and informal administrative procedures. <em>See </em>notes 18-19 <em>supra </em>and accompanying text. However, the <em>amount </em>of the fee ultimately awarded may reflect the relatively minor role that appellants played after their prompt and reasonable intervention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b435-12\">. But since intervention, has already been granted, the District Court should not reevaluate its decision on this issue unless new evidence has arisen. <em>Comm\u2019rs Court of Medina County, Texas v. United States, supra </em>note 29, 683 F.2d at 443.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b435-13\">. <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, supra </em>note 31, 581 F.2d at 280. Thus the fact that the offending provisions may have been suggested by the original plaintiffs, <em>see </em>App. at 5, is not a proper consideration for the District Court to take into account. It does not matter which party originated the offensive provisions; the operative concern is whether an employer has become party to and bound by a provision that implicates Title VII policies. The fact that another party agreed with or even originated a provision that implicates Title VII does not shield the employer from liability or from its obligation under Title VII to pay the plaintiff\u2019s fees in correcting the situation. Since GAO agreed to the provisions, it must bear any costs associated with them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
