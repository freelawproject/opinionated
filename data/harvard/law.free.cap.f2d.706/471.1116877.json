Because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, we vacate its order and remand the case with instructions to transfer it to the United States Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b564-23\">The Authority is a municipal corporation which operates a number of low income housing facilities in Portsmouth, Virginia. It receives several types of federal subsidies pursuant to an annual contributions contract (ACC) with HUD and the provisions of'42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1437-1437n. Supplemental contributions for operating expenses (operating subsidies) are made available to the Authority on an annual basis in accordance with the terms of its ACC and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437g. At the time the Authority and HUD entered into the ACC, section 1437g provided in part: \u201cThe Secretary shall embody the provisions for such annual contributions in a contract guaranteeing their payment subject to the availability of funds.\u201d In 1979 Congress amended section 1437g by adding .the following clause to the sentence we have quoted: \u201cand such contract shall provide that no disposition of the lower income housing project, with respect to which the contract is entered into, shall occur during and for ten years after the period when contributions were made pursuant to such contract unless approved by the Secretary.\u201d Pub.L. No. 96-153, \u00a7 211(a)(3), 93 Stat. 1110, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437g(a)(l) (1979). Pursuant to his gen-' eral rule making powers under 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u00a7 3535(d), the Secretary of HUD promulgated a regulation that requires each public housing agency operating under an existing annual contributions contract to execute an amendment to its contract embodying the new language of section 1437g(a)(l). <em>See </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 869.105(a) (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The Authority refused to execute an amendment to its ACC, and HUD began withholding operating subsidies. In addition, HUD declined to consider the Authority\u2019s application for funds under the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14371. The parties have stipulated that the CIAP application would have been approved were it not for the Authority\u2019s refusal to execute the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The Authority filed a complaint in federal district court seeking to enjoin HUD from withholding operating subsidies due under its ACC. The original complaint requested that HUD be required to release $676,085, the amount of funds allegedly wrongfully withheld during fiscal years 1981-82 and 1982-83, and that it be enjoined from requiring the Authority to execute an amendment as a prerequisite to receiving operating subsidies or having its CIAP application considered. An amended complaint filed by the Authority excluded the request for specific monetary relief and instead asked the court to \u201cdirect an accounting of those sums owed ... as a result of the [Secretary\u2019s] erroneous interpretation of [section 1437g(a)(l)] and the resulting wrongful withholding of operating subsidies and CIAP funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The Secretary filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, alleging that the action was essentially a contract claim against the federal government for an amount exceeding $10,000 and jurisdiction thus belonged exclusively to the Claims Court under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2) and 1491. The district court denied HUD\u2019s motion, ruling that HUD had waived its sovereign immunity in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404a and that the district court had federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The court decided the merits of the case in the Authority\u2019s favor and issued the requested declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">We agree with the Secretary that subject matter jurisdiction over this action belongs exclusively in the Claims Court. Because we dispose of this appeal on jurisdictional grounds, we do not address the merits of the Authority\u2019s claim except to the extent they bear on the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">The Tucker Act establishes three conditions which, if satisfied, vest subject matter jurisdiction exclusively in the Claims Court. The action must be against the United States, seek monetary relief in excess of $10,000, and be founded upon the Constitution, federal statute, executive regulation, or government contract. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2) and 1491.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">It is not necessary that the United States be denominated as a party. An action against a federal agency or official will be treated as an action against the sovereign if \u201cthe judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration, or if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain the Government from acting, or compel it to act.\u201d <em>Dugan v. </em>Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 620, 83 S.Ct. 999, 1006, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">This is a suit against a federal official for acts performed within his official capacity, and, consequently, it amounts to an action against the sovereign. <em>See Southern Sog, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roland, </em>644 F.2d 376, 380 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Ippolito-Lutz, Inc. v. Harris, </em>473 F.Supp. 255, 259 (S.D.N.Y.1979). Furthermore, any monetary judgment recovered in this case would expend itself on the public treasury. There is no \u201cseparate fund\u201d for the payment of operating subsidies within HUD\u2019s exclusive control, \u201cthe origin of which [is] not the public treasury.\u201d <em>Southern Sog, </em>644 F.2d at 379; <em>see also Lomas &amp; Nettleton Co. v. Pierce, </em>636 F.2d 971, 973-74 (5th Cir.1981). The funds appropriated to HUD for payment of operat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ing subsidies clearly originate in the public treasury, and they do not cease to be public funds after they are appropriated.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, both because this is a suit against a federal official and any judgment recovered would expend itself on the public treasury, we construe this action as one against the United States for purposes of the Tucker Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The second requirement for Tucker Act jurisdiction is that the claim seek monetary relief in excess of $10,000. The Authority\u2019s primary objective in this action is to recover money allegedly wrongfully withheld by the federal government. The amount involved far exceeds the jurisdictional prerequisite. Although the Authority\u2019s amended complaint phrases its request for money as a request for equitable relief, Claims Court jurisdiction cannot be avoided by framing an essentially monetary claim in injunctive or declaratory terms. <em>Hoopa Valley Tribe v. United States, </em>596 F.2d 435, 436 (Ct.Cl.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The Authority also contends that in light of the other equitable claims at stake, the Claims Court , would be unable to render a complete and effective remedy because it lacks the power to grant injunctive or declaratory relief. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, where a claim primarily seeks monetary relief, it is improper to deny the Claims Court jurisdiction simply because it cannot grant the precise equitable relief sought. <em>American Science &amp; Engineering, Inc. v. Califano, </em>571 F.2d 58, 62 (1st Cir.1978). A district court does not gain jurisdiction over a Tucker Act claim simply because the complaint couples requests for monetary relief with requests for injunctive relief. <em>Cook v. Arentzen, </em>582 F.2d 870, 878 (4th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Furthermore, the Claims Court can issue declaratory relief that is \u201ctied to and subordinate to a monetary award.\u201d <em>S.J. Groves &amp; Sons Co. v. United States, </em>495 F.Supp. 201, 209 (D.Colo.1980); <em>see also Gentry v. United States, </em>546 F.2d 343, 346 (Ct.Cl.1976). A 1972 amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 endows the Claims Court with limited equitable jurisdiction incidental to its jurisdiction over monetary claims because it provides: \u201cIn any case within its jurisdiction, the [Claims Court] shall have the power to remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as it may deem proper and just.\u201d <em>See also S.J. Groves &amp; Sons Co., </em>495 F.Supp. at 209. Therefore, the Claims Court is capable of awarding the Authority the relief it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The third and final requirement for Tucker Act jurisdiction is that the claim be founded upon the Constitution, federal statute, executive regulation, or government contract. The Authority contends that this action arises out of federal law and that the district court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">The gravamen of the Authority\u2019s claim is that HUD cannot modify its contractual obligation to pay operating subsidies by unilaterally altering the terms of the ACC. The answer to this issue depends on whether Congress intended to authorize the Secretary to modify existing annual contributions contracts by incorporating the new provisions of \u00a7 1437g(a)(l), and, if this was its intention, whether the modification infringes any constitutionally protected interests of the Authority. The primary basis for the Authority\u2019s challenge to the Secretary\u2019s actions, therefore, is the government contract. Although disposition of this claim necessitates adjudication of some questions of federal law, \u201cefforts to ground [jurisdiction] on the federal question statute have consistently been rejected by courts because the effect would be to undercut the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.\u201d <em>American Science &amp; Engineering, Inc., </em>571 F.2d at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">Furthermore, the Tucker Act gives the Claims Court jurisdiction over actions against the United States founded upon the Constitution, federal statutes, and regulations, as well as upon government contracts. Consequently, the Claims Court is the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>er forum for this action, whether it is characterized as one in contract or one to interpret provisions of the Constitution, federal statutes, or regulations pertaining to the contract. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>588 F.2d 1281, 1282 (9th Cir.1979); <em>see also Estate of Watson v. Blumenthal, </em>586 F.2d 925, 929 (2nd Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Finally, the Authority contends that the district court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404a. That section provides that the \u201cUnited States Housing Authority may sue and be sued only with respect to its functions under this chapter, and sections 1501 and 1505 of this title.\u201d The Authority argues that section 1404a both waives sovereign immunity and supports federal question jurisdiction by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In support of its position, the Authority relies on <em>Ferguson v. Union National Bank, </em>126 F.2d 753, 756-57 (4th Cir.1942), where this court interpreted 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702, another \u201csue and be sued\u201d clause. Section 1702 provides that the \u201cSecretary shall, in carrying out the provisions of this [chapter], be authorized, in his official capacity, to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\u201d In <em>Ferguson, </em>we reasoned that Congress could not have intended for suits over $10,000 to be brought in \u201cany state court of general jurisdiction, but in the federal jurisdiction only in the Court of Claims.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>126 F.2d at 756. Consequently, we held that section 1702 not only waived sovereign immunity but also conferred subject matter jurisdiction in the federal district court. Although the Authority does not contend that section 1702 governs this action, it argues that sections 1404a and 1702 are similar and that <em>Ferguson, </em>by analogy, is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The two \u201csue and be sued\u201d clauses are substantially different, however, and it is precisely this difference that renders <em>Ferguson </em>inapposite. Section 1404a does not contain the critical language \u201cin any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal,\u201d and thus the basis for our reasoning in <em>Ferguson </em>does not exist here. <em>See A.L. Rowan &amp; Son v. HUD, </em>611 F.2d 997, 1000-01 n. 3 (5th Cir.1980). Therefore, although section 1404a waives sovereign immunity, unlike section 1702 it does not vest jurisdiction in the district court. <em>See Jemo Associates v. Greene Metro. Housing Authority, </em>523 F.Supp. 186, 187 (S.D.Ohio 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">In sum, because this essentially is a contract claim against the federal government for monetary relief in excess of $10,000, the Claims Court has exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2) and 1491. Accordingly, the district court was without jurisdiction to hear this case. We vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to transfer the ease to the Claims Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> See, e.g., Appropriations Act, Pub.L.
