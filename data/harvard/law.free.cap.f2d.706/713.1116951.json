Subsequently, her discharge was revoked on a claim that it had been gotten fraudulently. When court-martial proceedings were commenced against her, she claimed that Article 3(b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the statute under which the court-martial court asserted jurisdiction, is unconstitutional. She appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the United States Army. Finding the statute to withstand constitutional scrutiny, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">In late August, 1980, Wickham submitted a urine sample as part of a pregnancy test. The test results indicated that she was approximately seven weeks pregnant. On October 15, 1980 she was found eligible for a discharge from active duty based upon that finding. Since she had not completed her military service obligation, her discharge from active duty also resulted in her transfer to the Individual Ready Reserve. She was assigned to the Army Reserve Control Group with her military service obligation to run until April 9, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-20\">In early November, Army officials learned that Wickham was not pregnant and that she had submitted the urine of another servicewoman who she knew was pregnant. An investigation by agents of the Army Criminal Investigation Division resulted in sworn statements verifying this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-21\">The Army promptly lodged a formal charge against Wickham and on December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>19,1980 revoked the order which discharged her from active duty. Court-martial proceedings were then commenced against Wickham for fraudulently obtaining a discharge. Before her trial could begin, Wick-ham filed a petition with the United States Court of Military Appeals seeking to block the court-martial and to restore her to civilian status. A stay of the proceeding was granted, but a split three-judge panel of that court later dissolved the stay. Wick-ham sought collateral relief through a district court petition seeking a permanent injunction against further prosecution in the military court. In addition, Wickham\u2019s complaint sought release from military custody, the dismissal of the court-martial charge and damages. From the district court\u2019s grant of the Army\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Wickham appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The issue presented is whether Article 8(b) may constitutionally confer court-martial jurisdiction over a person who has received a discharge that is later challenged by the issuing service on the ground it was fraudulently procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The Government urges that we avoid the constitutional question raised here on the basis that Wickham failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. It is basic to military claims that the petitioner must exhaust her military remedies before seeking federal court intervention. <em>Schlesinger v. Councilman, </em>420 U.S. 738, 758, 95 S.Ct. 1300, 1313, 43 L.Ed.2d 591 (1975); <em>Gusik v. Schilder, </em>340 U.S. 128, 131-32, 71 S.Ct. 149, 151-152,95 L.Ed. 146 (1950); <em>Von Hoffburg v. Alexander, </em>615 F.2d 633, 637 (5th Cir. 1980). While the Government\u2019s court-martial tribunal has not yet heard this case on its merits, by her injunctive action challenging military jurisdiction, Wickham has exhausted her military remedies on the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The Constitution, in article I, section 8, clause 14, empowers Congress \u201c[t]o make. Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\u201d Article I, section 8, clause 18, authorizes Congress \u201c[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper\u201d to execute all powers which the Constitution vests in the Congress. <em>Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, </em>361 U.S. 234, 237, 80 S.Ct. 297, 298-299, 4 L.Ed.2d 268 (1960); <em>Reid v. Covert, </em>354 U.S. 1, 19, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1231, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957); <em>Dynes v. Hoover, </em>61 U.S. (20 How.) 65, 15 L.Ed. 838 (1852). This is a limited grant of power to Congress to create exceptions to Article III courts. Trial by court-martial and the. Uniform Code of Military Justice are manifestations of that congressional authority. <em>Kinsella, </em>361 U.S. at 237, 80 S.Ct. at 298-299. In balancing the need to maintain discipline and order in the armed services and rights of citizens to be free of military obligations and control, the Supreme Court has held that congressional power to authorize trial by court-martial must be limited to \u201cthe least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, </em>350 U.S. 11, 23, 76 S.Ct. 1, 8, 100 L.Ed. 8 (1955) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Dunn, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 204, 230-31, 5 L.Ed. 242 (1821)).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Wickham contends that once she received her discharge from active duty, she became a civilian. Therefore, under the teachings of <em>Toth v. Quarles, supra, </em>Congress cannot authorize a military court to exert jurisdiction over her because of her nonmilitary status. Since Article 3(b) is the basis upon which the military has asserted jurisdiction to revoke her discharge and return her to active duty, she argues that this portion of the UCMJ is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">In <em>Toth, </em>the Supreme Court found that \u201c[i]t has never been contended by this Court, however, that Article I military jurisdiction could be extended to civilian ex-,soldiers who had severed all relationship with the military and its institutions.\u201d 350 U.S. at 14, 76 S.Ct. at 4. The Army had predicated court-martial jurisdiction over Toth on Article 3(a) which subjected servicemen and former servicemen to trial by court-martial for certain offenses committed while in the service. The Court held that Congress could not constitutionally confer upon a military court jurisdiction over an exserviceman, who at the time he was accused of crime had absolutely no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>military connections. Wickham asserts Article 3(b) is facially unconstitutional since it also subjects \u201ccivilians\u201d to the jurisdiction of the military courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">In <em>Toth v. Quarles, </em>the Court identified three factors which control the extent of military court jurisdiction over discharged servicemen. All are met in the instance of Article 3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Court asked whether the trial of this defendant would further the \u201c \u2018primary\u2019 function of the military to \u2018fight\u2019 or be ready to fight wars, rather than the \u2018incidental\u2019 purpose of maintaining discipline within the service.\u201d 350 U.S. at 17, 22-23, 76 S.Ct. at 5, 8-9. While the exercise of jurisdiction to deter fraud certainly has the effect of maintaining discipline, limiting the initial inquiry to fraud in procuring a discharge makes the power impact directly on the military\u2019s readiness to fight. Fraudulent separation, like desertion, places the power to thin the ranks of those ready for combat in the hands of the soldier not the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The Court next asked if the extension of military jurisdiction would \u201csweep under military jurisdiction a great number of persons not otherwise subject to military law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20, 22-23, 76 S.Ct. at 6-7, 8-9. The reach of Article 3(b) in this respect is minimal. It only subjects to jurisdiction those who in the midst of a legal period of service fraudulently procure a discharge. <em>See Wickham v. Hall, </em>12 M.J. 145, 151 (C.M. A. 1981 Cook, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Finally, the Court asked whether \u201cthe scope of the extension of court-martial jurisdiction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> [is] limited to <em>\u2018the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\u2019 \u201d </em>350 U.S. at 23, 76 S.Ct. at 8 (emphasis in original). Article 3(b) meets this requirement.' It is a narrowly drawn jurisdictional statute designed to maintain order and discipline in the service. It only asserts power over those who seek fraudulently to terminate their lawful period of service. Finally, it acts to preserve an active, full, prepared military fighting force. <em>Toth </em>does not condemn Article 3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">The enforcement of service obligations is critical for the continued orderly governance of America\u2019s land and naval forces. The choice to accomplish that end by authorizing the armed forces to try and punish those who seek to abbreviate their lawful active duty commitments is a constitutionally reasonable exercise of congressional authority. Such a power is akin to the unquestioned power vested in the military to try and punish deserters. Art. 85, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">The legislative history of Article 3(b) reveals that Congress was reacting to cases arising after World War II in which servicemen had fraudulently procured discharges. The former servicemen then used their fraudulently obtained discharges to block military court action. <em>See </em>Hearings on the Uniform Code of Military Justice before a House Subcommittee of the Committee on Armed Services, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 885 (March 18, 1949) (Comments of Felix Lar-kin, Assistant General Counsel, Office of The Secretary of Defense). Recognizing the seriousness of the problem, Congress gave military tribunals the authority to deal with an offense that would strike at the very heart of the individual\u2019s military commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">A cardinal tenet of military law is that a serviceman, upon enlisting, has changed his status. <em>In re Grimley, </em>137 U.S. 147, 150, 11 S.Ct. 54, 34 L.Ed. 636 (1890). In <em>Grimley, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe taking of the oath of allegiance is the pivotal fact which changes the status from that of a civilian to that of soldier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156-57, 11 S.Ct. at 56. Once that civilian becomes a soldier, his status as a member of the armed forces can only be honorably terminated by a completion of the service obligation or a valid discharge. A soldier may not by fraud cut short his military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>status before his service obligation is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The Ninth Circuit has stated that once a serviceman has enlisted, \u201che cannot withdraw unilaterally and become a civilian again. Enlistment is a contract; but it is a contract which changes the status .... of the civilian to soldier until released.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Chafee, </em>451 F.2d 1374, 1378 (9th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 933, 93 S.Ct. 242, 34 L.Ed.2d 188 (1972). That release or discharge is only effective if it is validly procured. It must be \u201cdue and legal, not fraudulent.\u201d Winthrop, Military Law &amp; Precedents 89 n. 46 (2d ed. 1920).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Military Appeals agreed with this position. Judge Cook\u2019s majority opinion noted that \u201cReparation procured by fraudulent means is not a valid separation.... The servicemember may merge with the civilian populace, but the fraudulent character of his separation exists and it binds him to the military community.\u201d <em>Wickham v. Hall, </em>12 M.J. 145, 150 (C.M.A.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">According to Wickham, this is the rub. Who should decide whether she fraudulently procured her discharge, a civil or a military court? She contends she is a civilian until her discharge is proven to be fraudulently procured. To allow the military court to assert jurisdiction over the claim that her discharge was fraudulently procured so that the military court can determine whether there was fraud in its procurement presumes she is still in the service. It is just as circular, however, to presume the discharge is valid and thereby confer upon a civil court jurisdiction to decide the issue of validity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Wickham\u2019s argument is appealing, but not persuasive. First, it presupposes that an unfair resolution of the issue awaits her before the military tribunal. Despite the extreme examples used by Justice Douglas in his scathing attack on \u201cso-called military justice\u201d in <em>O\u2019Callahan v. Parker, </em>395 U.S. 258, 266 n. 7, 89 S.Ct. 1683, 1687 n. 7, 23 L.Ed.2d 291 (1969), military courts are not Kafkaesque Star Chambers. They assume the same responsibility to protect a person\u2019s constitutional rights as state and federal courts. <em>Burns v. Wilson, </em>346 U.S. 137, 142, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 1048-1049, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953). This court is \u201cunwilling to presume .. . that the military courts will not fully and fairly consider the claims by petitioner of the violation of his constitutional rights .... \u201d <em>In re Kelly, </em>401 F.2d 211, 213 (5th Cir.1968). Although grand jury presentment and trial by petit jury are not parts of the system, and there is no right to bail the accused in a court-martial does enjoy most of the same significant constitutional rights accorded a criminal defendant in a civil court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">Whether Wickham\u2019s pregnancy test/discharge was validly or fraudulently procured depends in large part upon army regulations and procedures. Such matters fall within the special expertise of the military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>courts. <em>Schlesinger v. Councilman, </em>420 U.S. 738, 95 S.Ct. 1300, 43 L.Ed.2d 591 (1975). We should defer to them in these respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Second, the determination being made by the military court in this instance is precisely like that which must be made by a district court when it is called on to decide the merits of a claim in order to determine whether federal jurisdiction exists. <em>United States </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers of America, </em>330 U.S. 258, 292 n. 57, 67 S.Ct. 677, 695 n. 57, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947); <em>Davis v. Cluet, Peabody &amp; Co., </em>667 F.2d 1371, 1374 n. 8 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Carter v. United States, </em>135 F.2d 858, 861 (5th Cir.1943).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Third, if military courts should abridge Wickham\u2019s constitutional rights in the course of resolving the status of her discharge, the writ of habeas corpus is available for collateral attack on the military court judgment. Article 3(b) of the UCMJ is, on its face, a constitutional assignment of military court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In closing, we also note that <em>Toth </em>speaks to one whose offense was not connected with the severance of his ties with the military. Wickham, upon obtaining her discharge, was not totally released but instead was transferred from Active Duty to a Reserve component.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All military ties were not severed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She did not become a \u201cfull-fledged\u201d civilian. <em>Wheeler v. Reynolds, </em>164 F.Supp. 951, 955 (N.D.Fla.1958).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since, even if her discharge from active duty was valid, Wickham remained in a Ready Reserve duty status for the remainder of her contract enlistment period, her status would not equate with that of civilian. If it should be determined that the fraud-in-discharge issue is one that must constitutionally go to a civil court, we would nevertheless hold that Article 3(b) of the UCMJ is valid as applied to Wickham in this case since she remained a member of an armed forces reserve component.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">The last issue raised by the plaintiff is that of money damages. Wickham asks this court to reverse the district court judgment and to remand this action for a trial on the damages issue. She seeks $25,000 from Colonel Hall in his official capacity and also asks for recovery \u201cfor the costs, anxiety, and inconvenience\u201d of defending herself in this case. Because of our resolution of the constitutional claim, the damages question is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">THORNBERRY, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">Because Article 3(b) is grounded on a presumption of guilt, and constitutes an unconstitutional expansion of military jurisdiction, I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>A. <em>Impermissible Presumption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The majority has concluded that Article 3(b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(b) (1976), constitutionally confers court-martial jurisdiction over a former servicewoman who has received a facially valid discharge later challenged by the issuing service on the ground that it was fraudulently procured. In order to reach this result, it appears to me that the majority has implicitly indulged in the impermissible assumption that Wickham is guilty of the fraudulent act with which she is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">On October 15, 1980 Wickham obtained a facially valid discharge from her military obligations. The discharge resulted from a determination that Wickham was pregnant, based on the results of a urine test, and a pelvic examination by an Army doctor. The effect of this discharge was to terminate her active military service, and to return her to the civilian status she enjoyed before her term of service began.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a civilian, Wickham was and is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts-martial. <em>McElroy </em>v. <em>Guagliardo, </em>361 U.S. 281, 80 S.Ct. 305, 4 L.Ed.2d 282 (1960); <em>Grisham v. Hagan, </em>361 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 310, 4 L.Ed.2d 279 (1960); <em>Kinsella v. Singleton, </em>361 U.S. 234, 80 S.Ct. 297, 4 L.Ed.2d 268 (1960); <em>Reid v. Covert, </em>354 U.S. 1, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957); <em>Toth v. Quarles, </em>350 U.S. 11, 76 S.Ct. 1, 100 L.Ed. 8 (1955).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">A few weeks after Wickham returned to civilian life, information surfaced suggesting that she may have submitted, as her own, a urine specimen obtained from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>pregnant servicewoman she knew. An investigation conducted by Army agents led to the procurement of sworn statements corroborating this information. A formal charge was then lodged against Wickham, alleging that she had procured her separation from the armed forces in violation of Article 83(2) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 883(2) (1976), by falsely representing that she was pregnant. She faces up to five years confinement at hard labor, a dishonorable discharge, and the forfeiture of all pay and allowances. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 856 (1976). This formal charge is still pending against her. She has never been tried on this charge by any court, civil or military. She is still a civilian.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">In order to exercise jurisdiction over Wickham a court-martial must necessarily presume that she is a servicewoman. However, she would only be a servicewoman if she is guilty of the very offense for which it wishes to try her; fraudulent separation from the service. Neither the common law, nor the military law, authorizes such a presumption of guilt. Quite the contrary. The presumption of innocence is a fundamental tenet of both systems of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">The majority recognizes this inconsistency in its analysis, but dismisses it by concluding that the alternative analysis creates an equally insoluble conundrum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\">To allow the military court to assert jurisdiction over the claim that her discharge was fraudulently procured so that the military court can determine whether there was fraud in its procurement presumes she is still in the service. It is just as circular, however, to presume the discharge is valid and thereby confer <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>a civil court jurisdiction to decide the issue of validity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">It is not \u201cjust as circular\u201d to presume the discharge is valid, and limit the military to its action in federal court. The argument is a simple one. A discharge \u201cbecomes effective when it is ordered by competent authority and the dischargee receives either actual or constructive notice of it.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>22 C.M.R. 510, 515 (1956). These conditions were met in our case. An effective discharge returns a person to civilian status. As a civilian, Wickham is not subject to court-martial jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>1 C.M.R. 365 (1951). This analysis is linear, starting from a valid, permissible presumption, and then proceeding logically to its inescapable conclusion. There is no bootstrapping here.. The problem of circularity only arises when, in its effort to exercise court-martial jurisdiction over Wickham, the Army finds itself in the uncomfortable position of having to presume her guilt. There is no way out of this catch-22; the Army wishes to try her to prove her guilt, but it cannot try her unless her guilt has already been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The fallacy inherent in an argument is often most clearly revealed by the illogical consequences of its application. If Wick-ham is tried by court-martial and then acquitted, it will mean that she was validly discharged. If she was validly discharged, then she was a civilian all along, and was not subject to military jurisdiction. Of course, if the military lacked jurisdiction to try her, of what value is the determination by a court-martial that she is innocent, and therefore a civilian? The argument circles endlessly back to its source, confounded as it is by its own impermissible premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">B. <em>The Three </em>Toth <em>Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">In <em>Toth v. Quarles, </em>350 U.S. 11, 76 S.Ct. 1, 100 L.Ed. 8 (1955), the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional Article 3(a), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(a) (1976), the companion statute to Article 3(b). Article 3(a) subjected to court-martial jurisdiction any ex-serviceman or woman who while in the military committed an offense punishable by confinement for five years or more, for which the person could not be tried in any state or federal court. Even though Congress had not at the time of <em>Toth </em>seen fit to provide for federal district court trials of discharged soldiers accused of otherwise un-triable offenses committed while in the military, the Supreme Court found Article 3(a) to be an unconstitutional extension of military jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">In finding Article 3(a) unconstitutional, the <em>Toth </em>Court analyzed three aspects of this proposed extension of court-martial jurisdiction. The Court first asked whether this exercise of jurisdiction was justifiable in light of the military\u2019s primary function, which is to fight or be ready to fight wars.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">We find' nothing in the history or constitutional treatment of military tribunals which entitles them to rank along with Article III courts as adjudicators of the guilt or innocence of people charged with offenses for which they can be deprived of their life, liberty or property. Unlike courts, it is the primary business of armies and navies to fight or be ready to fight wars should the occasion arise. But trial of soldiers to maintain discipline is merely incidental to an army\u2019s primary fighting function. To the extent that those responsible for performance of this primary function are diverted from it by the necessity of trying cases, the basic fighting purpose of armies is not served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>Toth, </em>350 U.S. at 17, 76 S.Ct. at 5. How necessary is Article 3(b) to the business of fighting wars? It would appear quite incidental. This is a case of first impression. The Armed Services have gotten.along nicely for more than thirty years without having to invoke Article 3(b) against former servicemen or women. <em>Wickham v. Hall, </em>12 M.J. 145, 156 (C.M.A.1981) (Everett, C.J., dissenting). Neither the ability nor the inclination of soldiers to fraudulently procure their discharge has heretofore posed any measurable threat of \u201cthin[ning] the ranks of those ready for combat.\u201d The specter of mass defections from the ranks through fraudulently obtained discharges is a chimera. I see no justification for expanding military jurisdiction to combat a problem that simply has not been shown to exist. As Justice Black noted in <em>Toth: </em>\u201cIt is impossible to think that the discipline of the Army is going to be disrupted, its morale impaired, or its orderly processes disturbed by giving ex-servicemen the benefit of a civilian court trial when they are actually civilians.\u201d <em>Toth, </em>350 U.S. at 22, 76 S.Ct. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The second question asked in <em>Toth </em>was whether the extension of military jurisdiction authorized by the statute at issue actually or <em>potentially </em>swept under military jurisdiction a significant number of persons not otherwise subject to military law. The majority claims that the reach of Article 3(b) in this respect is minimal, because ft only subjects to jurisdiction those who in fact fraudulently procure a discharge. This is only half the story. While article 3(b) does <em>actually </em>bring under military jurisdiction those who fraudulently procure a discharge, <em>Toth </em>also instructs us to include in our tally all those who may <em>potentially </em>come within the jurisdiction of the courts-martial under the statute. Article 3(b) sweeps under military jurisdiction all for-, mer servicemen and women holding a presumptively valid discharge against whom the military authorities may later decide to lodge a charge of fraudulent separation. It places over the head of every veteran a damoclean threat that, without a hearing, he may be seized by the military authorities to face trial by court-martial on the charge that his discharge was fraudulently procured. The potential reach of Article 3(b) is enormous.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Last, the <em>Toth </em>Court asked whether this particular extension of court-martial jurisdiction is the least possible power adequate to the end proposed. The purpose of Article 3(b) is to deter potential offenders from fraudulently procuring their discharge, and to punish those who do. As Chief Judge Everett noted in his persuasive dissent in Wickham\u2019s prior appeal, <em>Wickham v. Hall, </em>12 M.M. 145 (C.M.A.1981) (Everett, C.J., dissenting),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Army has several adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>alternative remedies available to it, none of which raises the constitutional issue before us. Id. at 156. W. Winthrop Military Law and Precedents 93-94 &amp; n. 65 (1920). Wick-ham may be prosecuted for fraud in federal district court under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287, or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Since these charges are criminal,, the Speedy Trial Act would ensure their swift adjudication. Alternatively, the Army could bring a civil suit for fraud against Wickham, seeking to prove by a mere preponderance of the evidence that her discharge was fraudulently obtained. Once the discharge was set aside, Wickham would of course be subject to court-martial jurisdiction. Should- Wickham in fact be guilty of the fraudulent act with which she is charged, there is no risk that she will escape unpunished. Even if this country were to engage in another war, and the incidence of fraudulent discharges began to undermine the Army\u2019s ability to fight, suspected offenders could still be prosecuted to the limit of the law in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">It is also clear that the ability of the Armed Services to deter such conduct is not diminished by requiring them to resort to civilian courts to prosecute offenders. Although military justice in some cases may be swifter, it is no surer than that meted out in the federal courts. I can only conclude that Article 3(b) is not the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In sum, Article 3(b), like Article 3(a), fails to satisfy the three <em>Toth </em>criteria which must guide us in determining the constitutionality of any statute that expands the scope of military jurisdiction, and encroaches upon the jurisdiction of the Article III courts. Article 3(b), like Article 3(a), is unquestionably unconstitutional.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">C. <em>Reserve Obligation</em></p>\n<p id=\"afx-dedup-0\">As an alternative basis for its holding, the majority proffers the argument that since Wickham was discharged into the Ready Reserve, her status \u201cwould not equate\u201d with that of a civilian. In <em>United States v. Brown, </em>12 U.S.C.M.A. 693 (1962), the United States Court of Military Appeals affirmed a United States Board of Review determination that a continuing, reserve obligation constituted an insufficient basis for the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction under Article 3(a). It is significant that, without deciding this issue, the majority opinion of the United States Court of Military Appeals in our own case assumed that Wickham\u2019s \u201cobligation to perform reserve duty, even with tours of active duty, is insufficient connection with the military to make her constitutionally amenable to trial by court-martial under Article 3(b) of the Code.\u201d <em>Wickham, </em>12 M.J. at 149. This is a reasonable assumption. If a reserve obligation is insufficient to justify the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction under Article 3(a), it cannot magically metamorphose into a sufficient basis for the exercise of military jurisdiction under Article 3(b), especially where the reasons for the unconstitutionality of both statutes are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">D. <em>Other Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">The remaining arguments advanced by the majority in support of its conclusion that Article 3(b) is constitutional are equally unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">The power to try civilians for allegedly procuring their military discharge by fraud is easily distinguishable from the power to court-martial deserters. A deserter is, by definition, a soldier. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 885 (1976). Unlike discharge, desertion works no change in a soldier\u2019s military status. There is no question that the military has court-martial jurisdiction over its soldiers. <em>Ex parte Campo, </em>71 F.Supp. 543 (D.C.N.Y.), <em>affirmed, </em>165 F.2d 213 (2d Cir.1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">The majority\u2019s analogy to the power of a court to exercise jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction is misplaced. None of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the cases cited by the majority authorize a court to simply presume a defendant\u2019s guilt for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction over him. Cases applying the doctrine of jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction generally deal with the validity of orders issued under a court\u2019s determination that it has jurisdiction of an action, and with the ability of such a determination to withstand subsequent collateral attack. <em>See, e.g., United States v. United Mine Workers of America, </em>330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947); <em>Davis v. Cluet, Peabody &amp; Co., </em>667 F.2d 1371 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Carter v. United States, </em>135 F.2d 858 (5th Cir.1943). The jurisdictional determination either that a federal question is present, or that certain facts exist supporting the exercise of federal jurisdiction, is quite different from a presumption of ultimate guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The majority also claims that Wickham\u2019s argument presupposes that an unfair resolution of the issue awaits her before a court-martial, and that military courts are \u201cKafkaesque Star Chambers.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The majority evidently misapprehends Wickham\u2019s argument. All she is claiming is that since she is not a soldier, she may not be tried as a soldier. As a civilian, she is entitled like ally other civilian to be tried by a court of competent jurisdiction, whose process is firmly anchored in those constitutional safeguards to which she is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Last, there is nothing particularly \u201cmilitary\u201d about fraudulent misrepresentation. A quick look at the United States Code will show that this crime is, unfortunately, a familiar enough feature of civilian life. <em>See, e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q (1976); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, 1002, 1003, 2314 (1976); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973i(e)-(d) (1976). The fact that the alleged fraud in this case may have led to a military discharge does not raise any peculiarly \u201cmilitary\u201d question requiring the construction of Army regulations by a military tribunal. If Wickham substituted the urine specimen of a pregnant servicewoman for her own, she is guilty of fraud. If she did not, she is innocent. This is just the sort of simple fact question which a jury is uniquely competent to resolve. Under our system of law, persons charged with fraud, like those charged with other crimes, are constitutionally entitled to a trial by a jury of their peers. As Justice Black persuasively argued in <em>Toth:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">[TJhere is a great difference between trial by jury and trial by selected members of the military forces. It is true that military personnel because of their training and experience may be especially competent to try soldiers for infractions of military rules. Such training is no doubt particularly important where an offense charged against a soldier is purely military, such as disobedience of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>order, leaving post, etc. But whether right or wrong, the premise underlying the constitutional method for determining guilt or innocence in federal courts is that laymen are better than specialists to perform this task. This idea is inherent in the institution of trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-5\"><em>Toth, </em>350 U.S. at 17-18, 76 S.Ct. at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">I share the majority\u2019s concern that our nation continue to be defended by an effective fighting force. Our long history is replete with instances in which the effectiveness of our Armed Forces has proved crucial to the defense of our liberty. However, I do not believe that our continued security can only be bought at the price of unconstitutionally subjecting civilians to the jurisdiction of the courts-martial. For, \u201cconceding to military personnel that high degree of honesty and sense of justice which nearly all of them undoubtedly have, it still remains true that military tribunals have not been and probably never can be constituted in such a way that they can have the same kind of qualifications that the Constitution has deemed essential to fair trials of civilians in federal courts.\u201d <em>Toth, </em>350 U.S. at 17, 76 S.Ct. at 5. For these reasons, I must with deference dissent from the opinion of the majority in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-12\">. Article 3(b) is codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(b). It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-14\">(b) Each person discharged from the armed forces who is later charged with having fraudulently obtained his discharge is, subject to section 843 of this title (article 43), subject to trial by court-martial on that charge and is after apprehension subject to this chapter while in the custody of the armed forces for that trial. Upon conviction of that charge he is subject to trial by court-martial for all offenses under this chapter committed before the fraudulent discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">While Article 3(b) is the section that confers jurisdiction, the provision that makes the act criminal is Article 83, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 883. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-24\">Any person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-25\">(1) procures his, own enlistment or appointment in the armed forces by knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment as to his qualifications for that enlistment or appointment and receives pay or allowances thereunder; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-26\">(2) procures his own separation from the armed forces by knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment as to his eligibility for that separation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-27\">shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\">.

Because of its very nature and purpose the military must place great emphasis on discipline and efficiency. Correspondingly, there has always been less emphasis in the military on protecting the rights of the individual than in civilian society and in civilian courts....
