It is all too obvious that but for the plaintiffs\u2019 filing of a motion directing the magistrate to issue a decision within forty-five days, we would not yet have this case before us. Five days prior to a hearing on said motion, the magistrate finally-issued his recommendation, which was adverse to plaintiffs in all respects. That opinion was adopted by the district court. For the reasons stated herein, we reverse that opinion and remand the case to the district court where it hopefully will receive more expeditious treatment than it has heretofore.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-10\">This class action was brought under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 to challenge alleged racial discrimination in the initial assignment and promotion of blacks at the Georgia-Pacific chip-n-saw mill in rural Goss, Mississippi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A chip-n-saw mill is a modern facility designed to produce finished lumber from raw timber. This plant opened in 1970 and, depending on whether it operated on one or two shifts a day, employed either between sixty to seventy persons or 100 to 110 persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-11\">The EEOC charge in this case was filed in July of 1972 by the International Woodworkers of America (IWA). A right to sue letter was issued to the IWA in July of the following year and the complaint was filed shortly thereafter. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the IWA was certified by the National Labor Relations Board as the exclusive bargaining agent for the plant employees. The individual plaintiffs did not file EEOC charges, but instead relied on that filed by the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-15\">The EEOC charge was filed by the union during the pendency of a strike called to protest the inability of the union to secure a collective bargaining agreement with the defendant. The union was never successful in this regard. In 1974, it withdrew its representational status but has not ceased, in the magistrate\u2019s words, \u201cto vigorously pursue this particular lawsuit.\u201d Record on Appeal, vol. 5 at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-16\">The named plaintiffs in this action are two black men who were employed at the chip-n-saw mill until mid-1972. It is clear that defendant was willing to hire blacks at its plant; although the area labor force was approximately thirty percent black, often fifty percent of the plant\u2019s work force was black. What is at issue, however, is the quality of the jobs which these individuals were allowed to fill. The chip-n-saw mill is organized into five departments \u2014 Log Yard Department, Sawmill Department, Rough Lumber Manufacturing Department, Planer Mill Department and Shipping Department. Within each department, there are various job classifications. The bottom rung of the employment ladder is a classification called \u201cutility,\u201d which is where most blacks, including the named plaintiffs, both began and ended their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-17\">Plaintiff Robert Boykin was assigned to utility despite the fact that he had a great deal of relevant prior experience. He had previously worked in a plant that manufactured wood products and had received vocational training as a diesel mechanic. After his initial assignment, he repeatedly requested promotions from his supervisor, but his appeals were to no avail. In January of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>1972, a white employee who had just completed probation was given the position (forklift operator) that Boykin had been seeking. Plaintiff Thomas Powell also completed his two years of work at the plant as a utility. He had fifteen years of prior experience at a furniture plant but was still unable to secure a promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">The initial assignment of new employees at the plant was made by the plant manager or plant superintendent. Promotion decisions, on the other hand, were delegated to the foreman of the department that experienced a vacancy, but the plant superintendent retained veto power over the foreman\u2019s choice. The management did not post notices of vacancies within departments. Neither did it have any written procedures regarding the filling of vacancies until long after this action was filed. Plaintiffs contend that racial discrimination prevented blacks from initially receiving or indeed ever receiving the good jobs at the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">In order to prove their contentions, plaintiffs presented a battery of statistical evidence designed to show racial discrimination from the disparities between percentages of blacks and whites who received favorable initial assignments and promotions. In addition, plaintiffs bolstered their statistical case by presenting evidence concerning individual employment decisions, both (1) evidence from black witnesses about their inability to secure preferable assignments, and (2) evidence of the preferences shown to white employees, notably preferences given to whites who were family or friends of the upper level plant personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">CLASS CERTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AExe\">The first prong of plaintiffs\u2019 attack upon the lower court judgment is aimed at the denial of class certification. The action was tentatively certified as a class action in 1974, with a final decision reserved until after trial. When the magistrate finally issued his recommendations in 1981, he denied class certification for two reasons. First, he held that the number of persons involved was not great enough to meet the numerosity requirement of Fed.Rule Civ. Pro. 23(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, he held that the claims of the individual plaintiffs were stale since they had not been involved with the Georgia-Pacific plant since 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-10\">In order to determine whether the numerosity requirement was indeed met, we must examine the exact boundaries of the class. At the time of tentative class certification, the class was identified as all past, present and prospective black employees and all unsuccessful applicants for employment at the sawmill. Since the hiring claim has not been pursued upon appeal, that portion of the class must be eliminated. The claims of present and past black employees are raised in this appeal. Therefore, a class of 317 individuals remains. Certainly, a class of this magnitude is large enough to meet the numerosity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-11\">Defendant claims that the class includes fewer than twenty individuals. This number was calculated by determining the number of promotions which could have occurred during the relevant period (69) and then assuming that blacks were hired at a rate equal to their participation in the labor force (approximately 30%). The total number of jobs at issue is only approximately twenty, a number much too small to meet the numerosity requirement. However, this argument ignores the fact that the contours of this class encompass all present and past black employees. This is a case where employees were <em>not </em>promoted. All 317 individuals have a stake in that claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>There is no way to limit the action to twenty persons, as defendant suggests, because it is impossible to identify those persons who would have been hired but for the discrimination which occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">The magistrate also denied class certification because, in his words, \u201cnone of the individual plaintiffs have had any contact with the defendant plant since August of 1972.\u201d Record on Appeal, vol. 5 at 679. The relevant consideration for purposes of Rule 23, however, is not length of absence from the plant but willingness and ability to litigate the issues on behalf of the class. The plaintiffs shall not be penalized for the five year delay of the magistrate in deciding this case which makes the time span between employment and final resolution so large.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">The magistrate\u2019s recommendation also refers to <em>East Texas Motor Freight v. Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. 395, 97 S.Ct. 1891, 52 L.Ed.2d 453 (1977), as support for its holding that the individual plaintiffs are not proper class representatives. Reliance upon that case is misplaced. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the plaintiffs were judged improper class representatives because there were objective qualifications standards that they did not meet. Since prior qualifications are irrelevant in this case, the two cases are not analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-7\">VALIDITY OF THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-8\">The validity of statistical proof as a means of proving a prima facie Title VII case has long met with acceptance in the courts. <em>E.g., Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977); <em>Mayor of Philadelphia v. Educational Equality League, </em>415 U.S. 605, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Johnson v. Uncle Ben\u2019s, Inc., </em>628 F.2d 419 (1980), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>451 U.S. 902, 101 S.Ct. 1967, 68 L.Ed.2d 290 (1981); <em>Fisher v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., </em>613 F.2d 527 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1115, 101 S.Ct. 929, 66 L.Ed.2d 845 (1981); <em>Parson v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp., </em>575 F.2d 1374 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 968, 99 S.Ct. 2417, 60 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\">This class action was brought to remedy \u201cpervasive resistance to the principles of equality of treatment and opportunity in the workplace articulated in Title VII.\u201d <em>Rivera v. City of Wichita Falls, </em>665 F.2d 531, 534 (5th Cir.1982). The battery of statistical evidence which was presented does show that a significantly smaller percentage of blacks are initially assigned to a classification other than utility. Likewise, a much smaller percentage of blacks,are ever promoted to higher positions and those who are promoted must wait much longer for this opportunity than their white counterparts.</p>\n<p

12-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-17\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Hazelwood School District </em>v. <em>United States, </em>433 U.S. 299, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977), held: \u201cWhere gross statistical disparities can be shown, they alone may ... constitute prima facie proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination.\u201d 433 U.S. at 307-08, 97 S.Ct. at 2741. Although proof of discriminatory motive is generally required in disparate treatment cases, the evidence of subjective, standardless decision-making by company officials, which is a convenient mechanism for discrimination, satisfies this requirement. <em>See Rowe v. General Motors Corp., </em>457 F.2d 348, 359 (5th Cir.1972). The company, after all, made no provision for informing employees of promotion opportunities nor did it establish any objective bases for judging the possible applicants. The explanation of plant manager Bobby Thornton for the scarcity of blacks in upper level jobs demonstrates the prejudice which must have entered into the decisions he made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APe\">.. . their own choice, a whole lot \u2014 a lots of cases, it\u2019s their own choice as well as their experience, in other words, what probably I\u2019m trying to say is our better jobs as far as less physical work and responsibility and what have you is in our semi-skilled jobs, they have less responsibility. It\u2019s usually an easier type of job, less physical work such as debark operator has a cushion he sits on all day, and he\u2019s got buttons to push, he has to know which button to push at which time, but it\u2019s a much easier job than a millwright. A millwright\u2019s job \u2014 he has to get down in the grease and the grit and grind and everything that he does is physically hard plus he has to have the knowledge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>the skill to do his job as quickly as possible to get the mill back in production and most of these people that you\u2019re talking about \u2014 this class of black people are satisfied with a semi-skilled job.... [Tjhey\u2019re contented more so in a semiskilled job than taking on the responsibility and extra hard work and long hours that maintenance requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1471-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 41 at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on statistical evidence to prove a prima facie case of raci\u00e1l discrimination requires us to judge the statistical significance of the disparities charted above. Fortunately, the methodology to be utilized in arriving at this answer is clearly set out in <em>Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 496 n. 17, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1281 n. 17, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977). A binomial distribution statistical analysis of Tables I (initial assignment data) and VI (promotion data) demonstrates the statistical significance of the difference between the actual and expected number of blacks who received favorable initial assignments/promotions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1471-6\">In order to rebut this prima facie case of racial discrimination in employment, the defendant must come forward with evidence which either discredits the plaintiffs\u2019 statistical presentation or, in the alternative, provides a non-discriminatory explanation for the result. There is no dispute with the numbers listed in the tables printed below. Defendant, however, did present a number of challenges to the statistical proof offered by plaintiffs, which were adopted by the magistrate. First, defendant contended that the number of employees involved is too small to permit statistical evaluation of disparities in assignment and promotion. Defendant understates the size of the work force by maintaining that what is really involved here is simply a work force of sixty to seventy workers when the plant operated on one shift and 100 to 110 workers when the plant increased its operation to two shifts a day. A closer look at the exhibits presented by plaintiffs reveals that the initial assignment table considered the assignment of 761 employees and the promotion table considered 335 non-probationary employees. This suit involves, after all, a charge of continuing racial discrimination over a number of years; there is no merit to the proposition that at most 110 employees should be considered. This is irrelevant, however, because the dispositive point here is that the significance of the statistical data is shown by the test approved in <em>Castaneda </em>and <em>Ha-zelwood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1471-8\">The second basis upon which the court found the statistical evidence inadequate was the failure to standardize the data for qualifications. In determining the qualifications of employees, plaintiffs utilized all information listed on the individuals\u2019 employment applications.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is insufficient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>according to defendant, because a number of witnesses testified in court about additional qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">Although the defendant stressed the need for highly qualified individuals in many of the jobs at the plant, the plant manager testified that only one job required a skilled employee. The other jobs could be learned at the plant, in his opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-5\">Q. On that same issue, it is also true that any job at your plant can be learned and has been learned at the plant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-6\">A. That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-7\">Q. There\u2019s no job, is there, for which\u2014 some companies simply will not hire people into a certain job unless they have had certain types of experience elsewhere? That is not the case at your plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-8\">A. That\u2019s not the case at this plant. Q. And, in fact, every single one of these jobs that you\u2019ve been talking about today have been learned by employees who have had no relevant prior experience, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-10\">Q. Give me a list of the jobs at the Columbia sawmill that have not been learned by employees at the job but which have always been filled by persons who came with the necessary skills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-11\">A. The lead electrician job has never been filled by a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-12\">Q. Are there others?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1472-18\">A. I can\u2019t think of any.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-19\">Record on Appeal, vol. 10 at 983-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-20\">The plant manager stated that the company had adopted a policy of promoting to upper level positions on the basis of training received at the plant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is the rule in this Circuit that where unskilled persons are hired and then promoted on the basis of training received on the job, a disparity between the number of whites and blacks promoted is significant. It is unnecessary to standardize the data for qualifications.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1472-21\">The Company\u2019s entry level hiring policy is a distinctive circumstance in this case supporting the inference of discrimination. When a company adopts a policy and practice of hiring in at low-level unskilled jobs and promoting to upper-level [positions] based upon training received and skills developed at the plant itself, it cannot convincingly challenge the <em>prima facie </em>showing under the <em>Hazelwood </em>\u201cqualifications\u201d dicta. Where skills are commensurate with company training, we will approve statistical comparisons between racial make-up in key positions and racial composition in the total work force. See, <em>James v. Stockham Valves, </em>[559 F.2d 310] at 341 [ (5th Cir.1977) ]; <em>Scott v. City of Anniston, </em>[597 F.2d 897] at 901 [(5th Cir.1979) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1472-22\"><em>Fisher v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., </em>613 F.2d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-23\">Defendant points to a line of cases in which the failure to standardize data for qualifications was judged fatal to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>tiffs\u2019 statistical case. <em>E.g., Pouncy v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>668 F.2d 795 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Rivera v. City of Wichita Falls. </em>Unlike the case at bar, however, those cases considered jobs involving skills not generally possessed or readily acquired by the general population. The Supreme Court, in <em>Hazelwood School District v. United States, </em>set forth the reason that the two types of cases must be viewed differently.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1473-4\">In Teamsters, the comparison between the percentage of Negroes on the employer\u2019s work force and the percentage in the general areawide population was highly probative, because the job skill there involved \u2014 the ability to drive a truck \u2014 is one that many persons possess or can fairly readily acquire. When special qualifications are required to fill particular jobs, comparisons to the general population (rather than to the smaller group of individuals who possess the necessary qualifications) may have little probative value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1473-5\">433 U.S. at 308 n. 13, 97 S.Ct. at 2742 n. 13. Since the plant manager plainly stated that all but one of the jobs could be learned on the job, this case certainly corresponds to the line of authority represented by <em>Fisher v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., </em>and qualifications need not be considered in making an accurate statistical picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-6\">The final reason for rejection of the statistical evidence was defendant\u2019s presentation of evidence about a few of the promotion decisions and why blacks were not placed in these positions. This attempt to combat a prima facie case with evidence about a handful of promotion decisions is doomed to failure because a prima facie case of class-wide discrimination \u201cis not met by [defendant\u2019s] attempts to parry specific allegations of alleged discrimination .... \u201d <em>United States v. Hayes International Corp., </em>456 F.2d 112, 120 (5th Cir.1972). Defendant contends that its articulation of allegedly legitimate reasons for some promotion decisions should work to shift the evidentiary burden back to plaintiffs to demonstrate that the proffered reasons are a pretext for discrimination. However, the burdens of proof and production set out in <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1982), apply only to <em>individual </em>disparate treatment cases. In order to combat a case of class-wide discrimination based upon statistical evidence, defendant must either show flaws in the plaintiffs\u2019 statistics or provide a non-discriminatory explanation for the result. This burden will not be met by general assertions of good faith or of hiring only the best applicants. <em>Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. at 342 n. 24, 97 S.Ct. at 1858 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-8\">In addition to the reasons adopted by the court below, the defendant urges that the statistical evidence should be discounted because the exhibits impermissibly mixed conduct for which liability might attach and conduct barred by the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-9\">This court has recently reaffirmed in <em>Rivera v. City of Wichita Falls, </em>that the standards for judging claims of pattern or practice employment discrimination under Title VII and Section 1981 are identical. 665 F.2d at 534 n. 4. Therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 case is not adversely affected as long as the incidents upon which the statistical evidence is built fall within one of the limitations periods. Defendant reasons that the applicable statute of limitations governing this case is the Mississippi three years statute, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-29 (1972). Since some of the individuals whose employment history was reflected in the tables were hired shortly outside this limitations period, the defendant argues for the rejection of the entire battery of statistical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-10\">Although correct in its judgment that unlawful conduct which has not been made the subject of a timely charge is, in the words of the Supreme Court, \u201cmerely an unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences,\u201d <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 558, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 1889, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977), the defendant is incorrect in his assumption that the rule works to the plaintiffs\u2019 detriment in this action. This Court has held that the statute of limitations applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>Section 1981 claims is the six year Mississippi catch-all statute, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-49 (1972). <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Travenol Laboratories, Inc., </em>673 F.2d 798, 815 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 451, 74 L.Ed.2d 605 (1983); <em>Truvillion </em>v. <em>King\u2019s Daughters Hospital, </em>614 F.2d 520, 528 (5th Cir.1980). The limitations period reaches more than two years before any of the hiring at this plant occurred. Accordingly, we find that all statistical material presented by plaintiffs may properly be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-7\">Regrettably, we cannot bring this case to final resolution today. We do, however, lay the groundwork which should enable the court below to finish this task in short order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-8\">First, we reverse the court\u2019s denial of class certification and instruct the court below to certify plaintiffs Boykin and Powell as class representatives for both the initial assignment and promotion claims. Secondly, we reverse the court\u2019s judgment on the liability issue and order the district court to enter judgment for plaintiffs on both the initial assignment and promotion claims. The entry of judgment for plaintiffs on their claims of class-wide discrimination brings this case into Stage II. <em>See Baxter v. Savannah Sugar Refining Corp., </em>495 F.2d 437, 443-44 (5th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1033, 95 S.Ct. 515, 42 L.Ed.2d 308 (1975). <em>See also James v. Stockham Valves &amp; Fittings Co., </em>559 F.2d 310, 354-59 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1034, 98 S.Ct. 767, 54 L.Ed.2d 781 (1978). A notice must be sent to each member of the class informing him of his entitlement to make a claim. The named plaintiffs, as every other black employee in the class, are entitled to the presumption that arises from' the finding of discrimination and should be entitled to make a claim for back pay and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-11\">Finally, the finding of past discrimination makes appropriate the examination of defendant\u2019s present practices in order to evaluate the propriety of granting injunctive relief. We are unable to perform this task on a record that includes no information after the 1976 trial of this case; we, therefore, remand this issue for the district court to undertake this inquiry.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1474-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1465-12\">.
