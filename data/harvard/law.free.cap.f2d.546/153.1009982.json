Griffin contends there was a variance in the description of the 8 models as given in the indictment and those established by the proof to have been involved in the transportation and sale by him. He also assigns as error the sufficiency of the evidence, a charge to the jury on inference of guilty knowledge from possession of recently stolen goods \u201cif not satisfactorily explained,\u201d and limitation of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The electric train models were each described on the indictment by gauge, model number and color. Witnesses established that all but one of the numbers as set out incorrectly failed to include the ending letter \u201cE\u201d to identify the first 7 engines as being equipped with an automatic reversing mechanism. The model number on one of these engines also had two digits transposed. In defense counsel\u2019s opening statement he offered to stipulate that Griffin had these model trains in his possession, that he carried them across state lines, and that \u201c[t]he government need not prove that.\u201d The crucial questions, he maintained, were value and Griffin\u2019s lack of knowledge that the trains were stolen. After proof disclosed that the model numbers were incorrect, defendant moved for mistrial based upon \u201cobvious problems with the descriptions as alleged in the indictment.\u201d The court overruled this motion, noting that the errors were not such as would mislead or misinform a collector of such equipment or one who traded in these types of engines, such as the defendant. On the following trial day, defendant entered into a stipulation with the prosecution that the train models \u201cmade the basis for the indictment\u201d were transported across state lines and sold by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The variances did not affect substantial rights. They did not amount to the omission of any essential element of the crime charged. They were mistakes in numbers and no more. The defendant from the outset was not misled by these errors, and his defense was never predicated upon an inconsistent basis. He was not surprised, misled or prejudiced. The stipulation solved any possible problem as to future prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error do not merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
