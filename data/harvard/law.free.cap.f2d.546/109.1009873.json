After plea negotiations, he pleaded guilty to fifteen misdemeanor counts. He was sentenced to serve sixty days in jail, followed by three years\u2019 probation. After sentencing, substituted counsel moved pursuant to F.R.Crim.P. 35 for reduction of sentence. From denial of this motion, Bernstein appeals, raising two general grounds of error: (1) substituted coun- \u2022 sel was allegedly not allowed to see the presentence report; and (2) the sentencing court failed to consider various factors such as the \u201cminiscule\u201d amount of money involved, the advantages of imposing volunteer service rather than jail time, and defendant\u2019s exposure to extrajudicial punishments from his profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Bernstein\u2019s trial counsel was permitted to inspect the presentence report and at the sentencing hearing informed the court that the report was correct in all respects. After sentence was imposed, appellant retained new counsel to file a motion to reduce sentence, Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. The trial court did not allow appellant\u2019s new counsel to see the presentence report and denied the Rule 35 motion. Appellant complains of this failure to disclose his presentence report at the time of the Rule 35 motion. Rule 32(c)(3)(A) states that \u201c[bjefore imposing sentence the court shall upon request permit the defendant, or his counsel if he is so represented, to read the report of the presentence investigation . . . .\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(A). The Rule requires disclosure of the presentence report <em>before </em>sentencing and was complied with by the trial court. It was not error to refuse to disclose the presentencing report to new counsel <em>after </em>sentence had been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">As for appellant\u2019s complaints about his punishment, \u201cA sentencing court exercises broad discretion which is not subject to appellate review \u2018except when arbitrary or capricious action amounting to a gross abuse of discretion is involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gamboa, </em>543 F.2d 545, 546 (5 Cir. 1976). The sixty-day jail term followed by three years\u2019 probation was well below the maximum sentence Bernstein could have received. The transcript of the sentencing hearing shows that the trial court carefully considered appellant\u2019s lack of a prior record, his previous and probable future service to his community, and the likelihood of extrajudicial sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Appellant entirely fails to show any such gross or outrageous abuse of sentencing discretion as would warrant a modification or vacation of the sentence by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
