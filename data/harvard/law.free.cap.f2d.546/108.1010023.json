The district court has since elaborated upon its reasons for reversing the Secretary\u2019s disposition of Ms. Malveaux\u2019s application. <em>Malveaux </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>E.D.Tex. (No. B-74-387-CA, Dec. 1, 1976). After independently reviewing the record, we agree with the district court \u201cthat there is not substantial evidence to support the administrative determination\u201d. As the district court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-25\">The Social Security regulations are stringent by statute, but eligibility for benefits is to be administered with reason. Theoretical ability to engage in substantial gainful activity is not enough. <em>Hayes v. Celebrezze, </em>5 Cir. 1963, 311 F.2d 648. There is no reasonable evidence in this record that the claimant can perform the duties that she previously performed as a household maid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The district court \u201cawarded social security benefits dating back to December 26, 1971\u201d. That is the date that Ms. Malveaux, in her initial application for disabled widow benefits filed on December 30, 1971, claimed her disabilities began. However, in allowing disability benefits to accrue as of December 26, 1971, the district court failed to take into account the five month \u201cwaiting period\u201d that the statute requires to pass before a claim for disability benefits matures. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(a)(1), 423(c)(2)(A) (1970). The proper starting date for Ms. Malveaux\u2019s benefits claim is therefore May 26, 1972, rather than December 26, 1971. Except for our change of the date on which Ms. Malveaux\u2019s claim matured, the district court\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
