Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1308-21\">RONEY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1308-22\">Plaintiff, Harrell &amp; Sumner Contracting Co., Inc., appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of this cause for lack of diversity jurisdiction. 415 F.Supp. 573. The district court held that Tackett Construction Company, Inc., whose presence would destroy diversity of citizenship between the parties, was an indispensable party to the lawsuit as a joint venturer with plaintiff. It further held that the assignment from Tackett to plaintiff whereby Tackett retained a one-half interest in the proceeds was ineffective to bestow jurisdiction on the district court. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1359. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-23\">Plaintiff originally brought this action for the cost of extra work plaintiff and Tackett were required to perform on a waste water treatment center for the City of Port St. Joe, Florida. One month prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Tackett, by written contract, assigned to plaintiff \u201call of its right, title, interest, claim, demand, causes of action or chose in action which it has or may have ... by right of its joint venture\u201d with plaintiff against defendant. The assignment was made \u201cin consideration of one-half of the net proceeds of any recovery, after payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-24\">The first issue presented by this appeal is whether, absent the assignment, Tackett as a joint venturer with plaintiff was an indispensable party to the lawsuit. See Rule 19(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. The question of joinder in a diversity case is one of federal law. <em>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson, </em>390 U.S. 102, 125 n.22, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968). The rule generally applied by federal courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>is where two or more parties are joint obligees, they are indispensable parties in an action for enforcement of that obligation. <em>Bry-Man\u2019s, Inc. v. Stute, </em>312 F.2d 585, 587 (5th Cir. 1963); 3A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 19.11 at 2361 (1974). In the instant case, any obligation which might be owed by defendants would be owed to plaintiff and Tackett jointly pursuant to the terms of their contract with Peabody. Also, the rights, duties, and liabilities of plaintiff and Tackett\u2019s joint venture are governed, in general, by principles of partnership law. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Thielen, </em>82 So.2d 143 (Fla.1955); 46 Am.Jur.2d <em>Joint Ventures </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4, 57 (1969). Federal courts have held that in an action brought on a partnership contract, all members of the partnership are indispensable parties plaintiff. <em>Grant County Deposit Bank v. McCampbell, </em>194 F.2d 469 (6th Cir. 1952); <em>Charne v. Essex Chair Co., </em>92 F.Supp. 164 (D.N.J.1950); <em>see Purcel v. Wells, </em>236 F.2d 469 (10th Cir. 1956). Accordingly, absent the assignment, Tackett was an indispensable party to this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">Because joinder of Tackett, a Florida corporation, would destroy the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court, Rule 19(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., requires the court to determine \u201cwhether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed\u201d by considering the four factors enumerated in the rule. The district court found that because of the availability of an adequate remedy in state court, and because of the possibility of a second suit by Tackett alone with an inconsistent result, the suit should not proceed with the parties before the court absent an assignment of Tackett\u2019s cause of action. Such a result is consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bry-Man\u2019s, Inc. v. Stute, supra, </em>in which plaintiff\u2019s case was dismissed for failure to join a joint obligee as an indispensable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">Having decided that absent an assignment this action would have to be dismissed, the next question is whether the assignment by Tackett to plaintiff was effective to divest Tackett of its interest in the litigation so as to render its non-joinder proper. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1359 states that \u201c[a] district court shall not have jurisdiction of a civil action in which any party, by assignment or otherwise, has been improperly or collusively made or joined to invoke the jurisdiction of such court.\u201d In <em>Caribbean Mills, Inc. v. Kramer, </em>392 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1968), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>394 U.S. 823, 89 S.Ct. 1487, 23 L.Ed.2d 9 (1969), this Court held that an assignment that did not divest the assignor of his interest in the recovery and was made for the purpose of creating diversity of citizenship was \u201cimproper or collusive\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1359. The Supreme Court, affirming the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision, noted that the purpose underlying \u00a7 1359 was to prevent the \u201cmanufacture of Federal jurisdiction\u201d by assignments which are easy to arrange and involve few disadvantages for the assignor. 394 U.S. at 828-829, 89 S.Ct. 1487. In this case, Tackett did not divest itself of its interest in the recovery for it specifically retained in the assignment contract a right to one-half of the proceeds. In effect, Tackett assigned a one-half interest in the litigation, receiving as consideration for the assignment a one-half interest in the litigation. Under the standard enunciated in <em>Caribbean Mills, </em>this lack of economic substance to the assignment along with the district court\u2019s finding that the reasons for the assignment were legal and tactical was tantamount to a finding that the assignment was \u201cimproper or collusive\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1359, a device to manufacture federal jurisdiction. Section 1359 explicitly provides that the district court shall not have jurisdiction under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">In response to plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was not timely filed, we note briefly that under Rule 12(h)(3), Fed.R.Civ.P., the defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time by motion of a party or otherwise. 3A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice H 19.19, at 2581-2582, 2585 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
