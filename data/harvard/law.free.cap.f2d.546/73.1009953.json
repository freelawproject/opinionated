The borrower\u2019s summary judgment motion alleged four violations: 1) failure to disclose terms of insurance; 2) misleading and confusing non-essential disclosures; 3) failure to label the broker\u2019s service charge as a \u201cPrepaid Finance Charge\u201d; and 4) failure to disclose the amount of credit for the actual use of the borrower. Only the last two claims are subjects of this review. The insurance claim was decided adversely to plaintiff, and that ruling is not complained of on appeal. The district court did not reach the misleading disclosure claim because it involved a factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-20\">On December 2, 1974, in its first opinion, the district court held that the failure to label the broker\u2019s fee as a prepaid finance charge violated Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(d)(2), (e)(1) (1969). Pending the defendants\u2019 motion to reconsider, a group of district court cases that took a position opposite to the court\u2019s initial ruling was decided by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. <em>See Slatter v. Aetna Finance, </em>377 F.Supp. 806 (N.D.Ga.1974). Although this development caused the district court to reverse its ruling on the prepaid finance charge, it nevertheless again granted summary judgment for the borrower on April 2, 1975, this time on the basis of the defendants\u2019 failure cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>rectly to disclose the amount of credit disbursed for borrower\u2019s actual use in violation of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(d)(1) (1969). In this court, the defendants contend that the district court erred in assessing liability for this failure. The plaintiff cross-appeals on the refusal to grant relief on the prepaid finance charge issue and on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded. We affirm the judgment fixing liability but on grounds exactly opposite to those assigned by the district court and vacate and remand the attorney\u2019s fee holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">On June 8, 1973, Mr. McGowan and his wife applied for a loan from Credit Center of North Jackson, Inc., a small loan broker licensed under Mississippi law. The broker arranged for Guaranty Loan Corporation, a licensed lender, to finance the transaction. For its brokerage service, Credit Center charged a fee of $168.63. The disclosure statement furnished to McGowan separately listed the \u201cBroker\u2019s Service Charge\u201d under the \u201cFinance Charge\u201d heading and excluded the amount from the \u201camount financed\u201d entry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Although' the face amount of the note was $840, McGowan received a check for only $208.49. In addition to interest, broker\u2019s service fee, and insurance premium charges connected with the making of the loan, the sum of $325.96 was deducted to retire two obligations previously incurred by McGowan\u2019s wife. The plaintiff was informed of the deductions as evidenced by his acknowledgment of calculations prepared by the lender on a \u201cworksheet\u201d prior to the consummation of the loan. The disclosure statement nowhere itemized the deductions for the loan payoffs, however, and the deducted amount was included in the sum listed under the \u201cNet Proceeds to Borrower\u201d entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-24\">A. <em>Itemization of the Borrower\u2019s Funds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-25\">The district court correctly determined that under the scheme contemplated by the Truth-in-Lending Act, both the broker and the lender are classified as \u201ccreditors\u201d who must make the required disclosures before effecting a credit transaction. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(f); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.2(m) (1969). The failure of the defendants to itemize separately the amounts of the loan proceeds applied to pay off the previous indebtednesses requires consideration of both statutory and accompanying regulatory provisions. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(a); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(d)(1) (1969). In <em>Pollock v. General Finance Gorp., </em>535 F.2d 295 (5th Cir. 1976), a lender was found to be liable for failing to disclose the basic amount of the loan proceeds, despite the fact that both the \u201camount financed\u201d and the individual insurance charges connected with the making of the loan were correctly disclosed. Our holding was predicated on the distinct requirements of the statute and the regulation. Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(a), a lender is required to disclose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-26\">1) The amount of credit of which the obligor will have the actual use, or which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>is or will be paid to him or for his account or to another person on his behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">2) All charges, individually itemized, which are included in the amount of credit extended but which are not part of the finance charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">3) The total amount to be financed</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Regulation 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(d)(1) (1969) expresses these disclosure requirements thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">The amount of credit . . which will be paid to the customer or for his account or to another person on his behalf, including all charges, individually itemized, which are included in the amount of credit extended but which are not part of the finance charge, using the term \u201camount financed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The <em>Pollock </em>court relied on paragraph (1) of Section 1639(a). It held that this portion of the Act mandates that borrowers be told the basic amount of the loan proceeds they will have to use, <em>i. e., </em>the sum paid to them or to their account or to another on their behalf. Unlike Pollock, McGowan was told the \u201camount of credit of which the [borrower] will have the actual use, or which is or will be paid to him or for his account or to another person on his behalf.\u201d This information was disclosed as a single lump sum under the heading \u201cNet Proceeds to Borrower.\u201d McGowan\u2019s complaint is that the amounts of the two loan payoffs included in this single net proceeds sum were not itemized on the disclosure sheet in the same manner \u201ccharges\u201d described in paragraph (2) of Section 1639(a) must be individually tallied. Thus, McGowan\u2019s case presents a question <em>Pollack </em>did not squarely decide: Does the statute and its implementing regulation require individual disclosure of every separate disbursement which is to be made from the net amount generated by the loan for the borrower\u2019s use or benefit?</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Examining the regulation alone without consulting the separation of the three requirements in subsection (a) of Section 1639 could produce an erroneous answer. The regulatory requirement for itemization might reasonably be read as applying to both of the disclosures to be made for charges that are not part of the finance charge. As suggested by <em>Pollock, </em>however, this interpretation of the regulatory language would be improper. The statute is the foundation for the regulation and its <em>raison d\u2019 etre, </em>and the two must be read together. When they are, the proper construction becomes clear. The itemization required by paragraph (2) of Section 1639(a) and echoed in the regulation applies only to charges made by the lender for costs incurred in connection with the making of the loan, such as insurance and recording fees, which are not included in the finance charge. Other component parts of the amount financed, e. <em>g., </em>sums applied to retire outstanding loan balances, need only be disclosed within the total paragraph (1) sum, to be paid out to the borrower or for his use to others, and need not be individually itemized. Accordingly, the district court erred in predicating lender liability on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">B. <em>The Broker\u2019s Fee as a Prepaid Finance Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">The \u201cPrepaid Finance Charge\u201d debate has been laid to rest by our decision on rehearing in <em>Jones v. Community Loan &amp; Investment Corp., </em>544 F.2d 1228, <em>aff\u2019g in part and rev\u2019g in part, </em>526 F.2d 642 (5 Cir. 1976). In that case, three different Georgia creditors had excluded their loan fee from the \u201cAmount Financed\u201d and included it as part of the \u201cFinance Charge\u201d when they made their loans to three different borrowers. For all practical purposes, the Georgia loan fee and the broker\u2019s fee in the instant transaction are the same. All three Georgia creditors invoked 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(f)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as insulating them from liability and argued that they had relied upon the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s interpretative amendment, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.819 (1973), in including their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>loan fees as a part of the \u201cFinance Charge.\u201d We found that any Georgia lender who could establish that he omitted labeling a Georgia loan fee as a \u201cPrepaid Finance Charge\u201d in good faith in conformity with 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.819 (1973) would be exculpated from liability under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Two of the lenders in <em>Jones, </em>however, executed their loans prior to the date the Board issued 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.819 (1969). Since these two lenders could not have relied upon the amendatory regulation at the time their loans were transacted, we held that they were barred from reliance upon Section 1640(f)\u2019s exculpatory language. This part of the ruling in <em>Jones </em>controls the result here. The defendants\u2019 loan to McGowan was made on June 8, 1973, prior to the date on which the Board issued 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.819 (1969). Therefore, they are not protected under Section 1640(f) by the amendatory regulation. Their failure to include the broker\u2019s fee as a part of the \u201cPrepaid Finance Charge\u201d renders them liable under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640. <em>Jones v. Community Loan Investment Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">C. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(3) provides that in any successful action to enforce liability under the Truth-in-Lending Act, the defendant is liable for the plaintiff\u2019s \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees as determined by the court.\u201d In response to plaintiff\u2019s motion to award attorney\u2019s fees of $912, plus $54 in travel expense, the district court noted that because plaintiff\u2019s attorney had been successful \u201cin only one minor charge,\u201d the court was unwilling to allow the full amount claimed and reduced the fee to $228 but did allow the travel expense sought of $54.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The Congressional goals underlying the Truth-in-Lending Act include the creation of a system of private attorneys general to aid in effective enforcement of the Act. <em>Sosa v. Fite, </em>498 F.2d 114, 121 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Thomas v. Myers-Dickson Furniture Co., </em>479 F.2d 740, 748 (5th Cir. 1973) . The reduction of an award of attorney\u2019s fees from the amount sought solely because the plaintiff was successful on only one of the several charges would be inconsistent with the Congressional policy of implementing enforcement of the Truth-in-Lending Act. <em>See Sellers v. Wollman, </em>510 F.2d 119 (5th Cir. 1975). The attorney\u2019s fees award as reduced by the court below is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to determine the reasonable amount of attorney\u2019s fees to which the plaintiff\u2019s attorney is entitled. Our action here is not meant to intimate that any particular fee would be a reasonable fee. The amount of the fee should be set in accordance with the same principles that would govern the assessment of fees in general. <em>See Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974) . Since plaintiff prevailed on this appeal, the district court should also award additional attorney\u2019s fees to compensate him for this service. <em>Sosa v.
