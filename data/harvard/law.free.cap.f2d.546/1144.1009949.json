Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1224-21\">GODBOLD, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1224-22\">The union was awarded a judgment under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 et seq. for payment of unpaid vacation benefits under a collective bargaining agreement. The only issue is whether the court erred in declining to award pre-judgment interest (post-judgment interest was awarded).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-23\">The general federal rule is that in the absence of a statutory provision the award of pre-judgment interest is in the discretion of the court. <em>Wolf v. Frank, </em>477 F.2d 467 (CA 5, 1973) (\u00a7 10b-5 securities case); <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Central Gulf Steamship, </em>453 F.2d 137 (CA 5, 1972) (admiralty); <em>Weeks v. Alonzo Cothron, </em>493 F.2d 538 (CA 5, 1974) (longshoremen and harbor workers); <em>Solomon v. Warren, </em>540 F.2d 777 (CA 5, 1976) (DOHSA). The LMRA contains no explicit provision. We apply the general rule to this case. The Second Circuit has done the same. <em>Lodges 743 and 1746 v. United Aircraft Corp., </em>534 F.2d 422 (CA 2, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-24\">No basis is shown for holding that the district judge abused his discretion other than the contention that plaintiffs should be given pre-judgment interest to make them whole. This reason would apply with respect to any \u00a7 301 suit in which plaintiff successfully sues for money allegedly due under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. This is not alone sufficient basis for a finding of abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
