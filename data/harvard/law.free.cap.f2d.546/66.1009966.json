Klein, </em>529 F.2d 377 (C.A.5, 1976). With one exception we agree that plaintiff\u2019s other claims do not rise to constitutional status. Giving a liberal construction, which we must, to plaintiff\u2019s pro se pleading we think that it sufficiently states one claim.</p>\n<p id=\"pAQ\">Plaintiff asserted that he was arrested and held past ninety days in violation of a Texas statute providing that one in custody for ninety days and not indicted must be released; that he was \u201cheld [in] false imprisonment;\u201d that he worked for the defendant sheriff \u201cpainting houses for the defendant\u201d and doing other labor and was told he would be paid but was not paid. We think this sufficiently raises a constitutional claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-27\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-16\">. Breach of an agreement to pay wages to a validly incarcerated prisoner would not of itself necessarily constitute peonage or involuntary servitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-28\">Of course, plaintiffs brief on this appeal was not available to the court below. However, it substantiates the possible construction which we have put on plaintiffs complaint. In this pro se brief plaintiff says that the defendant was guilty of \u201cpeonage\u201d; that plaintiff \u201cdid work for peoples and did special work, painted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>a room and apartment in the courthouse . did plumbing work, hauled hay for the sheriff\u2019s father. Mowed yards and was illegal unlawful in custody\u201d; that \u201cPlaintiff constitution right was violated by the respondent held as a slave compelled to endue [endure?] involuntary servitude.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
