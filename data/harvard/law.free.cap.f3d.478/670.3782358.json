(\u201cOMR\u201d), and individuals whose records are in OMR\u2019s possession. Petitioners seek a writ of mandamus ordering the district court to rule on motions to intervene and motions to quash regarding a subpoena. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-26\">The respondents are defendants in matters pending in the Asbestos Multi-Dis-trict Litigation Court No. 875 (\u201cMDL 875\u201d) in the United States District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, respondents issued a subpoena through the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas for the production of documents and material from OMR. The individuals moved to intervene, and to quash the subpoena, in the Texas court. OMR also moved to quash in that court; its motion remains unresolved. The Texas court entered the order that is now being challenged; it (1) denied the individuals\u2019 motions and (2) directed that \u201c[a]ll future pleadings in this case be filed in MDL 875.\u201d Petitioners complain only about the second part of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Petitioners rely largely on the text of rule 45(c)(3)(A), which states that \u201cthe court by which a subpoena was issued shall quash or modify the subpoena .... \u201d To the same effect, rule 45(e) states that \u201c[flailure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena issued.\u201d Petitioners claim that by the text of these two provisions, only the Texas court may enforce the subpoena and protect parties from its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Respondents answer that MDL proceedings are to be treated differently. They rely primarily on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407(b), dealing with MDL proceedings, which provides that \u201c[t]he judge to whom such [MDL] actions are assigned ... may exercise the powers of a district judge in any district for the purpose of conducting pretrial depositions in such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\u201d The question of law that we must decide to evaluate the mandamus petition is whether the authority conferred on the MDL court by \u00a7 1407(b) extends beyond depositions so as to embrace the instant subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Based on the overwhelming weight of authority, we answer in the affirmative. A persuasive analysis is set forth in a leading treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">A motion to quash or modify a subpoena is to be granted by \u201cthe court by which a subpoena was issued.\u201d If a subpoena is issued by a district court other than the one in which the case is pending ..., the proper court in which to file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena is the issuing court, not the court in which the action is pending ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAz\">Certain federal statutes create an exception to the rule that only the issuing court may quash, modify, or enforce a subpoena. For example, the multidis-trict litigation (MDL) statute ... authorizes a judge assigned an MDL action to \u201cexercise the powers of a district judge in any district for the purpose of conducting pretrial depositions in such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\u201d [citing \u00a7 1407(b)]. This statute therefore authorizes the transferee district court to exercise the authority of a district judge in any district: The transferee court may hear and decide motions to compel or motions to quash or modify subpoenas directed to non-parties in any district. Though the statutory language refers to \u201cpretrial depositions,\u201d the statute wisely has been interpreted to embrace document production subpoenas as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">9 James W. Mooke et al., Moore\u2019s FedeRal Practice \u00a7 45.50[4], at 45-75 through 45-77 (Matthew Bender 3d ed.2006) (footnotes omitted). \u201cIn multidistrict litigation, the court in charge of the consolidated proceedings has the power to rule on a motion to quash subpoenas.\u201d 9A Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2459, 2006 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Supp., at 19 (West 1995). \u201cThe court in charge of consolidated proceedings has power to rule on a motion to quash subpoenas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19 n. 14.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">This conclusion is supported by the convincing analyses of myriad district courts. <em>E.g., In re Auto.
