In response the Postmaster General, through his counsel, the United States Attorney, asserts that the claim that he (the Postmaster) must read the appellant\u2019s mail is groundless; that the fraud order does not direct, permit, or in any fashion authorize the Postmaster\u2019s personal examination of the contents of appellant\u2019s mail; that such examination is expressly prohibited by statute, citing 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1717 <em>(c); </em>that the Postmaster can receive only the mail which appellant turns over to him as being related to the fraudulent enterprise; and that the determination of which mail is related to such enterprise remains appellant\u2019s alone. We accept these assurances on the part of the Postmaster General, and in reliance upon them the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
