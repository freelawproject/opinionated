English et al., provides in Paragraph 14 that \u201cThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehouse-men and Helpers of America shall pay the fees of counsel for the plaintiffs and expenses incurred by those in the prosecution of this action, such fees and expenses to be determined by this Court.\u201d On April 30, 1958, appellant applied to the District Court \u201cfor an order determining the amount of fair and reasonable counsel fees for services performed as associate counsel for the plaintiffs in the above-entitled cause, the amount of the expenses necessarily incurred by him in the prosecution of this action, and directing that said fees and expenses, as thus determined, be paid by the International Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">On July 14, 1958, the District Court denied appellant\u2019s application. We find no error in this denial. We express no opinion as to any claim appellant may make against Messrs. Godfrey P. Schmidt, Thomas J. Dodd and M.
