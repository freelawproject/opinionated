D.C. Code, \u00a7 22-2901. The principal allegation is that the plea was coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-20\">Appellant had pleaded not guilty. Shortly after trial was commenced thereon but before any evidence was taken, his court-appointed counsel approached the bench where the following occurred outside the hearing of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-21\">(At the bench:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-22\">\u201c[Defense Counsel:] Your Honor, I just talked to the man again, and he advises me that he wishes to enter a plea of guilty. I think it would be probably better to stop the trial for this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>* *\u2022 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">\u201c[Defense Counsel:] * * * I am trying to be on the safe side, Your Honor, and save a possible repercussion of what has happened before. Counsel advised me there was some difficulty in this man\u2019s mind at first as to whether he wanted to enter this plea, and I am afraid if he is perhaps questioned, he may sometimes say to Your Honor, in response to the question, \u201cI don\u2019t think I did it, but I am pleading because I have been advised to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">(In open court:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">\u201cThe Court: Members of the jury, we have a matter to take up which does not concern you, so I will ask you to retire to the jury room and remain there until summoned back. (Whereupon, the jury did leave the courtroom.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel:] Your Honor, I fully advised him as to his rights to a trial, and at this time he wishes to * * * withdraw his plea of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">\u201cThe Court: James E. Smith, you are about to enter this plea of guilty because you are guilty and for no other reason; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-13\">\u201cDefendant Smith: Right sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-15\">(Whereupon, the jury returned to the jury box.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-16\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-17\">\u201cThe Deputy Clerk: James E. Smith, in Criminal Case 346-56, in which you are charged with robbery, do you wish to withdraw your plea of [not] guilty heretofore entered and enter a plea of guilty to the indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-18\">\u201cDefendant Smith: I do, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-19\">At the hearing on the instant motion, appellant testified that shortly before the foregoing occurred his court-appointed trial counsel and a deputy marshal had told him that he would surely be convicted on the Government\u2019s evidence and would receive a sentence of twenty-five, years, but if he pleaded guilty they promised that the sentence would only be one to three years; that he never told either of them that he was guilty of the crime charged. Appellant admitted, however, that he would not have become dissatisfied with his counsel if he had been sentenced for one to three years as \u201che promised me faithfully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-21\">He did not know the name of the deputy marshal but he did identify one who was present at the hearing as the one who had advised him. This deputy later took the stand and denied ever having seen appellant or ever advising any prisoner how to plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-22\">Trial counsel also testified. He stated that he told appellant that the Government had much evidence against him and that \u201cYou haven\u2019t given me anything to go on at this point.\u201d He further testified :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-23\">\u201cI merely said that this is what was going to happen and did he still maintain his innocence. So I thereupon went into a discussion. I said, \u2018You know, the judges aren\u2019t too happy with people who come into court, have no evidence for themselves, and are proven guilty. It might be better for you if you are guilty to admit it now.\u2019 So he hemmed and hawed back and forth; and finally he said, and I remember this vividly, he said, \u2018Yes, I did it.\u2019 So then he says, \u2018What do I do ? \u2019 He was very nervous; and I said, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t tell you what to do.\u2019 And I alluded to a situation which happened in Municipal Court about a year before. I said, T told the defendant to plead guilty once and it created no end of difficulty for me over there,\u2019 and, I said, \u2018I am never going to do that again.\u2019 So I said, \u2018If it is in your mind that you want to enter a plea of guilty, I think this might be advisable at this time. Go ahead and enter it.\u2019 I said, \u2018It is your judgment, your decision.\u2019 And so he says, \u2018Well, I will enter a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>plea of guilty.\u2019 And then we came out, as Your Honor remembers, in open court; and he was asked the standard questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Trial counsel also denied appellant\u2019s allegations concerning the representations about sentencing but he admitted making \u201csome statements concerning what sentences are meted out. I said they generally run somewhere around three years. Some fellows have gotten one to three years. It can run higher or lower, but I made no statements as to what my idea of the sentence he would get would be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Since the court found that appellant was effectively assisted by counsel and that his plea of guilty was not coerced, it is evident that the court accepted counsel\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">That testimony may be viewed to support the thesis that counsel merely brought his professional judgment and experience to bear, as he was bound to do, in advising appellant (1) of the high probability of conviction, and (2) of the sentences some courts have imposed on pleas of guilty in such cases. It was not shown that counsel\u2019s estimate of the case was either erroneous or made for the purpose of misleading appellant. Nor does it appear that counsel\u2019s estimate of the sentence was offered as a promise rather than a hope.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find no basis for disturbing the District Court\u2019s determination in respect of these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Because appellant and persons similarly situated have an undeniable statutory right to bring motions like the instant one, it is perhaps inevitable that the dockets <em>of </em>the District Court and this Court will be crowded with such matters. We think it worth noting that there might be fewer such motions if, at the time of the making and receipt of the plea of guilty, the court were to conduct an inquiry sufficient to bring to light any facts which might affect the validity of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-24\">.
