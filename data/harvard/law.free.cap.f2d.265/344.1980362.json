The complaining witness was a military attache of a foreign embassy, and another witness was a domestic servant in his household. Appellant says that they were not competent witnesses, because they were not liable to punishment for perjury under their diplomatic immunity. We think the point is not well taken. These witnesses took the oath, and moreover the diplomatic immunity from punishment for perjury can be waived by superior diplomatic officials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-18\">. 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 1831, 1832 (3d ed. 1940); 4 Hackworth, International Law 547 (1942); Respublica v.
