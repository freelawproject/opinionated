The respondent pleads for enforcement of its entire order.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-26\">On January 6, 1956 a charge against the petitioner was filed with the Regional Director of respondent charging petitioner with discriminatorily discharging Buchberger in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq. Thereafter first, second and third amended charges were filed on February 29, 1956, June 19, 1956 and June 22, 1956, respectively. The amended charges added unfair labor practices which allegedly occurred long after Buch-berger\u2019s discharge on January 4, 1956. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The original charged only that Buch-berger had been unlawfully discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The petitioner here attacks only the part of the respondent\u2019s order which has to do with Buchberger\u2019s reinstatement. The respondent urges upon us that the failure of petitioner to question the balance of the order makes the findings of violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act \u201cmanifestly relevant * * * as they east light on the motivation underlying petitioner\u2019s discharge of Buch-berger, * *.\u201d We do not agree. The petitioner fully recognizes the right of its employees to engage in union activities and to organize. It is, therefore, apparent that it has no complaint as to the order of the respondent in that regard. However, that could have no effect on the discharge of buchberger as, under the circumstances disclosed by this record, the respondent was bound to determine whether his discharge was lawful or unlawful on the evidence of what occurred prior thereto and not thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Prom a mere cursory examination of this record it is apparent that the Trial Examiner simply swept under the rug the mass of evidence of Buchberger being obnoxious, hard to get along with, a trouble maker, and antagonistic toward his superiors, and of the many requests made to the petitioner\u2019s president to fire him. The undisputed evidence is that during the year 1955 Buchberger\u2019s name was before the Shop Committee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at almost every meeting \u201cbecause of his attitude, his belligerence, his failure to make any effort to get along with the rest of the people in the place\u201d; that the Shop Committee had requested Anthony E. Harrant, petitioner\u2019s executive vice-president, to get Buchberger discharged; that Harrant took the request of the Shop Committee to Mr. Miller, the petitioner\u2019s president, who with tolerance and in face of the numerous previous requests for Buchberger\u2019s discharge told Harrant that \u201ceach person has a right to be on this earth, * * * and that, therefore, Buchberger would stay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">Thus long prior to December 29, 1955, petitioner had more than just cause to discharge Buchberger. At the meeting of all the petitioner\u2019s employees on December 29, 1955 Buchberger falsified facts and accused petitioner\u2019s president of being dishonest with petitioner\u2019s employees. On January 4, 1956 Buchberger was discharged, not because of any union activity but for a valid and just stated reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-16\">Respondent in its brief admits that petitioner may have had grounds \u201cupon which the discharge of Buchberger could be validly predicated.\u201d The scant evidence and strained inferences upon which the respondent relies in finding Buch-berger was engaged in union activity known to petitioner prior to the discharge could not render it ineluctable over the valid cause for discharge. N. L. R. B. v. Blue Bell, Inc., 5 Cir., 1955, 219 F.2d 796, 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">The burden was on the Board to prove that Buchberger was discriminatorily discharged. Indiana Metal Products Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 7 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 613, 616. \u201c[W]hen viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board\u2019s view\u201d, we cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting the decision even remotely approaches substantiality. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456. There must be a limit to the amount of strain the Board can place upon threadbare testimony. Here the evidence, when considered in its entirety as we are bound to do,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> clearly preponderates in favor of Buchberger\u2019s lawful discharge. He was subject to discharge for legal cause and the fact that he was engaged in union activity was a coincidence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>did not render the just cause invalid. N. L. R. B. v. Birmingham Publishing Company, 5 Cir., 1959, 262 F.2d 2, 9. The finding of the Trial Examiner, as adopted by the Board, that Buchberger was discriminatorily discharged is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The order is modified by deleting therefrom the provisions requiring reinstatement of Vincent Buchberger and, thus modified, is ordered enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\">.
