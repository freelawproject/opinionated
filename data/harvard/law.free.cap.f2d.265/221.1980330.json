Appellants, Phillips Petroleum Company and others, defendants below, removed the case to the United States District Court which granted appellee\u2019s motion for a judgment on the pleadings. Appellants attack this judgment on four grounds, which are the identical grounds upon which they relied in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">The judge in the trial below, reciting that \u201cboth sides candidly concede that there is no factual dispute,\u201d wrote a careful and exhaustive opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dealing with each of the legal propositions relied upon on this appeal. A reading of the record and briefs convinces us that the case was fully presented by the pleadings, that the language of the crucial \u201cPugh Clause\u201d (160 F.Supp. 907) is clear and unambiguous, that the case was correctly decided and that the opinion of the trial judge accurately and adequately deals with all of the points relied upon here. For the reasons and upon the considerations set out in said opinion (and cf. Mattison v. Trotti, 5 Cir., 1959, 262 F.2d 339) the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-30\">. Broussard v.
