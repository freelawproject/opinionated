In a formal \u201copposition\u201d filed with us the National Labor Relations Board does not oppose a stay of the <em>notice-posting </em>requirement of the decree as it relates to peaceful picketing but opposes any other stay by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Paragraph 1(a) of the decree requires that respondent shall cease and desist from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqx-dedup-0\">\u201cRestraining or coercing employees of Alloy Manufacturing Company in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended [29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157], * * by picketing for the purpose of obtaining recognition of Alloy\u2019s employees at a time when it does not represent a majority of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">In its motion respondent frankly avows, inter alia, that \u201cshould picketing of Alloy\u2019s premises be resumed, its purpose will be confined to (1) persuading the employees of Alloy to join respondent, and/or (2) persuading customers of Alloy not to patronize it.\u201d The sort of picketing (described in Paragraph 1 (a)), as did the prior picketing, would probably inflict business loss on Alloy, which in turn might force it to accede to respondent\u2019s illegal objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">The Board suggests, and we agree, that to subject Alloy and its employees to this kind of pressure to select an unwanted representative would, if the Board\u2019s view be ultimately sustained, result in a pro tanto impairment of the Act\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">It is ordered by this Court that the <em>portion </em>of that <em>notice </em>which was required by our decree to be <em>posted, </em>a copy of which is attached to the decree and which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201cWe will not restrain or coerce the employees of Alloy Manufacturing Company, in the exercise of rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act, including specifically the right to refrain from engaging in any or all the activities guaranteed thereunder, by picketing for the purpose of obtaining recognition of Alloy\u2019s employees at a time when it does not represent a majority of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">be stayed in order to permit respondent to apply for a writ of certiorari, and until final determination of the cause by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In all other respects respondent\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
