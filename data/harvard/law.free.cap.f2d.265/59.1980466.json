They were first ordered deported on June 9th, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">On February 20, 1956, a complaint for judicial review of the deportation proceedings and injunction and declaratory relief was filed in the district court. An adverse decision in the district court was appealed to this Court on October 31, 1956. On May 20, 1957, the said appeal was dismissed by the clerk of the Court upon agreement between appellants and the Immigration and Naturalization Service that Cakmar and his family would and might depart from the United States at any time to and including July 1,1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Mrs. Cakmar subsequently asked for further delay, claiming she was too ill to travel. Extension of the departure date was thereafter granted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to August 10, 1957, then to August 20, 1957, and finally to September 20, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The Cakmars, on October 8, 1957, then petitioned for a stay of deportation. Their sworn written petition for a stay contained allegations differing materially from their testimony given at the subsequent hearing on the matter, where sworn testimony was heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The only reason urged for a stay was an alleged fear that <em>if </em>Russia takes over Turkey, Russian soldiers or Armenians may persecute the family. No such persecution has taken place during their lifetime, and none is feared from the Turkish government. To find such a possibility as ground to establish a present existing danger of persecution would render the immigration deportation statutes a complete nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In the district court appellants were denied relief from the order of deportation. The only ground urged on this appeal was that likewise urged below\u2014 that the appellant Bedrettin Cakmar \u201ccould not understand the questions asked of him, and it was the duty of the Hearing Officer to continue the case and obtain the services of a competent interpreter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The judgment below must be affirmed for several reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">I. There is <em>no </em>evidence showing that the appellant did not completely, thoroughly, and at all times, understand the questions he was asked and the answers-he gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">II. There is positive evidence in the record (a) by appellant\u2019s own answer; (b) by the testimony of the Hearing Officer; and (c) by the testimony of the shorthand reporter, that the appellant spoke and understood the English language well enough to proceed with the examination. There is no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">The court below found as a fact that Bedrettin Cakmar, appellant, when he represented all appellants at the hearing on October 30, 1957, \u201cunderstood the proceedings and questions [Finding IX] and speaks and understands the English language.\u201d [Finding X.] Not only is this finding supported by substantial evidence, it is uncontradicted. It is the only finding that could be made on the evidence before the trial court. Any different finding would have been error.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">III. Counsel for appellants, having obtained extensions of time below to file the transcript of trial testimony,, filed it on August 18, 1958. Over three months later, on November 21, 1958, he filed a five page brief on appeal, citing-one case, Gonzales v. Zurbrick, 6 Cir., 1930, 45 F.2d 934, 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">The case cited is inapposite on the-facts before us. There, <em>admittedly </em>the alien \u201cwas unable to speak and understand the English language satisfactorily\u201d at a preliminary hearing, and the first two of three interpreters <em>admittedly </em>were unable to interpret. There the only question on the habeas corpus proceedings was whether the alien had had a full and fair hearing. On the admitted facts mentioned above, she obviously had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Here it is equally as obvious the Cak-mars had. The district court here found that (a) the hearing accorded appellants was fair (Conclusion III), and they were accorded a fair hearing (Conclusion VII); (b) there was reasonable, substantial and probative evidence to sustain <em>the </em>finding that appellants were not entitled to discretionary relief (Conclusion IV); (c) the order for deportation was supported by reasonable, substantive and probative evidence (Conclusion V); and (d) the appellant Bedrettin Cakmar understood the proceedings and hearing accorded him in his application for discretionary relief (Conclusion VIII).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">It is clearly apparent that these conclusions are supported by appropriate findings of fact which are themselves fully supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">IV. The government likewise takes the position that an order denying discretionary relief pursuant to \u00a7 243(h) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1253(h) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a nonreviewable order under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) and the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Section 243(h) \u201cauthorizes\u201d the Attorney General to act if \u201cin his opinion\u201d the alien would be subject to physical persecution. At oral argument, the government took the position that the Attorney General\u2019s action was an absolute exercise of grace that was not reviewable, either in the district court or this Court. Jay v. Boyd, 1956, 351 U.S. 345, 76 S.Ct. 919, 100 L.Ed. 1242; Anderson v. Holton, 7 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 596. Like probation or suspension of sentence, it \u201ccomes as an act of grace,\u201d Escoe v. Zerbst, 1935, 295 U.S. 490, 492, 55 S.Ct. 818, 819 L.Ed. 1566, and \u201ccannot be demanded as a right.\u201d Ber-man v. United States, 1937, 302 U.S. 211, 213, 58 S.Ct. 164, 166, 82 L.Ed. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">By an \u201canswer\u201d filed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> subsequent to oral argument \u201cto the court\u2019s question regarding jurisdiction,\u201d the government concedes that there may be, in a proper case, jurisdiction \u2014 both in this Court and in the district court \u2014 \u201cto inquire into the Attorney General\u2019s actions in the following limited situations:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-16\">\u201c(1) Where the Attorney General has refused to act at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-17\">\u201c(2) Where the Attorney General Acts, but his actions are <em>completely </em>capricious. (This, we believe, governs the situation of denial of relief simply because a man has curly hair.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-18\">\u201c(3) Where the Attorney General acts under fraudulent circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-19\">\u201c(4) Where the actions of the Attorney General are completely beyond his authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-20\">The district court first refused, on motion, to dismiss the complaint for lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u2022of jurisdiction. After trial, the district court found that it had no jurisdiction to review the exercise of discretion by the Attorney General pursuant to \u00a7 243 (h) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Appellants cite no cases in their brief on this appeal to support their position that the refusal to exercise this act of grace is reviewable in the courts, but on the hearing below they cited Quan v. Brownell, 1957, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 229, 248 F.2d 89, 90. That case is inappo-site by its express language. In it Judge Prettyman said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u201cThe question before us is whether he [the Attorney General] has that power [to withhold deportation of aliens temporarily paroled into the United States]. We are not concerned with how he should exercise the power if he has it. We have to decide merely whether he has it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Id., 248 F.2d at page 90. The court then held he had that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Also cited below was United States ex rel. Cantisani v. Holton, 7 Cir., 1957, 248 F.2d 737, 738. That was a habeas \u2022corpus proceeding, which this is not. But there the court did review the discretion exercised by the Attorney General, holding it had not been abused, although there was conflicting evidence before the Attorney General. And that court did say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">\u201c[T]he determination of such claim [of possible physical persecution] * * * rest[s] in the administrative judgment and the opinion of the Attorney General or his delegate, United States ex rel. Dolenz v. Shaughnessy, 2 Cir., 206 F.2d 392, and United States ex rel. Leong Choy Moon v. Shaughnessy, 2 Cir., 218 F.2d 316, <em>assuming, of course, the alien has been afforded procedural due process and that the hearings as conducted were not manifestly unfair to him.\" </em>[Emphasis added.] Id., 248 F.2d at page 739.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">Appellants are not entitled to a hearing as of right before the Attorney General. The Attorney General can act, or not, as he likes. Section 1004 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S. C.A.) is not controlling. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1253(h) is a statute coming within the terms of 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009, rather than 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1004. Chiu But Hao v. Barber, 9 Cir., 1955, 222 F.2d 821; Jay v. Boyd, 9 Cir., 1955, 222 F.2d 820; Barreiro v. Brownell, 9 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 585; United States ex rel. Matranga v. Mackey, 2 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">But if the Attorney General purports to act, then we hold we have jurisdiction to determine if procedural due process has been rendered the alien. That is his right. Here he received it, as well as a fair consideration of his application. He has no right to complain, and none to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">This appeal appears to us to closely approach the frivolous and vexatious.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\">. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1253(h), as <em>amended </em>(1952), 66 Stat. 212, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">\u201cThe Attorney General is authorized to withhold deportation of any alien within the United States to any country in which in his opinion the alien would be subject to physical persecution and for such period of time as he deems to be necessary for such reason.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-10\">. 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">\u201cExcept so far as * * * (2) Agency action is by law committed to agency discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">\u201cRights of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">\u201c(a) Any person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action, or advorsely affected or aggrieved by such action * <em>* </em>shall be entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-23\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-24\"><em>\u201cIn </em>a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, except with respect to Federal taxes, any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.
