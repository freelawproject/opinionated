Joyce. Appellee is an attorney who claimed the status of a creditor of the Estate on account of legal services rendered to Joyce in the prosecution of his suit arising from his allegedly unlawful discharge from federal employment in 1953. As Joyce\u2019s widow, appellant received $20,479.41 \u201con account of salary due Edward M. Joyce as an employee of the Small Business Administration. '* * * on date of death November 16, 1956, for the period from October 12, 1953 to November 16, 1956.\u201d The District Court ordered the widow to account for the moneys so received by her. Appellant alleges error in the District Court\u2019s failure to apply 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 61f and 61g.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>No beneficiary had been designated by Joyce. Thus if the pertinent language of \u00a7 61 governs as appellant claims, she as Joyce\u2019s widow is entitled to retain the entire amount already paid to her. On the other hand, if the moneys must be paid into the Estate, such assets must first respond to the claims of creditors including that of the appellee. Next, under the District of Columbia Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the widow will receive only one-third of any balance remaining, for the decedent had children, him surviving.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Appellant\u2019s decedent was a Veterans Preference Eligible when discharged in 1953. His suit for reinstatement was filed May 14, 1954. Co-pending was a similar action commenced by one Kerr wherein summary judgment was granted for the defendants, and appeal followed. Cross motions for summary judgment having been filed in Joyce\u2019s case, counsel for both parties stipulated that the law \u201cis the same as that in Kerr v. Barnes.\u201d Thereupon Judge Youngdahl entered an order \u201cthat the final determination of Kerr v. Barnes shall also govern the instant controversy.\u201d Appellee Scott here argued the Kerr case on October 19, 1956.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Joyce died intestate on November 16, 1956. Appellant asked for appointment as Administratrix on January 30, 1957, her petition alleging only a \u201cclaim\u201d for unpaid salary due to her late husband\u2019s wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Following her appointment, the Ad-ministratrix filed on May 22, 1957, an inventory listing as the only asset and as undetermined, the claim for \u201cback salary still pending and under consideration.\u201d On November 14, 1957, the Comptroller General transmitted a Treasury check to \u201cBobye M. Joyce as widow of Edward M. Joyce, deceased\u201d as above noted, and \u201cin settlement of said claim (s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">Following an order to show cause entered on motion of the appellee as a creditor, appellant asked discharge of the rule showing that there were no funds belonging to the Estate, she as Admin-istratrix had never employed appellee, he had rendered no service in behalf of the Estate, and that her own counsel had represented her in pressing \u201cher claim as widow of decedent\u201d and the money so paid in settlement of the back salary claim belonged to her personally and not to the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">The District Judge ruled as a matter of law that the sum in question was an asset of the Estate, and that \u00a7 6Tf, supra, did not apply since there had been no determination at the time of decedent\u2019s death \u201cthat the decedent was entitled to anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">Appellee argues in the same vein that \u00a7 61, supra, cannot apply for it had not been determined that any unpaid compensation was \u201cdue\u201d to Joyce \u201cat the time of his death.\u201d He urges that \u201cdue\u201d be construed narrowly to mean here, as it often does in the law, an obligation which is fixed and matured. Joyce had not established his right to the office he formerly had held. Not until the Kerr case had been decided was there an obligation upon the Government to pay compensation nor was Joyce in position to demand payment or enforce collection. He was not an employee. At most he could pursue such rights as were conferred by 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus the argument runs.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">No provision is made in \u00a7 652(b) (2) for a payment to a beneficiary if one entitled to its benefits shall die before an actual determination in his favor shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>be made. That omission, appellee would have us say, leads to the conclusion that sums which may <em>become </em>payable in accordance with the section must be paid to the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">We cannot accept these contentions. Section 652(b)(2) must be read in its entirety with all of \u00a7 61f and 61g. Thus, \u00a7 652(b)(2) requires that upon a determination of eligibility for reinstatement the restored employee <em>\u201cshall for all purposes * * </em>* be deemed to have rendered service during such period.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) He is to be treated \u201cfor all purposes\u201d as though he had never been severed from his preferred employment status.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">His situation thus viewed is that of an employee throughout the period of severance. Thereupon \u00a7 6 If first provides a method of settling the Government\u2019s accounts in terms of compensation unpaid at the time of the employee\u2019s death. Section 61g defines \u201cunpaid compensation\u201d as the pay or salary due on account of services rendered the Government. Section 652(b)(2) speaks of compensation payable just as though the employee had never been discharged so that he shall \u201cfor all purposes\u201d be deemed to have rendered services within \u00a7 61g. Thus \u00a7 652(b)(2) specifies what is \u201cdue\u201d and creates a matured, fixed obligation upon the Government to pay for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Moreover, if an employee shall not have designated a beneficiary, under the prescribed priorities the widow comes next, just as other succeeding categories are specified. Only if there be none to qualify does the statute direct payment to the decedent\u2019s legal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In the circumstances shown, we deem it beyond peradventure that the statute requires payment to the widow. We are bound to reverse and remand, leaving as in the Kerr case, the actual framing of the order to the District Court. We are in no position to pass upon the merits of appellee\u2019s claim for services. Both in the Kerr case upon which Joyce\u2019s action turned and in behalf of Joyce, the legal position for which he contended has prevailed. We can say only that our action is without prejudice to his taking whatever appropriate steps may be open to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\">. 64 Stat. 395.
