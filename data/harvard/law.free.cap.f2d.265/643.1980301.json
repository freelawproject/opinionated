Ott \u201cPresident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u201c/s/ Warren A. Ott\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The amended complaint alleges that Ott and Mortgage Services had fully performed all the terms and conditions of the \u201cagreement in writing\u201d and \u201chave been and were ready, able and willing\u201d at all times mentioned to perform. It was set up that Home refused to purchase the real estate loans described and continued the refusal at all times since December 20, 1956. It was also alleged that Ott and Mortgage Services notified Home of the alleged nomination and assignment on or about December 5, 1956, and between that date and January 8, 1957, Home recognized, acknowledged and dealt with Ott and Mortgage Services as the assignee of Harold L. Shaw, and, in reliance thereon, Ott and Mortgage Services changed their position to their detriment and damage. It is claimed that Ott and Mortgage Services have been damaged in the sum of |237,135.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The trial court sustained a motion to \u25a0dismiss the amended complaint \u201con the grounds that such Amended Complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and failed to join an indispensable party in that Plaintiffs purported to act and to sue as assignees of a written agreement which was not assignable and hence had no rights in the alleged written agreement on which the action was based, in that Plaintiffs were not the real parties in interest and the real party in interest had not acted or sued under the alleged agreement, and in that a waiver or estoppel was not and could not be pleaded as against Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">At the outset, a question arises as to the nature of the instrument dated December 31, 1953, in the form of a letter from Home to Shaw.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Through-out the complaint it is characterized as an \u201cagreement,\u201d which is, of course, merely a legal conclusion which may be unwarranted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The instrument itself does not purport to be a contract or an agreement between Home and Shaw. The signature or affirmance of Shaw does not appear, consideration is not recited, nor is the instrument an engagement under seal. Upon its face, the letter appears to be an offer by Home to Shaw for a unilateral contract which by its terms is to remain open three years. Also pleaded in the complaint is the letter of Ott to Home dated December 20, 1956, whereby Ott and Mortgage Services purport to \u201caccept the offer and commitment of Home.\u201d Of course, this letter of Ott could not serve as an acceptance of the offer for the unilateral contract made to Shaw. The only one able to accept such an offer would be the offeree, who would accept by the performance of the act sought, in this ease the tender of the guaranteed re\u00e1l estate loans. While such tender might be made by letter, it could not be made by someone other than Shaw. Indeed, it is hornbook law even in the realm of bilateral contracts that a revocable offer cannot be accepted by anyone other than the offeree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>offeree, in whom the power of acceptance lies by virtue of the offer, has no assignable rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">However, this case is not decided upon this ground. It may be that facts omitted from the pleadings might be developed to indicate that the terms of the letter of December 31, 1953, did constitute the terms of a valid contract between Home and Shaw. If that assumption be true, still the trial court was correct in finding that the rights of Shaw thereunder were, by the terms of the document, not assignable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus it is assumed, arguendo, that the letter constituted an agreement and enforceable contract between Home and Shaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The written document is plain upon its face. There is no uncertainty or ambiguity in the language. The words constitute an offer of a commitment to one individual, Harold L. Shaw, alone. If more had been intended, the words \u201cand his assigns\u201d could have been inserted. But here a clause of severe limitation expressed the intention of the maker. There might have been a possible doubt if this phrase had been omitted. But, when the expression \u201cor your nominee\u201d was included, the intention to confine the benefit of the obligation to Shaw alone was patent. This formula excluded all other persons but Shaw. The general rule that contracts are assignable does not have any effect upon the specific document which is here construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">There is no doubt as to the sense in which the words \u201cor your nominee\u201d are used. The taking of title by a nominee of a principal or the conveyance of title by a nominee is a familiar device in stock transactions or in the transfer of other interests represented by documents. We cannot do better than to quote the language of a California decision which, while not entirely apposite upon the facts here, does give a definition of \u201cnominee\u201d which is exact for our purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">\u201cThe word \u2018nominee\u2019 in its commonly accepted meaning connotes the delegation of authority to the nominee in a representative or nominal capacity only, and does not connote the transfer or assignment to the nominee of any property in or ownership of the rights of the person nominating him.\u201d Cisco v. Van Lew, 60 Cal.App.2d 575, 583-584, 141 P.2d 433, 438.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACN\">The purpose of the document in question here was to offer an obligation to Harold L. Shaw alone and not to his nominee or to any other person whomsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\"> Contrary to the arguments advanced by appellants, Home clearly thus stated the intent to tender an obligation to Shaw and no one else. The terms of the written instrument were not ambiguous. No custom could vary this interpretation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No parol evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>explain the language used was admissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Whether used in their ordinary or popular sense or according to their strict legal meaning, the import of these words is exactly the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">This Court does not hold that there is any covenant against assignment. We simply construe the writing to offer rights splely to Shaw. No tender by Shaw of any permanent real estate loans was alleged. Appellants did not purport to act as nominees of Shaw. Appellants do not sue in the name of Shaw or on his behalf, but in their own right as assignees and as owners. But the writing makes it clear that appellants as such have no rights thereunder. Shaw was an indispensable party to suit even if it be assumed the writing was a \u25a0contract. A complaint which does not name Shaw as a plaintiff states no cause of action or claim upon the written documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Finally, it is claimed that Home has waived any right to insist that Shaw be a party to any litigation upon the supposed obligation because of the dealing of Home with appellants. In the first place, the answer to this contention is plain, if there were no contract. A contract cannot be created by waiver. A contract cannot be created' by estoppel. If it be assumed there was originally a contract enforceable against Home, we have already determined that Shaw was the promisee whether the contract was bilateral or unilateral. Shaw or his nominee was to do an act, or Shaw had promised he or his nominee would do an act. Neither by waiver nor estoppel could the promisee be varied. This could only have been done by a modification of the contract or a change of the offer. If Shaw or his nominee had performed then the benefit of the contract could have been transferred. Otherwise, there is no question of assignment or covenant against assignment involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">No allegations of fact are made which would support a claim of waiver or estoppel, and the specific facts in the complaint and the written documents themselves negative such contentions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\">. \u201c * * * where the allegations of a pleading are inconsistent with the terms of a written contract attached as an exhibit, the terms of the latter, fairly construed, must prevail over the averments differing therefrom.\u201d Foshee v.
