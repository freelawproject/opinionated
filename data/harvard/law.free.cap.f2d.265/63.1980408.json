The Congress saw fit to make the complete independence of the Philippine Islands contingent upon action by the President of the United States. In so providing, it was itself legislating, and the President, by his proclamations <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1394, historical note, pursuant to such express authority, acted within his authority and constitutionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">The second point is without merit. The statute, \u00a7 241(a) (11) as amended, 70 Stat. 575 (1956), by its terms is specifically made retroactive to one \u201cwho <em>at any time </em>has been convicted of a violation of * * * any law * * * relating to the illicit possession of * * * narcotic drugs * * [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The third point is without merit. Rabang v. Boyd, 1957, 353 U.S. 427, 77 S.Ct. 985, 1 L.Ed.2d 956. This ease was distinguished on its face from Barber v. Gonzales, 1954, 347 U.S. 637, 74 S.Ct. 822, 98 L.Ed. 1009, because entry from a foreign country is not a condition of deportability. And see, Rabang v. Boyd, 9 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The fourth point is without merit. It has been previously decided adversely to appellant. Cabebe v. Acheson, 9 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 795; Rabang v. Boyd, 1957, 353 U.S. 427, 77 S.Ct. 985, 1 L.Ed.2d 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-15\">. 60 Stat. 1353 (3946):</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">\u201cImmigration Quota for Philippine Islands By The President Of The United States Of America A Proclamation</p>\n<p id=\"b111-17\">\u201cWhereas the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General have reported to the President that pursuant to the duty imposed and the authority conferred upon them in and by sections 11 and 12 of the Immigration Act of 1924 approved May 26, 1924 (43 Stat. 159, 161) and Reorganization Plan No. V (3 OPR Cum.Supp., Ch.
