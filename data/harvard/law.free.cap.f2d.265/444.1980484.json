It did not notify appellant of its desire to resell any of the land, but notified it that it \u201cdesires and requires\u201d to retain all of the land purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">Thereupon appellant brought suit for declaratory judgment, seeking to have the court determine that Lehigh was obligated to resell to it all the property not \u201crequired\u201d for coquina mining and that such part consisted of lands which \u201cdo not contain commercially minable deposits of coquina rock and shell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">The trial court held that the complaint should he dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a cause of action, and from this order this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-17\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-18\">The option contract was plain and unambiguous on its face. It gave to the purchaser the right to retain all the land except that which it might \u201cdesire\u201d to resell. The fact that it stated that it might not need (require) all the property did not change the meaning of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u201cdesire\u201d to \u201crequire.\u201d It simply meant that if, because it did not require part of the property it should desire to resell that part, it must first give the right of repurchase to the original owner. It did not mean that upon a failure of Lehigh to require it all for the specific purpose of mining coquina rock or for any purpose then it was compelled to resell it regardless of its desire to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-12\">. The language of the agreement here pertinent, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">\u201cIt is understood that there is a possibility that the optionee and/or purchaser of the property will not require title to all of the land involved in the tract herein described and said optionee and/or purchaser does hereby give Mr. Harold Aron, and/or his assigns, the right and privilege to purchase any portion of the land herein described that they do not desire to retain at the price of One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars per acre. This privilege shall be given by the optionee and/or purchaser to the said Mr. Harold Aron and/or his assigns by registered mail not later than the 15th day of September, A.D., 1956, c/o Louis Ossinsky, Sr., Esq., 411 Main Street, Daytona Beach, Florida, describing the property which the optionee and/or purchaser does not desire to retain and, upon receipt of said notice, said Harold Aron and/or his assigns shall exercise said option to purchase said land, as herein granted, within sixty (60) days thereafter by registered mail, addressed to the said John G. Shumberger, Jr., at 31 South Hall Street, Allentown, Pennsylvania, or at the last known Post Office address of the said optionee and/or purchaser, and said transaction shall be consummated at the office of Messrs.
