United States, and related cases, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 230 F.2d 831. Those appeals questioned a judgment in favor of the United States. We remanded for reconsideration in light of Williams v. United States, 350 U.S. 857, 76 S.Ct. 100, 100 L.Ed. 761, under which the law of Virginia, where the accident occurred, would control the question of \u201cscope of employment\u201d of the serviceman driving the government vehicle which collided with another vehicle, resulting in the death and injuries involved in the three actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-28\">On reconsideration the District Court, applying the Virginia rule, held that the factual situation gave rise to a presumption that the serviceman driver was acting within the scope of his employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>by the United States at the time of the collision. The United States contends that the presumption was rebutted by uncontradicted evidence and, therefore, that the presumption dropped out of the case, leaving other testimony decisive against appellees on the issue of scope of employment. We think we are not warranted on appellate review of the trial court\u2019s analysis of the testimony in his findings and conclusions in holding that the evidence relied on to rebut the presumption that the serviceman driver was acting within the scope of his employment was uncontradicted and necessarily overcame the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
