The jury returned a verdict for defendant. Two questions are sought to be presented to this Court. (1) Under the facts and circumstances of this case, does the law of Florida require a charge to the jury on the \u201clast clear chance\u201d doctrine? (2) Did the district court abuse its discretion in not granting a new trial based on newly discovered evidence ?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-19\">The \u201clast clear chance\u201d doctrine was contained in appellant\u2019s requested jury instructions Nos. 6 and 10 which were refused. Even after the trial judge specifically gave an opportunity to object to the jury instructions, counsel failed to do so before the jury retired. We find no plain error resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Consequently, appellant has not reserved for appellate review the failure to give an instruction on the last clear chance doctrine. Rule 51, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-20\">The newly discovered evidence in all probability would not produce a different result and there is no adequate showing that this evidence could not by due diligence have been produced at the trial. \u201cClearly, there was no reviewable abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial upon this ground.\u201d Phillips v. Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co. of Wisconsin, 5 Cir., 1956, 239 F.2d 79, 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-21\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
