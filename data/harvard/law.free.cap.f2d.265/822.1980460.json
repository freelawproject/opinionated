They alleged that the testator was domiciled in the District of Columbia and that his widow, the present appellant, had entered into a written agreement renouncing all rights to his estate. The widow\u2019s answer alleged that the testator was domiciled in Virginia, denied that she had entered into a <em>valid </em>written agreement renouncing her rights in the estate, and asked for a jury trial of the issue of domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-19\">Without either deciding the question of domicile or referring it to a jury, the District Court found that appellant had \u201cby written agreement * * * renounced\u201d all rights in her husband\u2019s estate; dismissed her answer; and admitted the will to probate. The court afterwards said: \u201cUntil there has been an adjudication of the invalidity of this agreement under which she waived and released all her rights in the decedent\u2019s estate she has no right to share in the decedent\u2019s estate, and if she has no right to share in the decedent\u2019s estate she has no standing to raise the question of domicile and your mere allegation of the invalidity of the agreement does not establish a right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-21\">We think this puts the cart before the horse. Unless the testator was domiciled here, the District Court had no jurisdiction to probate the will, determine the validity of its provisions, and determine the validity of a purported agreement renouncing the widow\u2019s rights in the estate. The issue of domicile is therefore the first issue to be decided. The testator\u2019s widow has stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>ing to raise it. Her signature on a paper of disputed and undetermined validity-does not affect that standing. We think the issue of domicile should have been \u2022submitted to a jury. Cf. Shafer v. Children\u2019s Hospital, 105 U.S.App.D.C. -, 265 F.2d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
