It was organized in May, 1947, and maintained its principal office in Mexico City. For the year 1948 it filed an income tax return in California, and for the years 1949 and 1950 it filed such returns in Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-21\">The Commissioner determined deficiencies in the income tax of petitioner for each of those three years. The returns had been filed upon the assumption and with the claim that petitioner was a resident foreign corporation engaged in trade or business in the United States. The Commissioner determined, however, that it was a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business within the United States and hence subject to a higher income tax liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-22\">The taxpayer filed its petition in the Tax Court for redetermination of the deficiencies so asserted by the Commissioner. It presented to that court the sole question as to whether petitioner was a resident foreign corporation engaged in trade or business in the United States during those taxable years.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The controlling statutory provisions are to be found in \u00a7 231 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended by the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 798.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The facts relating to the question whether petitioner was or was not engaged in trade or business within the United States during the years in question are set out in the findings of the Tax Court. These described first what may be called the principal activities of the corporation during those years, and later, certain so-called casual or incidental transactions which the corporation carried on. The principal activities are described as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u201cPetitioner qualified as a foreign corporation in Nevada in March, 1948, and continued to be so qualified until March, 1951. It used for its American address that of Reno, Nevada, company that acted as resident agent for petitioner and other foreign corporations. Petitioner represented that it maintained only one place of business in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u201cGrover Turnbow, a United States citizen with offices in Oakland, California, served as petitioner\u2019s president. After March, 1948, at the suggestion of the California attorney who served as petitioner\u2019s vice president, Turnbow had petitioner\u2019s name added to the business names already appearing on his Oakland office door and on the building directory, which were: International Dairy Association, Inc., International Dairy Engineering Co., and International Dairy Supply Company, hereafter referred to as Association, Engineering, and Supply, respectively. Turnbow was president and sole stockholder of Supply. Petitioner never used the Oakland address on its letterheads or otherwise and paid no rent for the Oakland office.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">\u201cPetitioner represented the incorporation of part of the vast holdings of Axel Wenner-Gren, an internationally famous financier whose wealth was over $1,000,000,000. Wenner-Gren held substantial amounts of stock in the Electro-lux and Servel corporations, as well as sizable and diverse holdings in Mexican and other foreign enterprises. Prior to petitioner\u2019s incorporation, Turnbow served as attorney in fact in the United States for Wenner-Gren, who was then borrowing large sums from American <em>lending </em>institutions for use outside the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">\u201cTurnbow became acquainted with Wenner-Gren in Mexico when he erected a recombined milk plant in which Wen-ner-Gren had a financial interest. Turn-bow unsuccessfully sought to interest Wenner-Gren in financing the supplying of milk by Supply to the armed forces in the Par East.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">\u201cTurnbow and his various enterprises were interested in erecting recombined milk plants in foreign countries. Prior to and during the years here involved, the program failed to materialize because of the inability to reconvert foreign currency into American dollars, and the instability of foreign currencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">\u201cTurnbow hoped that petitioner would assist in the financing of these plants if his program for the establishment of recombined milk plants in foreign countries proved feasible. Its function would be to secure funds, but without any voice or activitity in the operations of the plants. Petitioner never undertook any activity in connection with the establishment of such recombined milk plants and never used its assets and borrowings for this or any related purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-16\">\u201cAfter petitioner\u2019s incorporation, it assumed Wenner-Gren\u2019s liabilities to various banks, having acquired his stock in the Electrolux and Servel corporations, which it thereupon pledged as security for loans. As of the beginning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>of 1948, petitioner had assumed indebtedness of Wenner-Gren as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">\u201cBank of America, N.T.&amp;S.A., $1,-100,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201cCentral Hanover Bank and Trust Company, New York, $480,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">\u201cTeleric, Inc., $926,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u201cPetitioner liquidated the loan from Central Hanover Bank during 1948. The loan from Teleric, Inc. remained outstanding as of the end of 1950. It liquidated the loan from the Bank of America in August 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u201cProm 1948 through 1950, petitioner had no paid employees in the United States. Turnbow received $1,500 per month during the last 6 months of 1950 denominated as salary for his services to petitioner. This represented part of an over-all settlement effectuated in June 1950 between Turnbow and Wenner-Gren, as individuals, whereby Turnbow would receive from Wenner-Gren stock and cash totaling $105,000. The settlement covered, among other items, Turn-bow\u2019s services to Wenner-Gren from October 1946 through June 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">\u201cPetitioner maintained no books of account in the United States. Its only records consisted of bank statements, cheek books, and documents pertaining to transactions within the United States, all in the care of Turnbow\u2019s secretary at Oakland. Petitioner maintained bank accounts in the United States at the First National Bank, Reno, Nevada, and at the Bank of America, N. T. &amp; S. A. in San Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s only assets in the United States at the end of 1948 consisted of Electrolux and Servel stock and the two bank account balances.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">\u201cPetitioner reported on its tax returns for the years in question that it derived more than 50 per cent of its gross income from sources outside the United States. It reported gross income from sources within the United States, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">1948 ............$817,791.39</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-14\">1949 ............ 605,635.10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\">1950 ............. 446,863.19</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIN\">Of the 1948 gross income, $823,635.59 represented dividends on Electrolux and Servel stock. The difference was represented by a reported net loss of $5,844.11 resulting from sales of property other than capital assets. Of the 1949 gross income, $692,125.20 represented dividends, and $3,509.90 \u2018Other Income in the United States.\u2019 Of the 1950 gross income, $441,624 represented dividends from the Electrolux Corporation, and $5,239.19 additional income \u2018From Sales.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b90-17\">\u201cDuring 1948, petitioner\u2019s activities in the United States included the following: (a) It collected dividends on Elec-trolux and Servel stock, (b) It made payments of principal and interest on outstanding loans, (c) In May it borrowed $1,000,000 from the Bank of America, which Wenner-Gren used in acquisition of Mexican telephone companies. (d) On August 6, it borrowed $1,850,000 from the Bank of America, of which it used $1,100,000 to repay prior indebtedness of Wenner-Gren to the bank, which petitioner had assumed. On that same date petitioner drew checks in excess of the balance of $750,000 to make payments of principal and interest on other outstanding indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-18\">\u201cDuring 1949, petitioner\u2019s activities in the United States included the following: (a) It collected dividends on Electrolux and Servel stock, (b) It made payments on principal and interest on outstanding loans, (c) It secured and repaid short-term advances from Turnbow. (d) In September it borrowed $1,700,000 from the Bank of America, used to liquidate the outstanding balances of two loans from that bank, (e) In December it sold its 55,000 shares of Servel stock, theretofore pledged with the Bank of America to secure loans. It used the proceeds of the sale to pay outstanding obligations to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-19\">\u201cDuring 1950, petitioner\u2019s activities in the United States included the following: (a) It collected dividends on Elec-trolux stock, (b) It made payments on principal and interest on outstanding loans, (c) On January 3, it borrowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>$2,000,000 from the Central Hanover Bank. It used the bulk of this loan to repay the $1,700,000 loan from the Bank of America. It transferred approximately $400,000 to its account in Mexico City, $110,000 for the account of a Swedish bank, and aproximately $275,000 to its account at the Bank of America, much of which was thereafter transferred to petitioner\u2019s Mexican accounts, (d) Petitioner repaid the $2,000,000 loan. In its negotiations with the Central Hanover Bank, petitioner represented itself as a Panamanian corporation, doing business in foreign countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u201cThe funds borrowed by petitioner were in the main used by Wenner-Gren. Turnbow had no direct knowledge of their use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">It will be noted that the activities described in the last four quoted paragraphs all relate to the corporation\u2019s investment in the stock of other corporations, the collection of dividends and the borrowing of money, some of which was used to acquire Mexican companies and some of which was used by Wenner-Gren. The taxpayer\u2019s filed returns stated that its principal activity was \u201cInvestment\u201d, and such a term would appear to describe the activities just listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">On the basis of these facts, taken alone, there cannot be any question but that the petitioner corporation was not \u201cengaged in trade or business\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 231. While the Internal Revenue Code did not specifically define \u201ctrade or business\u201d, yet the decisions have definitely established that where those terms are used elsewhere in the income tax laws, they do not include such activities as those here described.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The leading case on this point arose out of a taxpayer\u2019s effort to deduct the expenses of managing his investments in stocks and bonds as expenses incurred \u201cin carrying on any trade or business\u201d under the provisions of \u00a7 23 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23(a). The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to permit the deduction. Said the Supreme Court: \u201cThe petitioner merely kept records and collected interest and dividends from his securities, through managerial attention for his investments. No matter how large the estate or how continuous or extended the work required may be, such facts are not sufficient as a matter of law to permit the courts to reverse the decision of the Board.\u201d Higgins v. Commissioner, 312 U.S. 212, 218, 61 S.Ct. 475, 478, 85 L.Ed. 783.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since that decision it is fair to say that it is settled law that the mere management of investments and the collection of rents, interest, and dividends is insufficient to constitute the carrying on of a trade or business. See \u201cTrade or Business Under Income Tax Laws,\u201d 3 Kan.L.R. 99, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The meaning of the decision in the Higgins case was stated in Commissioner v. Smith, 2 Cir., 203 F.2d 310, 312, as follows: \u201cThe full-time management of one\u2019s investments does not constitute a trade or business.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This limited meaning of the phrase \u201ctrade or business\u201d was plainly in the mind of Congress when the language of \u00a7 231 was last amended prior to the years here in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>question. That amendment occurred in 1942. Prior to that time subdivision (b) provided the more advantageous rate of tax not merely for those foreign corporations \u201cengaged in trade or business\u201d within the United States, but also for those \u201chaving an office or place of business\u201d within the United States. The 1942 amendment eliminated this provision relating to an office or place of business. The House report which accompanied the bill accomplishing that made it plain that the intended effect was to eliminate foreign corporations which were merely investing in the stock of domestic corporations from claiming the benefits of subdivision (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">There can be no doubt that, for the purposes of \u00a7 231, \u201ctrade or business\u201d did not include the activities of petitioner which are described in the above quoted findings of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">This brings us to a consideration of some other activities of the petitioner,\u2014 activities referred to by the Tax Court as \u201cisolated and noncontinuous\u201d transactions. These were of three kinds: (1) In July, 1948, petitioner purchased a carload of dry milk fat from Kraft Foods Company for $46,212.75 and sold it one month later through one of Turnbow\u2019s companies for $40,248.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) As an accommodation to a Mexican corporation petitioner purchased, in 1950, equipment for that corporation for which it was reimbursed without profit. (3) In all three years petitioner bought tin cans for milk products which were needed by Supply, one of Turnbow\u2019s companies. The Tax Court summarized these can transactions as follows: \u201cIn each year, the only other activity reported by petitioner was represented by nominal amounts of income resulting from transactions relating to cans used by Supply. In 1948, such reported income amounted to $120.64; in 1949, $3,509.90; in 1950, $5,239.19.\u201d The first such can purchase occurred in December, 1948. Turnbow or Supply put in the order, but in petitioner\u2019s name. It paid for the cans and turned the cans to Supply for a five percent increase over the price it paid. This December 1948 transaction was repeated 37 times in 1949 and on 48 occasions in 1950. Said the Tax Court: \u201cThere was no business purpose connected with the can transactions engaged in by petitioner. It never used its Nevada office in these operations. It carried no inventory of cans and ordered no cans other than those used by Supply. In every instance in which Supply acquired cans in this way, it paid petitioner within 10 days of petitioner\u2019s payment to Western. After 1950, Supply recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>menced ordering and purchasing of cans directly from Western.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We think it was within the competence of the Tax Court to find that these facts were insufficient to show that petitioner was engaged in trade or business within the United States. The court found these milk fat, equipment and milk can transactions, because they were \u201cof an isolated and noncontinuous nature\u201d, and because they were \u201cdictated not by a business objective but purely by a desire to save taxes,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did not amount to activities sufficient to bring petitioner within the definition of \u00a7 231(b). Wholly apart from any question of \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d, it seems plain that whether these milk fat, milk can transactions were properly to be regarded, in the light of the corporation\u2019s whole enterprise, as casual or incidental transactions, was a question of fact. And further, whether as such, those transactions served to change an otherwise \u201cnon-trade or business\u201d corporation into one within \u00a7 231(b) is also a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In Linen Thread Co. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 128 F.2d 166, 168, the court was considering the validity of a Regulation defining the term \u201coffice or place of business\u201d as used in \u00a7 231(b) before its .amendment. It then provided: \u201cA foreign corporation engaged in trade or business within the United States or having an office or place of business therein shall be taxable as provided in section 14(e)(1).\u201d The Regulation recited: \u201cThe term \u2018office or place of business\u2019, however, implies a place for the regular transaction of business and does not include a place where casual or incidental transactions might be, or are, effected.\u201d The court said: \u201cThe regulations are valid because reasonable and <em>within the fair meaning of the statute.\u201d </em>See, accord, Linen Thread Co. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 152 F.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">For a like reason we think the Tax Court\u2019s holding that casual or incidental transactions (such as these milk fat and milk can matters) are not sufficient to show the corporation to be \u201cengaged in trade or business\u201d, was within the fair meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-19\">The Tax Court\u2019s decision was filed on September 4, 1957. On October 21, 1957 petitioner retained new counsel. He studied the record and reached the conclusion that \u201cnot all of the available facts were presented with reference to the issue decided by the Court,\u201d and so, although the 30 days allowed by the Tax Court\u2019s rules for making such a motion had long since passed, counsel moved for leave to file a motion to vacate the decision and reopen the proceeding for further testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is claimed the court erred in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The argument is groundless. Granting such a motion would at best be purely discretionary, none of the matters new counsel thought should have been presented were newly discovered, or unknown to petitioner or its representatives at the time of the hearing. Finally, there was no showing what the additional evidence would be, if taken, nor whether it would alter the picture of petitioner\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">DENMAN, Circuit Judge, did not participate in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-23\">. If petitioner qualified under \u00a7 231(b) it would be entitled to substantial dividends received credits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-10\">. \u00a7 231 in subdivision (a) relating to \u201cnonresident corporations\u201d provided for tax upon \u201cevery foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business within the United States\u201d, while subdivision (b) provided: \u201c(b) Resident Corporations.\u2014 A foreign corporation engaged in trade or business within the United States shall he taxable as provided in section 34(c) (1) and section 15.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 231 (a, b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">. The decision in the Higgins case led to corrective legislation, and this was accomplished, not by redefining the terms \u201ctrade or business\u201d, but by adding subdivision 23(a) (2) permitting deduction of expenses incurred \u201cfor the production or collection of income, or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">. That was a case in which taxpayer sought to deduct as a loss for the taxable year a debt which became worthless during the year, claiming it to be a business debt under \u00a7 23 (k) (1) of Internal Revenue Code, 1939. Taxpayer bad made extensive loans to and investments in numerous business enterprises. The court reversed a Tax Court decision for the taxpayer. Noting the history of the use, in the Code, of the term \u201ctrade or business\u201d, the court commented on its \u201crestricted meaning\u201d and said: \u201cAlthough Congress has never defined the term \u2018trade or business\u2019, it is clear that this concept as used in \u00a7 23(k) does not encompass all activities engaged in for profit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">. The report stated: \u201cUnder existing law, nonresident aliens and foreign corporations are divided into two classes: (a)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Those not engaged in trade or business within the United States and not having an office or place of business therein and (b) those engaged in trade or business within the United States or having an office or place of business therein. Those in class (a) are taxed at a flat rate on p fixed and determinable income while those in class (b) are subject to tax at the corporate rate applicable to domestic corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\u201cA tendency has arisen, principally on the part of foreign corporations which are substantial holders of the stock of domestic corporations and, occasionally on the part of nonresident alien individuals, to attempt to establish that they have an \u2018office or place of business\u2019 within the United States and hence secure the very different tax treatment accorded taxpayers within class (b). Since such corporations and individuals engage in no other economic activities in the United States, they can not be said to be engaged in trade or business within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">\u201cIt appears to your committee to be in the interests of good administration to establish but one test (as is done with respect to capital stock tax in section 1200) in ascertaining the classification of foreign entities, namely, whether or not it is engaged in trade or business within the United States. Such amendment narrows sharply the field of uncertainty arising in such cases and removes a possible avenue of tax avoidance to large foreign corporate and other holders of domestic securities.\u201d 1942-2 O.B. 372, 449.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b92-13\">. Speaking of this the Tax Court said: \u201cIn July 1948, petitioner engaged in a transaction of a type in which it was not. previously nor subsequently engaged.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\">. On this point the court cited Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 465, 55 S.Ct. 266, 79 L.Ed. 596.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\">.
