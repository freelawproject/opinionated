We must, therefore, reject the view that, in reviewing orders of the National Labor Relations Board and considering this petition for late filing, the court acts more in the public interest and should, therefore, act differently than when reviewing such petitions for leave filed in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-19\">Examining the petition for rehearing submitted with the petition for leave to file, as we do all other such petitions, we are of the clear opinion that the claimed discrepancies between the facts as stated in the opinion and as they appear of record were and are of no real significance and that, accepting them as the discrepancies they are claimed to be, they do not affect the ratio decidendi of the decision. This was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-20\">\u201cAs the examiner found and the record reflects, the facts as to the icehouse business and Albrecht\u2019s failure to exercise diligence to secure employment are such we think as to put beyond question that the Board\u2019s conclusion that Albrecht\u2019s conduct in that period measured up to the standards of diligence and good faith entitling him to make claim for back wages for that period is without substantial evidenti-ary support, indeed is contrary to the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-21\">The petition for leave to file is, therefore, denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-22\">RIVES, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
