For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that such separation was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The appellant, Leslie L. Barger, a veteran of World War II, was employed by the Library of Congress from February 3, 1954, to November 11, 1955. From February 3, 1954, to September 27, 1954, he was an editorial assistant and filer under a temporary appointment. From September 27, 1954, to November 11, 1955, he was in the Technical Information Division of the Library under a probational appointment. His performance of his duties was satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">On February 25, 1954, he filed an application for federal employment on Standard Form 57. He named 12 places of former employment, including one as a House Officer at the Taft Hotel in New York City for three months in 1945. He stated that he never had been discharged or forced to resign from any position for misconduct or unsatisfactory service. However, the file of the Taft Hotel shows that he had been discharged from its employ \u201cfor what amounted to misconduct.\u201d He admits the foregoing but denies that the Taft Hotel action was known to him when he filed Form 57. Upon the Librarian\u2019s discovery of the Taft Hotel incident a member of his staff, on December 21, 1954, interviewed appellant about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">On October 11,1955, appellant received a written notice from the appellee, L. Quincy Mumford, as the Librarian of Congress, directing appellant\u2019s \u201cseparation (disqualification)\u201d from employment at the Library, effective November 11. The notice stated: \u201cThis action is based upon your withholding information from the Standard Form 57, Application for Federal Employment, and making a false statement therein.\u201d The notice also said: \u201cYou are not entitled to appeal from this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">Appellant does not deny his withholding of information as charged by the Librarian. He seeks to excuse it as inadvertent, inconsequential, and done without intent to mislead.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">In January 1956, appellant sought to clear his record through the Civil Service Commission. That Commission replied that it could not consider his claim because he had not acquired eligibility for reinstatement. Appellant asked the Librarian of Congress to specify more fully his reasons for discharging appellant. When the Librarian declined to do so, appellant appealed to the Civil Service Commission for the procedural protection specified under \u00a7 14 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That appeal was rejected by the Civil Service Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Appeals Examining Officer and by the Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review. Appellant also, sought, unsuccessfully, assistance from several members of Congress and from veterans\u2019 organizations. Finally, on March 6, 1957, he filed, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the complaint in the instant case, demanding that his separation from employment be declared void, that he be reinstated in his former position, and that he be awarded back pay from November 11, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">There being little controversy as to the material facts, each party sought summary judgment. The District Court, after a hearing, denied appellant\u2019s motion, granted that of the Librarian, and dismissed Barger\u2019s complaint. From that order, he has taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">He makes two principal claims. If either is upheld, he is entitled to reversal of the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">I. Appellant claims that, as a war veteran, he is entitled to the protective procedures prescribed by \u00a7 14 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944, as amended. Note 1, supra. The Librarian concedes that such procedures have not been followed, and places his reliance primarily upon \u00a7 20 of the Act, 58 Stat. 391, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 869, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 869, which provides that \u201cNothing contained in this Act is intended to apply to any position in or under the legislative or judicial branch of the Government * *</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">The Librarian contends that such exemption applies to all employees of the Library, including appellant. Although we have found no court decision expressly deciding that the Library of Congress is \u201cin or under\u201d the legislative branch of the Government, we do find that status officially recognized in several ways. Statements of the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Comptroller General and the Attorney General indicate that, as its name implies, the Library of Congress has long been treated as being in or under the jurisdiction of the legislative branch of the Government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Several Acts of Congress reflect similar recognition of the status of the Library.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>language of \u00a7 20 is so clear that we need not resort to the legislative history of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The United States District Court for the District of Columbia has reached a similar conclusion in holding that \u00a7 20 exempts employees of the Government Printing Office from \u00a7 14 of the Act because such employees are \u201cunder the \u2018legislative branch\u2019 \u201d of the Government. Duncan v. Blattenberger, D.C.1956, 141 F.Supp. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Appellant argues that even if the Library of Congress and its employees generally are exempt from the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, appellant\u2019s particular position is not exempt. This argument is based on appellant\u2019s claim that his employment was in the Technical Information Division and that such division derived all or most of its operating funds from the Armed Services Technical Information Agency which, in turn, was a division of the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On this point we adopt the language of the Civil Service Board of Appeals and Review in its letter to appellant dated November 29, 1956:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\u201cIf, as stated in your letter, the division in which you were employed receives its funds from the Department of the Air Force, this would not serve to bring your case within the purview of Section 14. The position to which a person is officially appointed and the agency by whom a person is officially employed are controlling, and the transfer of funds between agencies does not affect a person\u2019s official employment status in such cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">II. Appellant contends also that he was entitled to the special remedial procedures established by the Library of Congress to administer its security program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This contention is based on his claim that he was in fact separated from his position for reasons of national security, although the Librarian made no reference to that reason in the notice of separation, and now expressly states that he did not discharge appellant on any ground of national security. Appellant does not charge bad faith on the part of the Librarian but insists that the Librarian believed appellant to be a security risk, and that therefore we should treat appellant\u2019s discharge as though it were ordered for that reason. The Librarian had a wide discretion in choosing the ground upon which he should base his order separating appellant from his probational position. Without reaching the question whether the Librarian could have lawfully discharged appellant from his probational position without stating any reason, we have here a termination of employment made in good faith for a rational reason within the employer\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">We have considered the other contentions made by appellant but find in them no force sufficient to invalidate appellant\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">We conclude, therefore, that the separation of appellant from a probational position not in or under the executive branch of the Government was validly directed by the Librarian. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">. \u201cSec. 14.
