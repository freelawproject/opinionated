The facts are fully stated in the opinion of Judge Levin, of the district court, reported in United States v. Meli, D.C.E.D.Mich., 158 F.Supp 217. We are of the view that the judgment should be, and is, hereby affirmed, for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the district judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b270-15\">MILLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"At5\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-16\">I am of the opinion that the documentary evidence and the supporting testimony of the naturalization examiner with respect to appellee\u2019s concealment of his prior criminal record, fully sustained the burden of proof resting upon the Government, although the examiner had no independent recollection of the ap-pellee and of the answers he made in his examination of him about twenty-six years prior thereto.
