The appellant, Sealy, Incorporated, opposed the application on the ground of likelihood of confusion of prospective purchasers between \u201cBaby Posture\u201d and appellant\u2019s prior registered \u201cPosture-pedic\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cPosture Pillow\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the unregistered mark \u201cBaby Posturepedie,\u201d each mark being used on mattresses. Op-poser, on appeal to this court, solely urges that \u201cBaby Posture\u201d so resembles \u201cBaby Posturepedie,\u201d when applied to applicant\u2019s goods, as to be likely to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">The Assistant Commissioner in dismissing the opposition on the ground of absence of probability of deception of purchasers, found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-13\">\u201cConsidering the circumstances surrounding the purchase of mattresses in the usual retail outlets, and considering the highly suggestive nature of the word \u2018Posture\u2019 when applied to mattresses, and considering the manner of opposer\u2019s use and advertising of its \u2018Posture-pedic\u2019 mark conjointly with \u2018Sealy\u2019, and considering opposer\u2019s use of \u2018Baby Posturepedie\u2019 merely to differentiate its \u2018Posturepedie\u2019 crib mattresses from its other sizes of \u2018posturepedie\u2019 mattresses, it is concluded that applicant\u2019s mark \u2018Baby Posture\u2019, when applied to mattresses, is not likely to create confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">On appeal, appellee urges that the decision below should be affirmed for the above mentioned reasons, and for the additional ground that Sealy, Incorporated, has failed to prove use of \u201cBaby Posturepedie,\u201d by it or any affiliate, prior to the first use of \u201cBaby Posture\u201d by the Simmons Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">The president of the opposer testified that his firm is primarily an executive office which licenses bedding manufacturers to use various trademarks and patents in association with the mattresses and other merchandise manufactured as \u201cSealy\u201d products. He further testified that Sealy, Incorporated, exercises absolute control over both the engineering quality standards and the advertising practices of its licensees. A document, portions of which had been deleted, purporting to be a license agreement, was introduced in evidence and identified by this witness as showing the contractual relationship between Sealy, Incorporated, and its manufacturing affiliates. The same witness further averred, though Sealy, Incorporated was not a sales or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>ganization, that in isolated cases it had acted as a transfer agent for its licensees to negotiate sales to national catalog houses, and that periodically floor samples were sold directly from opposer\u2019s markets in various cities to dealers, in order to eliminate old merchandise and prepare for new showings.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">The aforesaid testimony was corroborated by the vice-president of Sealy\u2019s Ohio licensee, who stated that his organization manufactured and sold \u201cSealy\u201d products, including \u201cSealy Baby Posture-pedic\u201d mattresses, in compliance with production specifications set by Sealy, Incorporated, and in accordance with a license of \u201cthe type\u201d of that introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">There is no doubt that the use of \u201cBaby Posturepedic\u201d by opposer\u2019s licensees inures to the benefit of opposer and can be used to support these opposition proceedings. For although the exact terms of the license agreement are not shown by the record, it is clear from the testimony of Sealy\u2019s Ohio licensee that manufacture of \u201cBaby Posturepedic\u201d mattresses was under the control of, and in behalf of Sealy, Incorporated. In view of the above, it is clear that op-poser has established the right to maintain this action. Wilson v. Delaunay, 245 F.2d 877, 44 CCPA 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">With regard to priority of use of the respective marks, the record shows use by the applicant of \u201cBaby Posture\u201d as a trademark for crib mattresses since May of 1954. Opposer\u2019s president, when asked when the mark \u201cBaby Posture-pedic\u201d was first used, answered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-7\">\u201cWell, as I told you, the Posture-pedic mark was used in June, 1950. I think it was probably about two or three years later when we started to use Baby Posturepedic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-9\">\u201cQ64. Are you sure of that? A. I am not positive, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-12\">\u201cQ67. Can you recall anything, Mr. Bergmann, [opposer\u2019s president] which would help you remember when Baby Posturepedic was first used? A. No, honestly, I would have to consult the records, because my memory does not tie me back to those dates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-14\">\u201cQ68. You don\u2019t have any recollection as to an approximate date on which you used Baby Posture-pedic? A. As I previously told you, I know from my own memory of sales back as early as 1953, and it could be the latter part of 1952.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">The witness for Sealy\u2019s Ohio licensee, when queried as to his company\u2019s first use of \u201cBaby Posturepedic\u201d on mattresses, replied, \u201cI can remember that we definitely started using it in 1952, possibly as early as 1951.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-16\">One cloth label and one photostatic copy of a label, each showing \u201cSealy\u201d preceding the words \u201cBaby Posture-pedic,\u201d in different styles of type, are in evidence. Opposer\u2019s president, in testimony taken in June 1955, stated that he didn\u2019t know how long the cloth label had been used, but estimated that \u201cit has been some little time, though. * * * My guess would be maybe a year.\u201d The representative of the licensee, when asked about the same label stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-18\">\u201cThat is the label we use on the Baby Posturepedic crib mattress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-19\">\u201cQ46. And do you have any idea off hand how long you have used this label ? A. About three years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-20\">Although the licensee was not questioned about the copy of the other label, the president of Sealy, Incorporated testified that it had been used \u201cfrom the very beginning. I don\u2019t know what the exact date was.\u201d He further made a \u201cguess\u201d that it had been used \u201cfor three or four years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-21\">The licensee further produced copies of invoices of sales of mattress products described as \u201cBaby Posturepedic Crib(s),\u201d several of which were dated in 1952 and 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-22\">In view of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that appellant, by the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>troduction of testimony of its president, a licensee representative, and the documentary evidence, has proven with \u201cconviction of its accuracy and applicability * * * \u201d that it and its licensee used \u201cBaby Posturepedic\u201d prior to May, 1954, the admitted date of first use of \u201cBaby Posture\u201d by appellee. This court has in similar situations stated that, although prior use must be established by a preponderance of the evidence, Etablissements Rene Beziers, Societe Anonyme v. Reid, Murdoch &amp; Co., 48 F.2d 946, 18 CCPA 1340, such use can be proven by the testimony of only one witness. In Nettie Rosenstein, Inc. v. Princess Pat, Ltd., 220 F.2d 444, 448, 42 CCPA 806, which involved the question of the prior use of a mark by the opposer, this court stated that \u201cthere is no requirement of law that corroboration of the testimony of a witness in a trade-mark opposition case is essential to its probativeness *.\" B. R. Baker Company v. Lebow Brothers, 150 F.2d 580, 583, 32 CCPA 1206, cited by appellee, is distinguishable from the case at bar since in that case applicant\u2019s witness was endeavoring to establish an earlier date than that alleged in the application, by recalling from memory events which occurred some fourteen years prior to the time that the witness testified. However, even under those circumstances this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-7\">\u201cIt is not contended by either party here that oral proof alone, even by one witness, if sufficiently probative, will not suffice in proving priority of ownership and use in a trade-mark interference proceeding. While the oral testimony of a single interested witness must necessarily have its \u25a0weaknesses, we know of nothing in trade-mark law which justifies the rejection of such proof if it is sufficiently probative. However, such testimony is obviously strengthened by corroborative documentary evidence, and it should not be characterized by contradictions, inconsistencies, and indefiniteness but should carry with it conviction of its accuracy and applicability. William S. Merrell Co. v. Anacin Co., 109 F.2d 339, 27 C.C.P.A. Patents, 847. * * * <em>\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">Insofar as the use of the word \u201cBaby\u201d in conjunction with \u201cPosturepedic\u201d is concerned, the invoices of the Ohio licensee definitely place the date of such usage prior to appellee\u2019s first use of \u201cBaby Posture.\u201d Furthermore, there is no reason for this court to deny probative value to these invoices, the label on which \u201cBaby Posturepedic\u201d is imprinted and the testimony of both op-poser\u2019s president and the licensee representative to establish trademark usage of \u201cBaby Posturepedic\u201d by Sealy, Incorporated on crib mattresses prior to May, 1954. Moreover, this same evidence proves that the word \u201cBaby\u201d was not used by appellant and its licensee solely to distinguish between the various mattress sizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">So we come now to the final issue in this case, i. e., whether \u201cBaby Posturepedic\u201d is confusingly similar to \u201cBaby Posture.\u201d In resolving this question, as in all similar trademark cases, we must examine the marks in their entireties. Kitchen-Quip, Inc. v. Sunbeam Corp., 222 F.2d 265, 42 CCPA 869; Lauritzen &amp; Co., Inc. v. Borden Co., 239 F.2d 405, 44 CCPA 720; Medicated Products Co. v. Alice Jewelry Co., 255 F.2d 408, 45 CCPA 966. Though appellant\u2019s labels include the house-mark \u201cSealy\u201d in much the same manner that appellee\u2019s label includes \u201cSimmons,\u201d this factor is not germane to the question of likelihood of confusion between the secondary trademarks. It is to be presumed that either \u201cBaby Posturepedic\u201d or \u201cBaby Posture\u201d may be used at any time without the respective house-marks. Hat Corp. of America v. John B. Stetson Co., 223 F.2d 485, 42 CCPA 1001; Bellbrook Dairies, Inc. v. Hawthorn-Mellody Farms Dairy, Inc., 253 F.2d 481, 45 CCPA 842; Denney v. Elizabeth Arden Sales Corporation, 263 F.2d 347, 46 CCPA-. This proposition is supported by the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>the mark shown in appellee\u2019s application does not include the word \u201cSimmons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aq2-dedup-0\">While dissection of marks should not be indulged in, it is of course proper to consider separate portions thereof in order to determine the importance to be attached thereto. Sleepmaster Products Co., Inc. v. American Auto-Felt Corp., 241 F.2d 738, 44 CCPA 784, and cases cited therein. The Assistant Commissioner is correct in stating that the word \u201cPosture\u201d is suggestive when applied to mattresses, many third party registrations using this word and phonetic variations thereof in connection with mattresses having been introduced as further evidence of such connotation. Although it is true that the suggestiveness of the word \u201cPosture\u201d precludes this court from giving the opposer\u2019s mark the protection that a purely arbitrary mark could command, nevertheless, in this instance, the opposer, by appending the syllables \u201cPedic\u201d to \u201cPosture,\u201d has changed it into a different word and has given it a certain arbitrariness which deserves a greater degree of protection than the word \u201cPosture\u201d alone, or as used in the third party registrations of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\"> Considering the marks in issue in their entireties, we note that the first four syllables are identical and that the only difference lies in the ultimate syllables \u201cPedic\u201d found in opposer\u2019s trademark. Since both designations are applied to exactly the same merchandise, which merchandise is offered to the public through the same marketing channels, and since the mental reaction to the composite word marks is liable to be similar, a substantial doubt as to the likelihood of confusion of purchasers arises. In accord with the well established rule, such doubt must be resolved against the newcomer to the field, the Simmons Company, and in favor of the prior user, Sealy, Incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">For these reasons, the Commissioner\u2019s decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-16\">.
