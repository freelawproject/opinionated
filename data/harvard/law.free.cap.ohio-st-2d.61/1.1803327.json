Zakany, </em>v. <em>Avellone </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 25, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-14\">In the cause before us, the Court of Common Pleas had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>original jurisdiction in the action relator seeks to prohibit. The action of respondent in denying relator\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that it may be erroneous, does not constitute the unauthorized usurpation of judicial power. Prohibition will not lie to prevent enforcement of an allegedly erroneous judgment rendered by a court with jurisdiction. <em>State, ex rel. Mansfield Telephone Co., </em>v. <em>Mayer </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 222, 223; <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Goldthorpe </em>(1930), 123 Ohio St. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Relator\u2019s argument, that the actions of the police prosecutor in obtaining relator\u2019s release of claims and dismissing a charge against him justify the issuance of a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent court from assuming jurisdiction herein, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Relator has an adequate remedy by way of appeal from any adverse judgment against him in the action presently before respondent court. See <em>State, ex rel. Gilla, </em>v. <em>Fellerhoff </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 86, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals allowing the writ of prohibition is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b31-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., Herbert, W.
