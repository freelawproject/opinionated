If so, such decision must be affirmed by this court. R. C. 5717.04. Recently, we were faced with the same responsibility in <em>N. &amp; C. Constr. </em>v. <em>Lindley, supra. </em>In that case we determined that the board decision holding N &amp; G Construction, Inc., a company remarkably similar in its operation to appellees in the instant cause, liable for the R. C. 5749.02 severance tax was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">We held, at page 417, \u201c***that the R &amp; F Coal Company, the owner of the coal and contractor for its excavation, is the person who actually severed the coal\u201d for R. C. 5749.02 purposes of imposing the excise tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Based on our decision in <em>N &amp; G Constr., </em>v. <em>Lindley, </em>the Board of Tax Appeals felt constrained to find appellees not liable for the tax. We are in agreement with the board\u2019s determination. <em>N &amp; G Constr. </em>is controlling in this matter. The factual pattern in the present case is nearly identical to that in <em>N &amp; G Constr. </em>Therefore, this court is of the opinion that the board decision is both reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Accordingly, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b87-12\">Herbert, W.
