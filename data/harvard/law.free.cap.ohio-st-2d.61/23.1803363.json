C. 5733.04 does not allow a taxpayer in computing its net income to deduct those net operating losses incurred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>subsidiary corporations in years prior to their merger into the taxpayer, during which they did no business in Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">By this single proposition of law, two issues are presented for disposition by this court:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">(1) Following a merger, do corporations succeed to the net operating losses of their former subsidiaries for purposes of the Ohio franchise tax?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">(2) If so, do corporations succeed to the net operating losses of former subsidiaries which were not subject to the Ohio franchise tax during the years that the net operating losses were sustained?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The Ohio franchise tax is imposed against foreign corporations for the privilege of doing business in this state, owning or using property in this state, or holding a certificate of compliance authorizing them to do business in this state. R. C. 5733.01 (A). Each such corporation is required to file an annual corporation report which determines the value of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the corporation. R. C. 5733.02 and 5733.05. The base or measure of the franchise tax is the value of the issued and outstanding shares of the corporation. R. C. 5733.05. The value of these shares is computed on a net worth basis and a net income basis, and a separate tax is computed on each basis. R. C. 5733.05 (A) and (B). The taxpayer corporation must pay the greater of the tax upon the net worth and the tax upon net income. R. C. 5733.06. In this case, the net income factor of the taxpayer is greater than its net worth factor, so we must determine whether the claimed deduction operates to reduce the net income factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The net operating loss deduction of the Ohio franchise tax is set forth in R. C. 5733.04, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\u201c(I) \u2018Net income\u2019 means the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income before operating loss deduction and special deductions, as required to be reported for the taxpayer\u2019s taxable year under the Internal Revenue Code, subject to the - following adjustments:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">\u201c(1) Deduct any net operating loss incurred in any taxable years ending in 1971 or thereafter but exclusive of any net operating loss incurred in taxable years ending prior to January 1, 1971. This deduction shall not be allowed in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tax year commencing before December 31,1973 but shall be carried over and allowed in tax years commencing after December 31,1973 until fully utilized in the next succeeding taxable year or years in which the taxpayer has net income, but in no case for more than five consecutive years after the taxable year in which the net operating loss occurs. The amount of such net operating loss, as determined under the allocation and apportionment provisions of section 5733.051 and division (B) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code for the year in which the net operating loss occurs, shall be deducted from net income, as determined under the allocation and apportionment provisions of section 5733.051 and devision (B) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code, to the extent necessary to reduce net income to zero with the remaining unused portion of the deduction, if any, carried forward to the remaining years of the five years after the net operating loss year, or until fully utilized, whichever occurs first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The Revised Code does not define the term \u201cnet operating loss,\u201d but it does provide in R. C. 5733.04 (K) that any term used in R. C. Chapter 5733 has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the federal income tax laws:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u201cAny term used in this chapter has the same meaning as when used in comparable context in the laws of the United States relating to federal income taxes unless a different meaning is clearly required. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States relating to federal income taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Sections 172 (a) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code define \u201cnet operating loss\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u201cNet operating loss deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u201c(a) Deduction allowed. There shall be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year an amount equal to the aggregate of (1) the net operating loss carryovers to such year, plus (2) the net operating loss carrybacks to such year. For purposes of this subtitle, the term \u2018net operating loss deduction\u2019 means the deduction allowed by this subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\"><em>U </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">\u201c(c) Net operating loss defined. For purposes of this sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tion, the term \u2018net operating loss\u2019 means the excess of the deductions allowed by this chapter over the gross income. Such excess shall be computed with the modifications specified in subsection (d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Thus, for purposes of the Ohio franchise tax, the definition of net operating loss is the excess of deductions over gross income, as modified by Section 172 (d) of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>R. C. 5733.031 (B) also provides that the taxpayer must use the same method of accounting when computing his Ohio franchise tax as it uses when computing its federal income tax:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>taxpayer\u2019s method of accounting shall be the same as his method of accounting for federal income tax purposes. In the absence of any method of accounting for federal income tax purposes, income shall be computed under such method as in the opinion of the Tax Commissioner clearly reflects income***.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The Internal Revenue Code contains a series of provisions which govern the carryover of certain items following corporate acquisitions. Section 381 of the Code prescribes how an acquiring corporation succeeds to and takes into account numerous items, including the net operating loss, earnings and profits, capital loss, and inventory of the corporation that was acquired. This section essentially prescribes the method of accounting to be used by the acquiring corporation for these items for federal income tax purposes. With respect to net operating loss carryovers, Section 381 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u201cCarryovers in certain corporate acquisitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u201c(a) General rule. In the case of the acquisition of assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>of a corporation by another corporation\u2014* * *the acquiring corporation shall succeed to and take into account, as of the close of the day of distribution or transfer, the items described in subsection (c) of the distributor or transferor corporation, subject to the conditions and limitations specified in subsections (b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>u </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u201c(c) Items of the distributor or transferor corporation. The items referred to in subsection (a) are:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u201c(1) Net operating loss carryovers.***\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The merger of Gulf Oil Corporation with its wholly-owned subsidiaries met the requirements of Section 381, and, therefore, under federal law, Gulf succeeded to and must take into account the net operating loss carryovers of its former subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The Board of Tax Appeals held in <em>Ben Tom Supply Co., Inc., </em>v. <em>Lindley, </em>60 B.T.A. Dec., Case No. E 21 (September 2, 1976), and in the present cause that the acquiring corporation succeeds to and must take into account the net operating loss of the corporation that was merged into it because this would be the result under federal income tax law. The board found that Sections 381 (a) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code either define the term \u201cnet operating loss\u201d or prescribe a method of accounting, and as such supplement R. C. Chapter 5733.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">We are persuaded that Sections 381 (a) and (c) prescribe a method of accounting for a net operating loss following corporate acquisitions. These provisions do not create a new deduction; rather, corporations are entitled to deduct net operating loss carryovers under Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code and R. C. 5733.04 (I) (1). Section 381 merely fills a gap in Ohio law. Since R. C. Chapter 5733 does not prescribe how an acquiring corporation must account for the net operating loss carryover of the corporation it acquired, we hold that the Board of Tax Appeals correctly referred to the provisions of Section 381, insofar as these provisions relate to net operating losses sustained wholly within the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Even though we find that under Ohio law acquiring corporations are generally entitled to succeed to the net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>operating loss carryover of the corporations they acquire, it is clear that this does not apply to the net operating loss of an acquired corporation which was not a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d at the time the loss was originally sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">R. C. 5733.04 (I) defines \u201cnet income\u201d as the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income before operating loss deduction and special deductions, subject to certain modifications including the Ohio net operating deduction. R. C. 5733.04 (I) (1) provides for the Ohio net operating loss deduction, and states that it may be allowed in tax years commencing after December 31, 1973, in which the <em>taxpayer </em>has net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">A \u201ctaxpayer\u201d is defined in R. C. 5733.04 (B) for purposes of the Ohio franchise tax as follows: \u201c \u2018Taxpayer\u2019 means a corporation subject to the tax imposed by this chapter.\u201d Gulf Oil Company of Pennsylvania and Sequoia Refining Corporation were not \u201ctaxpayers\u201d during the years in which their net operating losses were sustained. For purposes of the Ohio franchise tax, they had no net operating loss during the years 1971 to 1974. Gulf Oil Corporation did not succeed to any Ohio net operating loss carryover when the subsidiaries were merged into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The same result obtains in a comparable context under federal law. The strictly analogous situation under federal law is one in which a nonresident foreign subsidiary that did not have any United States income or deductions is merged with a parent corporation that is subject to the Internal Revenue Code. The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service has ruled in Rev. Rui. 72-421, that in such a situation the parent corporation is not entitled to deduct the net operating loss carryover of its subsidiary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cThe net operating loss of a liquidated nonresident foreign subsidiary that had no United States income or deductions may not be carried over to the domestic parent corporation.\u201d Rev. Rui. 72-421, 1972-2 Cum. Bull. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">R. C. 5733.04 (K) provides that terms used in R. C. Chapter 5733 have the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the federal income tax law, and R. C. 5733.031 requires the taxpayer to use the same method of accounting as is used for federal income tax purposes. The Board of Tax Appeals did not correctly determine the \u201ccomparable context\u201d of the present case under federal law, nor did it apply the \u201csame* * *method of accounting\u201d that federal law would apply to a case where a foreign subsidiary without any United States income or deductions is merged into another corporation. Rev. Rui. 72-421 prohibits the acquiring corporation from succeeding to the net operating loss carryover of its foreign subsidiary where the subsidiary had no United States income or deductions. The policy served by this ruling is to prevent a taxpayer from taking a deduction for a net operating loss where the profit, if any had been generated, would not have been subject to taxation. The same policy is served by our ruling in this case. If the foreign subsidiaries of Gulf Oil Corporation had turned a profit from 1971 to 1974, their net income would not have been subject to the Ohio franchise tax. Since their income was not subject to taxation by this state, their losses may not be used as a deduction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, being unreasonable and unlawful, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b60-6\">Celebrezze, C.

Therefore, its net operating loss is not a carryover to <em>P </em>under section 381 of the Code.\u201d Rev. Rui. 72-421,1972-2 Cum. Bull. 166.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> We are not presented at this time with a case where the distributor or transferor corporation was subject to the Ohio Franchise Tax during the taxable year in which its net operating loss was sustained. Under R. C. 5733.04 (I) (1), the amount of such a corporation\u2019s net operating loss is determined by the allocation and apportionment provisions of R. C. 5733.051 and 5733.05 (B). When such a corporation is acquired by another corporation, the acquiring corporation succeeds to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>must take into account only that portion of the net operating loss of the distributor or transferor corporation which was allocated to Ohio during the year in which the net operating loss occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b60-8\">William B. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATq\">concurring. The opinion of the court buries the crux of this case in footnote 4. We should rule that in connection with corporate asset acquisitions described in Section 381 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an acquiring corporation may inherit only those transferor or distributor corporation net operating losses which were previously apportioned to Ohio pursuant to R. C. 5733.05 (B) (2), and which the transferor or distributor corporation could have utilized<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> absent the acquisition. Such a rule properly focuses on the existence of <em>Ohio </em>net operating losses. As such, it would certainly dispose of the case at bar where the distributor subsidiaries had insufficient Ohio contacts during the loss years at issue to qualify as franchise taxpayers. The emphasis in the syllabus placed on the subsidiaries not being \u201ctaxpayers\u201d simply introduces the possibility that our decision will be read too narrowly, especially if footnote 4 is ignored.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">It is also both unnecessary and confusing for the court to assert that the subsidiaries, and not Gulf, are \u201ctaxpayer (s)\u201d within the meaning of R. C. 5733.04 (I) (1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>R. C. 5733.04 (I) directs a corporate taxpayer to adjust its federal taxable income in certain ways to reflect Ohio franchise tax base income. In this connection, R. C. 5733.04 (I) (1) directs the \u201ctaxpayer\u201d to set off certain earlier net operating losses against its current taxable income. To suggest that this \u201ctaxpayer\u201d is not Gulf is confusing at best, and may cause the commissioner difficulties in other contexts. Moreover, this definitional manipulation is unnecessary since we still need to determine the amount of net operating losses Gulf may properly inherit from its subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The statutory basis for the above determination should have been the phrase in R. C. 5733.04 (I) (1) that \u201c[t]he amount of such net operating loss as determined under the allocation and apportionment provisions * * <em>*for the year in which the net operating loss occurs, </em>shall be deducted from net income***.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since R. C. 5733.04 (I) (1) was not drafted with corporate acquisitions in mind, it does not inform Gulf <em>whose </em>apportionment ratios should be multiplied by its subsidiaries\u2019 earlier accumulated net operating losses. Surely, to use any ratios but those of the subsidiaries for each of their loss years, respectively, would be absurd. We should simply read this requirement into R. C. 5733.04 (I) (1) until the General Assembly drafts a provision tailored to corporate acquisitions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b61-8\">Celebrezze, C. J., Herbert and P. Brown, JJ., concur in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b60-13\"> For example, R. C. 5733.04 (I) (1) limits the carry-forward period to five years. It would follow from the rule set forth here that an acquiring corporation would succeed only to the unused portion of this period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b60-15\"> Although there is no case law on the issue, federal tax rules in a comparable context (merger of non-resident foreign corporation into a domestic parent) are similar in effect. See Section 882 (c) (1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code; Treas. Regs. 1.861-8 and 1.381 (a)-l (c). It is also noted that the analysis in Rev. Rui. 72-421 (discussed by the court) is based on the above provisions and is thus fully supportive of the rule espoused here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\"> In contradiction to this language, Gulf used its <em>merger year </em>apportionment ratio, not its subsidiaries\u2019 <em>loss year </em>apportionment ratios, to calculate its entitlement to its subsidiaries\u2019 pre-merger net operating losses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
