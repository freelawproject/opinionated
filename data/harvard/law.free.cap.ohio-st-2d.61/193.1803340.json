This court, however, has consistently held that mandamus will not lie where there is some evidence to support the finding of the commission. See <em>State, ex rel. Mees, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 128, 131; <em>State, ex rel. Davis, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 160, 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The claimant in this cause established compensability under R. C. 4123.68(BB), a residual definitional section dealing with non-scheduled occupational diseases. That section states: \u201cAll other occupational diseases: A disease peculiar to a particular industrial process, trade or occupation and to which an employee is not ordinarily subjected or exposed outside of or away from his employment.\u201d This court construed this section in <em>Ohio Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Krise </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 247. It was held that a disease is compensable under that section where the following criteria are found to exist: \u201c(1) The disease is contracted in the course of employment; (2) the disease is peculiar to the claimant\u2019s employment by its causes and the characteristics of its manifestation or the conditions of the employment result in a hazard which distinguishes the employment in character from employment generally; and (3) the employment creates a risk of contracting the disease in a greater degree and in a different manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>than in the public generally.\u201d The Court of Appeals concluded that there was evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding and that all three criteria were established.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Appellant\u2019s primary argument is that one of the medical reports considered as evidence by the Industrial Commission should have been stricken from the record. It is further contended that without this report the second and third requirements established by <em>Ohio Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Krise, supra, </em>can not be supported by the record in this cause. Appellant specifically argues that only this report states that the claimant\u2019s condition was peculiar to his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this medical report, authored by a Dr. Johnathan Forman, should have been stricken, we still find adequate support in the record for the Industrial Commission\u2019s findings. While Dr. Forman\u2019s report was the only document that used the word \u201cpeculiar,\u201d other medical reports provide some evidence that claimant\u2019s chronic condition was peculiar to his work where he had a long exposure to dust, fumes and vapors, and that the claimant had a greater risk of contracting bronchitis and emphysema and in a different manner than did the public generally. For example, a report by Dr. Ernest P. Molchany stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u201cThis is to certify that Ralph A. Shearer suffers from chronic bronchitis and emphysema which render him totally disabled and unable to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u201cThe end result of such an infirmity cannot possibly pinpoint the exact irritant. From the patient\u2019s history, however, he describes long exposure to cement dust which must, therefore, be presumed as the cause of his lung pathology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANk\">Furthermore, a medical report by Dr. David L. Miller notes that claimant stated that he \u201cwas exposed to dust, smoke, brick dust, cement dust and \u2018all kinds of gases,\u2019 \u201d and concludes by stating, \u201cthat this man is disabled because of broncho-obstructive disease, secondary to his work exposure and allergy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In addition to this medical evidence, claimant\u2019s own affidavit and an affidavit of a co-worker corroborative of claimant\u2019s description of working conditions establish an exposure by claimant to \u201ccement dust, cement cuttings***other contact with cement***silica dust, coal dust, brick dust, clay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>dust, open hearth dust, steel dust, blast furnace dust, gas fumes, sulphur fumes, torch welding fumes, and other types of injurious fumes and dust,\u201d during his employment with Republic Steel. The affidavits further illustrate that this array of dust, fumes, and gases was encountered in claimant\u2019s position as a carpenter in repair and maintenance operations. Claimant\u2019s exposure to these various substances throughout the plant, by virtue of his special duties as a carpenter, clearly exceeded that to which the public, and employees in general, are normally subjected.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Accordingly, we find that there was some evidence to support the Industrial Commission\u2019s finding and that all the criteria established by <em>Ohio Bell Telephone </em>v. <em>Krise, supra, </em>were satisfied. The judgment of the Court of Appeals denying the writ of mandamus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-7\">Celebrezze, C. J., Herbert, W.
