Lehmann, </em>v. <em>Cmich </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St. 2d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Here, as in <em>State, ex rel. Adler, </em>v. <em>Court </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 1, decided this day, there is no question of the jurisdiction of the court to hear the pending case. The Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Juvenile Division, has jurisdiction to proceed to disposition of a case charging a violation of R. C. 2151.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Further, appellant\u2019s allegations do not support any unauthorized usurpation of judicial power nor do they show that appeal is not an adequate remedy at law herein. See <em>Adler, supra, </em>and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">For reasons of the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of Appeals dismissing the complaint in prohibition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-8\">Celebrezze, C.
