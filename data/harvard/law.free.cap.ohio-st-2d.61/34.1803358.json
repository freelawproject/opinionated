C. 2907.02) and three counts of corruption of a minor (R. C. 2907.04). On direct appeal, the Court of Appeals upheld respondent\u2019s decision not to permit relator to withdraw his guilty pleas, and affirmed his convictions. This court, in case No. 78-559, on October 6,1978, denied relator\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, for the reason that no substantial constitutional question existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">Relator is not entitled to copies of the records at state expense since he has exhausted his state remedies and has no appeal from his convictions pending. See <em>State, ex rel. Catlino, </em>v. <em>Clerk of Courts </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St. 2d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals denying the writ of procedendo is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-17\">Celebrezze, C.
