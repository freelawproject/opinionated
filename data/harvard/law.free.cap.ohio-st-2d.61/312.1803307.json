See <em>Sorin </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 177. Appellant alleges that he is authorized to recover attorney\u2019s fees by R. C. 4123.519 and 2731.11. Neither statute is applicable, however. R. C. 4123.519 authorizes the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in an <em>appeal </em>from the <em>decision </em>of the Industrial Commission. R. C. 2731.11 authorizes a court to award damages in a mandamus action. Appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable as damages. See <em>State, ex rel. Grosser, </em>v. <em>Boy </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Appellant alleges further that he is entitled to recover his attorney\u2019s fees for the mandamus action because it was necessitated by the commission\u2019s \u201cbad faith, vexatious, wanton, obdurate or oppressive\u201d actions. We hold, however, that appellant has not borne his burden of proof to establish any improper action by the commission. Thus, we do not decide whether such actions, if proven, would entitle one to recover attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-9\">Celebrezze, C. J., Herbert, W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney, Locher and Holmes, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
