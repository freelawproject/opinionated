In essence, appellant asserts that it can not be held in contempt for failing to issue a continuing contract of employment when the complaint in mandamus filed by the appellee prayed for only the issuance of \u201ca written contract of employment for the academic year 1976-77***.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">It is rudimentary that contempt will be excused by either actual or substantial compliance with a mandamus order. See <em>State, ex rel. </em>v. <em>Crites </em>(1891), 48 Ohio St. 460; <em>State, ex rel. Maple, </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1912), 19 C. C. (N.S.) 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">The record of the mandamus action is void of any mention of a \u201ccontinuing contract.\u201d Rather, the mandamus order specifically directs the issuance of a \u201ccontract of employment for the 1976-77 academic year.\u201d The court\u2019s order of July 5, 1977, was couched in the words of appellee\u2019s prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>As noted in the facts herein, it is undisputed that appellant has paid appellee the amount due her for the 1976-1977 academic school year. Thereafter, the appellant, in full compliance with R. C. 3319.11, notified appellee of its intention not to reemploy her.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Accordingly, we hold that appellant did substantially comply with the mandamus order as specifically worded, by paying her the amount due for the 1976-1977 academic year. Therefore, we hold that appellant is not in contempt and that its first proposition of law is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Appellant asserts two additional propositions of law which do not merit discussion or review due to our holding as to its first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-8\">Celebrezze, C.
