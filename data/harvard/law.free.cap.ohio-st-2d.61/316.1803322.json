The record demonstrates however that relator has submitted a certified copy of respondent\u2019s conviction for the willful failure to file a federal income tax return in violation of Section 7203, Title 26, U. S. Code, a conviction which is now final. Prior cases of this court have consistently indicated that this fact is sufficient to support a finding that the attorney involved has violated DR 1-102(A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility, thereby warranting that attorney\u2019s indefinite suspension from the practice of law in this state. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Pandilidis, supra; Cincinnati Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Beall, supra; Ohio State Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 57, 341 N.E. 2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">It is contended as an additional ground upon which this court should depart from the standard of discipline enunciated in <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Stein, supra, </em>and its progeny, that the extenuating circumstances surrounding respondent\u2019s conviction distinguishes the instant matter from prior cases. In <em>Columbus Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Dixon </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St. 2d 76, 77, 320 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>N.E. 2d 293, it is stated that \u201cefforts to distinguish cases of this nature on other than clear-cut grounds serve only to prolong the uncertainty and anguish already besetting those under investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Although we are not unmindful of the unfortunate circumstances which often accompany this area of discipline, including those in the cause <em>sub judice, </em>we are of the view that the fundamental principles of ethical conduct embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility are best served by the discipline announced in <em>Stein, supra. </em>The rationale for that discipline bears repeating. <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Stein, supra, </em>states, at page 81:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cOne of the fundamental tenets of the professional responsibility of a lawyer is that he should maintain a degree of personal and professional integrity that meets the highest standard. The integrity of the profession can be maintained only if the conduct of the individual attorney is above reproach. He should refrain from any illegal conduct. Anything short of this lessens public confidence in the legal profession\u2014because obedience to the law exemplifies respect for the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">DR 1-102 (A) admonishes, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u201cA lawyer shall not:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\"><em>U </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">\u201c(5) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u201c(6) Engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">Upon examination of the record in this proceeding, we find that respondent has violated DR 1-102 (A) (5) and (6) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and he is, therefore, indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-14\">Celebrezze, C.
