On October 19, 1995, the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final judgment against Empire in the amount of $615,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">On December 4, 1995, after final judgment had been filed in the District Court of the State of Nebraska (the state where Empire is incorporated) Empire filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) and (6), M.R.Civ.P. Empire claimed that Roberts\u2019 complaint was misfiled through mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect and, in the alternative, that relief should be granted due to the extraordinary circumstances of the case, including the substantial amount of money awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On February 2, 1996, the District Court set aside the default judgment and on February 20, 1996, the court entered its memorandum in support of order. The District Court stated that Rule 60(b)(1), M.R.Civ.P., \u201cprovides a basic correction system for protecting the legal process from errors caused by neglect, inadvertence, and mistake\u2014 clearly, improper foundations upon which to base legal judgments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAk\">On February 5, 1996, Roberts filed a notice of appeal with this Court and on March 28, 1996, Empire filed a motion to dismiss Roberts\u2019 appeal for lack of jurisdiction, claiming that an order granting a motion to vacate a default judgment is nonappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Rule 1, M.R.App.P., provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">(b) In civil cases a party aggrieved may appeal from a judgment or order, except when expressly made final by law, in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">(2) ... from any special order made after final judgment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQj\">Empire relies on <em>Shields v. Pirkle Refrigerated Freightlines </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 37, 591 P.2d 1120, and <em>Kinion v. Design Systems, Inc., </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 226, 620 P.2d 852. In <em>Shields </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">In all this long history, the appealability of orders granting motions to set aside default judgments has never been specifically ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>tioned. We find no Montana cases holding that such orders may be appealed from. There is, however, dictum to the effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><em>Shields, </em>591 P.2d at 1122. The <em>Shields </em>Court noted such dictum in <em>State ex rel. Deck v. District Court, </em>(1922), 64 Mont. 110, 207 P. 1004, where we stated that \u201c[a]n order setting aside or refusing to vacate a default judgment is a special order made after final judgment within the meaning of the statute\u201d <em>Deck, </em>207 P. at 1005. One year later in <em>Kinion </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">In <em>[Shields] </em>we specifically held that an order vacating a default a default judgment is only appealable as a final judgment under Rule 1, M.R.App.Civ.P., if the result of the order is to finally dispose of the case. In the present case the order vacating the default judgment left the case pending in the Cascade County District Court for a trial on the merits. As a result, no final judgment was entered, the District Court order was interlocutory and the appeal is not properly before this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>Kinion, </em>620 P.2d at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Roberts argues that the District Court\u2019s damages judgment was a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d and that the court\u2019s order granting Empire\u2019s motion for relief from judgment was a \u201cspecial order made after final judgment.\u201d Thus, according to Roberts, this Court has jurisdiction to consider his appeal. Roberts relies on <em>In re Marriage of Rex </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 328, 649 P.2d 460, and <em>In re Marriage of Martin </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 95, 874 P.2d 1219. In Rex we stated that \u201c[a]n appeal from any special order made after final judgment includes an order setting aside or refusing to vacate a default judgment.\u201d Rex, 649 P.2d at 461. Likewise, in <em>Martin </em>we stated that \u201c[a]n order made after final judgment setting aside or refusing to vacate a default judgment is a special order\u201d. <em>Martin, </em>874 P.2d at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Rex and <em>Martin </em>do not reference or distinguish the <em>Shields </em>rule, and as a result there is confusion in this area as to whether an order setting aside a default judgment is appealable under Rule 1(b)(2), M.R.App.P. We take this opportunity to clarify this area and find that Rex and <em>Martin </em>more accurately reflect the plain language of Rule 1(b)(2), M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">In the present case, final judgment on liability and damages was entered against Empire and the District Court\u2019s order setting aside the default judgment was a special order made after final judgment. We therefore conclude, based on the clear language of Rule 1(b)(2), M.R.App.P, that this Court has jurisdiction over Roberts\u2019 appeal from the District Court\u2019s order setting aside the default judgment. To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>extent <em>Shields </em>and <em>Kinion </em>are inconsistent with this opinion and order they are hereby overruled. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Empire\u2019s motion to dismiss Roberts\u2019 appeal for lack of jurisdiction is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The Clerk is directed to mail copies of this order to counsel of record and to the Clerk ofCourtfor the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">DATED this 23rd day of April, 1996.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-7\">/S/J.A.TURNAGE</judges>\n<judges id=\"AqZi\">/S/ CHARLES E.
