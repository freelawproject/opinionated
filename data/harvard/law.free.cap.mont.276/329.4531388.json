Smith (Estate) appeals from the judgment entered by the Second Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County, on its order dismissing the Estate\u2019s complaint with prejudice. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">The issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in dismissing the Estate\u2019s complaint with prejudice pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">This is the second time that this case has been before us on appeal. The facts underlying the Estate\u2019s complaint are set forth in <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow County </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 1, 878 P.2d 870, and need not be repeated here. In <em>Smith, </em>the primary issues on appeal related to prosecutorial immunity and amendment of pleadings; we reversed the District Court on the former issue and affirmed it on the latter. <em>Smith </em>also presented the issue of whether the District Court erred in dismissing the Estate\u2019s action without prejudice under Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P, for failure to comply with its orders compelling discovery and requiring a psychological examination of Richard Smith\u2019s children. <em>Smith, </em>878 P.2d at 876. We declined to address the propriety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that dismissal due to the inadequacy of the record and the court\u2019s language indicating that it dismissed without prejudice in order to facilitate our review of rulings not appealable under Rule 1, M.R.App.P. <em>Smith, </em>878 P.2d at 877. We vacated the order of dismissal without precluding the availability on remand of further proceedings on that issue. <em>Smith, </em>878 P.2d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">On remand, Butte-Silver Bow County (County) again moved the District Court to dismiss the Estate\u2019s complaint based on the alleged discovery abuses which were the basis of the earlier dismissal. The District Court denied the County\u2019s motion on February 21, 1995, and, in doing so, rejected the County\u2019s reliance on discovery abuses alleged to have occurred prior to the appeal. The court gave the Estate thirty days from the date of its order denying the motion to dismiss \u201cto adequately answer or supplement the discovery requests\u201d and required the Estate to \u201c[p]rovide complete answers to all unanswered interrogatories and fully disclose all experts, their opinions and the basis for those opinions in accordance with Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P.\u201d The court warned that \u201c[i]f this order is not fully complied with, then the court will be left with no other alternative but to dismiss this case with prejudice or impose other appropriate sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On February 24, 1995, the Estate moved for an order of clarification, requesting the District Court to specifically list \u201cany further evidence\u201d to be provided to the County. Approximately ten days later, the Estate provided the County with \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Rule 26(b)(4) Disclosure\u201d stating that the opinions of its expert witnesses were based on facts and materials set forth in their depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The District Court issued an order of clarification and memorandum (hereinafter \u201cclarification order\u201d) directing the Estate to provide to the County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">1. The names of individuals who provided care to the minor children from January 1, 1989 through June, 1991;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">2. Information about Richard Smith\u2019s Social Security Benefit Claim for a leg injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">3. Information about [the Estate\u2019s] expert witnesses, their opinions and basis for them or in the alternative this Court must reopen the depositions of [the Estate\u2019s] experts to answer questions about the basis of their opinions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">In response to the clarification order, the Estate provided the required information regarding the children\u2019s caregivers and the leg injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>claim. With regard to the expert witness information, the Estate stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">[the Estate] has previously supplied information about it\u2019s [sic] expert witnesses to the [County]. This may have been overlooked by the court. The information previously supplied by [the Estate] complies fully with Rule 26, MRCP. Another copy of that information is provided to the court herewith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In June of 1995, the County moved to dismiss the Estate\u2019s complaint pursuant to Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., for alleged discovery abuses. The District Court granted the County\u2019s motion and subsequently entered judgment dismissing the Estate\u2019s complaint with prejudice. The Estate appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion in dismissing the Estate\u2019s complaint with prejudice pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C), M.R.Civ.P.?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">It is important at the outset to recognize the salutary purposes underlying the availability of Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., sanctions for discovery abuses and the respective roles of the district courts in imposing \u2014 and this Court in reviewing \u2014 such sanctions. While trial courts traditionally were reluctant to impose discovery-related sanctions, concerns relating to crowded dockets and the overall responsibility for maintaining fair and efficient judicial administration had reversed that trend by the 1970s. <em>See Owen v. F.A. Buttrey, Co. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 274, 277-78, 627 P.2d 1233, 1235. Indeed, since 1981, it has been this Court\u2019s position that dilatory abuse of discovery must no longer be dealt with leniently and that the transgressors of discovery abuses should be punished rather than encouraged repeatedly to cooperate. <em>See Owen, </em>627 P.2d at 1235. \u2018When litigants use willful delay, evasive response, and disregard of court discretion as part and parcel of their trial strategy, they must suffer the consequences.\u201d <em>Owen, </em>627 P.2d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., provides trial courts with a means to prevent an excessive back-log of cases. <em>See Dassori v. Roy Stanley Chevrolet Co. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 178, 180, 728 P.2d 430, 431. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">[t]he trial judge is in the best position to know ... which parties callously disregard the rights of their opponents and other litigants seeking their day in court[] [and] is also in the best position to determine which sanction is the most appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-10\"><em>Dassori, </em>728 P.2d at 431. As a result, we generally defer to the decision of the trial court regarding Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., sanctions. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>Eisenmenger v. Ethicon, Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 393, 402, 871 P.2d 1313, 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Here, the District Court determined that the Estate failed to comply with its post-remand orders requiring disclosure of expert opinion information in compliance with Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P., and dismissed the Estate\u2019s complaint with prejudice. We review a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions for discovery abuses to determine if the court abused its discretion. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1319 (citing <em>First Bank (N.A.)-Billings v. Heidema </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 373, 711 P.2d 1384).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\n<em>DISCOVERY ABUSE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Before discussing the propriety of the District Court\u2019s imposition of sanctions under Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., it is necessary to address the Estate\u2019s contention on appeal that no discovery abuse exists in this case. The Estate contends that the only information not provided to the County was the amount of time one of its expert witnesses, Dr. Paul F. Cimmino, spent researching for this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P., provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8o\">[a] party may through interrogatories require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to <em>state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">(Emphasis added). In its order of dismissal and accompanying memorandum, the District Court concluded that \u201c1) [the Estate] did not provide the substance of facts which [sic] the experts were expected to testify; and 2) [the Estate] omitted a summary of the grounds for each opinion\u201d in violation of its order and Rule 26(b)(4), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The Montana legislature adopted this rule from Rule 26, Fed.R.Civ.P. <em>See </em>Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P., Compiler\u2019s Comments. The underlying policies of Rule 26 are to eliminate surprise and to promote effective cross-examination of expert witnesses. <em>See Smith v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(10th Cir. 1980), 626 F.2d 784, 792-93 (citing 28 U.S.C., Rule 26, Fed.R.Civ.P., Advisory Committee Notes).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">\n<em>Before an attorney can even hope to deal on cross-examination with an unfavorable expert opinion he must have some idea of the bases of that opinion and the data relied upon. If the attorney is required to await examination at trial to get this information, he often will </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\n<em>have too little time to recognize and expose vulnerable spots in the testimony.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><em>Smith, </em>626 F.2d at 794 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Review of the Estate\u2019s Rule 26 disclosure reflects that the Estate identified each person it expects to call as an expert witness and stated the general subject matter on which each expert is expected to testify as required by Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P. The District Court did not conclude, and the County does not argue, otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Regarding the \u201csubstance of facts\u201d to which its expert witnesses are expected to testify, the Estate provided the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">1. Dr. Ruey-Lin Lin... will testify that the decedent herein was not a hard-core criminal, had a relatively minor history, and would have rehabilitated himself, or been rehabilitated, at or near the age of thirty-five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">2. Thomas Rozza ... will testify that the Defendant\u2019s county attorney failed to meet acceptable corrections standards in protecting the decedent\u2019s life, and that the Defendant\u2019s jail failed to meet acceptable corrections standards in protecting the decedent\u2019s life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">3. Dr. Paul Cimmino ... will testify that, had the decedent lived, any antisocial aspects of his personality would have lessened and been brought under control... [and] his abuse of drugs and alcohol would have been brought under control. He will also testify as to the loss suffered by the children upon the death of their father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">4. Dr. John Brower ... will testify as to the present value of the earnings the decedent might have expected, had he lived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">These broad statements indicate the general topics on which the Estate\u2019s experts are expected to testify. They do not, however, provide the <em>substance of facts </em>to which the Estate\u2019s expert witnesses will testify, as required by Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">Concerning the bases of its expert witnesses\u2019 opinions, the Estate stated in its Rule 26 disclosure that those opinions are based upon the \u201cfacts and information set forth in [their] deposition [s] which [are] in the possession of [the County], and upon [their] training and experience.\u201d The Estate also referred the County generally to the treatises upon which its expert witnesses relied. The Estate did not provide any further explanation or information concerning the bases or grounds for its expert witnesses\u2019 opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">These statements by the Estate add nothing to \u201cthe substance of the facts\u201d and the \u201csummary of the grounds for each opinion\u201d which are required to be disclosed by Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>over, nothing in Rule 26, M.R.Civ.P., permits a party to decline to comply with the Rule and a court order requiring compliance therewith on the basis of that party\u2019s belief or opinion that the opposing party already possesses the required information.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Having submitted its disclosure, the Estate obtained the court\u2019s clarification order explicitly requiring it to provide its experts\u2019 opinions and the bases for those opinions. The District Court expressly noted therein that \u201c[w]hile [the County] previously deposed [the Estate\u2019s] experts, [the Estate\u2019s] attorney at the depositions of certain experts instructed the experts not to answer relevant questions about the basis of their opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Estate did not provide any additional information relating to its expert witnesses in response to the District Court\u2019s clarification order. Instead, it merely stated that it had previously supplied the required information regarding those witnesses to the County and that the information supplied \u201ccomplies fully with Rule 26, MRCP[;]\u201d it referred the court to its \u201cRule 26(b)(4) Disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">This final response essentially ignored the clarification order which the Estate requested and received, and totally failed to comply therewith. In light of the court\u2019s clear awareness that the expert witness depositions had been taken, and the court\u2019s clear determination that those depositions had not produced the required information about the bases of the experts\u2019 opinions, the Estate\u2019s response appropriately could be characterized \u2014 in the vernacular \u2014 as \u201cin your face.\u201d Whatever counsel\u2019s intent in framing his client\u2019s response to a clear court order may have been \u2014 whether gamesmanship with the County or disdainful \u201cone-upmanship\u201d with the District Court \u2014 the Estate\u2019s response did not comply with the explicit requirements of the court\u2019s clarification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">We conclude that the Estate\u2019s expert-related responses to the District Court\u2019s initial order on remand satisfied neither the \u201csubstance of the facts\u201d requirement nor the \u201csummary of the grounds for each opinion\u201d requirement of Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P. We also conclude that the Estate\u2019s response to the District Court\u2019s clarification order totally failed to comply with the expert witness-related portion of that order. Therefore, we hold that the Estate committed discovery abuses after remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\n<em>REVIEW OF SANCTIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>If a party ... fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, ... the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just and among others the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMU\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">(C) An order ... dismissing the action ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">After concluding that the Estate failed to obey its clarification order, the District Court dismissed the Estate\u2019s complaint with prejudice. We review the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the Estate\u2019s complaint pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C), M.R.Civ.P., to determine if the court abused its discretion. <em>See Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Acknowledging both the discretionary nature of a trial court\u2019s decisions on sanctions for discovery abuse and the availability of the dismissal sanction under Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., the Estate argues that dismissal was an abuse of the District Court\u2019s discretion under these facts. It relies on the District Court\u2019s statement accompanying the clarification order that, in the event the Estate failed to provide the expert-related information to the County, the court would reopen the Estate\u2019s expert witness depositions. The County, on the other hand, relies on <em>Eisenmenger, </em>and <em>Landauer v. Kehrwald </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 322, 732 P.2d 839, in urging us to accord proper deference to the District Court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice. The County also contends that the instant case presents a more compelling case for the dismissal sanction than <em>Eisenmenger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\"><em>Eisenmenger </em>and <em>Landauer </em>clearly stand for the proposition that we generally defer to the decision of the district court regarding the appropriate sanction for discovery abuses. <em>See Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1319; <em>Landauer, </em>732 P.2d at 840. Those cases, however, are factually distinguishable from the present case and do not mandate a conclusion that the sanction of dismissal was properly applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">In <em>Eisenmenger, </em>a broken suture following surgery caused the plaintiff to have a stroke and suffer other severe complications. The plaintiff filed a medical malpractice claim against the doctor and hospital and a products liability claim against Ethicon, Inc. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1315. In 1988, Dr. Olcott, who later became Ethicon\u2019s expert witness, reviewed the Eisenmenger case and generally advised Ethicon\u2019s counsel of his opinions regarding the doctor and hospital\u2019s possible culpability in the case based on certain acts and decisions. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">In June of 1990, Ethicon responded to a detailed discovery request from the plaintiff. Despite the plaintiff\u2019s request that Ethicon set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>forth the factors it contended contributed to the broken suture and the plaintiff\u2019s resulting stroke, Ethicon failed to disclose the opinions provided by Dr. Olcott two years earlier. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1319. Indeed, Ethicon did not disclose Dr. Olcott as a potential expert witness until August of 1991. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1319. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the doctor and hospital approximately six months later. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Ethicon did not make Dr. Olcott available for deposition until one month after the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the doctor and hospital. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1321. The plaintiff then deposed Dr. Olcott, and his testimony supported a theory that the doctor or the hospital could have caused the broken suture. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1315. The plaintiff subsequently moved the district court for sanctions against Ethicon pursuant to Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., for its failure to disclose this relevant information in discovery requests dating back to 1988. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The district court determined that Ethicon made a \u201cknowing concealment\u201d of the expert\u2019s testimony and stated that, had Dr. Olcott\u2019s testimony been available, it was \u201cvery doubtful\u201d that the doctor, and hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment would have been granted. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1315. Concluding that the plaintiff had suffered extreme prejudice due to Ethicon\u2019s discovery abuses, the district court entered a default judgment against Ethicon on the issue of liability. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In reviewing the propriety of the default sanction, we set forth at some length the record before us regarding Ethicon\u2019s failure to timely disclose Dr. Olcott\u2019s opinions, update discovery responses or make Dr. Olcott available for deposition. On the basis of that record, we determined that \u201csevere prejudice had already occurred to [the plaintiff], and the [district] court had few options for appropriate and meaningful sanctions against Ethicon.\u201d <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1321. We also determined that the record supported the district court\u2019s finding that Ethicon\u2019s failure to respond to discovery requests was willful and in bad faith and caused severe prejudice to the plaintiff on an issue central to the case. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1321. We held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in entering a default judgment on the issue of liability against Ethicon. <em>Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Thus, in <em>Eisenmenger, </em>the plaintiff was foreclosed from seeking compensation from two potentially responsible parties due to Ethi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>con\u2019s \u201cknowing concealment\u201d of Dr. Olcott\u2019s opinion. As a result of Ethicon\u2019s egregious conduct, the plaintiff was severely prejudiced. <em>See Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1321. Under such extreme circumstances, no other sanction could have remedied the severe prejudice suffered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Here, we are not confronted with the extreme and irreparable circumstances which existed in <em>Eisenmenger. </em>Certainly any incidental prejudice to the County due to delay and the necessity of repeated motions does not rise to the level of extreme prejudice suffered by the plaintiff in <em>Eisenmenger. </em>Moreover, unlike <em>Eisenmenger, </em>sanctions other than dismissal were available in this case to remedy the limited prejudice to the County. Indeed, the District Court provided for one such sanction when it stated that it would reopen the Estate\u2019s expert witness depositions as an alternative to the Estate providing the ordered expert-related information. In addition, upon reopening the depositions, the District Court could have required the Estate to pay the expenses incurred by the County as a result. <em>See </em>Rule 37(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Finally, Ethicon\u2019s \u201cknowing concealment\u201d in <em>Eisenmenger </em>was far more egregious than the Estate\u2019s inadequate Rule 26 disclosure and response to the District Court\u2019s clarification order in this case. In <em>Eisenmenger, </em>Ethicon totally concealed Dr. Olcott\u2019s opinion <em>(see Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1321) and, as a direct result, the plaintiff was foreclosed from pursuing a viable claim against the doctor and hospital. Here, the Estate disclosed the identity of its expert witnesses and the general topics on which they are expected to testify at trial. Thus, although the Estate\u2019s conduct in this case clearly violated the court\u2019s order of clarification and is strongly disapproved, it does not rise to the level of discovery-related misconduct present in <em>Eisenmenger. </em>Since neither the nature or extent of discovery abuse nor the resulting prejudice is of the magnitude of that present in <em>Eisenmenger, Eisenmenger </em>does not compel a conclusion that imposition of the dismissal sanction was appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In <em>Landauer, </em>the plaintiff filed a claim against the defendant to recover lost rental income. The defendant served requests for production of the plaintiff\u2019s federal and state income tax returns for specified years. <em>Landauer, </em>732 P.2d at 839. When the plaintiff did not provide the returns, the defendant filed a motion to compel production. The district court ordered the plaintiff to produce the returns within twenty days and the plaintiff failed to comply. <em>Landauer, </em>732 P.2d at 840. The defendant again moved the court to compel production. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>court ordered the plaintiff to provide the returns within ten days and warned that failure to comply would result in dismissal of his complaint with prejudice. <em>Landauer, </em>732 P.2d at 840. The plaintiff timely produced his federal, but not his state, returns and the district court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint with prejudice pursuant to Rule 37(b), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Landauer, </em>732 P.2d at 840. We determined that, under those circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. <em>Landauer, </em>732 P.2d at 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Similar to the district court in <em>Landauer, </em>the District Court in this case warned in its initial post-remand order that if the Estate failed to comply, \u201cthen the court will be left with no other alternative but to dismiss this case with prejudice or impose other appropriate sanctions.\u201d However, the Estate then moved the District Court to clarify that order and the court issued a clarification order wherein it modified its prior warning, at least with regard to the expert witness information, by requiring that the Estate provide the expert-related information \u201cor in the alternative this Court must reopen the depositions of [the Estate\u2019s] experts to answer questions about the basis of their opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The record before us demonstrates that the Estate provided two of the three categories of information set forth in the District Court\u2019s clarification order; it also provided part of the ordered expert witness information. Notwithstanding its specific warning of the sanction which would result from the Estate\u2019s failure to provide the ordered expert-related information, however, the District Court dismissed the Estate\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Thus, in both <em>Landauer </em>and the present case, the parties were expressly warned of the consequences for failure to comply with the court\u2019s discovery-related order. In <em>Landauer, </em>the district court imposed the consequence of which it had warned \u2014 dismissal with prejudice \u2014 and we determined that the court had not abused its discretion. <em>See Landauer, </em>732 P.2d at 841. In this case, however, the District Court imposed consequences much more severe than those of which it had expressly warned. <em>Landauer </em>does not, therefore, compel a conclusion that the sanction of dismissal with prejudice was appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">We reaffirm our policy that, in reviewing the imposition of Rule 37 sanctions, we generally must defer to the decision of the district court. <em>See Eisenmenger, </em>871 P.2d at 1319. When parties fail to comply with court orders enforcing the rules of discovery, they must suffer the consequences. <em>See Owen, </em>627 P.2d at 1236. The extent of the \u201cconse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>quences\u201d imposed by a district court, however, should relate to the extent and nature of the actual discovery abuse and the extent of the prejudice to the opposing party which results therefrom. Moreover, where a court expressly warns of the consequences to follow from a party\u2019s failure to comply, the court should impose sanctions accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Here, the Estate\u2019s failure to comply with ordered discovery was totally insupportable, but relatively limited, as was the prejudice to the County. Thus, the dismissal sanction bears little relationship to the nature and extent of the discovery abuse and the resulting prejudice in this case. Most importantly, the District Court\u2019s imposition of the ultimate sanction of dismissal was a marked, and significant, departure from the specific consequences of which it had elected to warn the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Discovery abuse tactics, especially in this era of crowded dockets, deprive other litigants of an opportunity to use the courts as a serious dispute-settlement mechanism. <em>See First Bank (N.A.)-Billings, </em>711 P.2d at 1386 (quoting <em>G-K Properties v. Redevelopment Agency, Etc. </em>(9th Cir. 1978), 577 F.2d 645, 647). Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., provides a necessary tool for district courts to manage crowded dockets. Dismissal of an action with prejudice, however, is the \u201cmost severe in the spectrum of sanctions provided by statute or rule[;] ... [it] must be available to the district court <em>in appropriate cases </em>....\u201d <em>National Hockey League et al. v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., et al. </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 639, 643, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 49 L.Ed.2d 747, 751 (emphasis added). Such a severe sanction is inappropriate where, as here, the court has stated in its order that the sanction for noncompliance will be something other than dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The District Court\u2019s frustration with the Estate\u2019s attorney is evident in its order of dismissal and entirely understandable. This case, only one of hundreds on the District Court\u2019s docket, has consumed a great deal of the court\u2019s resources for more than five years and the discovery phase apparently remains uncompleted. Under the record before us, however, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in dismissing the Estate\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">:|: * *</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b360-10\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"A54i\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>I concur with our conclusion that, under the narrow circumstances here, imposition of the ultimate sanction of dismissal of the Estate\u2019s cause of action with prejudice was too severe a sanction given the precise nature of the Estate\u2019s discovery abuses. In my own mind, however, this case presents an extremely close call and I sincerely sympathize with the trial court and opposing counsel who have had to bear the frustration of the Estate\u2019s attorney\u2019s approach to discovery and the trial court\u2019s orders \u2014 correctly characterized in our decision as \u201cin your face\u201d and totally insupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Moreover, while perhaps implicit in our opinion, reopening the Estate\u2019s experts\u2019 depositions at the Estate\u2019s expense is not the only remaining sanction available to the District Court under Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P. To the contrary, there are a variety of sanctions under the Rule which the trial court might discretionarily impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Finally, if, after all this, counsel for the Estate continues to persist in his intransigent approach, I would not preclude the imposition of the sanction of dismissal with prejudice. Further warnings are unnecessary. Accordingly, I specially concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
