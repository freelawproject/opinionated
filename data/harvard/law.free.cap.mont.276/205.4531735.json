(MRI), by the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Roosevelt County. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">Sharon raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">1. Did the District Court err in applying a 25 percent minority discount in determining the value of Sharon\u2019s 600 shares of MRI stock?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">2. Did the District Court err in refusing to award Sharon attorney fees and costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">MRI is a Montana corporation, originally incorporated in 1965. MRI owns agricultural real estate and improvements in Roosevelt County, Montana. In 1992, Thomas McCann owned 1200 of the 2400 shares of MRI stock. In that year, Thomas and Sharon McCann divorced after a thirty-seven-year marriage. Pursuant to their Colorado divorce decree, Sharon was awarded one-half of Thomas\u2019s MRI stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">Shortly after the McCanns\u2019 1992 divorce, MRI, acting through its board of directors, decided to pay off two outstanding debts to Florian and Virginia McCann. The directors in turn determined that MRI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>would stop paying dividends to MRI shareholders as it had done in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">The shareholders then reincorporated MRI to make it a Montana statutory close corporation, which designation carries with it a restriction on the alienability of corporate stock. Sharon, as a shareholder of MRI, voted against the amended articles of incorporation. Sharon was not notified by MRI that she was entitled to assert dissenter\u2019s rights as required by \u00a7 35-9-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">MRI had leased its land and improvements to Robert Anderson since 1978. The initial lease was for seven years. Before the first lease expired, MRI renewed the lease for an additional ten years. In 1993, after the filing of this lawsuit, but prior to the final disposition in District Court, MRI again renewed the Anderson lease for an additional ten years. When the lease was renewed in 1993, approximately ten months remained on the existing lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Following a brief and unsuccessful series of negotiations between MRI and Sharon concerning MRI\u2019s purchase of Sharon\u2019s shares, MRI instituted this lawsuit pursuant to the Montana Declaratory Judgment Act. MRI asked the District Court to determine the value of Sharon\u2019s 600 shares of MRI stock and compel the sale of said stock to MRI. Sharon and MRI stipulated to allow the District Court, sitting in equity, to determine the value of Sharon\u2019s shares. Sharon agreed to transfer her shares of stock to MRI upon MRI\u2019s payment to her of the court-determined value of her stock. The stipulation read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGW\">Subject to the parties\u2019 right to appeal the amount of the Court\u2019s valuation determination and any evidentiary irregularities occurring during the conduct of the trial, the parties agree and stipulate as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">1. The Court may exercise its equitable powers to grant equitable relief by declaring the value of Sharon Quigley-McCann\u2019s shares and ordering the sale of the shares to occur;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">2. Sharon Quigley-McCann agrees to sell and McCann Ranch agrees to purchase Sharon Quigley-McCann\u2019s 600 shares in McCann Ranch in the amount determined by the Court to be the value of the shares;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">3. The Court\u2019s valuation of Sharon Quigley-McCann\u2019s shares shall be binding on the parties [.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Following a two-day trial, the District Court determined the value of Sharon\u2019s shares to be $162,144. This valuation was established by applying a 25 percent minority discount to Sharon\u2019s interest in MRI. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The court refused to grant either party attorney fees. The court did, however, add MRI\u2019s litigation expenses to the value of the corporation prior to calculating Sharon\u2019s share of the corporate assets, under the rationale that Sharon, as a quarter owner of MRI, should not be required to pay for MRI\u2019s litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Section 3-2-204(5), MCA, sets forth this Court\u2019s standard for reviewing equitable cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">In equity cases and in matters and proceedings of an equitable nature, the supreme court shall review all questions of fact arising upon the evidence presented in the record, whether the same be presented by specifications of particulars in which the evidence is alleged to be insufficient or not, and determine the same, as well as questions of law, unless for good cause a new trial or the taking of further evidence in the court below be ordered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We have determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">review of findings of fact in an equitable case must comply with not only \u00a7 3-2-204(5), MCA, but also with Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P., which requires that findings of fact be upheld unless they are clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\"><em>Westfall v. Anderson </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 113, 115, 795 P.2d 976, 977 (citing <em>Rase v. Castle Mountain Ranch, Inc. </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 209, 216, 631 P.2d 680, 684). A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Interstate Production Credit v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Did the District Court err in applying a 25 percent minority interest discount in determining the value of Sharon\u2019s 600 shares of MRI stock?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Sharon argues that the District Court should not have applied a 25 percent discount in calculating the value of her shares. She argues that pursuant to \u00a7 35-9-501, MCA, a shareholder may petition the court for relief if the actions of a Montana statutory close corporation were illegal, oppressive, fraudulent, or unfairly prejudicial. The relief available includes the purchase of the petitioner\u2019s shares at \u201cfair value.\u201d Section 35-9-503(2), MCA. Sharon maintains that MRI\u2019s conduct was illegal, oppressive, fraudulent and unfairly prejudicial and she is therefore entitled to \u201cfair value\u201d which she further main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tains is the value of the stock without application of the 25 percent discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">Sharon also contends that the court erred in applying the 25 percent discount to the value of her stock by refusing to apply the dissenter\u2019s rights provisions of Montana\u2019s codes. Section 35-9-103(2), MCA, states that when a corporation reincorporates to become a statutory close corporation, any individual voting against close corporation status may assert dissenter\u2019s rights pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 35-1-826 through -839, MCA. Section 35-1-827, MCA, states that when a shareholder dissents, the shareholder may obtain \u201cfair value\u201d of his or her shares from the corporation. Section 35-1-829(1), MCA, provides that when a shareholder will be entitled to dissenter\u2019s rights, the corporation must notify the shareholder that he or she may assert dissenter\u2019s rights prior to the vote of the shareholders. MRI did not notify Sharon of her right to assert dissenter\u2019s rights. Sharon argues that the District Court sitting in equity should have afforded her \u201cfair value\u201d for her shares of the corporation. Again, Sharon asserts that \u201cfair value\u201d means the value of her shares without application of the 25 percent discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Sharon\u2019s arguments fail for several reasons. First, in regard to her arguments under \u00a7 35-9-501, MCA, a review of the record reveals that the corporation\u2019s actions were not illegal, oppressive, fraudulent or unfairly prejudicial. The District Court correctly noted that debts MRI paid to Florian and Virginia McCann were legally binding debts which the corporation had an obligation to pay. Paying the debts did not adversely affect Sharon\u2019s distribution from MRI because payment of the debts served to reduce the indebtedness of the corporation which otherwise would have been deducted from the total value of the corporation in determining the corporation\u2019s net value.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Nor did MRI\u2019s decision to cease paying shareholder dividends violate \u00a7 35-9-501, MCA. MRI properly accounted for all monies which would have been paid as dividends. Elimination of dividends again increased MRI\u2019s net worth, which was reflected in the value of Sharon\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Renewal of the Anderson lease was clearly a business decision and not a fraudulent or oppressive act. MRI\u2019s agricultural holdings had been leased to Anderson for nearly two decades at the time of the lease renewal. The Anderson lease did not decrease the value of MRI\u2019s holdings, but instead provided financial security for MRI\u2019s shareholders. Renewal of such a lease cannot be viewed as oppressive or fraudulent. A careful review of the record does not support these or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>any other contentions that MRI acted illegally, oppressively, fraudulently or with unfair prejudice toward Sharon.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Secondly, Sharon did not institute an action pursuant to \u00a7 35-9-501, MCA. This section provides that a shareholder \u201cmay petition the district court for any of the relief described in 35-9-502 through 35-9-504[.]\u201d This action was not commenced by a petition by Sharon seeking relief as an oppressed shareholder. Rather, this action is a declaratory judgment action commenced by MRI. In the course of litigating MRI\u2019s declaratory judgment action, the parties entered into a stipulation by which the court was to determine the value of Sharon\u2019s 600 shares of MRI stock. Sharon agreed to sell and MRI agreed to purchase said shares of MRI stock at the value established by the District Court. Therefore, the subject litigation was confined to these stipulated topics, and not the relief provided in \u00a7 35-9-501, MCA, et. seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Sharon likewise did not assert her dissenter\u2019s rights nor did she institute proceedings to challenge MRI\u2019s failure to notify her of such dissenter\u2019s rights. Rather, Sharon stipulated to exchange her shares of MRI stock for a price established by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Alternatively, Sharon has not established to the satisfaction of this Court that \u201cfair value\u201d necessarily excludes an application of a minority discount. Section 35-1-826(4), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cFair value,\u201d with respect to a dissenter\u2019s shares, means <em>the value of the shares </em>immediately before the effectuation of the corporate action to which the dissenter objects, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action unless exclusion would be inequitable. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">While the corporate conduct which led to the dissenter\u2019s suit should not be considered, nothing in this section prohibits considering a minority shareholder\u2019s lack of control and the lack of marketability for minority shares when establishing \u201cfair value.\u201d Thus, the value of Sharon\u2019s 600 shares prior to the complained of conduct may still be less than one-fourth of the total assets of MRI as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">We have determined that minority discounts are appropriate under certain circumstances. In approving a 25 percent minority discount, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">A discount for a minority interest is appropriate when the minority shareholder has no ability to control salaries, dividends, profit distributions and day-to-day corporate operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-11\"><em>In re Marriage of Milesnick </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 88, 97, 765 P.2d 751, 757 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Jorgensen </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 294, 300, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>590 P.2d 606, 610). In valuing Sharon\u2019s shares, the District Court applied the specific methodology recommended by Sharon\u2019s own expert share appraiser. The District Court correctly noted in its findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">The stock held by defendant is insufficient to control the activities of the corporation. While minority shareholders in a corporation must be treated fairly, especially those in a closely held corporation, the lack of control makes such shares less valuable. This is a known fact, which is reasonably contemplated by every person who holds a minority interest in a small corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s findings in these regards.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We conclude that the District Court did not err in applying a minority discount in calculating the value of Sharon\u2019s 600 shares of MRI stock. Sharon has not established that those in control of MRI acted in an illegal, oppressive, fraudulent or unfairly prejudicial manner. She has not established any prejudice to her from the corporation\u2019s failure to notify her of her dissenter\u2019s rights, because all she was entitled to, in any event, was the \u201cfair value\u201d of her shares. Further, she has not established that \u201cfair value\u201d precludes the application of a minority discount. We hold that the court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Did the District Court err in refusing to award Sharon attorney fees and costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Sharon argues that the court erred in refusing to award her attorney fees and costs, again basing her arguments on \u00a7\u00a7 35-9-501 and 35-1-826 through -839, MCA. We reiterate that this is not a dissenter\u2019s right action or an oppressed shareholder petition. Regardless, the above statutory provisions vest the District Court with discretion concerning an award of attorney fees. If not otherwise specified by statute, an award of costs is left to the sound discretion of the court. Section 25-10-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The record reveals that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in requiring Sharon and MRI to bear their respective costs of litigation. This action was of a declaratory nature, with both parties stipulating to the scope of the litigation. Neither party can be considered the \u201cprevailing\u201d party in this equitable proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Sharon also challenges the District Court\u2019s calculations of MRI\u2019s direct litigation expenses, these costs being added to the corporation\u2019s assets prior to determining the value of Sharon\u2019s 600 shares. Sharon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>maintains that MRI\u2019s costs and fees were $22,550, rather than the $15,846 established by the court. However, Sharon\u2019s valuation of MRI\u2019s costs and fees spent as a direct result of litigation is based on speculative trial testimony and unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The District Court\u2019s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence, the court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence, and we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. We hold that the court did not err in its determination concerning attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-6\">JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON, ERDMANN and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
