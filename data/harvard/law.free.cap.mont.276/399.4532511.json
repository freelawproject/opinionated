Drga\u2019s motion to withdraw guilty plea and motion to set aside sentence. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Drga\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea and refusing to set aside Drga\u2019s conviction and sentence when it made no determination regarding Drga\u2019s fitness to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In July 1994, Drga was charged with felony stalking for harassing and intimidating his ex-wife. Upon a stipulation signed by Drga\u2019s former attorney and the Cascade County Attorney\u2019s Office, Drga was sent to Warm Springs State Hospital for a mental evaluation. Drga was diagnosed with \u201cDementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s Type and Probable Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\u201d and declared to be seriously mentally ill and unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">As a result of the mental evaluation, the parties stipulated that Drga was unfit to proceed. The District Court then suspended all proceedings and ordered the matter be reviewed at a later date. Drga was sent back to the state hospital where it was determined that he was not mentally unfit to proceed. He returned to District Court and pled guilty based on a plea agreement with the Cascade County Attorney's Office. The District Court accepted the plea but refused to follow the county attorney\u2019s sentencing recommendation. Instead, the District Court sentenced Drga to five years with all but 349 days suspended with credit given for the 349 days served and he was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Drga was later brought into District Court on a petition to revoke his suspended sentence for failure to comply with the conditions. He admitted the violations and was released again with further conditions. He then retained new counsel and filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, a motion to set aside the judgment and sentence, and a petition for habeas corpus. He alleged that there was no review regarding Drga\u2019s fitness to proceed within the ninety-day statutory period, no subsequent hearing was held in which Drga was determined by the court to be competent, Drga\u2019s plea was involuntary because it was merely a way to get the matter over with, and Drga had ineffective assistance of counsel in the prior proceedings. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>court granted review of the petition for habeas corpus, held a hearing on the issue of whether Drga was being held illegally, and then denied the motions to withdraw guilty plea and to set aside sentence. From the denial of the two motions, Drga appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Did the District Court err in denying Drga\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea and refusing to set aside Drga\u2019s conviction and sentence when it made no determination regarding Drga\u2019s fitness to proceed?</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We review a District Court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea and motion to set aside sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1995), [274 Mont. 124], 907 P.2d 150, 152; <em>State v. Arbgast </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 220, 223, 656 P.2d 828, 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">A court may adjudge a defendant lacks fitness to proceed and should be committed to an appropriate mental health facility. Section 46-14-221(1) and (2)(a), MCA. In that event, the court shall review the defendant\u2019s fitness to proceed within ninety days of the commitment. Section 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA. Accordingly, the District Court committed Drga to the state hospital on December 8,1994, and set a hearing for review on March 15, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">On February 22, the staff of the state hospital informed the court that, in its opinion, Drga was fit to proceed with the criminal charges pending against him. Drga did not appear at the March 15 hearing and it was postponed until April 21, 1995. Prior to the April 21 hearing, the parties signed a plea agreement whereby Drga would plead guilty in exchange for the county attorney\u2019s recommendation to defer imposition of sentence for one year. The court then vacated the April 21 review hearing and set a change of plea hearing for May 1, 1995. At that hearing, the court accepted Drga\u2019s change of plea to guilty for felony stalking.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-222, MCA, proceedings can be resumed once a court has determined that the defendant has regained fitness to proceed. Furthermore, such a determination must be made \u201cafter a hearing if a hearing is requested.\u201d Section 46-14-222, MCA. Ahearing was requested in the December 8, 1994, stipulation of the parties. The court therefore erred in vacating the fitness hearing and accepting Drga\u2019s plea of guilty without making a determination that Drga had regained fitness to proceed. The State concedes that Drga\u2019s conviction and sentence are invalid because the District Court erred in resuming proceedings when it had not determined that Drga regained fitness. Accordingly, we conclude that the court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>discretion in denying Drga\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea and motion to set aside sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
