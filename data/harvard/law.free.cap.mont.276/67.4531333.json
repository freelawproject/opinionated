We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-19\">We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">1. Did the District Court err in determining that Stratemeyer\u2019s suit was not timely filed?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>2. Did the District Court err in determining that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided Stratemeyer\u2019s exclusive remedy?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">3. Did the District Court err in determining that the Montana Safety Act did not apply to Stratemeyer\u2019s claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">This is Stratemeyer\u2019s second appeal to this Court arising out of mental injuries he suffered while on duty as a deputy sheriff in Lincoln County, Montana. <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 147, 855 P.2d 506, <em>cert. </em>denied, _ U.S. _, 114 S.Ct. 600, 126 L.Ed.2d 566. Stratemeyer observed a traumatic gunshot injury to a suicide victim and alleges that he has suffered severe mental and emotional distress as a result of Lincoln County\u2019s failure to train, counsel, and debrief him following the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">On May 4, 1990, Stratemeyer, an eight-year veteran of the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Department, responded to a suicide call. En route to the scene he learned that the victim, a teenage girl, was still alive. Upon arriving at the victim\u2019s home, Stratemeyer was led to the bedroom where he found a seventeen-year-old girl who had shot herself in the head. The girl, covered in blood, was being held in her father\u2019s arms. Stratemeyer forcibly removed the girl from her father\u2019s arms and began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation. When the ambulance arrived, Stratemeyer assisted the crew in loading the girl onto the gurney and into the ambulance. Shortly after escorting the ambulance to the hospital, Stratemeyer was dispatched to the scene of another accident. Later that evening, Stratemeyer learned that the girl had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Thereafter, Stratemeyer was plagued by thoughts of the girl\u2019s suicide and his decision to tear the victim from her father\u2019s arms during her last moments of life. Although Stratemeyer continued to report to work, he began to experience a lack of concentration and mental disorientation. Subsequently, Stratemeyer was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Since the incident, Stratemeyer has been unable to return to his job with the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Stratemeyer filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim on May 25, 1990, which was denied four days later. After Stratemeyer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was denied, he petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for a hearing regarding his wage loss benefits and medical expenses. The Workers\u2019Compensation Court determined that Stratemeyer did not suffer an \u201cinjury\u201d as defined in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA. However, the court determined that subsections 3(a) and 3(b) of \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, which exclude mental stress from the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>injury were unconstitutional and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Lincoln County and its insurer appealed to this Court, and this Court determined that \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution because it is rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of controlling the costs of the workers\u2019 compensation program and providing benefits. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>855 P.2d at 510. While Stratemeyer\u2019s case was pending in this Court, Stratemeyer filed a tort claim against Lincoln County in Missoula County District Court on April 30, 1993. The District Court\u2019s dismissal of Stratemeyer\u2019s tort claim is the subject of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">1. Did the District Court err in determining that Stratemeyer\u2019s suit was not timely filed?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, courts are required to construe a complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Loney v. Milodragovich, Dale &amp; Dye, P.C. </em>(1995), [273 Mont. 506], 905 P.2d 158, 160. A complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief under any set of facts which could be proved in support of the claim. <em>Loney, </em>905 P.2d at 160 (citing <em>Boreen v. Christensen </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 405, 408, 884 P.2d 761, 762). The District Court determined that although Stratemeyer\u2019s complaint was filed within three years, as required by \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, Stratemeyer had failed to first file his administrative claim with Lincoln County, as required by \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, which, according to the District Court, was a prerequisite to filing suit. Thus, the District Court determined that Stratemeyer\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the administrative filing prerequisite of \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, had not been satisfied. This determination is a conclusion of law. <em>See Loney, </em>905 P.2d at 161. In reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, we determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686; <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Lincoln County asserts that Stratemeyer\u2019s claim should be barred because he did not first file his claim with Lincoln County. Section 2-9-301, MCA, sets forth the procedure for filing claims against the State and its political subdivisions. Lincoln County argued that because of Stratemeyer\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, within the three-year statute of limitations, he is barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>statute of limitations from pursuing his claim. The District Court agreed, concluding that \u00a7 2-9-301 and \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, barred Stratemeyer\u2019s claim. Section 2-9-301, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">(1) All claims against the state arising under the provisions of parts 1 through 3 of this chapter must be presented in writing to the department of administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">(2) A complaint based on a claim subject to the provisions of subsection (1) may not be filed in district court unless the claimant has first presented the claim to the department of administration and the department has finally denied the claim. The department must grant or deny the claim in writing within 120 days after the claim is presented to the department. The failure of the department to make final disposition of a claim within 120 days after it is presented to the department must be considered a final denial of the claim for purposes of this subsection. Upon the department\u2019s receipt of the claim, the statute of limitations on the claim is tolled for 120 days. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to claims that may be asserted under Title 25, chapter 20, by third-party complaint, cross-claim, or counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">(3) All claims against a political subdivision arising under the provisions of parts 1 through 3 shall be presented to and filed with the clerk or secretary of the political subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Lincoln County argues that Stratemeyer\u2019s failure to present and file his claim with the Lincoln County Clerk and Recorder within the three-year statute of limitations bars his suit in district court. Stratemeyer contends that he did not pursue his tort claim in district court until this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stratemeyer </em>and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent denial of his petition for a writ of certiorari had been handed down. He argues that had he attempted to submit his tort claims to the county before exhausting possible remedies under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act his tort claims would have been dismissed based on the exclusive remedy rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Stratemeyer contends that the plain language of \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, does not require him to present his claim to the county clerk before filing in district court. He argues that subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, applies and that subsection (3), unlike subsections (1) and (2), does not require him to file with the clerk before filing a complaint in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">In construing a statute, \u201cthe office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The rules of statutory construction require the language to be construed according to its plain meaning. <em>Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088. If the language is clear and unambiguous, then no further interpretation is required; we will resort to legislative history only if the intent cannot be determined from the plain wording of the statute. <em>Clarke, </em>897 P.2d at 1088. Where the intention of the legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in a statute, the courts may not go further and apply other means of interpretation. <em>Clarke, </em>897 P.2d at 1088 (citing <em>Tongue River Elec. Coop. v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 511, 515, 636 P.2d 862, 864).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Lincoln County asserts that this Court has previously interpreted subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, to require a plaintiff to first file a claim against the entity before proceeding in district court. <em>See Rouse v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 1, 4, 817 P.2d 690, 691. However, the language in <em>Rouse </em>on which Lincoln County relies is dicta. In <em>Rouse, </em>we were considering whether the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, barred Rouse\u2019s claims against Anaconda-Deer Lodge County. <em>Rouse, </em>817 P.2d at 691. Rouse\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA, was not at issue. Although we stated that \u201cthe statutory requirements enacted by the legislature mandate a plaintiff asserting a cause of action against a governmental entity to first file a claim before that entity before filing an action in district court,\u201d this sentence is not related to our holding in <em>Rouse </em>and it is contradicted by other language in the opinion. <em>Rouse, </em>817 P.2d at 691. Later in the opinion we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">With respect to claims against political subdivisions, the statutes do not state that a final disposition of the claim before a local tribunal is a prerequisite to filing an action in district court. The statutes also do not provide an automatic denial period claims made against a county or political subdivision similar to the 120 day period for claims against the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\"><em>Rouse, </em>817 P.2d at 692. In <em>Rouse, </em>we recognized that the plain language of subsection (3) does not require a final disposition of the claim or an automatic denial period for the claim, yet, inexplicably, we read the \u201cfirst file\u201d requirement into the statute. This violates the mandate of \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, and our rules for statutory construction. <em>See Clarke, </em>897 P.2d at 1088. We reject our broad statement in <em>Rouse </em>which would require a claimant to \u201cfirst file\u201d his claim with the political subdivision before proceeding in district court. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>statement is contrary to both our subsequent logic in that case and the plain language of the statute. To the extent that <em>Rouse </em>expresses an opinion inconsistent with our analysis in the instant case, <em>Rouse </em>is expressly overruled. We hold that although subsection (2) of \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, requires that a claim first be presented to the Department of Administration, and that the department dispose of the claim before a plaintiff can file a complaint in district court, subsection (3) of \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, contains no such requirement. Rather, \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA, merely requires that a claim be filed, it does not require that it be \u201cfirst presented\u201d or that it be acted upon before a complaint can be filed. Accordingly, we determine that Stratemeyer\u2019s complaint, which was filed within three years pursuant to \u00a7 27-2-204, MCA, is not barred by his failure to first file an administrative claim with the Lincoln County Clerk pursuant to \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">2. Did the District Court err in determining that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided Stratemeyer\u2019s exclusive remedy?</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The exclusive remedy rule is perhaps the most firmly entrenched doctrine in workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>See, e.g., </em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 1915 Mont. Laws 168; <em>Shea v. North-Butte Mining Co. </em>(1919), 55 Mont. 522, 179 P. 499. The rationale for adopting workers\u2019 compensation legislation was to guarantee workers with work-related injuries some form of compensation in exchange for relinquishing any potential tort claims against their employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The enactment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was essentially a compromise between industry and labor \u2014 workers received guaranteed no-fault recovery, and industry was relieved of the possibility of large and potentially uncapped recoveries in the tort system. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark County v. Industrial Accident Bd. </em>(1916), 52 Mont. 6, 8-11, 155 P. 268, 269-70. Montana\u2019s exclusive remedy provision, \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">For all <em>employments covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act </em>or for which an election has been made for coverage under this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are exclusive. Except as provided in part 5 of this chapter for uninsured employers and except as otherwise provided in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>an employer is not subject to any liability whatever for the death of or personal injury to an employee covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or for any claims for contribution or indemnity asserted by a third person from whom damages are sought on account of such injuries or death. </em>The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act binds the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>employee himself, and in case of death binds his personal representative and all persons having any right or claim to compensation for his injury or death, as well as the employer and the servants and employees of such employer and those conducting his business during liquidation, bankruptcy, or insolvency. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Lincoln County argues that Stratemeyer\u2019s <em>employment </em>was covered under the Act, thus, that the Act is his exclusive remedy. In asserting that a covered <em>injury </em>is necessary before the exclusivity provision can be applied, Stratemeyer relies on the second sentence of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, which provides that an employer is not subject to liability for the <em>\u201cdeath of or personal injury to an employee.\u201d </em>We find Lincoln County\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The quid pro quo between employers and employees is central to the Act; thus, it is axiomatic that there must be some possibility of recovery by the employee for the compromise to hold. The scope of immunity from tort relates to the definition of injury under \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA. As Professor Larson observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">If ... the exclusiveness defense is a \u201cpart of the <em>quid pro quo </em>by which the sacrifices and gains of employees and employers are to some extent put in balance,\u201d it ought logically to follow that the employer should be spared damage liability only when compensation liability has actually been provided in its place, or, to state the matter from the employee\u2019s point of view, rights of action for damages should not be deemed taken away except where something of value has been put in their place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">2A Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 65.40 (perm. ed. rev. vol. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">By definition, the mental injury which Stratemeyer suffered is excluded from coverage under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 39-71-119(3), MCA. This is further evidenced by the policy statement added by the 1993 Montana Legislature to \u00a7 39-71-105(5), MCA. That section declares the \u201cpublic policy\u201d of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 39-71-105(5), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">It is the intent of the legislature that stress claims, often referred to as \u201cmental-mental claims\u201d and \u201cmental-physical claims\u201d, are not compensable under Montana\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation and occupational disease laws. The legislature recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims have a potential to place an economic burden on the workers\u2019 compensation and occupational disease system. The legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ture also recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various categories of stress claims and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other jurisdictions. In addition, not all injuries are compensable under the present system, as is the case with repetitive injury claims, and it is within the legislature\u2019s authority to define the limits of the workers\u2019 compensation and occupational disease system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axq\">Thus, it is unequivocally clear that mental injuries, such as Stratemeyer\u2019s, are beyond the scope of coverage of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Accordingly, under Lincoln County\u2019s theory, employees would have no possibility of recovery for mental injuries and yet the employer would be shielded from all potential liability. If that were the case, the quid pro quo, which is the foundation of the exclusive remedy rule would be eliminated. Such a result would be contrary to the spirit and intent of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Cunningham v. Northwestern Improvement Co. </em>(1911), 44 Mont. 180, 222, 119 P. 554, 566. Stratemeyer asserts that in light of the restrictive definition of injury in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, as well as the policy statement in \u00a7 39-71-105(5), MCA, there is no quid pro quo for workers who suffer \u201cmental-mental\u201d injuries. We agree. Absent the quid pro quo, the exclusive remedy cannot stand, and the employer is thus exposed to potential tort liability. <em>Errand v. Cascade Steel Rolling Mills </em>(Or. 1995), 888 P.2d 544, 552; <em>Day v. NLO, Inc. </em>(S.D. Ohio 1992), 811 F. Supp. 1271, 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In <em>Day, </em>the plaintiffs asserted tort claims against their employer and the employer contended that the plaintiffs had not suffered an injury under Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. <em>Day, </em>811 F. Supp. at 1278. The plaintiffs argued that their injuries did not qualify as compensable injuries under Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In asserting their tort claims, the plaintiffs argued that their emotional distress injuries did not fall within the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s definition of \u201cinjury.\u201d Day, 811 F. Supp. at 1279 (discussing Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 4123.01(C)). The court noted that the Ohio Act excluded \u201c[p]sychiatric conditions except where the conditions have arisen from an injury or occupational disease....\u201d <em>Day, </em>811 F. Supp. at 1279 (quoting Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 4123.01(C)). The court determined that \u201cif an employee\u2019s malady does not fall under the definition of an \u201cinjury\u201d ... then the exclusivity provisions of workmens\u2019 compensation do not apply.\u201d <em>Day, </em>811 F. Supp. at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The court noted that workers\u2019 compensation claims involving emotional distress can be classified as \u201cmental-mental\u201d (mental stimulus, mental consequence), \u201cmental-physical\u201d (mental stimulus, physical consequence), or \u201cphysical-mental\u201d (physical stimulus, mental consequence). <em>Day, </em>811 F. Supp. at 1280 (citing 1B Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 42.20-42.25 (perm. ed. rev. vol. 1991)). The court concluded that only \u201cmental-mental\u201d claims are actionable in tort in Ohio\u2019s courts because Ohio\u2019s exclusive remedy rule continues to govern \u201cmental-physical\u201d and \u201cphysical-mental\u201d claims. <em>Day, </em>811 F.Supp. at 1280 (citing <em>Harover v. City of Norwood </em>(Ohio Ct. App. 1988), 549 N.E.2d 1194).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The <em>Day </em>court opined, similar to the Montana Legislature in setting forth its \u201cpublic policy\u201d statement in \u00a7 39-71-105(5), MCA, that the subjectivity, costs, and the nature of damages involved in \u201cmental-mental\u201d claims led Ohio\u2019s courts to reasonably determine that workers\u2019 compensation does not cover these claims and, as a result, the employee may sue in tort. <em>Day, </em>811 F. Supp. at 1281-82. However, given the facts of the case before it, the court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arose from a physical, non-mental stimulus and, as a result, the exclusivity provisions of Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law controlled. <em>Day, </em>811 F. Supp. at 1280-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Likewise, in <em>Errand, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court concluded that the exclusivity provision of Oregon\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act did not shield the employer from the employee\u2019s tort claims because the employee did not suffer a \u201ccompensable injury\u201d as that term is defined in the Oregon Act. <em>Errand, </em>888 P.2d at 552. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board determined that the injury suffered by the employee was not compensable. Thereafter, Errand brought a civil suit against his employer based on statutory and common law tort claims. Arguing that workers\u2019 compensation was Errand\u2019s exclusive remedy, the employer moved for and was granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed stating that \u201cthe exclusivity of the Act is not limited to claims that are ultimately determined to be compensable.\u201d <em>Errand, </em>888 P.2d at 546 (citing <em>Errand v. Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Inc. </em>(Or. Ct. App. 1994), 869 P.2d 358, 360). However, the Oregon Supreme Court reversed, determining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">In plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation case, it was established that the employer <em>had no liability </em>to compensate plaintiff under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. <em>By providing for an employer\u2019s freedom from \u201cother\u201d liability [tort liabilityJ, </em>it may be inferred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the exclusivity provision that there must exist, as a predicate for that freedom, <em>some actual liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law before the exclusivity provision may protect the employer from \u201call other liability. \u201d </em>Thus, the text of the exclusivity provision, specifically its use of the term \u201cliability,\u201d further supports the conclusion that the statutory definition of \u201ccompensable injury\u201d applies to ORS 656.018. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><em>Errand, </em>888 P.2d at 548. Although Oregon\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act uses different terminology than ours, the underlying principle of the opinion is equally applicable under our Act; namely, that the employer cannot receive the benefit of the exclusive remedy provision when the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cinjury\u2019 precludes any possibility of recovery for the particular injury at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Section 1-2-107, MCA, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">Whenever the meaning of a word or phrase is defined in any part of this code, such definition is applicable to the same word or phrase wherever it occurs, except where a contrary intention plainly appears.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Therefore, the definition of injury in \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, must be construed consistently with the restrictive definition of injury in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA. Thus, an injury excluded by \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, necessarily must be excluded as an injury from the exclusive remedy provision of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. The exclusive remedy rule applies only if the injury suffered by the worker is covered by the Act. Sections 39-71-119 and 39-71-411, MCA; <em>see also Day, </em>811 F. Supp. at 1280 (finding that Ohio\u2019s exclusive remedy rule governs \u201cmental-physical\u201d and \u201cphysical-mental\u201d claims). For example, in a \u201cphysical-mental\u201d claim, where an employee loses an arm, that employee\u2019s remedy under the workers\u2019 compensation act is exclusive and he cannot recover in tort for emotional distress. By definition, under Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Stratemeyer\u2019s injury is excluded from coverage. Sections 39-71-105(5) and 39-71- 119(3)(a)-(b), MCA; <em>Stratemeyer, </em>855 P.2d at 508-10. Thus, under both the definition of injury in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, and the statement of public policy in \u00a7 39-71-105(5), MCA, it is evident that \u201cmental-mental\u201d injuries were intended to be outside the scope of coverage of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. It is equally evident that this exclusion defeats the' quid pro quo central to the Act. <em>See Great Western Sugar Co. v. District Court </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 1, 6, 610 P.2d 717, 720. Stratemeyer did not suffer an injury as defined in the Act and, therefore, the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>does not afford him any \u201cremedy;\u201d certainly not an \u201cexclusive\u201d remedy. <em>Errand, </em>888 P.2d at 548. The exclusion of Stratemeyer\u2019s \u201cmental-mental\u201d injury leaves him without workers\u2019 compensation coverage and likewise removes Lincoln County\u2019s shield from a tort claim. Thus, in keeping with the quid pro quo of the Act, we hold that Stratemeyer is allowed to proceed in tort against his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">3. Did the District Court err in determining that the Montana Safety Act did not apply to Stratemeyer\u2019s claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, we determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County, </em>898 P.2d at 686 (citation omitted). The existence of a duty is a legal question for the court, while breach of that duty is a question for the jury. <em>Ganz v. United States Cycling Federation </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 360, 903 P.2d 212, 215. The District Court determined that there was \u201cno duty under Montana law which could have been breached by Defendants\u201d and that Stratemeyer failed to state a claim under the Montana Safety Act, \u00a7\u00a7 50-71-201 and 50-71-203, MCA. Specifically, the District Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">Plaintiffs do not cite any authority which would extend the duty imposed by the safe place to work statutes to include alleged injuries for emotional distress which resulted from the Plaintiff observing a traumatic incident not caused by Defendants, and the Court concludes that there is no such Montana authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Stratemeyer contends that his claim is based on Lincoln County\u2019s failure to train, supervise, treat and debrief him following the incident. According to Stratemeyer, the traumatic nature and consequences of responding to the suicide were foreseeable, and post-traumatic stress disorder is a common injury for law enforcement personnel, emergency medical technicians and disaster and emergency services personnel. He alleges that the District Court interpreted the Montana Safety Act too narrowly, when it construed it to include only physical harm. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Section 50-71-201, MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Each employer shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">(1) furnish a place of employment that is safe for each of his employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akc\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">(4) do any other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, and safety of his employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The plain language of the statute does not limit its application to only physical harm. Rather, \u00a7 50-71-201(4), MCA, and \u00a7 50-71-203(3)-(4), MCA, contain the broad duty to \u201cdo any other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, health, and safety of his employees.\u201d Although it remains a question for the finder of fact to determine whether the employer breached its duty in failing to train, supervise, treat, or debrief Stratemeyer, we determine here that the Montana Safety Act is applicable to mental as well as physical injuries. We hold that the District Court erred in concluding that the Montana Safety Act does not encompass mental or emotional distress type injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b100-5\">JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER, NELSON and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b100-6\">JUSTICE ERDMANN</author>\n<p id=\"AQA\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">I concur with the majority\u2019s holding on Issue 1, respectfully dissent from its holding on Issue 2, and join with Chief Justice Turnage\u2019s dissent on Issue 3. Gary Stratemeyer\u2019s mental injuries resulted from duties performed within the scope of his employment as a Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy. <em>See Stratemeyer v. MACO Workers Corp. Trust </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 147, 855 P.2d 506 <em>(Stratemeyer I). </em>The legislature has declared that mental injuries are not compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 39-71-105(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">In <em>Stratemeyer I </em>this Court held that the exclusion of mental injuries without physical manifestations was rationally related to a legitimate government objective of controlling the costs of the workers\u2019 compensation program. Stratemeyer then filed a tort action against Lincoln County in district court. The District Court dismissed the action on the basis that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided the exclusive remedy for Stratemeyer. The majority has now reversed this determination and has held that even though Stratemeyer\u2019s employment was covered under the Act, since his injury is not compensable under the Act the exclusive remedy provisions do not apply. In doing so, the Court avoids a harsh result and if it were within this Court\u2019s province to do so, I would certainly join the majority. However, the scope of coverage for employment-related injuries should remain within the province of the legislature and its power to define and amend the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The majority correctly notes that the exclusive remedy rule is perhaps the most firmly entrenched doctrine in workers\u2019 compensation law. Montana\u2019s exclusive remedy provision provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>For all <em>employments </em>covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or for which an election has been made for coverage under this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are exclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Section 39-71-411, MCA (emphasis added). There is no dispute that Stratemeyer\u2019s employment was covered under the Act and therefore the remedy provisions of the Act, no matter how harsh, are exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">I do not agree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the language in \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, which states that \u201can employer is not subject to any liability whatever for the death of or personal injury to an <em>employee covered by the ... Act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The language is unambiguous and simply states that the employer is not liable for injuries to its employees covered under the Act. The majority misinterprets the language to create an exclusivity provision that is injury-driven, rather than employment-driven. The majority states that \u201c[t]he exclusive remedy rule applies only if the injury suffered by the worker is covered by the Act.\u201d On the contrary, under the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, the focus should not be on the type of injury incurred but instead on whether the injury occurred within the scope of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The majority supports it conclusion by overlaying the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d found in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, onto \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. Such a stretch is not necessary, as the language of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, standing on its own, is clear when it states that \u201c[f]or all employments covered under the ... Act... the provisions of this chapter are exclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Errand v. Cascade Steel Rolling Mills </em>(Or. 1995), 888 P.2d 544, is not persuasive. In discussing that case, the majority notes in passing that the language of the Oregon Workers\u2019 Compensation Act differs from ours. However, I find the difference in the statutory language to be significant. The Oregon exclusivity provision provides that a complying employer\u2019s liability \u201cis exclusive and in place of all other liability arising out of <em>compensable injuries </em>to the subject workers\u201d and that the \u201crights given to a subject worker ... for <em>compensable injuries </em>under this chapter are in lieu of any remedies they might otherwise have for such injuries against the worker\u2019s employer.\u201d <em>Errand, </em>888 P.2d at 546-47 (quoting Or. Rev. Stat. 656.018(1) and Or. Rev. Stat. 656.018(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The Oregon Legislature, unlike ours, has chosen to specifically tie its exclusivity provision to \u201ccompensable injuries.\u201d Our legislature could certainly choose to restrict Montana\u2019s exclusivity provision to \u201ccompensable injuries,\u201d but has chosen not to do so. The Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy for all employ-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>merits covered under the Act, regardless of the nature of the injury involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">I agree with the majority that the quid pro quo between employers and employees is central to the Act, but it is a legislatively created quid pro quo and, within constitutional limits, is defined by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The majority\u2019s rationale that the employer is shielded from liability only for those injuries covered under the Act essentially rewrites the language of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. This Court should not assume legislative functions by adding what the legislature has omitted, or by omitting what the legislature has added. <em>Russette v. Chippewa Cree Housing Auth. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 90, 93-94, 874 P.2d 1217, 1219. The majority has added \u201ccovered injury\u201d to the exclusive remedy statute, and therefore, has improperly assumed a legislative function. I would affirm the District Court on Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">* * *</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b102-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE,</author>\n<p id=\"AAJ\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">I join in Justice Erdmann\u2019s dissent on Issue 2. I also respectfully dissent from the majority opinion on Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The majority has interpreted Montana\u2019s Safety Act as creating a duty on the part of the defendants and respondents to take steps to prevent psychological harm from incidents in the workplace. This interpretation stretches the Act far beyond the legitimate purposes for which it was enacted, with no citation to legislative history or case law as support for that extension. The absence of such citation is quite understandable, as none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The Montana Safety Act was adopted in 1969. Discussion by advocates and legislators at the hearings on the bill centered around the need for employers to provide employees with safety equipment such as hard hats and boots. <em>See </em>Minutes of House Public Health, Welfare and Safety Committee, February 4,1969; Minutes of Senate State Administration Committee, February 24, 1969. When the Act was amended in 1991 to, inter alia, exclude a requirement that employers provide protective footwear for employees, it was again discussed at legislative hearings as a safeguard requiring employers to provide safety equipment for employees. <em>See </em>Minutes of House Labor and Employment Relations Committee, February 21, 1991; Minutes of Senate Labor and Employment Relations Committee, March 12, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The cases citing the Act, too, have involved the duty to protect from physical injury. <em>See, e.g., Hondo v. PPG Industries, Inc. </em>(1989) 236 Mont. 493, 771 P.2d 956 (worker became ill from paint fumes); <em>Kemp v. Bechtel Const. Co. </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 519, 720 P.2d 270 (worker injured in ditch cave-in); <em>Cain v. Stevenson </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 101, 706 P.2d 128 (worker fell on slippery cinder block \u201cstep\u201d at exit from building under construction); <em>Stepanek v. Kober Const. </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 430, 625 P.2d 51 (worker fell from scaffolding); <em>Reynolds v. Burlington N. </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 383, 621 P.2d 1028 (runaway railway cars struck worker); <em>Shannon v. Howard S. Wright Const. Co. </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 269, 593 P.2d 438 (worker fell from ladder).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Expanding the Montana Safety Act to require employers to provide training, supervision, treatment, and debriefing to protect workers from on-the-job psychological harm may be a valid subject for discussion among the peoples\u2019 elected representatives in Montana\u2019s legislature. In my view, however, it is not appropriate for accomplishment by judicial fiat, as the majority does here. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
