Joseph also contends the \"Qualified Domestic Relations Order\" (QDRO) does not accurately reflect the trial court's decision. The court did not make a finding on the income of the parties, and the court did not address the ability of Joseph to meet his needs and financial obligations while\n   meeting those of Penny or enter written findings on the statutory factors. We affirm the decision to award maintenance. But we remand to determine the amount and duration of maintenance after making a finding on the income of the parties and consideration of the statutory factors. Penny concedes the QDRO is not accurate. On remand, the court shall enter a QDRO that accurately reflects the court's ruling. We also direct the court on remand to address Penny's request on appeal for attorney fees under RCW 26.09.140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Joseph Anthony and Penny Anthony married on June 19, 1987. Joseph was 24-years-old and Penny was 22-years-old.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Penny did not complete the eighth grade and does not have a general education development (GED) certification. During the marriage, Penny stayed home and took care of the four children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Joseph served in the Marine Corps from March 27, 1984 until July 31, 2006. Joseph was 43-years-old when he retired from the Marine Corps in 2006. In 2007, Joseph started working at Lynden Transport Incorporated (LTI) as a short-haul truck driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Joseph and Penny separated in August 2012. On July 6, 2015, Joseph filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage. Joseph requested a \"fair and equitable division\" of the community and separate property and \"all debts and liabilities.\" Joseph agreed \"[m]aintenance will be paid\" to Penny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Joseph and Penny testified at trial. At the time of trial, Joseph was 53-years-old and Penny was 51-years-old. The court admitted a number of exhibits into evidence, including the financial declarations filed by Joseph and\n   Penny and financial documents, including LTI W-2s and pension documentation. In his financial declaration,\n   Joseph states his total gross monthly income is $7,807. He lists monthly wages of $3,504, overtime of $2,086, and military disability of $817. Joseph receives monthly military retirement income of $2,500. In his financial declaration, Joseph allocates $1,400 of the military retirement income to himself and $1,100 to Penny. Joseph imputed $1,600 in income to Penny. Joseph stated his total monthly expenses were $3,995. In her financial declaration, Penny stated she has no income and total monthly expenses of $3,566.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Joseph testified his financial declaration was accurate and he routinely worked overtime at LTI, earning approximately $2,000 a month. Joseph agreed the LTI W-2s showed his income had increased every year since 2012. Joseph testified he works approximately 15 hours a week in overtime. Joseph said he works that amount of overtime to pay bills and does not want to continue working the same amount of overtime. Joseph testified he could pay $2,500 a month in maintenance to Penny and pay his expenses. Joseph testified the amount in his LTI 401(k) retirement account in 2014 was $26,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Penny testified she receives $3,050 each month from Joseph and $500 a month in rent from her adult son Michael. Penny testified she has no retirement savings and wanted to remain in the family house. Penny testified that she planned to get her GED and then apply for minimum wage jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The court ruled at the conclusion of the trial. The court considered the statutory factors in dividing the assets and liabilities under RCW 26.09.080. The court awarded Penny the family home. The court determined the equity in the house was $51,000 and awarded Joseph one-half of the equity of $25,500. The court awarded Penny one-half of the military pension and the LTI \"pension equity plan\" retirement account. The court ruled the award of the retirement accounts would offset Joseph's half of the home equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 The court identified and considered the statutory factors under RCW 26.09.090 in awarding maintenance to\n   Penny. The court ruled Penny should receive maintenance for 20 years as follows: $2,500 per month for the first five years, decreased by $500 each of the next five-year periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 Joseph filed a motion for clarification of the division of property, the valuation date for the family home and the pensions, and the maintenance award \"in relation to the parties' incomes and their portions of the military retirements and the husband's overtime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 On April 18, 2017, the court entered the decree of dissolution and written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court awarded the family home to Penny. The court offset Joseph's equity in the house with the LTI retirement account. The court ordered Penny to refinance or sell the house in the next 18 months. Exhibit A, \"Real Property,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Penny Anthony shall receive the marital home located at 8378 Glennwood Rd. SW, Port Orchard, WA 98367.

Exhibit B states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    LTI Retirement Account\n   </em>\n   : Each party is to receive half of the LTI Retirement Account accrued from the date of marriage through November 1, 2016.

The remaining balance in the account will then [be] divided by 2 to split the remainder of the funds equally between the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Military Retirement\n   </em>\n   : Mrs. Anthony is awarded her portion of Mr. Anthony's military retirement accrued from June of 1987 until Mr. Anthony's military retirement date, minus his disability payments as they are not subject to division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    401(k) Retirement\n   </em>\n   : Mrs. Anthony is awarded half of the 401(k) accrued from June of 1987 until August of 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b613 The court awarded Penny maintenance.

The court amended the decree of dissolution to state maintenance \"will end when either spouse dies, or the spouse receiving support gets married or registers a new domestic partner.\" The court entered an amended decree on June 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b615 Joseph seeks reversal of the amount and duration of maintenance.

In addressing property distribution, the court cited\n   <em>\n    Rockwell\n   </em>\n   \"with regards to the just and equitable distribution of property and going beyond, as [Penny's attorney] points out, kind of the post divorce economic circumstances of the parties.\" The court addressed the parties' \"substantial financial disparities in terms of the potential to generate income.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In looking at the issues kind of post divorce and post dissolution, the economic circumstances, it's completely understood that Mr. Anthony likely will be working less and not more. He's 53. He's correct -\n   I think, he provided credible testimony with regards to his job. It is a difficult job. It's - it's taxing both mentally and physically driving a truck.\n   He's 53. As he continues to get older, that will become more and more of an issue. He's certainly entitled to do things outside of work, and so the notion that he would continue to work 60 hours a week - perhaps in the short term ... but in the long term that's not particularly realistic. And I don't think that he's obligated [to] be working 60 hours a week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   As I do the math, just I like to do kind of in my own mind kind of hypotheticals and whatnot, although I have real numbers here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   For example, if over the next ten years instead of grossing 115,000 a year, Mr. Anthony were to gross $85,000 a year, so $30,000 less per year because he decides to work less, that still is a total gross income of $850,000 over the next ten years. That would take him to 63, at which point he may be contemplating retirement or whatnot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   If Ms. Anthony - and we will talk about her employment situation - but if she were to work a minimum wage job - well, actually I did $10 an hour, minimum wage will likely increase - but at $10 an hour, full time, over the next ten years that would be $200,000 gross income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   So we're talking about even if Ms. Anthony were to work for ten years at a minimum wage job and Mr. Anthony were to decrease his hours and his gross income were to decrease [$]30,000 a year, we're still talking about over the next ten years a difference of $650,000 of income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   There's no doubt, there's no question that Mr. Anthony is in a far better position to generate income than Ms. Anthony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b618 Joseph contends his projected 10-year income is $679,800, not $850,000; and Penny's income would be $383,680, not $200,000. Joseph argues the court deducts $30,000 a year for overtime but erroneously allocates the entire amount of his military pension to him in the hypothetical projections. We agree the hypothetical does not appear to take into account allocation of the pension. But as the court expressly noted, the projection is a hypothetical example and \"I have real numbers here.\" The record shows the court did not base the award of maintenance on the\n   hypothetical projections. But the court did not make a finding on the actual income of the parties. We remand to determine the income for each party for purposes of awarding maintenance. On remand, the court shall determine the income of each party and enter a specific finding on income before considering the statutory factors for maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Award of Maintenance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b619 RCW 26.09.090 controls the award of maintenance.
