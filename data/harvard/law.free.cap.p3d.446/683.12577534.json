Caliber issued a notice of trustee's sale for the home on U.S. Bank's behalf in 2016, and the Terhunes filed a lawsuit to enjoin the foreclosure and to quiet title to their home. The Terhunes argued that the promissory note had been accelerated in 2009, which started the six-year statute of limitations. Therefore, they claimed that the statute of limitations period had expired before U.S. Bank's foreclosure action. The Terhunes also argued that U.S. Bank was not authorized to foreclose because there was no evidence that U.S. Bank was the holder of the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 We hold that (1) the statute of limitations did not bar the foreclosure action because there was no clear and unequivocal acceleration of the promissory note; (2) the evidence established that U.S. Bank was the holder of the Terhunes' promissory note and the Terhunes failed to establish a genuine issue of fact on this question, and therefore U.S. Bank had authority to foreclose on the deed of trust; and (3) the trial court did not err in denying the Terhunes' motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's orders granting summary judgment in favor of U.S. Bank and Caliber and denying the Terhunes' motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Promissory Note\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 On January 8, 2008, the Terhunes executed a promissory note for $1,499,999 in favor of Countrywide Bank (Countrywide). The note was secured by a deed of trust on the Terhunes' home in Lake Tapps. The note\n   required the Terhunes to make payments of $8,124.99 on the first day of every month\n   beginning on March 1, 2008. The maturity date of the note was February 1, 2038.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The note stated that the Terhunes would be in default if they failed to make a monthly payment on the due date. The note also included an acceleration clause, which stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full amount of Principal that has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 The deed of trust stated that the lender must give written notice before accelerating the note obligations and that the notice must specify that \"failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration.\" CP at 109 (bolding omitted). The deed of trust further provided that if the default was not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, \"Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums\" secured by the deed of trust. CP at 109 (bolding omitted).\n   <em>\n    Default and Notice of Intent to Accelerate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 The Terhunes made monthly payments on the mortgage from March 2008 through October 2008. On December 17, after the Terhunes failed to make the November and December payments, Countrywide sent them a Notice of Intent to Accelerate. The notice stated that the loan was in default and that the Terhunes had until January 16, 2009 to cure the default by paying the two missed payments plus late charges. The notice also stated that if the default was not cured, \"the mortgage payments\n   <strong>\n    will be accelerated\n   </strong>\n   with the full amount remaining.\" CP at 158.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 The Terhunes made the November payment, but did not make the December payment and failed to make the January 2009 payment. On January 16, 2009, Countrywide sent a second Notice of Intent to Accelerate. The notice\n   stated that the loan was in default and that the Terhunes had until February 15 to cure the default by paying the two missed payments plus late charges. The notice again stated that if the default was not cured, \"the mortgage payments\n   <strong>\n    will be accelerated\n   </strong>\n   with the full amount remaining.\" CP at 161.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 The Terhunes made the December payment, but they did not make the January 2009 payment and failed to make the February payment. On February 17, 2009, Countrywide sent a third Notice of Intent to Accelerate. The notice stated that the loan was in default and that the Terhunes had until March 19 to cure the default by paying the two missed payments plus late charges. The notice stated, \"If the default is not cured on or before March 19, 2009, the mortgage payments\n   <strong>\n    will be accelerated\n   </strong>\n   with the full amount remaining.\" CP at 164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 The Terhunes failed to make any further payments on the loan. However, there is no evidence that Countrywide provided any formal notice to the Terhunes that the loan actually had been accelerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    2010 Foreclosure Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 In November 2009, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (BAC) sent the Terhunes a notice stating that BAC was servicing their loan and that their account was seriously delinquent. The notice stated that the past due amount was $86,382. In March 2010, BAC sent the Terhunes a notice of default stating that the total amount in arrears was $158,188.86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 In August 2010, the trustee of the deed of trust sent the Terhunes a notice of foreclosure, which stated that their property would be sold in December if their default was not cured. The notice stated that the amount in arrears was $216,503.61, and that the Terhunes had until November 22 to cure the default by paying all accrued charges that by that time were estimated to be $256,210.39. The trustee also recorded a notice of trustee's sale for December 3, 2010, which showed that the amount in arrears was $216,611.75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 In November, the Terhunes filed a lawsuit against BAC and others seeking, among other relief, an injunction to prevent the trustee's sale and to quiet title to their home. The Terhunes' lawsuit eventually was\n   dismissed. But there is no evidence that the trustee continued to pursue foreclosure at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Transfers of Note/Deed of Trust\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 In March 2015, LSF9 Master Participation Trust notified the Terhunes that it had purchased their loan. The Trust's mailing address was listed as \"c/o Caliber Home Loans, Inc.\" CP at 551. On June 4, Caliber notified the Terhunes that it was the new servicer of the loan. In a June 5 letter, Caliber notified the Terhunes that the creditor on the loan was LSF9 Master Participation Trust and that their total debt was $2,292,209.26. However, the letter stated, \"We are not requesting that you pay the entire loan balance.\" CP at 187.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 In September 2015, Bank of America (as successor by merger to BAC) assigned its beneficial interest in the deed of trust to U.S. Bank, as trustee for LSF9 Master Participation Trust. On October 7, a representative of Caliber signed a declaration referencing the Terhunes' loan and stating that \"U.S. BANK TRUST, N.A., AS TRUSTEE FOR LSF9 MASTER PARTICIPATION TRUST is the beneficiary ... and actual holder of the promissory note or other obligation secured by the deed of trust.\" CP at 559. Above the signature line the declaration stated, \"U.S. Bank Trust, N.A., as Trustee for LSF9 Master Participation Trust, by Caliber Home Loans, Inc., as its attorney in fact.\" CP at 559. The document was signed by a person who listed her title as \"authorized signatory.\" CP at 559.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    2016 Foreclosure Action and Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 In December 2015, the trustee of the deed of trust sent the Terhunes a notice of default, which stated that U.S. Bank was the creditor on the loan, Caliber was the servicer\n   of the loan, and the Terhunes owed $732,627.78 in overdue payments, late charges, and advances on the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 On October 11, 2016, the trustee recorded a notice of trustee's sale for February 17, 2017. The notice stated that the total amount in arrears was $669,729.11 and that the Terhunes had until February 6, 2017 to cure the default by paying that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 On February 7, the Terhunes filed a lawsuit against U.S. Bank as trustee for LSF9 Master Participation Trust and Caliber\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to enjoin the trustee's sale and to quiet title in their property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Terhunes claimed that the notice of trustee's sale was invalid because the statute of limitations to enforce the promissory note and deed of trust had expired, and that the trustee did not have the authority to initiate a trustee's sale because U.S. Bank was not the holder of the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 U.S. Bank and Caliber filed a joint summary judgment motion. They argued that the statute of limitations had not expired because the loan was never accelerated. In support of their summary judgment motion, U.S. Bank and Caliber submitted the declaration of Nathaniel Mansi, a Caliber employee. Mansi stated that Countrywide did not accelerate the Terhunes' loan, and that \"[a]t no time has the Loan been accelerated.\" CP at 92. He also stated that Countrywide had endorsed the promissory note in blank and that U.S. Bank was the owner of and was in possession of the note. Mansi stated that he made his declaration based on personal knowledge and his review of Caliber's business records regarding the Terhune loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 The trial court granted the summary judgment motion. The Terhunes filed a motion for reconsideration\n   arguing that there was no evidence to support the trial court's ruling. The trial court denied reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 The Terhunes appeal the trial court's orders granting U.S. Bank's and Caliber's summary judgment motion and denying the Terhunes' motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.

Under RCW 7.28.300, \"[t]he record owner of real estate may maintain an action to quiet title against the lien of a mortgage or deed of trust on the real estate where an action to foreclose such mortgage or deed of trust would be barred by the statute of limitations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b632 Here, the Terhunes defaulted on their promissory note in February 2009, but the foreclosure proceedings at issue here were not initiated until October 2016. Therefore, if Countrywide accelerated the loan in 2009, the statute of limitations period may have run on enforcement of the note before the 2016 foreclosure action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we must determine whether the Terhunes presented any evidence to\n   establish an issue of fact regarding whether Countrywide accelerated the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b633 The Terhunes argue that Countrywide accelerated their obligations on the promissory note on February 17, 2009 when it sent the Terhunes the Notice of Intent to Accelerate. The notice stated that if the Terhunes did not cure the default before March 19, 2009, the mortgage payments \"\n   <strong>\n    will be accelerated\n   </strong>\n   .\" CP at 164. The Terhunes claim that Countrywide was conditionally electing to exercise its right to accelerate the payments, and that the Terhunes' failure to cure the default automatically triggered the acceleration of the loan. They assert that this language is sufficient to at least create a question of fact regarding whether acceleration occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b634 However, the evidence does not support the conclusion that Countrywide took an affirmative action in 2009 that clearly and unequivocally informed the Terhunes that the note had been accelerated. First, as the title of the document indicated, the Notice of Intent to Accelerate was a statement only of an\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to accelerate at some time in the future if the Terhunes did not cure. The notice stated that the note \"will\" be accelerated, CP at 164, not that the note\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   accelerated. The argument that the failure to cure automatically triggered acceleration is inconsistent with the rule that the lender must take some affirmative action to accelerate a note.\n   <em>\n    Merceri\n   </em>\n   , 4 Wash. App. 2d at 760,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12573464\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/434/84/\">\n    434 P.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b635 Second, there is no evidence that Countrywide ever gave the Terhunes formal notice that the note had been accelerated. The argument that such notice is not required is inconsistent with the rule that acceleration must be invoked clearly and unequivocally.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12573464\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/434/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b636 Third, in multiple subsequent statements and notices, BAC and Caliber made it clear that that they were seeking to recover past due installment payments, not the full balance of the loan. BAC's first notice to the Terhunes\n   in November 2009, eight months after the Terhunes claim acceleration occurred, stated that the past due amount was $86,382. BAC did not state that the full amount of the loan was due. The 2010 and 2015 notices of default both stated that the amount in arrears was the amount of the unpaid installments, not the full amount of the loan. All the notices in the 2010 and 2016 foreclosure were based on the past due installment payments rather than the full amount of the loan, and stated that payment\n   of the past due amounts could stop the foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b637 The Terhunes argue that certain notices from loan servicers stated the entire balance of the loan. They reference a July 6, 2011 letter from BAC stating that the Terhunes owed $1,830,002 on the loan without mentioning an option to bring the account current by making missed payments. But stating the outstanding balance on the loan does not mean that the full balance is immediately due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b638 Fourth, U.S. Bank and Caliber submitted the declaration of Mansi, who stated based on his review of the records for the Terhunes' loan that Countrywide did not accelerate the loan and that the loan had never been accelerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b639 Two cases from other divisions of our court have rejected arguments similar to the Terhunes' argument here. In\n   <em>\n    Merceri\n   </em>\n   , Division One addressed a bank's notice of intent to accelerate containing language identical to Countrywide's \"will be accelerated\" notice. 4 Wash.

Here, the notice of intent to accelerate used the same conditional language as in\n   <em>\n    Merceri\n   </em>\n   . And, unlike\n   <em>\n    Washington Federal\n   </em>\n   , Countrywide and its successors never indicated in a subsequent statement or notice that it was\n   seeking the entire balance of the mortgage. In addition, the deed of trust explicitly required the lender to give advance notice before accelerating the mortgage payments. A notice of\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to accelerate is such an advance notice, not an affirmative election. And a conditional statement that failure to cure the default\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   accelerate the loan in the future does not unequivocally alert the borrower that the\n   note holder\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   already elected to accelerate the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b643 We conclude that the Terhunes failed to establish a question of material fact whether Countrywide or its successors took an affirmative action that clearly and equivocally accelerated their promissory note and therefore that the statute of limitations had expired on U.S. Bank's foreclosure action. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting U.S. Bank's and Caliber's summary judgment motion with regard to the Terhunes' quiet title action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   C. HOLDER OF THE PROMISSORY NOTE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b644 The Terhunes argue that the trial court erred by ruling that U.S. Bank had authority to enforce the deed of trust. They argue that summary judgment is inappropriate because there was a question of material fact whether U.S. Bank is the holder of the promissory note. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   1. Legal Principles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b645 Chapter 62A RCW provides for the enforcement of negotiable instruments like promissory notes.

The beneficiary declaration signed by Caliber as attorney in fact for U.S. Bank states that U.S. Bank was the actual holder of the Terhunes' note.

Instead, it was signed by Caliber as the attorney in fact for U.S. Bank. The Terhunes emphasize that\n   RCW 61.24.030(7) requires the\n   <em>\n    beneficiary\n   </em>\n   of the note to sign the declaration, and not the beneficiary's agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b651 However, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bain v.

RCW 61.24.030(7)(a) provides that a beneficiary declaration stating that \"the beneficiary is the holder of any promissory note\n   <em>\n    or other obligation\n   </em>\n   secured by the deed of trust\" is sufficient proof that the beneficiary is the holder of the note. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, we conclude that the declaration language was not ambiguous and satisfied the statutory requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b656 Third, the Terhunes argue that the Mansi declaration is insufficient to prove that U.S. Bank had possession of the note because he was an employee of Caliber, not U.S. Bank, and lacked personal knowledge as to whether U.S. Bank actually had possession of the note. However, Caliber was the servicer of the Terhunes' loan and Mansi reviewed Caliber's business records regarding the loan. Therefore, he did have personal knowledge based on that review regarding the promissory note. And there is no requirement that only the holder can present evidence regarding possession of the note. The Terhunes' arguments may go to the weight of Mansi's testimony, but they presented no evidence to refute it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b657 We hold that the Terhunes failed to establish a question of material fact as to whether U.S. Bank was the holder of the Terhunes' promissory note and therefore had\n   authority to foreclose on the note. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting U.S. Bank's and Caliber's summary judgment motion with regard to the Terhunes' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   D. MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b658 The Terhunes argue that the trial court erred in denying their reconsideration motion. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b659 CR 59(a) provides nine grounds under which a party can move for reconsideration of a trial court's decision.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Christian v. Tohmeh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460970\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/191/709/#p728\">\n    191 Wash.

Under CR 59(a)(7), a party may argue that there is no evidence or reasonable inference from the evidence to support the trial court's ruling. We review a trial court's\n   decision on a reconsideration motion for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Fed. Home Loan Bank of Seattle v. RBS Sec., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3 Wash. App. 2d 642, 648,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567489\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/168/\">\n    418 P.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). A trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable, based on untenable grounds, or unsupported by the record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567489\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/168/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b660 The Terhunes argued on reconsideration that at a minimum U.S. Bank could not recover installment payments not made before October 2010 based on the statute of limitations. On appeal, the Terhunes argue that the trial court erred in rejecting this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b661 The Terhunes may be correct that the statute of limitations had run on their earlier missed installment payments because the claim on those payments accrued when they were missed. But U.S. Bank was not seeking to \"recover\" any payments; it was seeking a nonjudicial foreclosure of the Terhunes' property. A trustee's sale is allowed if \"a\" default has occurred on the secured obligation, RCW 61.24.030(3), and therefore U.S. Bank was entitled to foreclose based on the later missed payments. And the Terhunes generally cannot be held personally liable in a nonjudicial foreclosure action. RCW 61.24.100(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Therefore, whether some of the earlier payments were subject to the statute of limitations is immaterial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b662 The Terhunes also argued on reconsideration that there was no evidence to support the trial court's summary judgment ruling that U.S. Bank was the holder of the note. However, as discussed above, the evidence showed that U.S. Bank was the holder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b663 Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying the Terhunes' motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   E. ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b664 U.S. Bank and Caliber request attorney fees on appeal. We may grant an award of reasonable attorney fees under RAP 18.1(a) if allowed under the applicable law. The prevailing party in a breach of contract action can recover reasonable attorney fees if the contract specifically provides for such an award.\n   <em>\n    4518 S. 256th\n   </em>\n   , 195 Wash. App. at 446,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%201\">\n    382 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . U.S. Bank and Caliber apparently rely on the attorney fee provision in the promissory note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b665 The only provision in the promissory note regarding attorney fees is paragraph 7(E) which states, \"If the Note Holder has required [the borrower] to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note Holder will have the right to be paid back by [the borrower] for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this Note. ... Those expenses include, for example, reasonable attorneys' fees.\" CP at 96. This provision allows for the recovery of attorney fees only if the note obligations have been accelerated. Because we hold above that the note was not accelerated, U.S. Bank is not entitled to recover attorney fees under the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b666 The Terhunes also request attorney fees and costs on appeal under the note. Because we affirm the trial court's\n   orders, the Terhunes are not entitled to recover attorney fees and costs because they are not the substantially prevailing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b667 We affirm the trial court's orders granting U.S. Bank's and Caliber's summary judgment motion and denying the Terhunes' motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   LEE, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   CRUSER, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The lawsuit also named North Cascade Trustee Services, Inc., the trustee of the deed of trust, as a defendant.

Because we hold that the note was not accelerated, we do not address this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The Terhunes argue that whether the statute of limitations has expired on earlier missed payments may be relevant if their house sells for more than the outstanding balance of their loan. We do not address whether the statute of limitations would apply to earlier missed payments if U.S. Bank attempts directly or indirectly to recover the amount of those payments in the foreclosure proceeding. Instead, that issue can be addressed in the foreclosure proceeding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
