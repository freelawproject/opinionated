The State and Defendant stipulated that \"Defendant ... took the life of Michael Grube on or about April 11, 2003, and amputated Mr. Grube's penis, scrotum and testes.\" Defendant was charged with an open count of murder and tampering with evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {4} Roughly three years later, in June 2006, the parties stipulated that (1) Defendant was incompetent to stand trial and dangerous; (2) there was not a substantial probability that he would attain competency within a reasonable period of time; (3) there was clear and convincing evidence that he committed second degree murder; (4) aggravating circumstances existed; and (5) the court should enter an order of commitment for a period not to exceed eighteen years-a term based on the fifteen-year sentence for second-degree murder with an additional three years for aggravated circumstances. Defendant has been housed at the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute from the date of arrest to the present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {5} Approximately eight years later, Defendant was found competent to proceed to trial. However, shortly before trial was to begin, questions about Defendant's competency to stand trial were raised during a motion hearing. The district court vacated the trial setting and instead held an evidentiary hearing in April 2016 pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 31-9-1.5 (1999) to determine the sufficiency of the evidence for the two charges in this case: an open count of murder and tampering with evidence. After the hearing, the parties stipulated that the evidence was clear and convincing that Defendant had committed the crime of second-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {6} At a commitment hearing in February 2017, the district court took additional evidence regarding mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Based on evidence at the April 2016 and February 2017 hearings, the district court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4. The Defendant committed the murder of [Decedent] with extreme viciousness\n   and brutality, as evidenced by testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing on April 11th, 2016 and the commitment hearing on February 24th, 2017; to include the near decapitation of the body, the removal of the genitals, the stabbing of the anus, as well as the numerous wounds to [Decedent]'s head and torso;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   6. ... Defendant committed the murder of [Decedent] while in a state of psychosis as evidenced by expert testimony at the evidentiary hearing on April 11th, 2016 and the commitment hearing on February 24th, 2017. Based on evidence at those same hearings, ... Defendant had also previously attacked his brother while in a state of psychosis. If released without supervision, there is a danger that ... Defendant would be medically non-compliant and his psychosis would return, thereby creating a threat of harm to the community[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court also found that both \"[t]he brutality and viciousness with which this crime was committed\" and \"[the] threat to community safety\" were \"valid aggravating factor[s] by which to increase Defendant's commitment to the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute (NMBHI) [.]\" Based on these findings, the district court ordered Defendant to be committed to NMBHI for fifteen years (the basic sentence for second-degree murder) plus five years for aggravating circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMSA 1978, \u00a7 31-18-15(A)(4) (2016) (stating that the sentence for a second-degree felony resulting in death is fifteen years); NMSA 1978, \u00a7 31-18-15.1(A) (2009) (permitting alteration of a basic sentence up to one-third based on aggravating or mitigating circumstances).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    The New Mexico Mental Illness and Competency Code (NMMIC)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {7} The NMMIC has two purposes: \"to protect an incompetent defendant from indefinite and unjust commitment to a mental health institution without due process of law and to protect society from dangerous criminals.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Legislature made clear that a sentence may consist of a \"basic\" sentence plus additional terms of imprisonment to be imposed after assessment of additional factors. For example, Section 31-18-15(A) defines the \"basic sentences\" for felonies and Section 31-18-15(B) provides for alteration of those basic sentences: \"The appropriate basic sentence of imprisonment shall be imposed upon a person convicted and sentenced pursuant to Subsection A of this section, unless the court alters the sentence pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Sentencing Act.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31-18-15.1 (\"The judge may alter the basic sentence as prescribed in Section 31-18-15\" upon certain findings); \u00a7 31-18-17 (providing that a \"basic sentence shall be increased\" by given periods for habitual offenders).

In that case, the same evidence supported both the district court's finding that the defendant committed child abuse and aggravated battery and its finding that the defendant was dangerous.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {16} Defendant contends that his enhanced sentence cannot be justified on the ground that the circumstances surrounding the crime demonstrated that Defendant is dangerous because \"dangerousness is a separate-and predicate finding-required before the incompetent defendant may be committed for treatment.\" Defendant provides no support for the idea that, having determined that a defendant is dangerous as a predicate to commitment, the district court may not also consider the circumstances of the defendant's conduct, and their bearing on defendant's future dangerousness, in determining the term of commitment. Contrary to Defendant's argument,\n   <em>\n    Chorney\n   </em>\n   held that a defendant's dangerousness relates directly to the term of commitment, stating, \"The 'maximum sentence' ... addresses the possible dangerousness\n   of an incompetent defendant and provides the outer limits for commitment for the purpose of protecting society.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352304\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/130/638/\">\n    2001-NMCA-050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352304\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/130/638/\">\n    130 N.M. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352304\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/130/638/\">\n    29 P.3d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that the enhancement here was congruent with the NMMIC because the brutality of the conduct and prior violent conduct by Defendant are \"specific marker[s] of dangerousness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {17} Defendant makes one final argument: he argues that aggravating circumstances relate to a defendant's culpability and that a commitment term enhancement based on such culpability is inappropriately punitive and violates due process. The problem with this argument is that it fails to recognize that, in the criminal sentencing context, all sentences are based on the defendant's culpability. In other words, \"as applied to sane defendants, all sentences of imprisonment, whether measured by an extended term or not, have as their goals punishment and deterrence.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

However, Defendant rightly does not argue that commitment for the period of the basic sentence is improperly punitive, as our Supreme Court has stated that \"commitment pursuant to Section 31-9-1.5 is not punishment[.]\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Adonis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242007\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/102/\">\n    2008-NMSC-059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242007\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/102/\">\n    145 N.M. 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242007\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/145/102/\">\n    194 P.3d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).
