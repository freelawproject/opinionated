We address the following issue, and reverse and remand:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Anderson's motion to strike juror M.J. for cause?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 On August 20, 2015, Bruce Anderson and Shelley Locher spent the evening socializing and drinking alcohol. Afterward, Anderson drove Locher back to her house on his motorcycle. Locher could only recall \"snapshots\" of what happened next. She described being physically\n   incapacitated but cognizant of Anderson climbing through her bedroom window, lying in bed beside her, and then leaving the next morning. She also described feeling \"very sore\" and swollen throughout her \"whole lower pelvic area\" including inside and outside her vagina. According to Locher, Anderson returned to her house later that day, walked downstairs to the basement where she was doing laundry, and grabbed her breasts. Locher claims she pushed Anderson away and told him to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Locher told law enforcement about the alleged assault in November 2015 and participated in a forensic interview. The State filed charges against Anderson in January 2016, alleging he entered Locher's residence through the window and engaged in sexual intercourse with her without her consent. A jury trial was held in March 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 During voir dire, the prospective jurors were asked general questions about whether they could follow the instructions and law given to them by the judge, and render a verdict after listening to the evidence. Defense counsel explained the presumption of innocence and Anderson's right not to testify and asked, \"Would anybody hold that against Mr. Anderson if he doesn't testify?\" In response, Defense counsel noted, \"Everybody's shaking their heads no.\" At the close of voir dire, the District Court informed the jury panel that they would be asked to leave the courtroom while the attorneys exercised preemptory challenges and then brought back in, at which time the final jury members would be seated. Before dismissing the jurors, the District Court said, \"don't be talking about the case among yourselves. Don't be forming or expressing an opinion about the case. Just talk about the weather, what you saw on TV last night as long as it's not about the case.\" After the jurors left, the parties each exercised their preemptory challenges. The District Court confirmed the list of selected jurors, and asked for all the potential jurors to be brought back into the courtroom to be seated and sworn in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 During the short recess before seating of the jurors, the bailiff informed the court that a juror, M.J., had stated to the bailiff that \"he is pretty sure the Defendant is guilty\" based upon the juror's assessment of the wording used by defense counsel during voir dire. The court immediately held a meeting in chambers with counsel to discuss the juror's comments. The court said, \"I guess the State would say, let's proceed. Got a juror saying the guy's guilty before we even have any evidence. What's the Defense say about it?\" Defense counsel suggested M.J. be dismissed for cause. The court asked for M.J. to be brought into chambers for questioning by the parties and noted a\n   different juror from the panel could be substituted if the court decided to dismiss him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 During questioning in chambers, the State asked M.J. whether he had already formed an opinion about the culpability of Anderson. M.J. stated, \"I have a leaning.\" When asked to clarify, he said, \"Yeah, like, like just based upon how Defense counsel was asking questions to all jurors. There was a few wordings [sic] that made me uh believe I know how he's going to push the defense-what, what the main arguments are going to entail.\" M.J. continued, \"I don't know if I could be able to push those sort of things all the way to the side.\" The State asked M.J. if he could listen to the evidence, follow the judge's instructions, and suspend his decision until the close of trial when all the evidence has been presented. M.J. responded, \"I think I can 100 percent try, but life moves forward and there's certain things from my past, that all of our lives that we can't not [sic] remove.\" He continued, \"I can do my absolute best and if I'm selected I will 100 percent try to be as entirely [sic] as I can.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Defense counsel asked M.J. whether he was bothered that Anderson may not testify. M.J. responded, \"Uh that's one of the things. The, the belief that, that an innocent man has nothing to hide prevails slightly above-the idea of uh being accidentally trapped by a trick question from, from the other side and\n   counsel.\" When asked whether he can \"be impartial and not make up [his] mind until [he] hear[s] all the evidence,\" M.J. said, \"I believe I could. I do believe that. There just is a slight bit of preconception stepping in, forward now. And that's, that's why I told the Bailiff why, what I wanted you to be aware of.\" Defense counsel then moved to strike M.J. for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The court then advised M.J. that he was being questioned because of his comment to the bailiff that he possessed a \"leaning\" that Anderson was guilty. M.J. said, \"I believe the words that I told him was I believe how, I know how the Defense is going to argue and then that leads me to believe they are coming from a more defensive standpoint than just purely we're going to lay down the facts for you to decipher.\" The court then had the following colloquy with M.J.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   COURT: Alright, well the way trials work and if I may be so bold is that jurors and other people sit there and they listen to a witness and the witness says something. And they go, oh that witness must be telling the truth and then they listen to another witness and they go, hmm boy maybe that one's telling the truth. And you hear argument from the State, and oh boy that sure sounded good or that didn't make any sense to me and then the other guy argues, and oh I like that or I didn't like it. The ball\n   goes back and forth and uh you know, my concern is, is that you seem to have kind of start [sic] to formulate an opinion when you haven't heard anything yet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   My question to you is do you think you can imagine how important it is we're going to determine whether or not Mr. Anderson is guilty or not guilty of criminal charges. Can you sit on that jury, listen to all the evidence, not make-form any opinion until you've heard everything, you've heard all the arguments of counsel and not form any opinion about it and you keep an open mind. A completely open mind on all the issues that you're going to be asked to decide, guilt or innocence. Guilty or not guilty. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Listen to all my instructions. Consider all the evidence. But not form any opinion until you get into the jury room and you're told now you can deliberate. Can you keep an open mind and be a fair juror in that manner?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   M.J.: I can absolutely keep an open mind\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   COURT: So that's a yes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   M.J.: Yes, yes to your question, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   COURT: Alright, so I don't need to be concerned about the comment you made to [the bailiff]? If you started to form an opinion you're going to uh, you can put that aside and be a fair and equitable juror, wait until it's submitted to you to form an opinion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   M.J.: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   COURT: Alright, the requested exemption is denied. [M.J.] is a qualified juror.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the court denied defense counsel's motion to strike M.J. for cause, the trial resumed with the jury being empaneled and sworn, including M.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b69 The jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts. Following trial, Anderson obtained new counsel who filed two motions for a new trial because of alleged juror bias and improper jury instructions relating to the applicable mental states of sexual intercourse without consent and burglary. The District Court denied both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b610 Anderson appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b611 We review a district court's denial of a challenge for cause for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State answers that\n   by expressing his opinion as a \"leaning,\" M.J. demonstrated that he held no fixed opinion of Anderson's guilt but merely possessed a \"slight bit of preconception.\" Additionally, the State argues that M.J.'s comment, \"an innocent man has nothing to hide,\" does not mean he is unable to be fair and impartial. Rather, when read in context with M.J.'s admission of holding \"a slight bit of preconception,\" the State contends that M.J. was merely voicing a concern about impartiality, which should not be cause for removal, citing\n   <em>\n    Jay\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20 (\"[A] juror should not be removed merely because [he] voices a concern about being impartial-every person comes to jury duty with preconceptions.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 In\n   <em>\n    Jay\n   </em>\n   , we considered the difference between a juror who should\n   be disqualified because of a \"fixed opinion\" of the defendant's guilt and a juror who has \"mere preconceptions\" and thus, remains qualified to serve.\n   <em>\n    Jay\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21.\n   <em>\n    Jay\n   </em>\n   offers an example of the latter.

I believe I could. I do believe that. There just is a slight bit of preconception stepping in, forward now. And that's, that's why I told the Bailiff why, what I wanted you to be aware of.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b620 Our review of the record, based on a totality of circumstances, reveals a troubling pattern that should have resulted in M.J.'s removal. M.J.'s statements raised serious questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial juror. Unlike the jurors in\n   <em>\n    Jay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Falls Down\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Champagne\n   </em>\n   , M.J. did not relinquish his opinion of Anderson's guilt during substantial chambers questioning, but instead, reaffirmed this leaning or tacitly resisted recanting it several times. Considered together, M.J.'s statements are closer to the disqualifying answers given by the jurors in\n   <em>\n    DeVore\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . M.J.'s answers called into\n   question whether he could serve as a juror \"with entire impartiality and without prejudice\" toward Anderson. Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. While the State focuses on M.J.'s assurance, at the end of the court's chamber questioning, that he could \"absolutely keep an open mind,\" we conclude that M.J.'s multiple, spontaneous answers to previous questions were \"most likely to be reliable and honest\" indicators of his state of mind.\n   <em>\n    Jay\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19 (internal quotations and citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeVore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b621 Therefore, we conclude the District Court abused its discretion in denying Anderson's motion to dismiss M.J. for cause. The error is structural in nature, requiring reversal.\n   <em>\n    Swan v.

Anderson was charged with committing burglary in violation of \u00a7 45-6-204(1)(b), MCA, which includes two mental state requirements. A person commits burglary if (1) he \"knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in an occupied structure\"; and (2) \"knowingly or purposely commits any other offense within that structure.\" The burglary statute and the state's model jury instruction for the statute enumerate this two-part mental state requirement. Here, the District Court's instruction on the elements of the offense of burglary provided a singular mental state: \"To convict the Defendant of the charge of burglary, the State must prove the following elements: 1. That the Defendant knowingly entered or remained unlawfully in an occupied structure; AND 2. That the Defendant committed the offense of sexual intercourse without consent therein.\" Although we make no ruling on the parties' arguments related to the interpretation and applicability of\n    <em>\n     State v.
