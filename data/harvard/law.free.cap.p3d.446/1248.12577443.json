The Honorable William D. LaFortune, District Judge, presided over Tafolla's jury trial and sentenced him, in accordance with the jury's verdict, to life imprisonment on Count 1 and thirty days in the county jail on Count 2. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently.

Around 11th Street and Highway 169 they saw a white male, Jestin Tafolla, straddling a black male who was on his back on the sidewalk. Tafolla was hitting the victim repeatedly in the face and the detectives could see the victim's head bouncing off the sidewalk with each blow. The detectives activated the lights on their car and drove up to the two men. When Tafolla saw the detectives approach, he stood up, pulled brass knuckles off of his hand, and threw them into the grass ten to fifteen feet away. The officers\n   separated and handcuffed both men as they tried to figure out what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b64 The victim told the detectives that he had been driving on the highway and had been cut off. This upset him and he followed the car that cut him off. When the car driven by Tafolla pulled over, both men got out of their vehicles and the two engaged in a heated argument. After they exchanged words they walked back to their cars. As the victim walked toward his car, the occupant of Tafolla's car, Lara Maloy, yelled at him and called him a \"n----r.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim lost his cool; he grabbed a QuikTrip cup half filled with soda from his vehicle and threw the soda toward Tafolla's vehicle at Maloy. As the victim was verbally confronting Maloy, Tafolla sucker punched him in the back of the head. The victim did not remember much after the initial blow. His head was bleeding profusely; he had lacerations in both the front and back of his head. When he spoke with the detectives he was disoriented, dazed, upset, and confused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b65 When Detective Dawson approached Tafolla he noticed that Tafolla was heavily tattooed. Dawson thought that the tattoos might indicate a gang affiliation and because he noted a cloverleaf tattoo he asked Tafolla if he was a member of the Irish Mob. Taffolla was angered by the question and pointed out his swastika tattoo; he told Dawson that he was UAB (Universal Aryan Brotherhood). The brass knuckles retrieved from the grass had wolf heads across the knuckle with sharp pointed ears on the wolves. Dawson testified at trial that members of UAB refer to themselves as the \"wolf pack.\" Dawson noted that in addition to significant lacerations on his face, the victim had a row of lacerations across the back of his head in the shape of a wolf's head; the head and sharp ears from the brass knuckles were cut into the back of his head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b66 When Tafolla and Maloy told the detectives what had happened, their accounts of how the altercation began were similar to the victim's but their stories of how it escalated at the end were different. Lara testified at trial that after her husband and the victim \"had words\" in the parking lot they shook hands and went back to their own cars. She testified that the victim backed his car up and started calling her names. She said that he stopped his car, grabbed something from the car and started walking toward her. At this point Tafolla intervened. The victim threw a cup at Tafolla's face and started hitting and punching him. She testified that Tafolla only hit the victim because he was attacked by the victim first. She denied calling the victim a racial epithet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b67 Tafolla testified at trial. He said that after he and the victim got within a few feet of each other the victim's demeanor changed; he became less aggressive possibly because he saw Tafolla's visible tattoos. The victim \"went from very aggressive to second guessing his behavior.\" Tafolla said that after their heated exchange of words, he and the victim calmed down and shook hands. When he returned to his car, Lara was standing outside the vehicle. He told her to get back in the car and as he and Lara were bickering back and forth the victim drove by and said, \"yeah, get your bitch cuz.\" Tafolla testified that Lara started yelling at the victim who stopped, got out of his car, reached back into his car and started grabbing for something. Tafolla grabbed his brass knuckles. The victim threw his drink on Tafolla and punched him in the mouth. The two began to fight and were engaged in mutual combat. He testified that they were on their feet \"engaging in hand-to-hand combat.\" Tafolla denied ever hitting the victim from behind and he surmised that the injuries on the back of the victim's head occurred when the victim ducked his head during the fight. Tafolla testified that when the victim fell to the ground he got right back up again. Tafolla denied sitting on the victim and beating his face. He testified that the detectives' testimony to the contrary was wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b68 Prior to trial the prosecution gave notice that it intended to introduce evidence of other crimes or bad acts at trial. This included\n   evidence that Tafolla was a member of the Universal Aryan Brotherhood (UAB) - a white supremacist prison gang. Tafolla argues that the evidence of his gang affiliation was inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b69 The State asserted below that evidence of Tafolla's involvement in the UAB gang was admissible to show motive, common scheme, design, or purpose, identity, and bias. Despite the extensive pretrial discussion and argument, the gang related evidence about which Tafolla complains in this proposition was not met with objection when it was introduced at trial. Accordingly, we review the admission of this evidence for plain error only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowery v.

The gang evidence in this case was not introduced to label Tafolla as a criminal without showing that he engaged in criminal activity; it was introduced to provide a context and explanation for the criminal act he committed.

Tafolla's statement about his gang affiliation was closely connected to the charged offense. It was necessary to give the jury a complete understanding of the crime and was central to the chain of events. Tafolla's statement about his UAB affiliation, viewed with evidence of his numerous tattoos of white supremacist symbols and the brass knuckles also bearing a symbol associated with white supremacists provided an alternative explanation of why the confrontation escalated from an uneventful parting to a brutal\n   beating.

After it was determined that the victim did not have a weapon, his handcuffs were removed so that he could hold a t-shirt to his head wounds to apply pressure to the bleeding. The detectives called for an ambulance and while they were waiting for it to arrive Detective Dawson asked the victim what had happened. Clearly, the circumstances under which the victim was questioned cannot be characterized as formal. However, it is fair to say that the victim's statements were not made to enable the police to meet an ongoing emergency; the situation had deescalated and was no longer an emergency. A reasonable person could determine from the fact that detectives had arrived during an ongoing assault, secured the individuals involved, and asked questions to determine what had happened, that the detective's intent was to secure testimonial evidence. Despite the lack of formality, a reasonable person in the victim's position could understand that the detective's questions were investigative in nature and foresee that his response might be used in the prosecution of a crime. Thus, the statements were testimonial and absent a showing that the victim was unavailable and that Tafolla had prior opportunity to cross examine him, Detective Dawson's testimony about what the victim told him had happened violated Tafolla's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b622 Again, because Tafolla did not raise this issue below, he has waived all but plain error. Detective Dawson's testimony about what the victim told him about the assault repeated testimonial hearsay and violated Tafolla's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him and was plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7334643\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/313/934/\">\n    2013 OK CR 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 104-05,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7334643\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/313/934/\">\n    313 P.3d at 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (clear violation of Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was plain error).

It was therefore entirely proper for the prosecution to cross-examine him about two prior attacks which also targeted minorities. The testimony\n   at issue was admissible as it was relevant and material to impeach Tafolla's credibility as a witness, to help prove the State's theory of the case, and to rebut his proffered defense.
