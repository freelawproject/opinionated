We address the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate and by denying Kluver's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On September 13, 1977, Genie Land Company (Genie) was incorporated by its first president, Genie Philbrick Fulmer. Fulmer was the grandmother of brothers Charles Kelly Kluver (Kelly) and Karson Kluver (Karson). On June 4, 2005, after Fulmer passed, Kelly and Karson became the sole shareholders of Genie. Each received one-half of Genie's corporate stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 When Kelly and Karson became the sole shareholders, Article IV, Section 4 of Genie's corporate by-laws contained a transfer restriction provision, which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Shares of stock shall be transferred only on the books of the company by the holder thereof and may be transferred only to (1) the corporation, (2) one or more descendants of GENIE PHILBRICK FULMER, or (3) a third party, however, any transfer to a third person who is not already a stockholder in the corporation must be approved in advance by vote or written consent of all of the remaining stockholders of the corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Further, upon the death of any stockholder, the corporation shall have the right to redeem the stock at its book value and for this purpose, book value is defined as the amount at which stock is carried in the books of the corporation on the basis of tangible assets and any undivided profits, but not including intangible assets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Article I, Section 8 of Genie's by-laws additionally provided that: \"Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof.\" Finally, Article VII, Section 1 of Genie's by-laws provided that: \"Amendments to these by-laws may be made by a vote of the stockholders representing a two-thirds majority of all the stock issued outstanding at any annual stockholders meeting; or at any special stockholders meeting ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 During Kelly's lifetime, he and his wife Barbara Needham were concerned that Genie's by-law's transfer restriction provision would prevent Kelly's family members from inheriting his one-half interest in Genie if he was the first of the two brothers to die. Subsequently, Kelly and Karson discussed amending Genie's by-laws to ensure each of the brother's families would inherit their respective share of Genie's stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 In 2010, Kelly retained counsel to review Genie's by-laws. Counsel advised that\n   the current by-laws had the potential to undervalue each brother's half interest depending on who died first because it allowed for each brother's respective share of stock to be redeemed by the corporation at book value, which would be significantly lower than fair market value. Counsel recommended amending Genie's by-laws. However, neither brother took immediate action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 In November 2012, Karson began suffering from significant medical issues that he feared were life-threatening. On November 16, 2012, Kelly and Karson signed and entered into a written agreement (2012 Agreement) in which both agreed that: \"[We] each want our shares in Genie Land Company to go to our respective families, and we are in agreement that by-laws or anything else should not prevent this in case of death of one of us or both or [sic] us.\" At the time the 2012 Agreement was executed, Karson and Kelly were the sole shareholders, directors, and officers of Genie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 On January 6, 2017, Kelly unexpectedly died. Needham was appointed personal representative of his Estate. On February 15, 2017, Kelly's Last Will and Testament was admitted to probate. In his will, Kelly devised his residuary estate to Needham, which included his\n   stock in Genie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 On June 28, 2017, Karson and Needham attended a joint meeting of the shareholders and directors of Genie. By unanimous vote, Karson and Needham were elected to serve as directors and co-presidents of Genie. Karson and Needham agreed to a reduction in the number of directors and discussed options for an orderly division of the corporate assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 On August 29, 2017, Needham was informed by Karson's counsel that Karson had decided: (1) the 2012 Agreement was unenforceable and not executed in strict accordance with Genie's by-laws; (2) Needham was not entitled to any ownership in Genie; and (3) Karson disavowed his obligations under the 2012 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 On September 8, 2018, the Estate filed a Verified Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and for Dissolution of Genie against Kluver. The Complaint alleged four counts: (I) Declaratory Judgment; (II) Breach of Contract; (III) Promissory Estoppel; and (IV) Judicial Dissolution of Corporation. On December 11, 2017, the Estate filed for partial summary judgment on Counts I, II, and III, seeking a declaratory judgment that Needham was entitled to Kelly's interest in Genie pursuant to the 2012 Agreement, and arguing that Karson had breached the 2012 Agreement. On January 2, 2018, Kluver filed a response and cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the 2012 Agreement was unenforceable and did not constitute a proper amendment to Genie's by-laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 On April 5, 2018, the District Court granted partial summary judgment in the Estate's favor on Counts I and II and denied Kluver's cross-motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The District Court ruled that Needham was entitled to a declaratory judgment, that she is the rightful owner of Kelly's interest in Genie, that Karson breached the 2012 Agreement by impeding the transfer of Kelly's stock to Needham, and that Karson must specifically perform his obligations under the 2012 Agreement. The District Court additionally held that Count III of the Estate's Complaint was moot following its resolution of the first two counts. On October 16, 2018, the District Court found that all issues relating to Genie's stock ownership had been determined in its Order granting summary judgment, certified its decision as a final judgment for purposes of appeal, and bifurcated the Estate's Judicial Dissolution of Corporation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 We review a district court's summary judgment ruling de novo, applying the criteria of M.

Any party to a written contract, or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a contract, may have its construction and validity determined and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations from a district court. Sections 27-8-201, -202, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11. A district court has the statutory authority to construe the terms of a contract, either before or after a breach. Section 27-8-203, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 Under Montana law, a contract exists where there are: (1) identifiable parties capable of contracting; (2) consent of the parties; (3) a lawful object; and (4) a sufficient cause or consideration. Section 28-2-102, MCA. The consent of the parties to a contract must be free, mutual, and \"communicated by each to the other.\" Section 28-2-301, MCA. Sufficient consideration is exchanged where \"[a]ny benefit conferred or agreed to be conferred upon the promisor by any other person, to which the promisor is not lawfully entitled, or [where] any prejudice suffered or agreed to be suffered by the person, other than prejudice that the person is at the time of consent lawfully bound to suffer, as an inducement to the promisor ....\" Section 28-2-801, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 Under Montana corporate law, the shareholders may amend a corporation's by-laws without a meeting if all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action consent.

The District Court additionally held that the 2012 Agreement was a valid, unambiguous, and enforceable contract that Karson breached by failing to transfer Kelly's shares to Needham. Finally, the District Court held that the 2012 Agreement effectively amended Genie's by-laws due to Kelly and Karson's unanimous consent, as the sole stockholders of Genie, to a new stock transfer provision, as reflected in the 2012 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 Kluver generally argues that the District Court relied on disputed facts in granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate. Kluver argues that the 2012 Agreement was an invalid amendment to Genie's by-laws because (1) it was entered absent the formality required by Genie's by-laws and Montana corporate law, and (2) the 2012 Agreement was ambiguous. Kluver additionally argues that the 2012 Agreement did not constitute a\n   valid contract because Karson was not competent to enter into the 2012 Agreement in 2012 due to his health scare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 The Estate counters that Genie's by-laws did not require a formal amendment to modify transfer of its stock, and that the 2012 Agreement was a valid contract. Therefore, the Estate argues that Needham is entitled to Kelly's half of Genie's stock pursuant to Kelly's will. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 The formation of the 2012 Agreement created a valid contract that entitled Needham to Kelly's shares of stock after his death. The 2012\n   Agreement was valid because: (1) Karson and Kelly were identifiable parties; (2) Karson and Kelly's consent to the 2012 Agreement was free and mutual-despite his allegations, Karson failed to present evidence that he entered into the 2012 Agreement by mistake or that he was under duress in 2012 due to his health scare; (3) the 2012 Agreement had a lawful object, that being the transfer of corporate stock in accordance with the by-laws of a corporation; and (4) Karson and Kelly exchanged sufficient consideration when they gave up their ability to solely own Genie upon the death of the other brother in exchange for the assurance that their respective families would receive each brother's interest in Genie regardless of their order of death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 28-2-102, -301, -801, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b623 Genie's by-laws make clear that its stock can be transferred to any third-party, without amendment, so long as it is approved \"in advance by vote or written consent of all the remaining stockholders of the corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 35-1-236(2), MCA (\"[t]he bylaws of a corporation may contain any provision for managing the business and regulating the affairs of the corporation that is consistent with law or the articles of incorporation. ...\"). Kelly and Karson were the sole stockholders of Genie when they signed and entered into the written 2012 Agreement relating to the transfer of Genie's stock. Therefore, both Kelly and Karson validly approved the stock transfer arrangement in the 2012 Agreement under Genie's by-laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 35-1-236(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 Although a formal amendment was not required to modify the transfer of Genie's corporate stock under its by-laws, Kelly and Karson undertook the 2012 Agreement with the formality required for amendments under Genie's by-laws and under Montana law. The 2012 Agreement was made by a stockholder vote at a meeting representing a two-thirds majority of all the stock issued, satisfying Genie's by-law requirement for amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 35-1-236(2), MCA. Similarly, under Montana law, a formal meeting to amend Genie's by-laws was not required if all of the shareholders entitled to vote on the action consented-which occurred with the formation of the 2012 Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 35-1-519(1), MCA.
