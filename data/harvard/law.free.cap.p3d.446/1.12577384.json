According to plaintiffs, the common-law doctrines of public trust and public use protect the public's right to enter the lake, and the city's restrictions on access to the lake are contrary to those common-law doctrines. Plaintiffs also contend that the city's restrictions violate the Equal Privileges and Immunities guarantee of the Oregon Constitution, Article I, section 20. Defendants are the City of Lake Oswego and the State of Oregon, as well as the Lake Oswego Corporation, which holds title to riparian rights to the lake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case reaches this\n   court following a summary judgment in which the trial court assumed that the lake is among the public waterways to which the doctrine of public trust or public use applies but held that neither those doctrines nor Article I, section 20, entitle plaintiffs to the declarations that they seek. The Court of Appeals affirmed, also without deciding whether the lake is a public waterway and this court allowed review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We conclude that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment on plaintiffs' Article I, section 20, challenges. We also conclude that neither the public trust nor the public use doctrine grants plaintiffs a right to enter the swim park property and that the public use doctrine does not grant plaintiffs a right to access the water from the waterfront parks. But we conclude that, if Oswego Lake is among the navigable waterways that the state holds in trust for the public, then neither the state nor the city may unreasonably interfere with the public's right to enter the water from the abutting waterfront parks. Accordingly, the case\n   must be remanded for resolution of the preliminary question of whether the lake is subject to the public trust doctrine and, if the lake is subject to that trust, then for resolution of the factual dispute regarding whether the city's restriction on entering the lake from the waterfront parks unreasonably interferes with the public's right to enter the lake from the abutting waterfront parks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Most of the land surrounding Oswego Lake is privately owned, but the city has an interest in four properties that abut the lake. Along an area of the lake known as Lakewood Bay, the city has created three waterfront parks, called Millennium Plaza Park, Sundeleaf Plaza, and Headlee Walkway. The fourth property is a small swim park on city land abutting the shore of the main lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Recorded ownership claims to the land surrounding Oswego Lake date to 1850, when two early settlers staked a federal Donation Land Claim to land abutting what was then called Sucker Lake. Eventually, a company called Oregon Iron &amp; Steel acquired all of the property surrounding the lake and, over time, built dams and an artificial channel. Those projects increased the lake to its current size. In the early 20th century, Oregon Iron &amp; Steel created a residential development around the lake. In doing so, the company platted subdivisions and changed the lake's name to \"Oswego Lake.\" When the company sold off the lots abutting the lake, it reserved to itself ownership of the riparian rights and then transferred those rights to Lake Oswego Corporation, whose shareholders-waterfront property owners and others-pay dues in exchange for access to the lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the same era, Oregon Iron &amp; Steel deeded two parcels of waterfront land to the city, with a covenant that the land was to be used \"by the resident children of Lake Oswego\" for purposes of recreation. Those parcels became the swim park, which is open during July and August each year. The swim park land is fenced on three sides and bordered on the water side by a fenced dock, which creates a small, enclosed swimming area-smaller than an Olympic-size pool-and prevents access from the park to the open\n   lake. The city limits use of the park to city residents and limits water activities to swimming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   More recently, the city acquired the properties on which the three downtown, waterfront parks are located. Two of those parks, Headlee Walkway and Sundeleaf Plaza, have physical barriers that prohibit entry into the water. Millennium Plaza Park, which the city acquired through condemnation, has steps that lead from the park to the water. Millennium Plaza Park also has a grassy area from which plaintiff Prager entered the lake in the past. Although the waterfront parks are open to the public, the city has prominently posted signs at Millennium Plaza Park announcing,\n   \"Private Lake. Please stay on the steps.\" The city also passed a resolution prohibiting entry into the water from the city's waterfront parks. That resolution provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"It is prohibited for any person to enter Oswego Lake from Millennium Plaza Park, Sundeleaf Plaza or the Headlee Walkway by any means or method, including, without limitation, by wading or swimming, or by using water vessels or other floatation devices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"20.\n   <em>\n    Leaving the Pathway Portion of the Headlee Walkway\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"It is prohibited for any person to leave the pathway portion of the Headlee Walkway when using that facility, or to climb, traverse, or occupy the fencing or the planted areas adjacent to the path.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Underscoring in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs, who have no access to the private land surrounding the lake, filed suit under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, ORS 28.010 to 28.160. They alleged that they have an interest in swimming in and kayaking on the lake, and they sought declarations that the city's waterfront-parks resolution and the city's resident-only policy for the swim park are invalid. Plaintiffs' amended complaint asserts three bases on which they contend that the restrictions are invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In their first claim, plaintiffs allege that, even if the beds of Oswego Lake are privately owned, the waters of the lake are owned by the State of Oregon and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"are held in trust for the preservation of the public right of recreation, including paddling, canoeing, boating, and swimming, and other public rights which all citizens enjoy in such waters under common law[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, plaintiffs allege, the resolution and residents-only swim park rule are unlawful and preempted by the \"Public Trust Doctrine and/or Public Use Doctrine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In their second claim for relief, plaintiffs similarly allege that the resolution and swim park rule are unlawful and preempted by the \"Public Trust Doctrine and/or Public Use Doctrine.\" But on this claim, plaintiffs request a declaration that \"the submerged and submersible lands below the ordinary high water mark of the Lake have been and are owned by the State of Oregon and held in trust for the public since the time of statehood[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, in their third claim for relief, plaintiffs allege that both the waterfront-parks resolution and the swim-park rule violate Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution, by effectively \"granting to a small class of citizens monopolistic privileges of access to the waters of the Lake, which upon the same terms, did not equally belong to all citizens.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on their first claim, contending that the public has a right to use the lake as a matter of law, regardless of ownership, and defendants each filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In resolving the motions against plaintiffs' first two claims, the trial court assumed that the public has a right to use the lake under the \"public trust\" and \"public use\" doctrines, but the court determined that neither doctrine gave the public a right to use the city's land to reach the water. Thus, the trial court granted defendants' motions against plaintiffs' common-law claims and declined to resolve the preliminary question of whether the public has a right to use the lake under either the \"public trust\" or \"public use\" doctrine. The trial court also determined that\n   the city's policies did not violate Article I, section 20, and, therefore, granted defendants' summary judgment on the third claim for relief as well. The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court's reasoning and affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendants.\n   <em>\n    Kramer v.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As the case is presented to this court, we assume-without deciding-that Oswego Lake is among the navigable waterways that the state holds in trust for the public. Neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals addressed the preliminary question of the lake's status, and defendants do not contend that the lake's status can be resolved as a matter of law. Defendants argue instead that, regardless of the public's interest in the lake as a whole, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that plaintiffs are not entitled to the declaratory relief that they have sought. We agree with the Court of Appeals in part. We conclude that, regardless of the lake's status, neither the public use doctrine nor Article I, section 20, entitle plaintiffs to the declarations that they seek. However, if plaintiffs are correct that the lake is a navigable waterway subject to the public trust doctrine, then genuine issues of material fact preclude a determination on summary judgment that the city is authorized to prohibit the public from entering the water from the public waterfront parks. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment for defendants on plaintiffs' second claim for relief and remand for the trial court to resolve the remaining issues, including whether the lake is publicly owned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs' three claims for relief all depend to some extent on their premise that the assumed public interest in\n   Oswego Lake includes a right of access to the water from the abutting upland. Thus, we begin with an overview of the public's interest in waterways, generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Overview of the Public Right to Use Oregon Waters\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In Oregon, two related doctrines create a public right to use certain bodies of water, regardless of who owns the abutting upland.

The exception appears to have been a product of two factors: first, the burden on the landowner was incidental and temporary; and second, without imposing that incidental burden on the landowner, the navigator could not continue floating his logs to the downriver sawmill. As this court emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Weise\n   </em>\n   , whatever right a person navigating a stream has to \"meddle with or touch upon the bank of the stream,\" the right is based on the \"necessity\" of completing the process of floating logs downstream.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2292648\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/3/445/#p450\">\n    3 Or. at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   But plaintiffs do not seek just an incidental and temporary burden on the land that is a \"necessity\" to continue their existing use of the water. Rather, plaintiffs seek a declaration that the owner of abutting upland must allow the public to use that land to enter the lake in the first instance. The \"public use\" doctrine does not support that declaration. Thus, the trial court correctly granted summary judgment on plaintiffs' first claim for relief, which rests on the public's right to use a waterway even when the underlying land is privately owned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Right to Gain Access to the Water Under the \"Public Trust\" Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs' second claim for relief alleges a right of access to the lake that is premised on the state's alleged ownership of the underlying land in trust for the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' argument in support of that claim for relief depends on two premises. First, plaintiffs contend that the doctrine of \"public trust\" would preclude the state from unreasonably restricting access to publicly-owned water. Second, plaintiffs contend that the same limitations apply to the city. Defendants disagree with both propositions. They\n   contend that they were entitled to summary judgment on this claim because, even if the state holds title to the lands underlying Oswego Lake, that public ownership does not create a public right to enter the water from the abutting upland and, in particular, does not require the city to permit access from city-owned upland. We conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. We begin by explaining why the scope of the public's rights with respect to the navigable waterways subject to the public trust doctrine includes a right of access from public land, and we then explain why a city's authority to interfere with that right is limited to the same extent that the state is prevented from restricting public access to waters that are subject to the public trust doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Whether the \"public trust\" doctrine protects a right of passage from public land\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the \"public trust doctrine\" imposes obligations on the state that would preclude it from enacting the type of restrictions on access to public water that the city has adopted. As we will explain, we agree with that proposition. We pause to emphasize, however, that the doctrine of public ownership of the beds and banks of navigable waters and the so-called \"public trust\" doctrine are independent doctrines, as the Supreme Court cautioned in\n   <em>\n    PPL Montana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p591\">\n    565 U.S. at 603-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p591\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Federal law determines whether a body of water is \"navigable\" and, thus, one for which Oregon acquired title to the underlying land at statehood, but state law primarily determines what the \"public trust\" doctrine means for those waters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, we must determine as a matter of state law whether the public's rights with respect to publicly-owned waters includes a right to enter the water from public land.

Neither the state nor the \"public\" generally were parties to that dispute, and no mention is made of the \"public trust\" doctrine.

Specifically, we have concluded that the doctrine limits the state's authority to interfere with the public's right to enter the publicly-owned waters from abutting upland that is open to the public. Restrictions on that right must be objectively reasonable in light of the purpose of\n   the trust and the circumstances of the case. Because the state's authority to enact restrictions on the public's access to publicly-owned waters is limited in that way, the same limitations apply to the authority of a city, to which the constitution has assigned a portion of the authority of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Application to this case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Our conclusion that the city may not unreasonably interfere with the public's ability to enter the public water from abutting upland that is open to the public has two consequences for plaintiffs' claim under the public trust doctrine. First, the rule does not implicate the residents-only swim park policy because that policy denies public entry to the upland in the first place, not entry into the water from upland that is open to the public. Second, our conclusion means that the validity of the waterfront resolution depends upon whether the restriction on the public's right to enter the water from that public upland is objectively reasonable under the circumstances. That question can only be answered after genuine issues of material fact are resolved on remand. The list of pertinent material facts, of course, begins with whether the city is correct that the lake is not among those navigable waters for which the state holds title to the underlying land. If the city's premise is incorrect, then additional relevant circumstances include the extent to which the denial of water access from the waterfront parks impairs the public's ability to use the public water and whether the prohibition reasonably furthers the purpose of the trust in other ways. On this record, the trial court erred in concluding that defendants are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' second claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Challenge Under Article I, section 20\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs' third claim for relief seeks a declaration that both the waterfront resolution and the swim park policy unequally distribute the privilege of lake access according to classifications based on residency, in violation of Article I, section 20.

Const., Art. I, \u00a7 20. With respect to the waterfront resolutions, plaintiffs contend that the prohibition on entering the water unconstitutionally creates a monopoly on lake use for the class of citizens who are shareholders of Lake Oswego Corporation. With respect to the swim park policy, plaintiffs contend that the city has unlawfully granted the privilege of use only to a class of citizens who are city residents. On this record, we are not persuaded that either the waterfront resolution or the swim park policy violates Article I, section 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Whether the waterfront resolution violates Article I, section 20\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs' challenge to the waterfront resolution fails because it is not the kind of law that triggers scrutiny under Article I, section 20. As explained at the outset of this opinion, that resolution prohibits \"\n   <em>\n    any person\n   </em>\n   to enter Oswego Lake from Millennium Plaza Park, Sundeleaf Plaza or Headlee Walkway by any means or method, including, without limitation, by wading or swimming, or by using water vessels or other floatation devices.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the text of the resolution applies \"upon the same terms\" to all people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Despite that facial neutrality, plaintiffs argue that the resolution violates Article I, section 20, because it has a \"practical exclusionary effect.\" Plaintiffs emphasize that, apart from the downtown parks, access to the land abutting Oswego Lake is monopolized by the class of private land owners who are shareholders in Lake Oswego Corporation. For individuals who are not members of that privileged class, the shoreline of the downtown parks is the only potential entry point into water that-we are asked to assume-all Oregonians have a right to use. Under those circumstances, plaintiffs argue, the resolution violates Article I, section 20, by permitting members of a privileged class to monopolize \"the commonly held resource.\" Plaintiffs insist that this court has invalidated other similar laws under Article I, section 20, when \"the side-effect of a seemingly non-discriminatory enactment is to create an impermissible privileged class.\" But plaintiffs' understanding of our case law is not correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Article I, section 20, addresses government grants of a privilege or immunity in an unequal manner.

The city has granted only to city residents the privilege to enter the city swim park. There are no genuine issues of material fact regarding the nature of that privilege. The swim park occupies two of the parcels originally platted by Oregon Iron &amp; Steel. The side of the park that abuts the lake is bordered by a three-sided, fenced dock, which creates a small, enclosed swimming area. According to plaintiff Prager, the swimming area is \"smaller than an Olympic-size swimming pool.\" The park, which is open only during July and August, features diving platforms, water sprayers, inner tube games, outdoor showers and lounge chairs. Entrance to the park is free and provides access to the enclosed swimming area, which is monitored by certified lifeguards. The city's rules do not permit anyone to fish or\n   boat on the enclosed water of the swim area, and there is no evidence that the park affords access to the open waters of the lake. In other words, whether or not the lake as a whole is a common public resource, there is no evidence that the privilege of entering the swim park is more than the privilege to use a city-created recreational facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   And there is no dispute that managing a city recreational facility for the benefit of city residents is a legitimate exercise of city authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The next question is whether the entrance restriction bears a reasonable relationship to the city's purpose in managing the city facility. On that point, the record contains undisputed evidence that there are costs to the city associated with managing the swim park, such as employing lifeguards. Nor is there any dispute that the number of people who can safely use the park is limited by its size. Limiting use of that facility to city residents is one way to address the city's management concerns about size and cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiffs' only argument for why we should reject the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the residents-only restriction bears a reasonable relationship to the identified purpose is to point out that a \"user fee\" also would address the city's fiscal concerns. That argument misapprehends the nature of the court's inquiry. As we have explained, if a classification bears \"some rational relationship to a legitimate state interest[,]\" then it is \"immaterial that available alternatives may be better suited to carry out the rationale[.]\"\n   <em>\n    School District No. 12\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2124837\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/270/622/#p629\">\n    270 Or. at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2124837\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/270/622/#p629\">\n    529 P.2d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the circumstances, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the restriction does not violate Article I, section 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   We conclude that the public's interest in the navigable waterways that are held in trust by the state includes a right of access to the publicly-owned water from abutting public land and that state interference with the public's exercise of that right must be objectively \"reasonable\" in\n   light of the purpose of the trust and the circumstances of each case. We also conclude that cities are subject to the same limitations on their authority to restrict the public's right of access to publicly-owned water. Finally, assuming that Oswego Lake is a navigable waterway held in trust by the state, we conclude that genuine issues of material fact preclude a determination that the waterfront resolution\n   is a \"reasonable\" restriction on the public's right of access. Thus, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs' claim for a declaration that the waterfront resolution exceeds the city's authority as limited by the public trust doctrine. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on plaintiffs' remaining claims for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part and affirmed in part. The judgment of the trial court is remanded for a declaratory judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiffs' first and third claims for relief, and the judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings to resolve part of plaintiffs' second claim for relief (which seeks a declaration that the waterfront resolution exceeds the city's authority as limited by the public trust doctrine).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    In general, the term \"riparian rights\" refers to rights associated with land adjacent to navigable bodies of water, including the right of access to the water from the land.\n    <em>\n     Darling v.
