(Father) to strike an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order authorizing DCS to take temporary custody of two young children. In our discretion, we accept special action jurisdiction and hold that the legal standard to be applied to a motion challenging temporary custody depends upon the timing of the motion. Because the court applied an incorrect legal standard here, we grant relief and vacate the order granting Father's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 On October 26, 2018, M.S., an Indian child, was born substance-exposed. At the same time, her mother (Mother) tested positive for methamphetamine. Two days later, DCS filed an electronic application and sworn declaration in Maricopa County Superior Court seeking an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order authorizing it to assume temporary custody over M.S. and his eighteen-month-old sister, L.S.-R. (collectively, the Children).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (A.R.S.) \u00a7 8-821(B)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (authorizing temporary custody where, \"on a sworn statement or testimony,\" the court finds \"probable\n   cause exists to believe that temporary custody is clearly necessary to protect the child from suffering abuse or neglect and it is contrary to the child's welfare to remain in the home\"); Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 47.3(A) (\"On application under oath ..., the court will determine whether to authorize [DCS] to take temporary custody of a child.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 After considering DCS's application and sworn declaration, the superior court found it \"contrary to the [C]hildren's welfare to remain\" with Mother and Father and that \"temporary custody was necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the [C]hildren.\" Thus, on October 28, 2018, the court found probable cause \"to believe that temporary custody is clearly necessary to protect\" the Children and issued an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order authorizing DCS to take temporary custody of the Children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 DCS took custody of the Children, and, on October 31, 2018, filed a verified petition in Yuma County Superior Court alleging the Children were dependent as to Mother and Father based upon substance abuse and neglect. After reviewing the petition, the juvenile court found it would be contrary to the Children's welfare to place them with Mother and Father and issued a separate order, on November 1, authorizing DCS's temporary custody of the Children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-821(B) (authorizing temporary custody where, \"on a dependency petition filed ... under oath,\" the court finds \"probable cause exists to believe that temporary custody is clearly necessary to protect the child from suffering abuse or neglect and it is contrary to the child's welfare to remain in the home\"); Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 48(B) (\"Upon the filing of a [dependency] petition, the court may issue temporary orders necessary to provide for the safety and welfare of the child.\"). The court also scheduled and held a preliminary protective hearing (PPH) on November 6. Although Father did not appear, at the conclusion of the PPH, the court issued a third order finding temporary custody was necessary to prevent abuse and neglect and that return of the Children to Mother and Father was contrary to their best interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 50(A) (\"At the [PPH], the court shall determine whether continued temporary custody of the child is necessary and shall enter appropriate orders as to custody ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Three days later, Father personally appeared before the juvenile court at the initial dependency hearing (IDH). Although given the opportunity to do so, Father did not challenge the orders authorizing temporary custody of the Children at the IDH. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court again found \"temporary custody [with DCS] is necessary to prevent abuse or neglect and return of the Children to the Parents ... is contrary to the best interest[s] of the Children\" and issued a fourth order authorizing temporary custody on November 9, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 52(D)(6) (\"At the conclusion of the [IDH] the court shall ... [a]ffirm prior orders making the child a temporary ward of the court[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On November 27, 2018, Father filed a motion to return the Children to his care, arguing that the October 28 application and sworn declaration in support of DCS's request for the original\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary custody order \"d[id] not set forth sufficient facts to support findings of probable cause\" to remove the Children from his care. In response, DCS asked the juvenile court to set an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Arizona Rule of Procedure for the Juvenile Court (Rule) 59.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 59(E)(1) (authorizing the juvenile court to return a child to a parent upon request made after the PPH if it finds, \"by a preponderance of the evidence, that return of the child would not create a substantial risk of harm to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or safety\"). The court held oral argument on December 31 but did not apply Rule 59 or require Father to show the Children would be safe in his care; nor did the court allow DCS to present evidence regarding the need for continued out-of-home care. Instead, the court found the application and declaration in support of the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order deficient\n   and ordered the Children returned to Father. This Court stayed the return order pending resolution of the special action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 This Court has discretion to accept special action jurisdiction and will generally do so when there is no equally plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal and the case presents purely legal issues, issues involving a matter of first impression, or issues of statewide importance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

Ct. 47.3(C)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Father relies exclusively upon principles underlying the issuance of criminal warrants to justify his objection to the juvenile court's procedural approach. But, although a criminal warrant and an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary custody order in a dependency proceeding have some similarities, they are quite different in practice. Most notably, a criminal warrant is not reviewed unless challenged. By contrast, an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order authorizing temporary custody either expires automatically if no dependency petition is filed, or, if a dependency is initiated, subject to automatic, immediate, and continued review and scrutiny. Pursuant to Rule 47.3(D)(4),\n   \"[t]he temporary custody authorized by the [\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ] order will expire after 72 hours excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays unless a dependency petition is filed.

R.P. Juv. Ct. 52(D)(6) (\"At the conclusion of the [IDH] the court shall ... [a]ffirm prior orders making the child a temporary ward of the court.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Thereafter, the juvenile court is directed to periodically address placement and the need for out-of-home care at the dependency adjudication, disposition, and review hearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

The need for continued\n   out-of-home care is then reviewed at least once every six months until the dependency is resolved. Recurring review of a child's placement ensures that the court's orders remain in his best interests - a consideration that \"permeates dependency and severance proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    DCS v.

While the initial temporary custody order is likely based solely upon the application and sworn declaration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 47.3(C), the order issued after a dependency petition is filed will be based upon the verified allegations in the petition, Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 48(B); A.R.S. \u00a7 8-821(B), and the orders entered after the PPH, IDH, and review hearings may be informed by additional reports, evidence, and testimony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 50(B)(4), (6), 51(C), 58(C)-(E). The cumulative nature of the review process means the duration of a temporary order may be quite brief; each new order necessarily replaces the last as the court gains information and perspective. For these reasons, the timing of a parent's challenge to temporary custody is critical to determining both the record upon which the review occurs and the standard to be applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 Applying these principles, the original\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order authorizing temporary custody ceased to be of effect on November 1, 2018, when the juvenile court approved temporary custody based upon the allegations of the verified dependency petition. Therefore, to the extent Father's November 27 motion to return the Children sought to challenge the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, it was untimely and should have been denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 Father suggests the juvenile court should treat the November 27 motion as a challenge to the temporary custody order issued at the PPH and governed by Rule 51. Rule 51 directs the court to set an evidentiary hearing \"to determine whether removal of the child was necessary and whether the child should remain in out-of-home placement.\" Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 51(A). At that hearing, DCS bears the burden of proving \"there is probable cause to believe that continued temporary custody of the child is clearly necessary to prevent abuse or neglect.\" Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 51(B). If the child is an Indian child, DCS must also prove \"by clear and convincing evidence ... that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child\" and \"that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that those efforts have proven unsuccessful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4249018\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/235/300/#p304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b617 By its terms, however, Rule 51 directs the court to conduct a hearing \"if requested by the parent ... at the [PPH].\" Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 51(A). Father did not challenge temporary custody at the PPH, and Rule 51 does not apply. Nor did Father challenge temporary custody at the IDH, where he made his first appearance in the case. Because Father expressly waived review of temporary custody at the IDH, we need not consider whether Rule 51 applies solely to a challenge made at the PPH - as the text of Rule 51 provides - or whether it applies more broadly to the hearing at which a parent first appears after service is completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b618 Father's failure to avail himself of Rule 51 does not mean he is unable to challenge temporary custody. A parent may still request return of a child \"[a]t any time after the temporary custody hearing\" pursuant to Rule 59. Rule 59 directs the juvenile court to set an evidentiary hearing on the motion within thirty days. Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 59(B). At that hearing, the court may return the child to the parent if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that it would not create a substantial risk of harm to the child's physical, mental, or emotional health or safety. Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 59(E)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-861. This procedure was available for disposition of Father's motion, and the court erred in not following these procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 Father suggests the application of these rules and statutes results in a manifest injustice. Not so. The focus at each\n   stage of the temporary custody inquiry is whether there is a present need for out-of-home care. This focus is consistent with the directive that, at all stages of the removal and dependency proceedings, the paramount concern is the child's health and safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 36 (\"The rules [of procedure for the juvenile court] should be interpreted in a manner designed to protect the best interests of the child, giving paramount consideration to the health and safety of the child.\"), 47.1(A) (\"If a child has been removed from the child's home by the state authority, the court shall make protecting the child from abuse or neglect the first priority.\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8-821(E), -824(E)(9), -829(A), -843(A), -845(B);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

For this additional reason, the juvenile court erred in focusing solely upon the facial sufficiency of the electronic application and sworn declaration to support the by-then defunct\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary custody order, and erred by declining to hear any evidence or testimony regarding Father's present willingness or ability to care for them, particularly in light of DCS's avowals within the dependency petition and at the hearing that Father had been neglecting the Children and was unable or unwilling to provide them a safe home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b620 We accept jurisdiction and grant relief. The applicable rules and statutes provide a mechanism for review of the propriety of ongoing temporary custody through Rules 47.1 (mandating a review and judicial determination that out-of-home care is necessary at the court's first order approving the removal of a child), 50 (governing the PPH), 51 (governing challenges to the temporary custody order), and 59 (governing motions to return the child to a parent). Each rule requires the juvenile court to act quickly, provides the parent with a reasonable opportunity to present argument and evidence in support of his position, and represents a careful balance between the competing interests of protecting a child's health and welfare and a parent's right to custody and control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b621 The juvenile court did not follow the prescribed procedures, and its order striking the original\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order authorizing DCS to take temporary custody of the Children is vacated.
