Perkins argues that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion of recent criminal activity and his detention was therefore illegal. In the alternative, he argues that even if the detention was lawful at its inception, the detention was unreasonably long. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 A concerned citizen met \"face-to-face\" with Officer Pearce to inform the officer that Perkins's girlfriend (the girlfriend) was using and selling drugs. Among other things, the concerned citizen witnessed the girlfriend sell methamphetamine to Perkins. For the next few weeks, Officer Pearce attempted to contact the girlfriend and her probation officer, to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 When the girlfriend went to the Adult Probation and Parole (AP&amp;P) office for her monthly check-in, the probation officer informed Officer Pearce that she had arrived. Officer Pearce met with the girlfriend at the AP&amp;P office and asked her some questions based on the concerned citizen's report. In particular, Officer Pearce asked the girlfriend if he and the probation officer would find any drugs if they searched her car. At first the girlfriend said no, but as they were walking to her car, she admitted there were drugs in the center console. The officers searched the car and collected small baggies containing crystal pieces that later tested positive for methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 After discovering the narcotics in her car, Officer Pearce informed the girlfriend of her rights and questioned her about using and selling drugs. The girlfriend admitted to selling methamphetamine and confirmed the concerned citizen's report that Perkins was one of her customers. Initially, she told Officer Pearce that she had seen Perkins use methamphetamine that morning, but she later\n   changed her story and claimed she had last seen him use the week before. The girlfriend lived with Perkins and his sister, and Officer Pearce asked whether there were drugs at the residence (the residence). The girlfriend said they would find only drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Officer Pearce, other officers, and a canine unit, accompanied the girlfriend back to the residence and conducted a drug sniff and a search of the common areas \"as outlined in [her] probation agreement.\" The girlfriend lived in the basement of the residence, and Perkins and his sister lived upstairs. The drug dog alerted to narcotics in the girlfriend's bedroom and in an upstairs bathroom used by Perkins and his sister. The officers also found paraphernalia and prescription medication not prescribed to the girlfriend in her room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Based on the information provided by the concerned citizen as well as the girlfriend's statements that she sold Perkins methamphetamine and recently saw him use it, Officer Pearce wanted to detain Perkins for further investigation. Officer Pearce contacted another officer, Officer Stirland, and instructed him to attempt to locate and detain Perkins at his workplace. According to Officer Stirland's testimony, Officer Pearce did not provide many details about the justification for or purpose of the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 At 11:44 a.m., Officer Stirland located Perkins in the company's parking lot and detained him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Stirland notified Officer Pearce, who was still at the residence where the canine unit was finishing its work. Officer Pearce told Officer Stirland that he was dispatching a canine unit to Perkin's location and to continue to detain Perkins until the unit arrived. As soon as the drug sniff at the residence had concluded, the canine unit left for Perkins's location. Due to heavy snow on the roads as well as the distance between the residence and Perkins's location, the drive took approximately twenty minutes. While waiting for the canine unit to arrive, Officer Stirland allowed Perkins to remove company-owned items from his truck and wait inside his company's office. According to the call records, the canine unit arrived at Perkins's location between 12:20 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. The drug dog alerted to narcotics in Perkins's truck within five minutes of arriving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Meanwhile, at the residence, Officer Pearce had begun drafting an affidavit for a search warrant to obtain bodily fluids from Perkins to test for recent drug use. When he was notified that the drug dog had alerted to the smell of narcotics in Perkins's truck, Officer Pearce revised his affidavit to include a request to search the truck. The officers decided to wait for the search warrant, which was already in progress, rather than conduct a warrantless search of the truck based on the drug dog's alert or Perkins's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Officer Pearce concluded his investigation at the residence at approximately 12:45 p.m. and then traveled to Perkins's location. Officer Pearce completed the affidavit for a search warrant while another officer drove. Once they arrived on the scene, Officer Pearce electronically submitted the affidavit for the search warrant at 1:31 p.m. When he did not receive an immediate response, Officer Pearce contacted the court and learned that the magistrate judge who was in charge of signing warrants that week was not available. Officer Pearce contacted two other magistrate judges, but neither judge could access the affidavit. After contacting different agencies to resolve the issue, a magistrate judge was able to review the affidavit and the search warrant was approved at 1:59 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Officer Pearce executed the search warrant and collected a urine sample from Perkins, which tested positive for methamphetamine. A search of the truck did not uncover drugs or drug paraphernalia, but did lead to the discovery of an assault rifle. The State charged Perkins with possession of an\n   illegal substance\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and possession of a firearm by a restricted person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Perkins moved to suppress the result of his urine analysis and the discovery of the firearm in his truck, arguing that his initial detention was illegal because it \"was not based upon reasonable suspicion\" and, even if it were, \"the duration of the detention substantially exceeded what was reasonable given the information available [to the officers] at the time.\" Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Perkins's motion to suppress, concluding that \"the officer had reasonable suspicion that [Perkins] may have been in possession of illegal narcotics and acted with due diligence in pursuing the investigation thereof and obtained the necessary search warrants in a timely manner.\" The district court credited the call logs to establish the timeline of events and determined that the length of the detention was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Following this denial, Perkins entered a conditional no-contest plea to possession of a controlled substance, preserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress under rule 11(j) of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure. Perkins now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Perkins contends the district court should have granted his motion to suppress for two reasons. First, he argues that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to detain him. Second, he argues that the duration of the detention was \"considerably longer than necessary\" to confirm or dispel the officers' suspicion of criminal activity. \"We review a denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact and will disturb the district court's factual findings only when they are clearly erroneous, but we afford no deference to the district court's application of law to the underlying factual findings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The officers corroborated the tip when the girlfriend confirmed that she had consistently sold methamphetamine to Perkins and had recently seen Perkins using methamphetamine, possibly as recently as that morning. Also, during the search of the residence, the officers found drug paraphernalia and a drug dog alerted to narcotics in a bathroom used by Perkins and his sister.

Given the distance between the two locations and the heavy snow, it took about twenty minutes for the canine unit to arrive. Based on the call records, the canine unit arrived somewhere between 12:20 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. and the dog alerted to the presence of narcotics within five minutes of arrival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 Under the circumstances, the thirty-six- to forty-six-minute delay until the commencement of the dog sniff was reasonable. Although we have little Utah case law directly on point, other courts have consistently held that comparable delays are reasonable where the officers promptly requested a drug dog to be transported to the scene of the stop.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For instance, he argues that in\n   <em>\n    Villa-Chaparro\n   </em>\n   , the officer \"did not know prior to stopping the defendant that he was going to be needing a drug dog,\" whereas in this case the officer knew that \"the very purpose of stopping [Perkins] was to investigate drugs\" and had \"prior knowledge that the drug dog would be needed.\" However, Perkins ignores the fact that the officers did not know if or when Perkins would be located. As soon as Officer Stirland confirmed that Perkins had been stopped, and Officer Pearce knew that a dog sniff could take place, he promptly sent a canine unit to Perkins's location. Nothing in the record suggests that another canine unit was available that could have arrived more quickly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Given the parallel investigations taking place some distance apart, as well as the road conditions at the time, Perkins's thirty-six- to forty-six-minute detention while awaiting the drug dog's arrival was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b626 Finally, Perkins claims that his detention was unreasonable because Officer Stirland was not actively questioning him or otherwise investigating the suspected drug activity while waiting for the canine unit to arrive. While \"officers must diligently pursue a means of investigation that is likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The decision to forgo further questioning until the dog sniff was particularly reasonable in this case where the officer making the stop was not privy to the details of the investigation. Given that the police had reasonable suspicion of drug activity and promptly requested a canine unit to conduct a minimally invasive sniff to confirm or dispel their suspicions, Perkins's thirty-six- to forty-six-minute detention was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   2. Probable Cause Detention\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b627 Perkins also challenges the length of the detention between the dog alert and the time the search warrant was executed, again arguing that the officers did not diligently pursue a method of confirming or dispelling their suspicion of criminal activity.

As soon as the search of the residence was completed at approximately 12:45 p.m., Officer Pearce went directly to Perkins's location, working on the affidavit for the search warrant during the twenty-minute drive. The warrant was submitted at 1:31 p.m., shortly after Officer Pearce arrived on the scene. Officer Pearce placed calls to the court to locate an available magistrate to ensure that the warrant would be promptly reviewed.
