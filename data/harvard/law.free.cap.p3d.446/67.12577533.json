ORS 656.214 obligates employers to provide compensation for a worker's permanent impairment, meaning \"loss of use or function\" that is \"due to the compensable industrial injury.\" ORS 656.214(1)(a). But another statute limits the employer's liability when the compensable injury combines with a qualifying \"preexisting condition\" to \"cause or prolong\" the injured worker's' disability or need for medical treatment, unless the compensable injury is the \"major contributing\n   cause\" of the \"combined condition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B). As part of that liability limit, the legislature has created a process by which the employer issues a denial of the \"combined condition\" and then pays permanent partial disability compensation only for the estimated portion of the worker's permanent impairment that is attributable to the \"current accepted condition.\" ORS 656.268 (1)(b). The question we must resolve is whether the legislature intended that an employer would obtain the same limited liability when the employer has not followed the process that the legislature has created for estimating a reduced amount of permanent impairment following the denial of a \"combined condition.\" We conclude that the legislature intended that injured workers would be fully compensated for new impairment if it is due in material part to the compensable injury, except where an employer has made use of the statutory process for reducing liability after issuing a combined condition denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

When an injury is compensable, the worker may be entitled to a variety of benefits through the period of recovery, including \"medical services for conditions caused in material part by the injury,\" temporary disability compensation for lost wages, and permanent partial disability compensation. ORS 656.245 ; ORS 656.210 ; ORS 656.214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The rule for compensation is different when the worker has a \"combined condition,\" which arises when an \"otherwise compensable injury combines *** with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment.\" ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the worker has a combined condition, it \"is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . However, only certain preexisting causes qualify as a \"preexisting condition\" that can form a \"combined condition\"-generally only conditions diagnosed prior to the injury or \"arthritis.\" ORS 656.005(24)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   If the worker has a \"combined condition,\" then the claim may be closed when the \"accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker's combined ***\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   condition.\" ORS 656.268(1)(b).

ORS 656.214.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In general, \"permanent partial disability\" means \"[p]ermanent impairment resulting from the compensable industrial injury,\" where \"impairment\" is \"the loss of use or function of a body part or system due to the compensable industrial injury.\" ORS 656.214(1)(a), (c)(A). Permanent impairment is measured according to standards adopted by the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and is \"expressed as a percentage of the whole person.\" ORS 656.214(1)(a) ; ORS 656.726(4)(f). However, if the claim has been closed \"because the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker's combined or consequential condition or conditions,\" then permanent partial disability compensation is based on an estimate of \"the likely permanent disability that would have been due to the current accepted condition.\" ORS 656.268(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History of this Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Employer's calculation of permanent partial disability in the notice of claim closure is the source of the dispute that arose in this case. Claimant injured her back at work, and employer issued a notice of acceptance listing the accepted condition as a \"lumbar strain.\" A few months later, claimant underwent surgery to address a lumbar disc herniation, but she continued to experience back pain and\n   enrolled in and completed a comprehensive pain management program. At discharge from that program, a staff physician measured diminished lumbar range of motion but also noted preexisting arthritis in the lumbar spine, which the evaluator estimated contributed to 50 percent of the impairment in claimant's spine. However, claimant did not request that employer accept a \"combined condition,\" and employer did not accept or deny a \"combined condition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When claimant's attending physician released her to return to regular work, the physician concurred with the earlier evaluator that preexisting arthritis contributed to an estimated 50 percent of claimant's lumbar impairment. Based on that report, employer issued a notice of closure in which it calculated claimant's permanent partial disability as 50 percent of her impairment from reduced range of motion. On reconsideration, the department's medical arbiters estimated that claimant's arthritis was actually responsible for 70 percent of her current impairment, and the Order on Reconsideration reduced her permanent partial disability compensation accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On review of that decision, the administrative law judge and the Workers' Compensation Board agreed that the department had correctly reduced claimant's disability to factor out the estimated contribution from her preexisting arthritis. The board reasoned: \"[I]t is undisputed that claimant's permanent impairment is due in part to 'arthritis ' (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a legally cognizable 'preexisting condition') and in part to her accepted lumbar strain. Accordingly, claimant's impairment was appropriately apportioned.\" The Court of Appeals affirmed in a per curiam opinion, citing to an earlier decision in which it had held that, if the worker has a \"legally cognizable\" preexisting condition (such as claimant's arthritis ), then \"impairment due to the compensable industrial injury\" is calculated by factoring out the estimated contribution from the preexisting condition, \"unless [the preexisting condition] is part of an accepted combined condition claim that remains compensable at the time of closure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    McDermott v.

According to claimant, the legislature intended ORS 656.268(1)(b) to provide an exception to a general rule that the employer is obligated to pay compensation for the full measure of the worker's disability if the disability as a whole is caused in material part by the compensable injury, and the legislature intended that employers would obtain the benefit of that exception only by following the specified process. In other words, the dispute turns on whether the legislature intended that permanent partial disability for workers with a preexisting condition will be calculated automatically under the method described in ORS 656.268(1)(b)-absent an \"accepted combined condition\"-or whether the legislature intended that permanent partial disability will be calculated under the method described in ORS 656.268(1)(b) only when the employer has issued a denial of a \"combined condition\" and closed the claim under the process specified in ORS 656.268(1)(b). We allowed review to resolve that question of statutory construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As with all questions of statutory construction, our goal is to determine the intention of the legislature when it enacted the relevant statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We examine the \"workers' compensation statutes as a whole\" and our \"prior judicial interpretations\" of those statutes to determine whether the legislature intended that the estimated contribution from a preexisting condition would be factored out of a workers' permanent impairment only when an employer follows the process specified in ORS 656.268(1)(b) for accomplishing that result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Finally, we explain why the process proposed by employer allows a denial of compensation through a process that is inconsistent with the notice requirements that the legislature has otherwise specified in the workers' compensation laws. From those considerations, we conclude that the legislature intended the combined condition process to create an exception to the general rule that employers pay compensation for the full measure of the workers' permanent impairment if the impairment as a whole is caused in material part by the compensable injury, and we conclude that the legislature intended that employers would obtain the benefit of that exception only by issuing a denial of a \"combined condition\" and following the process that the legislature has specifically provided in ORS 656.268(1)(b) for reducing the worker's permanent partial disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Text and Prior Construction of ORS 656.214\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As explained above, permanent partial disability means \"[p]ermanent impairment resulting from the compensable industrial injury,\" and \"impairment\" is the loss of use or function \"due to\" the compensable injury.

Thus, claimant's award for \"permanent partial disability\" is based on her permanent \"loss of use or function\" that is \"\n   <em>\n    due to\n   </em>\n   the compensable industrial injury.\" ORS 656.214(1)(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Claimant and employer disagree about the meaning of \"loss of use or function * * *\n   <em>\n    due to\n   </em>\n   the compensable industrial injury,\" the phrase used to define \"impairment.\" ORS 656.214(1)(a) (emphasis added).

If that new loss, as a whole, is caused in material part by the injury, claimant argues, then the impairment as a whole is \"due to\" the compensable injury, without reduction for other contributing causes. Employer disagrees. It argues that, if a portion of the worker's impairment is attributable to the compensable injury combining with a preexisting condition, then the portion of the loss that is attributable to the preexisting condition is not \"due to\" the compensable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We have explained that, as used in ORS 656.214, \"impairment due to\" plausibly could mean either the impairment as a whole, or a portion of the impairment.\n   <em>\n    Schleiss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n    354 Or. at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n    317 P.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   addressed a permanent partial disability dispute in a case very much like the present case-but prior to the addition of a combined condition process-it provides significant historical\n   context and identifies the foundation on which the legislature added the process for identifying, accepting, and denying \"combined conditions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   , the claimant fell at work and hit his back, and those \"injuries were superimposed upon\" an underlying disease of osteoarthritis that had been \"asymptomatic for some time before the accident.\" 300 Or. at 330, 327,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180130\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/300/325/\">\n    709 P.2d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Or. Laws 1990, ch. 2, \u00a7 3 (Spec.

Among other things, the 1990 legislation amended the definition of \"compensable injury\" to specify that when an \"otherwise compensable injury combines *** with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment,\" the combined condition \"is compensable only if, so long as[,] and to the extent that[,] the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\" ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following that 1990 special session, however, the Court of Appeals concluded that the legislature had failed to create a process for denying combined conditions.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414841\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/241/#p283\">\n    361 Or. at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414841\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/241/#p283\">\n    391 P.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The legislature addressed that oversight, and more, by adding numerous requirements for accepting and denying specific conditions, including \"combined conditions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Text of the \"combined condition\" processing statutes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The processing requirements that the legislature added to chapter 656 clarified that an\n   employer's \"acceptance of a combined or consequential condition * * * shall not preclude the [employer] * * * from later denying the combined or consequential condition if the otherwise compensable injury ceases to be the major contributing cause of the combined or consequential condition\" and also clarified that the employer \"must issue a written denial to the worker when the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker's combined condition before the claim may be closed.\" Or. Laws 1995, ch. 332, \u00a7 28,\n   <em>\n    codified at\n   </em>\n   ORS 656.262(6)(c), (7)(b) (1995). In addition, new provisions required the employer to issue an \"updated notice of acceptance\" at the time of claim closure to specify \"which conditions are compensable,\" and the legislature created a mechanism by which an injured worker can alert the employer \"at any time\" if the worker believes that a condition was incorrectly omitted from a notice of acceptance. Or. Laws 1995, ch. 332, \u00a7 28,\n   <em>\n    codified at\n   </em>\n   ORS 656.262(6)(d) (1995) ; Or.

All of those added procedures remain in the current version of ORS 656.262.\n   Especially pertinent to the question before us, the 1995 legislation created the specific process by which a claim may be closed with a permanent partial disability award that factors out the estimated contribution from preexisting conditions. ORS 656.268(1) (1995). In its current form, that statute specifies that an employer may close the claim when \"[t]he accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker's combined or consequential condition or conditions\" and that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"[w]hen the claim is closed because the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker's combined or consequential condition or conditions, and there is sufficient information to determine permanent disability, the likely permanent disability that would have been due to the current accepted condition shall be estimated.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   ORS 656.268(1)(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the legislature addressed the burden of proof for combined conditions in 2001. Or. Laws 2001, ch. 865, \u00a7 2. In general, the injured worker bears the burden of proving that an injury is compensable and of proving \"the nature and extent of any disability resulting therefrom.\" ORS 656.266(1). However, \"for the purpose of combined condition injury claims under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) only,\" the burden is reversed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Once the worker establishes an otherwise compensable injury, the employer shall bear the burden of proof to establish the otherwise compensable injury is not, or is no longer, the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ORS 656.266(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The parties advance diametrically opposed views regarding the significance of those post-\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   statutory changes. Claimant contends that the legislature only intended to create an exception to the general rule from\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   that permanent partial disability under ORS 656.214 includes the full measure of new impairment, as long as the disability as a whole is caused in material part by the compensable injury. She also contends that the legislature intended that employers would obtain the benefit of that exception only by using the process specified in ORS 656.268(1)(b), after issuing a \"written denial to the worker when the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker's combined condition.\" ORS 656.262 (7)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Employer, by contrast, understands the statutory changes since\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   to have altered\n   fundamentally the calculation of impairment \"due to\" the compensable injury. Employer emphasizes that employers now must specifically list the accepted conditions in an updated notice of acceptance at closure and that an injured worker who believes that a condition has been omitted may object to the acceptance notice or initiate claims for a new or omitted condition \"at any time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 656.262(6)(d) ; ORS 656.267(1). If those additional conditions are accepted after claim closure, then the claim must be reopened, and the worker will receive additional permanent partial disability to address those additional conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 656.262(7)(c). According to employer, that process places the burden on the injured worker to request acceptance of a combined condition in order to receive permanent partial disability compensation\n   for the portion of impairment attributable to a preexisting condition. Applying that understanding of the statute to the present claim, employer notes that, although claimant does not deny that a preexisting condition contributed to the diminished range of motion on which her impairment rating is based, she failed to request that employer accept that combined condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The question is whether the legislature intended the combined condition statutory process to change the rule for calculating permanent partial disability whenever the employer identifies a \"preexisting condition,\" or whether the legislature intended only to create an exception when a combined condition is identified, denied, and closed under the process set out in ORS 656.268(1)(b). Three aspects of the combined condition statutory framework persuade us that the legislature intended to create a limited exception to the general rule that\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   described for calculating permanent partial disability under ORS 656.214. First, the legislature has provided a process for addressing an employer's liability for combined conditions, but the legislature has not changed the key phrase in ORS 656.214 that\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   construed. Then, as now, the measure of permanent partial disability was the loss \"due to\" the compensable injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   ORS 656.214(5) (1985), ORS 656.214(1)(a). Second, the legislature set out the standard for compensability in cases of \"preexisting condition[s]\" as an exception to the general definition of a \"compensable injury,\" allowing employers to limit their liability for an \"otherwise compensable injury.\" ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B). Third, the proof requirements for a combined condition suggest that the legislature intended that process to provide a limited exception. Only certain preexisting contributing causes qualify as a \"preexisting condition\" that can form a \"combined condition,\" ORS 656.005 (24)(a), and once the worker proves a compensable injury, it\n   becomes the employer's burden to prove that the compensable injury has combined with a qualifying preexisting condition in a way that cuts off the employer's liability for medical care or disability. ORS 656.266(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Thus, the text of the combined condition statutes suggests that the legislature intended \"combined conditions\" to be a limited exception to the general rule that the employer\n   is obligated to pay compensation for the full measure of the workers' disability. In addition, the legislature created a specific statutory process by which employers will obtain the benefit of that exception. In combination, those considerations suggest that the legislature did not intend for employers to obtain the same benefit by following some unspecified process, although that is not a foregone conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prior construction of the \"combined condition\" processing statutes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We, thus, turn to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Schleiss\n   </em>\n   , in which we addressed a related question. The worker in\n   <em>\n    Schleiss\n   </em>\n   had injured his back at work, and the insurer had accepted a claim for a lumbar strain. At claim closure, the worker had new impairment caused in part by the injury but also had preexisting degenerative joint disease and accelerated aging, to which the medical arbiters attributed a majority of the worker's impairment.\n   <em>\n    Schleiss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n    354 Or. at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n    317 P.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As we explained, \"[i]n this case, apart from the compensable injury, there are no other legally cognizable contributing causes that claimant's impairment\n   is 'due to' under either statute. It follows that all of claimant's impairment\n   is 'due to' the compensable injury for purposes of making a [permanent partial disability] award under ORS 656.214.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n    at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n    317 P.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, we attributed significance to the legislature's creation of a specific process for employers to follow to obtain the benefit of that exception. As we emphasized, \"if a preexisting contributing cause would not qualify to reduce the impairment that is 'due to' a compensable combined condition under ORS 656.268(1)(b), it makes no sense to conclude that such a cause would qualify to reduce the impairment that is 'due to' a claimant's compensable injury under ORS 656.214.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 654,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n    317 P.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted). That reasoning is significant because a \"legally cognizable preexisting condition\" is only one requirement for reducing the worker's impairment under ORS 656.268(1)(b) to account for a combined condition; it also requires that the condition has combined with the \"otherwise compensable injury\" and that the employer can meet its \"burden of proof to establish the otherwise compensable injury is not, or is no longer, the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition.\" ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) ; ORS 656.266(2)(a). Yet, if employers were able to use a preexisting condition to reduce the impairment that is \"due to\" the worker's compensable injury without expressly denying a combined condition, then there would be cases in which employers would obtain the benefit of the exception set out in ORS 656.268(1)(b), even though the preexisting condition would not qualify to reduce the worker's impairment under ORS 656.268(1)(b). To explain why that would be the result and why the legislature intended employers to issue a denial before reducing the impairment that is \"due to\" a claimant's compensable injury under ORS 656.214, we turn to the general notice requirements of the workers' compensation laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Additional Statutory Context\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The broader context of the workers' compensation laws persuades us the legislature intended that the specified process for denying a \"combined condition\" and then closing the claim with reduced impairment under ORS 656.268(1)(b) would be the only process by which employers\n   obtain the benefit of that impairment reduction. Employer proposes that the legislature has created another process to ensure that injured workers are not denied permanent partial disability because of a preexisting condition unless the condition would qualify to reduce the worker's impairment under ORS 656.268(1)(b). Under that process, when the claim is closed with a reduced award for impairment, the worker also receives an updated notice of acceptance that will not list a \"combined condition.\" ORS 656.262(7)(c). According to employer, a worker who believes that he or she has a compensable combined condition needs to request that the employer add that \"combined condition\" to the list of accepted conditions, as provided in ORS 656.262(6)(d). And if the employer ultimately accepts the combined condition-either voluntarily or after a hearing-then the worker's permanent partial disability award will be adjusted to account for the previously-denied portion of the impairment through a new notice of closure. ORS 656.262(7)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   However, asking the employer to accept a combined condition affords no solution for workers who dispute that they have a combined condition, either because they dispute that they suffer from a qualifying \"preexisting condition\" or because they dispute that their preexisting condition has combined with the compensable injury to cause greater disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the process that employer proposes assumes that the worker, who may be unrepresented, understands that there is a need or opportunity to raise the\n   issue of a combined condition. That assumption is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In general, the workers' compensation laws require specific written notice whenever an employer intends to deny compensation. ORS 656.262(9). The written notice must state \"the reason for the denial\" and must inform the worker \"of hearing rights under ORS 656.283.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is the notice that the worker will receive if the employer follows\n   the specified process and issues a denial of a combined condition before reducing its liability for permanent impairment that otherwise would be due under ORS 656.214. ORS 656.262(7)(b) (employer \"must issue a written denial to the worker when the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker's combined condition before the claim may be closed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   However, if the employer reduces the worker's permanent partial disability in the notice of closure without first issuing a denial of a combined condition, then the partial denial of compensation is the same, but the notice is not. For example, the notice of closure in this case advised claimant only that her 16 percent impairment rating was \"apportion[ed] 50%\" for a compensable impairment of eight percent and that she had the right to appeal the notice of closure \"by requesting reconsideration.\" The notice nowhere advised claimant of the reason for employer's refusal to provide compensation for half of claimant's impairment; it did not explain that employer had determined that claimant suffered from preexisting arthritis that was 50 percent responsible for her reduced range of motion or that she could challenge that determination at a hearing. And there is no requirement that a notice of closure contain that information. ORS 656.268(5)(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Although a worker is ultimately entitled to challenge the notice of closure at a hearing if the worker first requests reconsideration by the department, only issues raised and evidence submitted in the reconsideration process will be permitted at that hearing. ORS 656.283(6). Thus, absent a formal denial of a \"combined condition,\" no other provision of the workers' compensation laws requires that the employer provide notice to the worker when the employer decides that a qualifying preexisting condition has combined with the compensable injury to create additional impairment for which the employer contends it is not liable. And no other process ensures that the worker will have the opportunity to challenge the employer's determinations in an evidentiary hearing. It is not plausible that the legislature intended employers to deny compensation to which a worker otherwise would be entitled for the worker's permanent impairment without providing a notice that affords the worker a meaningful opportunity to challenge that denial of compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, absent sufficient notice for the worker to challenge the employer's determination regarding a \"combined condition,\" there will be cases in which employers obtain the benefit of that exception even though the preexisting condition \"would not qualify to reduce the impairment that is 'due to' a compensable combined condition under ORS 656.268(1)(b).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Schleiss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n    354 Or. at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758439\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/354/637/#p643\">\n    317 P.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We conclude that the method for calculating impairment in cases of combined conditions is an exception to, and limitation on, the general rule that the employer pays compensation for the full measure of the workers' permanent impairment if the impairment as a whole is caused in material part by the compensable injury. We conclude that employers obtain the benefit of that exception only by issuing a denial of the \"combined condition\" and following the process that the legislature has specifically provided in ORS 656.268(1)(b) for reducing the worker's permanent partial disability. We understand the board to have found that claimant's 16% impairment was new impairment caused in material part by her accepted lumbar strain. Thus, in the absence of a combined condition denial, that impairment as a whole was \"due to the compensable injury\" and should have been reflected in the award of permanent partial disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
