(collectively ABM)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging negligence in the provision of wheelchair services by ABM to Montgomery at the Dallas-Fort Worth\n   (Dallas) airport in Texas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On discretionary review, ABM seeks reversal of the trial court's ruling denying its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. According to ABM, the trial court erred by concluding that it had specific jurisdiction over ABM and that the Estate's claim arose from ABM's contacts with Washington given that Montgomery was injured in Texas and ABM provided wheelchair assistance services in Texas but not in Washington. We agree and now reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 ABM is an airline and airport services company incorporated in Georgia with its principal place of business in Georgia. ABM offers a variety of airline and airport services, including wheelchair assistance, by contracting with airlines and airports. With respect to wheelchair assistance, passengers requiring such services request wheelchair assistance directly from their airline. If ABM has a contract with that airline to provide such services at the airport in which the passenger requires wheelchair assistance, the airline will then request wheelchair assistance from ABM on the customer's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 ABM has affiliate locations in numerous airports, including in Dallas and in Seattle (SeaTac). In July 2015, however, ABM did not provide wheelchair assistance services in the SeaTac Airport but, rather, provided janitorial, cabin cleaning, and baggage services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Sharon Parchia, Montgomery's daughter, purchased a ticket from Alaska Airlines for Montgomery to travel from\n   SeaTac to Dallas in July 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parchia utilized Alaska Airlines' website to purchase the ticket and, at the time of the booking, checked a box on the website to request wheelchair assistance for Montgomery for both her departure from SeaTac and her arrival in Dallas. The website did not identify or offer any suggestion or reference to the company or companies that would provide the wheelchair assistance. At no time did Parchia or Montgomery contact ABM during the booking process.\n   \u00b65 On July 29, 2015, Montgomery's flight arrived at the Dallas airport and ABM provided Montgomery with wheelchair assistance services. The Estate alleges that during or immediately following the provision of these services, Montgomery sustained injuries that ultimately led to her death. Thereafter, the Estate filed its claim in King County Superior Court against ABM, alleging that negligence during the provision of wheelchair assistance services in Texas caused Montgomery's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleges that jurisdiction over ABM is proper because \"at all times relevant and material hereto\" ABM was \"doing business within King County, Washington, ... as well as other locations in Washington State.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 Subsequently, ABM filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. After hearing oral argument, the trial court denied the motion. During the hearing, the trial court concluded that ABM had purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Washington and that the Estate's claim was sufficiently connected to ABM's contacts with Washington to subject ABM to the jurisdiction of Washington courts. Although the trial court considered the connection between the Estate's claim and the forum to be \"a little bit tenuous,\" it nevertheless concluded, after\n   discussing the extent of ABM's non-wheelchair-assistance-related services, that as long as there was some connection to ABM's acts or transactions in Washington, jurisdiction was proper, even if that connection was \"fairly tenuous.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 ABM then moved this court for discretionary review, asserting that review was warranted pursuant to RAP 2.3(b)(1) because the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss constituted an obvious error rendering further proceedings useless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our commissioner ruled that the trial court's decision appeared inconsistent with recent case law from the United States Supreme Court concerning whether claims have arisen from a nonresident defendant's contacts with a forum state and granted review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 ABM contends that the trial court erred by concluding that the superior court had specific personal jurisdiction over it and denying its CR 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. This is so, ABM asserts, because the Estate's claim does not arise out of, or relate to, ABM's contacts with Washington. In response, the Estate asserts that ABM purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Washington by entering into contracts with airlines to provide wheelchair services to Washington residents in Texas and that the Estate's claim arose from those contracts. ABM has the better argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 We review de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Court explained that specific jurisdiction requires that there be \" 'an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   , 137 S. Ct. at 1780\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n    564 U.S. at 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court further explained that a corporation's continuous activity within a state is irrelevant to specific jurisdiction if there is no adequate link between that activity and the claim made in the case.\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   , 137 S. Ct. at 1781.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b616 ABM contends that the trial court herein erred by concluding that it had specific jurisdiction over ABM. This is so, ABM contends, because there was no link between the claim made in this case and ABM's contacts with Washington. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b617 The pertinent facts of this case are not disputed and demonstrate that the Estate's claim did not arise from ABM's contacts with Washington. It is undisputed that ABM had contacts with Washington at the time of Montgomery's injuries because it had contracts with airlines to perform janitorial, cabin cleaning, and baggage services at SeaTac. But it is also undisputed that ABM did not provide any wheelchair services at SeaTac and that it only provided wheelchair services to Montgomery in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b618 The trial court's ruling appears to have implicitly adopted the sliding scale approach rejected by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   . It is clear from the record that the trial court considered the connection between the Estate's claim and the forum to be \"a little bit tenuous.\" Nevertheless, the trial court concluded, after discussing ABM's non-wheelchair-assistance-related services, that as long as ABM was transacting business in Washington, and Parchia was in Washington when she requested that wheelchair services be provided to Montgomery in Texas, personal jurisdiction was proper, even if that connection was \"fairly tenuous.\" This generous approach to specific jurisdiction-giving heed to the amount of nonrelated business conducted in the forum to compensate for the necessary \"case-linked\" connection between the tort and the forum-was expressly rejected by the\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   Court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1780\">\n    137 S. Ct. at 1781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b619 While it is undisputed that ABM conducted some business within Washington, it is not sufficient, for purposes of establishing specific jurisdiction, that ABM conducted business activities in Washington unrelated to the provision of wheelchair services when it is from the allegedly negligent provision of such services in Texas that the Estate's claim arose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   , 137 S. Ct. at 1781 (\"Nor is it sufficient-or even relevant-that [Bristol-Myers Squibb] conducted research in California on matters unrelated to Plavix. What is needed-and what is missing here-is a connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue.\"). Specific jurisdiction is not flexible: a claim must arise from the nonresident defendant's contacts with the forum state regardless of how many (or how few) contacts the nonresident defendant has with the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   , 137 S. Ct. at 1781. Because the Estate's claim did not arise from ABM's contacts with Washington, Washington courts do not have specific personal jurisdiction over ABM for the claim alleged herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b620 The Estate contends that its claim arose from ABM's contacts with Washington through the third party arrangement ABM has with airlines to provide wheelchair services in Dallas to Washington residents who fly to Texas. Essentially, the Estate asserts (1) that ABM purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in Washington by contracting with airlines to provide wheelchair services to Washington residents in Texas, and (2) that Montgomery's injuries arose from those contracts and, therefore, arose from ABM's contacts with Washington. This argument is off the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b621 First, RCW 4.28.185 does not permit Washington courts to exercise jurisdiction over nonresident defendants for business they conduct in other states. RCW 4.28.185(1)(a) specifically requires that jurisdiction over nonresident\n   defendants premised on business transactions must be premised on business transactions\n   <em>\n    made within Washington.\n   </em>\n   The Estate's assertion of jurisdiction is premised on a contract to provide services\n   <em>\n    in Texas.\n   </em>\n   That does not meet the requirements of Washington's long-arm statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b622 Second, the Estate's assertion evinces a misunderstanding of that which constitutes purposeful availment. The principal inquiry for whether a corporation has purposely availed itself of the privilege of conducting business activities in the forum state is \"whether the defendant's activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign.\"\n   <em>\n    J.

The Court further explained, however, that World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. and other corporate\n   defendants did not carry on any \"activity whatsoever in Oklahoma\" and the defendant's contact with Oklahoma was due only to the \"fortuitous circumstance that a single Audi automobile ... happened to suffer an accident while passing through Oklahoma.\"\n   <em>\n    World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306135\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/286/\">\n    444 U.S. at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306135\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/286/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
