After successfully appealing that conviction, Martin was retried and convicted of first-degree murder. We hold that double jeopardy barred Martin's retrial for first-degree murder because the State had a full and fair opportunity to try him on that charge in the first trial and the jury, after full deliberation, refused to convict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Martin shot and killed his neighbor with a single shotgun blast as the neighbor approached Martin's house to speak with him. Martin admitted that he shot his neighbor, contending he believed the victim was armed and coming to harm him after the victim ignored his demands to leave. The State charged Martin with premeditated first-degree murder under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1105(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 At Martin's first trial for first-degree murder, the trial court provided the jury with a standard instruction on the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court advised:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   You may find the defendant guilty of the less serious crime if all of you agree that the state has failed to prove the defendant guilty of the more serious crime beyond a reasonable doubt, or if after reasonable efforts you are unable to agree unanimously on the more serious crime, and you do all agree that the state has proven the defendant guilty of the less serious crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury returned the verdict form with the box marked \"[u]nable to agree\" on the first-degree murder charge but found Martin guilty of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to sixteen years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Martin appealed on procedural grounds, and the court of appeals reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. Dec. 23, 2014) (mem. decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Before the second trial, the trial court granted the State's motion to retry Martin for first-degree murder, over Martin's objection that doing so would violate double jeopardy. The court ruled that no \"implied acquittal\" occurred in the first trial, that the jury was genuinely deadlocked, and that the State demonstrated a \"manifest necessity\" for continuing Martin's jeopardy for first-degree murder. Therefore, jeopardy did not terminate on the first-degree murder charge. The court expressed its misgivings over the ruling, however, observing that the State had the opportunity to convict Martin of first-degree murder and failed, that the State could not have retried Martin for first-degree murder had he not appealed the second-degree murder conviction, and that by doing so Martin essentially forfeited his sixteen-year sentence and was now exposed to a life sentence by having exercised his appellate rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 In the subsequent retrial, the jury found Martin guilty of first-degree murder and the court sentenced him to natural life in prison. The court of appeals affirmed Martin's conviction and sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court barred retrial on a first-degree murder charge after the first jury was silent on that charge but returned a guilty verdict on the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder, and that conviction was overturned on appeal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6164126\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/184/#p187\">\n    355 U.S. at 186, 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6164126\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/184/#p187\">\n    78 S.Ct. 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Martin contends that by checking \"[u]nable to agree\" on the verdict form here, the jury, as in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   , impliedly acquitted him on the first-degree murder charge, thus preventing retrial on that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 By contrast, the State cites\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

However, under\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   , a verdict of \"unable to agree\" may, but does not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   , mean that the jurors are hung on the greater offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b628 Compounding this problem is the fact that\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   's approach \"does not lend itself to a ready opportunity for the prosecution to seek a mistrial based on a deadlocked jury.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. As a practical matter,\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   provides no opportunity for the state to seek a mistrial. For example, in the typical case, if the jurors are truly hung on a charge, they can advise the judge that they are at an impasse. However, because\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   only requires the jurors to engage in \"reasonable efforts\" in considering the greater charge (rather than having to actually agree on a verdict of guilty or not guilty), it seems unlikely that they would advise the judge that they are at an impasse-particularly when they can simply state they are \"unable to agree\" and move on to the lesser charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b629 Requesting the judge to poll the jury is also not a viable option. When the\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   verdict form is returned to the court, the jury has already reached a verdict on the lesser offense. Under these circumstances, why would the prosecutor request the judge to poll the jury about their \"unable to agree\" verdict on the greater charge? Worse yet, what if the jury responds they are not hung, and they request assistance from the court in breaking the impasse?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Crim. P. 22.4 &amp; cmt. (stating the trial judge may assist a jury at an impasse by \"giving additional instructions; clarifying earlier instructions; directing the attorneys to make additional closing argument; reopening the evidence for limited purposes; or a combination of these measures\"). Would the judge allow additional arguments or evidence, and then instruct the jurors to resume their deliberations on the greater charge? Obviously not. After all, given the fact that the jury has already reached a verdict on the lesser offense, any new deliberations on the greater offense are barred by double jeopardy.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.
