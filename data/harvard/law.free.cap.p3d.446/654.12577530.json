McLaughlin was injured after he struck an open car door while riding his bicycle. McLaughlin's personal injury protection (PIP) policy covers injuries to a \"pedestrian\" but does not define that term. Because we must give an undefined term in an insurance policy its plain, ordinary, and common meaning and because the dictionary definition of \"pedestrian\" excludes bicyclists, we hold that McLaughlin was not a pedestrian at the time of his injury and therefore not entitled to PIP benefits. Additionally, we reject McLaughlin's contention that a definition of \"pedestrian\" in Washington's Insurance Code, Title 48 RCW, requires that a bicyclist is a pedestrian under his policy. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 On July 31, 2017, McLaughlin was injured while riding his bicycle on Westlake Avenue in Seattle. Daniel Moore, who was parked on the street, did not see McLaughlin approach and opened his driver's side door, striking McLaughlin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 At the time of the accident, McLaughlin was covered by a California Personal Auto policy from Travelers. The\n   policy provided PIP benefits of up to $5,000 in medical expenses sustained by an \"insured.\" The term \"insured\" was defined in relevant part as \"a pedestrian when struck by\" a motor vehicle. The term \"pedestrian\" was not defined.\n   \u00b64 McLaughlin sought coverage for his medical expenses under the policy. Travelers denied coverage, finding that McLaughlin was not a pedestrian because he was riding his bicycle at the time of the accident. McLaughlin sued Travelers for breach of contract and other related theories based on its denial of coverage. Both McLaughlin and Travelers moved for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim. The trial court concluded that the ordinary and common meaning of the term \"pedestrian\" does not include a bicyclist. It therefore granted Travelers's motion for summary judgment and denied McLaughlin's motion for summary judgment. McLaughlin appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 McLaughlin argues that because the ordinary meaning of \"pedestrian\" includes a bicyclist, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Travelers.

Caused by an accident; and 2. Sustained by an 'insured.' \" The policy defines an \"insured\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1.

Therefore, we look to the dictionary definition of \"pedestrian\" to determine its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"pedestrian\" as \"a person who travels on foot: WALKER : as\n   <strong>\n    a\n   </strong>\n   : one who walks for pleasure, sport, or exercise : HIKER ...\n   <strong>\n    b\n   </strong>\n   : one walking as distinguished from one travelling by car or cycle.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1664 (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 The plain, ordinary meaning of \"pedestrian,\" as defined by the dictionary, defeats McLaughlin's argument. Based on this definition, a pedestrian is distinct from a bicyclist, who travels by cycle. Therefore, the trial court did not err in concluding that McLaughlin was not an insured under the policy and that Travelers was entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 Both McLaughlin and Travelers agree that there is no conflict of law when the dictionary definition of \"pedestrian\" is used. But McLaughlin argues that the definition of \"pedestrian\" in RCW 48.22.005(11), which is part of Washington's Insurance Code, is automatically\n   incorporated into the policy and includes a bicyclist. In its amicus curiae brief, United Policyholders also asserts that RCW 48.22.005(11) applies here. But none of the authority cited by McLaughlin mandates that the plain meaning of an undefined term in an insurance policy be displaced if there is a definition of the same term in an insurance statute. Rather, they stand for the general proposition that insurance policies cannot violate applicable statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ringstad v. Metro. Life Ins.

Nevertheless, even if RCW 48.22.005(11) is incorporated into the policy, we disagree with McLaughlin's narrow reading of that statute and hold that McLaughlin has not met his burden to show that a bicyclist is a pedestrian, even under RCW 48.22.005(11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 \"The purpose of statutory interpretation is to determine the legislature's intent and to apply it.\"\n   <em>\n    Segura v.

Title 46 RCW not only includes a definition of \"motor vehicle,\" it also includes definitions for the terms \"pedestrian\" and \"vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 46.04.400 (\"Pedestrian\" is defined as \"any person who is afoot or who is using a wheelchair, a power wheelchair, or a means of conveyance propelled by human power other than a bicycle.\"), .670 (\"Vehicle\" is defined as \"every device capable of being moved upon a public highway and in, upon, or by which any persons or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway, including bicycles.\"). Under those related definitions, the legislature expressly determined that a bicyclist was not a pedestrian, but a vehicle. The definition of \"pedestrian\" in RCW 48.22.005(11) specifically refers the reader to Title 46 RCW. Therefore, we attempt to harmonize the definition of \"pedestrian\" in that statute with the definition of \"pedestrian\" found in RCW 46.04.400. Because RCW 48.22.005(11) does not explicitly refer to bicyclists, the statutes can be harmonized by excluding bicyclists from that definition of \"pedestrian,\" in accordance with RCW 46.04.400.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 McLaughlin argues that we must narrowly read RCW 48.22.005(11) to incorporate only the definition of \"motor vehicle\" from chapter 46.04 RCW.

The Supreme Court held that the definition of \"pedestrian\" in RCW 46.04.400 as a person \"afoot\" did not overrule prior case law establishing bicyclists would be treated the same as pedestrians when they were in a crosswalk.\n   <em>\n    Pudmaroff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"887374\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/138/55/\">\n    138 Wash.2d at 64-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20P.2d%20574\">\n    977 P.2d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But\n   <em>\n    Pudmaroff\n   </em>\n   is not controlling here. McLaughlin was not in a crosswalk when he was hit by Moore's car door-he was riding down a busy street in downtown Seattle. Furthermore, the term \"pedestrian\" in his insurance policy is not subject to principles of statutory interpretation, but to the principles of contract interpretation. The analysis of an undefined term in an insurance policy is straightforward and requires only that we determine the plain, ordinary, and popular meaning of \"pedestrian.\" We need not look to the purpose of any laws regulating pedestrians or bicyclists for this conclusion. Therefore, McLaughlin's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Pudmaroff\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 Finally, McLaughlin argues that to the extent the term \"pedestrian\" is ambiguous in the policy, the ambiguity should be construed against Travelers, who drafted the contract. He is correct that \"[a]mbiguous policy language must be liberally construed in the insured's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Gull Indus., Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.
