Following a hearing resulting in the denial of her suppression motion, Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to driving while intoxicated (DWI) and driving on a revoked license, reserving her right to appeal the denial of her motion. Defendant contends that she was seized without reasonable suspicion when she stopped her moving vehicle in response to a police officer's tap on the vehicle's window and that the evidence discovered as a result of her illegal detention must be suppressed. We determine that the police officer's initial contact with Defendant was consensual. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of Defendant's suppression motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} On June 17, 2015, in Farmington, New Mexico, Mark Kennedy, a park ranger and animal control officer, was going about his evening duties at a city park complex. At around 11:00 p.m., he noticed a car drive into a nearby parking lot. The parking lot was park property, partially paved, and poorly lit. The driver of the car-later identified as Defendant-parked and turned off her lights. Officer Kennedy found this suspicious because, while not posted as such, the park's official closing time was 10:00 p.m. He reported the suspicious vehicle to dispatch. Farmington Police Officer Nick Adegite arrived in uniform and in a marked patrol car at approximately 11:20 p.m. to investigate Officer Kennedy's suspicious vehicle report. He entered the parking lot and parked near Defendant's stationary vehicle. Officer Adegite at no time engaged his vehicle's emergency lights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} As Officer Adegite approached Defendant's vehicle on foot, Defendant turned on her lights and started to drive away. Officer Adegite then reached out and tapped on the window of Defendant's moving vehicle. Defendant stopped and rolled down her window. Officer Adegite quickly detected the strong odor of alcohol, which led to a DWI investigation and Defendant's eventual arrest. Ultimately, Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the district court's denial of her motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {4} On appeal, Defendant argues that she was illegally seized when she stopped her vehicle to comply with Officer Adegite's signal to stop because the police officer lacked sufficient reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Officer Adegite's tap on Defendant's car window, without more, constituted only a consensual encounter between the officer and Defendant. Therefore, there was no seizure at the time Defendant rolled down her window and Officer Adegite observed a strong odor of alcohol emanating from inside the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The State argues that Defendant was not seized until sometime after\n   Officer Adegite observed signs of intoxication, with all prior events being consensual in nature. \"The point at which the seizure occurs is pivotal because it determines the point in time the police must have reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The plain language of Section 30-22-1(C) prohibits \"willfully refusing to bring a vehicle to a stop when given a visual or audible signal to stop, whether by hand, voice, emergency light, flashing light, siren or other signal, by a uniformed officer\n   <em>\n    in an appropriately marked police vehicle\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Emphasis added.) In this case, along with the lack of typical displays of authority attendant to a traffic stop mentioned above, we also note that Officer Adegite was not in his police vehicle when he approached Defendant's vehicle and tapped on the window. Defendant has not provided us with any argument or authority as to how Section 30-22-1(C) applies here when Officer Adegite was not\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   his police vehicle.

In this case, Officer Adegite, alone, in uniform, and on foot, approached a moving vehicle in a parking lot, and without displaying a weapon or making any gestures or uttering any commands for Defendant to stop, simply tapped on the vehicle's window. Had this window tap occurred in a similar situation involving a parked vehicle, the communicative effect would have been to gain the attention of the vehicle's occupant in order to initiate a consensual encounter and nothing more.
