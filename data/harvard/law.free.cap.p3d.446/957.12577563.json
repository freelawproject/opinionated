Dees contends that the court erred because it issued the APR order without first inquiring into the child's possible Indian heritage as required by the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201901\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 1963 (2018). Dees is right. In agreeing with her, we clarify that (1) a legal father under Colorado law is not necessarily a \"parent\" for purposes of ICWA and (2) an APR to a legal father who does not qualify as a \"parent\" under ICWA is a \"child custody proceeding\" under ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Because the APR to Stockwell here constituted a child custody proceeding and the court did not comply with ICWA, we reverse the order denying Dees's motion and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Factual and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 L.D-S. was born during the marriage between Dees and Stockwell. That marriage has since been dissolved. Although Stockwell is not L.D-S.'s biological father, he was declared his legal father under the paternity presumption in section 19-4-105(1)(a), C.R.S. 2018. On October 2013, the district court entered an APR order that named Stockwell the primary residential parent for L.D-S. and limited Dees's parenting time to weekends. Over the next few years, the court expanded Dees's parenting time to include holidays, school breaks, and two weeks of summer vacation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2015, Dees asked the court to set aside the October 2013 APR order. She alleged that she had obtained a DNA test result from L.D-S.'s biological father that would rebut Stockwell's paternity presumption. A magistrate denied her motion, and the district court adopted the magistrate's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In 2017, Dees filed a pro se motion titled \"Motion for 25 U.S.C. 1914 'ICWA' Violations,\" arguing that federal law required L.D-S. to be returned to her care (hereinafter, ICWA motion). She attached to the ICWA motion various orders (including the October 2013 APR order) and a letter asking the district court to invalidate all parenting orders, return L.D-S. to her custody, and comply with ICWA. She asserted in her letter that L.D-S. was \"Choctaw and Wailaki on my side only\" and that the APR to Stockwell was a \"foster care placement.\" The court denied the motion as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.

Timeliness of Dees's ICWA Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 We first address the district court's reason for denial. The court noted that Dees's ICWA motion sought to reconsider a September 3, 2013, order. (In fact, the motion also sought reconsideration of the October 2013 APR order.) The court cited C.R.C.P. 121, section 1-15(11), which provides that motions to reconsider interlocutory orders shall be filed within fourteen days of the order unless the moving party shows good cause for not filing within that time. Finding that Dees had filed the ICWA motion 1382 days after the September 2013 order and had not shown good cause for the delay, the court denied the motion as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 According to ICWA, however, an Indian child who is the subject of an action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights,\n   <em>\n    any parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed\n   </em>\n   , and the Indian child's tribe may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that the action violated ICWA provisions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201914\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). ICWA places no time limit on such a petition. Moreover, barring a parent's ICWA claim as untimely or waived under state law would contradict our supreme court's recognition that ICWA is also intended to protect the tribe, which was not at fault for the timing of the ICWA claim and whose interest may have been harmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    B.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8403661\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/138/299/#p303\">\n    138 P.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because the protection of a separate tribal interest is at the core of the ICWA, otherwise sufficiently reliable information cannot be overcome by the statements, actions, or waiver of a parent, or disregarded as untimely.\") (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.

Therefore, the district court erred in denying Dees's ICWA motion as untimely. In addition, because the record does not show that the court complied with ICWA, we reverse the order denying the ICWA motion and remand for further proceedings as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C. Was the APR a Child Custody Proceeding?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 Dees argues that the district court failed to comply with ICWA before issuing the October 2013 APR order. Stockwell responds that ICWA is inapplicable because he and Dees are parents of L.D-S. Stockwell is correct that ICWA does not apply to an award of custody to one of the parents, including in a divorce proceeding.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2023.103\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3985483\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/178/751/\">\n    178 Cal.App.4th 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20679\">\n    100 Cal.

But whether Stockwell qualifies as a parent for purposes of ICWA requires a closer look.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 As relevant here, a \"parent\" under ICWA is defined as \"any biological parent or parents of an Indian child or any Indian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child, including adoptions under tribal law or custom.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201903\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9). By defining this critical term, Congress has expressed its intention that the word is not subject to definition by state courts.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holyfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605240\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/30/#p49\">\n    490 U.S. at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605240\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/30/#p49\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under these circumstances it is most improbable that Congress would have intended to leave the scope of the statute's key jurisdictional provision subject to definition by state courts as a matter of state law.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 As noted, Stockwell is L.D-S.'s legal father. Based on this status, he enjoys all the rights and responsibilities of legal fatherhood under state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.A.H. v.

Stockwell has primary parenting time with L.D-S., sole decision-making for the child's educational needs, and joint decision-making for other child-related issues. These responsibilities place Stockwell squarely within the role of L.D-S.'s \"guardian\"; hence, the APR to Stockwell was a foster care placement under ICWA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    K.G.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16 (recognizing that involuntary APR to aunt and uncle constituted placement with guardians).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 A foster care placement, which here takes the form of an APR to a person who is not a parent under ICWA, is a child custody proceeding under ICWA because the parent cannot have the child returned upon demand but must instead overcome procedural and\n   substantive barriers to regain custody and control of the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17-18 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2023.2\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Upon demand\n   </em>\n   means that the parent or Indian custodian can regain custody simply upon verbal request, without any formalities or contingencies.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 In sum, the APR to Stockwell was a child custody proceeding for purposes of ICWA.
