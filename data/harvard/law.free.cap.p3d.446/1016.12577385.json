This appeal raises numerous issues, and we conclude that the trial court erred in a number of instances and this case must be remanded for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant/Cross-Appellee Donna Lee Ching (\n   <strong>\n    Ching\n   </strong>\n   ) appeals from: (1) the Order Denying [Ching's] Motion for Additur or New Trial, filed on November 14, 2016 (\n   <strong>\n    Order Denying Additur\n   </strong>\n   ); and (2) the Final Judgment, filed on September 15, 2016 (\n   <strong>\n    Judgment\n   </strong>\n   ), by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (\n   <strong>\n    Circuit Court\n   </strong>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants/ Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Appellees/Cross-Appellants Annette Dung (\n   <strong>\n    Annette\n   </strong>\n   ), Darah Dung (\n   <strong>\n    Darah\n   </strong>\n   ), Dean Dung (\n   <strong>\n    Dean\n   </strong>\n   ), Denby Dung (\n   <strong>\n    Denby\n   </strong>\n   ), and Dixon Quan Hon Dung (\n   <strong>\n    Dixon\n   </strong>\n   ) (collectively, the\n   <strong>\n    Dungs\n   </strong>\n   ) cross-appeal from: (1) the Order Granting in Part, and Denying in Part, Defendants/Counterclaimants' Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law [ (\n   <strong>\n    JMOL\n   </strong>\n   ) ], filed on April 12, 2016 (\n   <strong>\n    Order re JMOL\n   </strong>\n   ); (2) the Judgment; (3) the Order Denying Defendants/Counterclaimants' Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, filed on January 4, 2017 (\n   <strong>\n    Order Denying Further JMOL\n   </strong>\n   ); and (4) the Order Denying Defendants/Counterclaimants' Motion for a New Trial or Remittitur, filed on January 4, 2017 (\n   <strong>\n    Order Denying New Trial\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Creation of the Easement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ching owns and resides at a property located on Wilder Avenue in Honolulu, Hawai'i (\n   <strong>\n    Ching Property\n   </strong>\n   ), which is also known as \"Lot 28\". The Dungs own and live on an adjacent property, which is located on Hoonanea Street, in Honolulu, Hawai'i (\n   <strong>\n    Dung Property\n   </strong>\n   ), which is also known as \"Lot 27\". Ching's predecessor-in-interest, Mary Ching, previously owned all the land on which the Ching Property and Dung Property now stand, but in 1944 applied to have the property subdivided. Mary Ching's petition to subdivide the property was approved by the Land Court on September 29, 1944. Land Court Order 5938 (\n   <strong>\n    Order 5938\n   </strong>\n   ) authorized and approved the subdivision upon the Land Court's review of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   \"the Petition stating that Lot 28 [the Ching Property] will have access to Hoonanea Street over Easement 'A' \". Attached to Order 5938 is \"Map 8,\" which identifies Easement A, which runs along the edge of Lot 27 (the Dung Property). Map 8 indicates that the easement is 12 feet in width (\n   <strong>\n    Easement\n   </strong>\n   ); there is no specific information regarding the scope or intended use of the Easement in Order 5938 or Map 8, except that the map's Notes state that \"Lot 28 will have access to Hoonanea Street over Easement 'A' \".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It appears that the conflict over the Easement began in 2007. Prior to 2007, the Ching Property and the Dung Property were separated by a retaining rock wall, and the Ching Property was not accessible by vehicle over the Easement because of, inter\n   <em>\n    alia,\n   </em>\n   a five-foot difference in elevation between the properties. In 2003 or 2004, Ching requested that the Dungs remove the top portion of a retaining wall so that she could create some type of fencing for her dog, which the Dungs did. In 2007, Ching poured a slab, constructed a carport, and constructed a ramp to connect her property to the Easement, so that she was then able to drive from Hoonanea\n   Street to her property using the Easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The 2007 Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 21, 2007, Ching filed a Complaint (\n   <strong>\n    2007 Complaint\n   </strong>\n   ) against a number of the Dungs alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that they had blocked her access to the Easement and through various means had interrupted her use and enjoyment of the Easement (\n   <strong>\n    the 2007 Suit\n   </strong>\n   ). Ching sought injunctive relief and damages in the 2007 Suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Dungs filed an Answer to the 2007 Complaint (\n   <strong>\n    2007 Answer\n   </strong>\n   ) and a Counterclaim asserting nine counts, including claims for declaratory relief, negligence, nuisance, trespass, and malicious, wanton and intentional actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As relevant to the Circuit Court's ruling on judicial admissions (discussed below), the 2007 Complaint alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   13. The Easement is necessary due to the fact that Plaintiff's Lot (Tax Map Key No. (1) 2-8-014:074) is land-locked, and the only legally enforceable means of ingress and egress to Plaintiff's lot from Hoonanea Street, is through an easement over Defendants' Lot (Tax Map Key No. (1) 2-8-014:091). True and correct copies of the Tax Maps covering the area in question together with enlargements of the specific lots are collectively attached hereto as Exhibit B and made a part hereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   18. Defendants would not agree to allow Plaintiff access to her property through use of the Easement, causing delay to Plaintiff's construction work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In their 2007 Answer, the Dungs' response included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   5. The Defendants admit the allegations contained in Paragraph 13 as to the existence of an easement, and are without sufficient knowledge or information sufficient to admit or to deny the rest of the allegations in said paragraph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   6. All of the answers are to take into consideration the fact that the Defendants have always fully accepted the idea of an easement for ingress and egress consistent with the easement described in the applicable Land Court documents with two exceptions: (a) at the point where the easement joins Hoonanea Street, the utility company and the county had erected a pole and signs that prevented access to the easement without trespassing onto the property of the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit \"A\". Defendants had earlier advised the Plaintiff's family of their objection to any trespass of their property and the obligation of the Plaintiffs to clear their entry to the easement by working with the County and the utility company (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit \"G\"); (b) the fact that while the easement was for access and the reasonable loading and unloading of material from the Plaintiffs' property, it did not allow the parking of vehicles or the placing of stationary material on the easement so as to interfere with the Defendant's use of the easement after the actual loading and unloading were accomplished.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   7. The utility pole [ ] was never removed and the county sign was not removed until May 30, 2007.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   8. With regard to the allegations contained in Paragraph 14-15 of the Complaint, the Defendants admit the existence of Land Court Order No. 5938, filed September 29, 1944, in the Officer [sic] of Assistant Registrar, Land Court, State of Hawaii (\"Land Court Order\") and that such document speaks for itself, and on that basis, the Defendants deny Plaintiff Ching's characterization thereof and denies all other allegations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   9. With regard to the allegations contained in Paragraph 18 of the Complaint, Defendant Annette admits that she informed Plaintiff Ching and/or her representative that the subject easement area was for ingress and egress only and that Plaintiff was not permitted to block the easement area by indefinitely parking vehicles or leaving material on the easement that would prevent the Defendants from using that same easement. Defendant Annette advised Plaintiff that loading and unloading was fine as long as what was loaded or unloaded was from the Plaintiff's property and there was no trespass upon the Defendants' property. Defendants had\n   always insisted that the Plaintiffs take care of business with the County and the utility company first so that there would be no trespass upon their property. Finally, the Complaint in this matter was filed on June 21, 2007, and on that same date, counsel for the Defendants submitted a letter to counsel for Plaintiffs explaining why the Complaint and motion for temporary restraining order should not have been filed. This letter is attached as Exhibit \"B\" and states in pertinent part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   It is unfortunate the complaint was filed. I was only recently asked by Mrs. Dung to explain the situation to her as to the rights of the Chings and their easement and had we communicated earlier, I doubt that any of this would have happened. Her actions were not in any way malicious, but taken in view of what she thought her rights to be; she was concerned at times that trucks were parked on the easement preventing her from getting into her garage. I have explained the complaint and the TRO requesting injunctive relief to Annette. With regard to the injunctive relief requested, Mrs. Dung agrees for the land owners that\n   <em>\n    what is being requested is consistent with what her understanding is at this time and that there is no need to request injunctive relief through the Courts. The only point that may be in question is the ability to park on the easement as the easement is one that can be used by both the land owners and the Chings. I have advised Mrs. Dung and she agrees that parking is within the use of an ingress and egress easement if it is for the purposes of loading and unloading; but the easement is not an unlimited easement for unlimited parking by either side.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties agree the 2007 Suit was informally resolved and no further action was taken, but the case remained pending in the Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    2013 Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following the informal resolution of the 2007 Suit, conflict persisted between the parties regarding the Easement. On or about June 20, 2013, Annette sought a temporary restraining order and injunction against Ching, which was granted by the District Court of the First Circuit (\n   <strong>\n    District Court\n   </strong>\n   ), which found clear and convincing evidence of harassment by Ching. The District Court issued an Injunction Against Harassment (\n   <strong>\n    Injunction\n   </strong>\n   ) that provided that Ching was restrained from entering Annette's driveway except for the sole purpose of non-stop access between Ching's residence and Hoonanea Street for a period of three years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On or about November 1, 2013, Ching filed a complaint in a second lawsuit against the Dungs, asserting numerous claims (\n   <strong>\n    the 2013 Suit\n   </strong>\n   ), which was subsequently amended on May 27, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Dungs filed an Answer to the Amended Complaint and a Counterclaim, which sought,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , declaratory and injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Dungs sought a declaration that Ching has \"no rights[,] titles, estates, liens or interests superior to [the Dungs'] right to the quiet enjoyment of their own driveway\" and they sought an order \"declaring that Ching's purported easement is null and void and of no legal force and effect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On January 8, 2015, the 2007 Suit and the 2013 Suit were consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Certain Pre-Trial, Trial, and Post-Trial Matters\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On January 25, 2016, the Circuit Court held a pre-trial hearing to address, among\n   other things, how the court would proceed with respect to the legal and equitable claims in the case, tried by a jury and the court, respectively. In an Order Regarding Priority of Issues Adjudicated at [the] January 25, 2016 Hearing (\n   <strong>\n    Judicial Admissions Order\n   </strong>\n   ), entered on January 26, 2016, the Circuit Court included the following orders and findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the court finds and concludes that the terms and conditions of the easement in question are issues of fact for the jury to determine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   However, the court further finds and concludes that the defendants have judicially admitted the following facts in their answer to complaint filed herein on October 5, 2007:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   1. The existence of the subject easement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   2. The purpose of the subject easement is for ingress and egress consistent with the easement described in the applicable land court documents with the following exception: the fact that the easement is for access and the reasonable loading and unloading of material from the plaintiff's property, it did not allow the parking of vehicles or the placing of stationary material on the easement so as to interfere with the defendants' use of the easement after the actual loading and unloading were accomplished.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   3. The subject easement could be used for vehicular ingress and egress and loading and unloading of property from plaintiff's property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants, and each of them, are estopped from denying any or all of the above-stated judicially admitted facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Also prior to trial, the Circuit Court limited the proposed testimony of the Dungs' proposed expert, Mr. Robert Bruce Graham, Jr. (\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Graham\n   </strong>\n   ), an attorney and law professor specializing in real property and land title matters. The Dungs sought to have Mr. Graham testify regarding matters pertaining to the scope of the Easement at its creation, specifically that it was likely intended to be a \"paper easement\" and not intended for actual use. The Circuit Court issued its Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part [Ching's] Motion in Limine Wo. 7 to Strike the Testimony of Robert Bruce Graham, Jr. (\n   <strong>\n    Order Striking Graham's Testimony\n   </strong>\n   ), ordering that Mr. Graham could testify regarding \"consolidation\" and \"re-subdivision\" but he would not be allowed to testify about the law\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   or provide any other opinion testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A jury trial commenced on February 16, 2016, and concluded on March 8, 2016. On March 3, 2016, the Dungs filed a motion for JMOL, which sought the dismissal of a number of claims against a number of individual defendants. Relevant to this appeal, the Dungs sought the dismissal of the counts for nuisance, invasion of privacy, defamation, conspiracy, and malicious prosecution. The Circuit Court denied the Dungs' request to dismiss the nuisance, invasion of privacy, defamation, conspiracy, and malicious prosecution counts as to certain defendants and the jury was instructed that it could find in favor of Ching on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The jury entered a special verdict in which the jury found that the Easement- was for both pedestrian and vehicular use. The jury also concluded that Ching had proved her claims for (1) civil conspiracy, (2) nuisance, (3) invasion of privacy, (4) defamation, and (5) malicious prosecution. The jury awarded Ching special damages of $16,600, general damages of $500,000, and punitive damages of $100,000. The jury decided against the Dungs on all counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Following trial, the Circuit Court issued a ruling denying both Ching's and the Dungs' requests for equitable relief, because the court found both sides had \"unclean hands.\" The Circuit Court entered the Final Judgment on September 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Dungs filed a Motion for New Trial or Remittitur on September 23, 2016. They also filed a Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law on September 26, 2016. Both motions were denied on January 4, 2017, when the Circuit Court entered the Order Denying Further JMOL and the Order Denying New Trial. Ching filed a Motion for Additur or New Trial on September 6, 2016\n   (\n   <strong>\n    Motion for Additur or New Trial\n   </strong>\n   ). After a hearing, the Circuit Court entered the Order Denying Additur on November 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ching and the Dungs now appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    POINTS OF ERROR\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Dungs raise four points of error on appeal, contending that the Circuit Court erred by: (1) applying the principle of \"judicial admissions\" and ruling that the Dungs were estopped from denying that the Easement could be used for vehicular ingress and egress; (2) refusing to allow the Dungs' expert to testify regarding the scope of the Easement; (3) refusing to allow evidence of the District Court's Injunction and the finding, that Ching engaged in harassment as defined by HRS \u00a7 604-10.5 ; and (4) allowing the jury to deliberate, despite the lack of sufficient evidence, on Ching's claims of nuisance, invasion of privacy, defamation, malicious prosecution, and entitlement to punitive damages. Further, the Dungs challenge the general and punitive damages awarded to Ching.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Ching asserts two points of error, arguing that the Circuit Court abused its discretion: (1) by not allowing her to present evidence to the jury of the attorneys' fees and the costs that she incurred, as part of her claim for punitive damages; and (2) when it determined that Ching would not be competent to testify as to the reasonableness and necessity of the fees and costs that she incurred in this matter and that she would need an expert witness to testify to the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A circuit court's determination that a party has made a judicial admission is reviewed de\n   <em>\n    novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.

Thus, in order to constitute a judicial admission, a party's statement must be a clear and unequivocal statement of fact.

First, this is a statement of the Dungs' acceptance of an idea of an easement for ingress and egress, perhaps referencing what in their opinion is permissible under the Easement. It is not a statement of a \"concrete fact\" regarding the scope of the Easement. The Judicial Admissions Order takes this \"acceptance of an idea\" and converts it into an unchallengeable finding as to the scope of the Easement. In addition, the Dungs' statement is not an admission concerning the intent of the original parties to the Easement's creation, as the Dungs were not parties to the creation of the Easement and there is nothing in the 2007 Answer otherwise supporting that the intent of the original parties was within the Dungs' knowledge. The somewhat rambling answers to allegations of the 2007 Complaint, read as a whole, are more fairly read as a long-winded explanation of the Dungs' positions, actions, and grievances with respect to the Easement - an attempt to characterize their actions as reasonable and accommodating and the actions of Ching as unreasonable and burdensome. While perhaps inartfully drafted, we cannot conclude that these statements are sufficiently clear, deliberate, and unequivocal that they should be decisive to the outcome of an issue that is so central to the dispute between the parties that it does substantial justice to estop the Dungs from denying or presenting contrary evidence as to the permissible use of the Easement pursuant to Order 5938.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, Order 5938 provides that it authorized and approved \"the Petition stating that Lot 28 [the Ching Property] will have access to Hoonanea Street over Easement 'A'.\" Attached to Order 5938 is Map 8 that identifies \"Easement A\" that runs along the edge of the Dung Property and indicates that the easement is 12 feet in width. There is no additional information regarding the scope or intended use of the Easement.

The subject easement could be used for vehicular ingress and egress and loading and unloading of property from plaintiff's property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Incongruously, the instructions to the jury informed the jury that its duty was to decide whether Ching was permitted pedestrian access, vehicular access, or both, and in its Special Verdict Instructions the jury was in fact asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Question 1:\n   </em>\n   Which of the following use or uses are permitted over the 12 foot wide easement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A.

The Dungs argue that the Circuit Court erred regarding its conclusion that they had made judicial admissions as to the scope of the Easement, specifically that the scope of the Easement included vehicular ingress and egress. This argument has merit. As we explained above, the scope of the Easement is ambiguous. The documents granting the Easement state that \"Lot 28 [Ching's lot] will have access to Hoonanea Street over Easement 'A',\" but are silent with respect to the nature of that access and anything else, other than its length and width. When faced with such an ambiguity, the duty of the court is to then determine the intent of the Easement's creator by looking to extrinsic evidence, such as the circumstances surrounding its creation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Polumbo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201082986\">\n    2018 WL 1082986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In sum, the Dungs did not create the Easement, and the scope of the Easement was not \"a concrete fact within [their] knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   29A Am.

We conclude that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that the Dungs had made judicial admissions regarding the scope and permissible use of the Easement and in estopping the Dungs from denying that scope and use, as well as estopping them from presenting evidence concerning the scope of the Easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Excluded Expert Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Belatedly, the Dungs argue that the Circuit Court erred by refusing to allow the Dungs' expert to testify regarding the intended scope of the Easement. As discussed above, when an easement is ambiguous as to its scope, the next step is to look to the intent of the parties who created the easement to give effect to their intention as ascertained by the circumstances surrounding the easement's creation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Polumbo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201082986\">\n    2018 WL 1082986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6 ; Restatement of Property \u00a7 4.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Dungs sought to admit the testimony of their expert, Mr. Graham, who reportedly would have testified that the circumstances surrounding the creation of the Easement support a conclusion that it was created as a \"paper easement.\" Mr. Graham was prepared to testify that the Easement was likely created in response to the City Planning Commission's recommendation, in order to obtain approval of a proposed subdivision, as the Commission had a policy against creating landlocked parcels. The Dungs argue that the jury could infer, from Mr. Graham's proposed testimony, that it was not the intent of the Easement's creator to allow vehicular access over the Easement. Mr. Graham's testimony was to have been\n   supported by reference to the steep grade or drop at or near where the Easement abutted Ching's lot, limiting any practical means of vehicular access at the time the Easement was created. Mr. Graham was also prepared to testify,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that in the 1940s, when the Easement was created, many Honolulu residences had no garage or carport and immediate vehicular access was not necessary for their use and enjoyment, as well as concerning \"practical access\" from Ching's lot to Wilder Avenue, which access was later formalized. Based upon these circumstances, as well as the nature of Land Court easements (which Mr. Graham was intended to address), Mr. Graham's opinion was that the Easement was merely a paper easement and that it remained for Mary Ching, as the owner of both the dominant and subservient lots, to subsequently specify by specific grant the scope of Easement A, as well as terms and conditions. The Circuit Court in its pre-trial ruling decided that it would only permit Mr. Graham to educate the jury about \"consolidation\" and \"re-subdivision\", but excluded all other opinion testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   It is unclear what testimony would be encompassed in Mr. Graham's testimony regarding \"consolidation\" and \"re-subdivision .\" However, all parties to this appeal acknowledge that Mr. Graham's testimony outlined above would have been excluded. The Circuit Court reiterated during trial that Mr. Graham's testimony would be limited to those two issues and he would not be able to assist the jury as to \"any fact in issue in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   At the time the Circuit Court made its decision to limit Mr. Graham's testimony, it had already concluded that the Dungs had judicially admitted critical facts regarding the Easement's scope, which undoubtedly impacted the court's assessment as to whether Mr. Graham's testimony should be admitted at trial. Insofar as Mr. Graham's testimony was excluded by the Circuit Court's Order Striking Graham's Testimony because the scope of the Easement was taken out of controversy, it was excluded in error and the order is vacated. On remand, the Circuit Court will have an opportunity to reconsider whether the Dungs' expert's proposed testimony meets the standards for expert testimony and would provide relevant evidence regarding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the scope of the Easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The District Court Injunction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Dungs argue that the Circuit Court erred when it ruled, inter\n   <em>\n    alia,\n   </em>\n   on February 17, 2016:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Any reference to other judges' rulings, that is ... Judge Kawashima at the district court[,] will be responded to by this court by severe sanctions, either monetary or otherwise. I have to see what the circumstances are. But I already told counsel there will be no reference to a district court adjudication or any other determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   It appears that in this statement, the Circuit Court emphasized that it would not allow evidence of the District Court's Injunction and the District Court's finding that Ching engaged in harassment as defined by Hawaii Revised Statutes (\n   <strong>\n    HRS\n   </strong>\n   ) \u00a7 604-10.5 (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   However, it further appears that, days earlier, the Circuit Court ruled to the contrary, in response to the parties' motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   . Ching's Motion in Limine No. 1 sought \"an order that precludes any and all testimony that refers to the [Injunction], the hearing on the Injunction, and any evidence presented\n   at the hearing.\" The Dungs' Motion in Limine No. 1 sought \"an order stating that the issue of [Ching's] misuse of the subject easement has already been adjudicated and therefore Hawai'i law principles of collateral estoppel ... apply.\" After the Circuit Court announced its inclination, entertained argument, and engaged in spirited discourse with counsel, the court announced its rulings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [Ching's] Motion in Limine No. 1 is denied. Judge Kawashima's findings of harassment are based on clear and convincing evidence after a trial - a three-day trial on the merits. The findings appear to be intended as a final adjudication on the merits. The findings are sufficiently firm, and there is no indication expressed that - by the Court of any intention that future litigation on the issue of harassment of Annette Dung by Donna Ching should not be collaterally estopped. So for these and any other good cause shown in the record, the Court will deny [Ching's] Motion in Limine No. 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court will also grant [Dungs'] Motion in Limine No. 1, however, this phrase, quote; \"easement abuse,\" end quote, will not be permitted. That is a characterization by Judge Kawashima almost as an afterthought and is not a finding of fact. The Court will restrict the evidence to the determinations of Judge Kawashima through the date of the injunction that was issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   If the defense can show this court legal authority to support the contention that they should be able to submit new evidence of additional acts of harassment or in the nature of harassment that occurred after the issuance of the restraining order, ... I'll be open to seeing any legal authority on that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Post-trial, on August 4, 2016, the Circuit Court entered written orders memorializing these rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   During trial, the issue of how the Dungs could characterize and admit into evidence the District Court's \"order\" with respect to Ching and the Easement arose. The Dungs requested clarification on the court's previous decision that the Dungs could reference the District Court's previous \"order\" but not the term \"injunction\" and could not admit the Injunction into evidence. The Circuit Court stated that the court did not recall foreclosing the use of the word \"injunction.\" Further, the court explained that multiple witnesses had talked about injunctions so the objection to the admission of the Injunction might be waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court acknowledged that a preliminary injunction in favor of Ching and against the Dungs had already been admitted into evidence. However, the court declined to rule at that point on whether the Injunction could be admitted because the Injunction had not yet been identified and offered for admission into evidence, for example, through a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The issue again arose when the Dungs tried to introduce the Injunction itself into evidence. Notwithstanding the admission of a somewhat similar order in favor of Ching and against the Dungs, the Circuit Court concluded,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that admitting the Injunction into evidence would result in undue prejudice to Ching as the jurors could conclude based on the District Court's adjudication that Ching \"must be guilty of everything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Dungs argue on appeal that Ching submitted evidence of numerous instances where the Dungs called the police and that they were prejudiced by their inability to submit as evidence the three-year Injunction because without it the jury was left to believe the Dungs had been unreasonable in their calls to the police for assistance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   the finding that Ching committed harassment and the order that she was restrained from particular actions including \"[e]ntering or visiting [the Dung] residence,\n   including yard, driveway and garage, except for the sole purpose of non-stop access between Hoonanea Street and [Ching's residence]\" for three years, the Injunction states that \"THE POLICE SHALL ENFORCE THIS INJUNCTION ORDER.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Significantly, one of the claims asserted by Ching against a number of the Dungs was a claim for nuisance, alleging that they \"deliberately and significantly interfered with ... the Easement\" and \"deliberately and improperly sought to prevent [Ching] from using the Easement and to punish her for using the Easement.\" Ching alleged in her Counterclaim that the Dungs repeatedly called the Honolulu Police Department (\n   <strong>\n    HPD\n   </strong>\n   ) after the District Court issued the Injunction and improperly used the Injunction to prevent her from using the Easement; Ching presented evidence at trial concerning the Dungs' calls to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We conclude, and it appears that the Circuit Court agreed, that the Injunction was relevant at trial. There was a judicial finding in a previous action that Ching had harassed Annette and the Injunction was to be enforced by the HPD. The enforcement of the Injunction was a basis for Ching's nuisance claim and was critical to explain (and perhaps justify) why the Dungs called the HPD to report various actions of Ching that they believed violated the Injunction. The Circuit Court, however, found that the introduction of evidence regarding the prior adjudication and entering into evidence the Injunction itself would be unduly prejudicial to Ching.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Pursuant to Hawai'i Rules of Evidence (\n   <strong>\n    HRE\n   </strong>\n   ) Rule 403 (2016),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   relevant evidence should be admitted unless the probative value is substantially outweighed by its undue prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \"Probative evidence always 'prejudices' the party against whom it is offered since it tends to prove the case against that person.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in doing so. There were numerous instances at trial in which the Injunction was mentioned or referred to by witnesses. For example, the Injunction was mentioned in the Facebook posting that was entered into evidence to support Ching's invasion of privacy claim and testimony with respect thereto was given at trial. The Injunction was critical to understanding why Ching could not stop on the Easement and is highly relevant to the issue of whether the Dungs' calls to the HPD were a nuisance, While we recognize the Circuit Court's concern regarding informing the jury of the District Court's previous finding of harassment, in light of all of the issues and circumstances in this case, including the admission into evidence of Preliminary Injunction in favor of Ching' and against the Dungs, we conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in refusing to admit into evidence the Injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The Order re JMOL\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Dungs contend that the Circuit Court erred in denying JMOL and rejecting their request for a new trial, on numerous grounds.

Therefore, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to submit Ching's nuisance claim to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   However, we further conclude that our disposition of the Dungs' first and second points of error require us to vacate the Circuit Court's entry of judgment on the nuisance claim. The Circuit Court's error in its ruling regarding the Dungs' judicial admission of the scope of the Easement is directly relevant. Ching claims that the Dungs interfered with her use and enjoyment of the Easement by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , blocking or attempting to prohibit her vehicular access to the Easement. As explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Dungs were precluded from introducing evidence at trial that the scope of the Easement did not include vehicular ingress or egress due to the Circuit Court's conclusion that the Dungs had judicially admitted that the Easement could be used for vehicular ingress and egress and were estopped from presenting evidence to the contrary. If the Dungs could establish that the scope of the Easement does not include vehicular use, then acts obstructing Ching's vehicular access to the Easement could be considered reasonable and of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   2. Invasion of Privacy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Dungs argue that the Circuit Court erred when it entered the Order re JMOL with respect to Ching's claim for invasion of\n   privacy because there was insufficient supporting evidence as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   HRCP Rule 50(a)(1) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Ching alleged, and maintains on appeal, that the Dungs committed the tort of invasion of privacy by: (1) videotaping Ching; (2) yelling derogatory statements about Ching that others could hear; and (3) posting derogatory comments, video, and images about Ching on the social media platform Facebook. Ching submitted to the jury three separate legal theories upon which her invasion of privacy claim was based: (1) intrusion upon seclusion; (2) false-light; and (3) unreasonable publicity. We will address each of these in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Regarding the videotaping, which was the basis of Ching's intrusion upon seclusion claim, the Restatement of Torts \u00a7 652B defines the tort of intrusion upon seclusion as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The tort of intrusion upon seclusion does not depend on any publicity but rather \"consists solely of an intentional interference with his interest in solitude or seclusion, either as to his person or as to his private affairs or concerns, of a kind that would be highly offensive to a reasonable man.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 652B cmt. a. Regarding \"solitude or seclusion,\" the Restatement of Torts explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   The defendant is subject to liability under the rule stated in this Section only when he has intruded into a private place, or has otherwise invaded a private seclusion that the plaintiff has thrown about his person or affairs. Thus there is no liability for the examination of a public record concerning the plaintiff, or of documents that the plaintiff is required to keep and make available for public inspection. Nor is there liability for observing him or even taking his photograph while he is walking on the public highway, since he is not then in seclusion, and his appearance is public and open to the public eye. Even in a public place, however, there may be some matters about the plaintiff, such as his underwear or lack of it, that are not exhibited to the public gaze; and there may still be invasion of privacy when there is intrusion upon these matters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202972219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. c. The intrusion must be a \"substantial one, of a kind that would be highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable man, as the result of conduct to which the reasonable man would strongly object.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at cmt. d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The evidence at trial showed that the Dungs had installed video cameras to capture video of the Dungs' driveway and the Easement. Screen shots from the video were submitted into evidence. There is no evidence in the record that the video cameras captured anything other than what is publicly viewable from the Dungs' home and property. There was also testimony of an instance of one of the Dungs videotaping Ching with a cellular phone as Ching got into her car and drove up the Easement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   We conclude that, giving Ching's evidence all of the value to which it is legally entitled, and indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn in favor of Ching, there was no evidence at trial to support a jury verdict in favor of Ching on her invasion of privacy claim on the theory of intrusion upon seclusion based on the video-recording of Ching and the Easement. The videos were taken of the Easement and Ching in a public, not a private, place and the recordings were\n   not of anything outside of the public gaze.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement of Torts at \u00a7 652B cmt. c;\n   <em>\n    Stinson v.

App. July 12, 2017) (no reasonable expectation of solitude or seclusion on land encompassing an easement between plaintiffs and defendants). Therefore, the Circuit Court erred in entering the Order re JMOL with respect to the intrusion upon seclusion theory of invasion of privacy and in submitting that theory to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We next consider Ching's claim that the certain statements yelled by the Dungs, while the Dungs were on their property, were heard by third-parties, and constituted an invasion of privacy under either the theory of \"unreasonable publicity\" or \"false light.\" The Restatement of Torts defines the unreasonable-publicity tort as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the matter publicized is of a kind that\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   (a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Restatement of Torts \u00a7 652D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The false-light tort is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another that places the other before the public in a false light is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   (a) the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202972219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 652E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Both the unreasonable publicity and false light theories share the identical requirement of \"publicity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 652D cmt. a, 652E cmt. a. Regarding the requirement of \"publicity\", the Restatement of Torts explains that publicity\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   means that the matter is made public, by communicating it t the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge. The difference is not one of the means of communication, which may be oral, written or by any other means. It is one of a communication that reaches, or is sure to reach, the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Thus it is not an invasion of the right of privacy, within the rule stated in this Section, to communicate a fact concerning the plaintiff's private life to a single person or even to a small group of persons. On the other hand, any publication in a newspaper or a magazine, even of small circulation, or in a handbill distributed to a large number of persons, or any broadcast over the radio, or statement made in an address to a large audience, is sufficient to give publicity within the meaning of the term as it is used in this Section. The distinction, in other words, is one between private and public communication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Restatement of Torts \u00a7 652D cmt. a. The commentary further explains that the rule \"gives protection only against unreasonable publicity, of a kind highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable man.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202972219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. c. By way of illustration, the comment helpfully elaborates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   The protection afforded to the plaintiff's interest in his privacy must be relative to the customs of the time and place, to the occupation of the plaintiff and to the habits of his neighbors and fellow citizens. Complete privacy does not exist in this world except in a desert, and anyone who is not a hermit must expect and endure the ordinary incidents of the community life of which he is a part. Thus he must expect the more or less casual observation of his neighbors as to what he does, and that his comings and goings and his ordinary daily activities, will be described in the press as a matter of casual interest to others. The ordinary reasonable man does not take offense at a report in a newspaper that he has returned from a visit, gone camping in the woods or given a party at his house for his friends. Even minor and moderate annoyance,\n   as for example through public disclosure of the fact that the plaintiff has clumsily fallen downstairs and broken his ankle, is not sufficient to give him a cause of action under the rule stated in this Section.

As discussed above, to sustain a claim for invasion of privacy based upon unreasonable publicity, the Restatement of Torts requires that Ching must prove that the Dungs (1) gave publicity, (2) to a matter concerning her private life, (3) if the matter would be regarded as highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (4) is not of legitimate concern to the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement of Torts \u00a7 652D. On appeal, the Dungs' only contention of error regarding the unreasonable publicity theory pertains to the publicity requirement. To sustain a claim for invasion of privacy based upon false light, Ching must prove that the Dungs (1) gave publicity, (2) to a matter concerning Ching that placed her before the public in a false light, (3) if the false light would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (4) the Dungs had knowledge or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Also admitted into evidence were postings concerning Ching made on the same Facebook page. These postings did not identify Ching by name but described the conflict the Dungs had with Ching regarding the Easement, allegations of harassment, personal details regarding Ching, such as the fact she was a divorcee, and assertions that various men had spent the night at her home. The evidence at trial showed that the offending Facebook page\n   had numerous followers (over 2,000) and was also available to the public at large. With respect to the Facebook postings by the Dungs, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence the publicity requirement is satisfied to support a jury verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Dungs also argue that the Facebook posts are not actionable as an invasion of privacy because the posts do not actually name Ching. However, the Facebook posts contain video footage of Ching, pictures of Ching and her vehicle, images of Ching's house, and comments about Ching's personal life, such as, \"she's had so many different men going up and down. Our driveway. On this morning the guy driving her is-not the same one she returned with later that night. ... He just spent the night.\" Courts generally require that a plaintiff be reasonably identifiable to support an invasion of privacy claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   David A.

If the plaintiff cannot be identified as the person who is the subject of the publication from the published matter itself, then there has been no actionable invasion of the right of privacy\"). Here, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Ching's identity was reasonably identifiable from the Dungs' Facebook postings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Accordingly, based on the evidence in the record, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence of the publication element necessary to a jury verdict, based upon the theories of either unreasonable publicity or false light, based on these Facebook postings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Dungs' argument regarding false light also pertains to the publicity requirement. Based upon the Facebook posting evidence, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err when it entered the Order re JMOL with respect to the unreasonable publicity and false light theories of invasion of privacy as, giving Ching's evidence all the value to which it is entitled and indulging every legitimate inference in Ching's favor, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find in Ching's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   3.

Upon review, the Dungs did not raise any objection or seek to strike this testimony on these grounds. Moreover, the Dungs do not acknowledge the testimony of another witness who also testified to hearing crude statements regarding Ching, John Hoogsteden (\n   <strong>\n    Hoogsteden\n   </strong>\n   ). Hoogsteden testified that he heard female voices from the Dung residence on multiple occasions make crude sexual and other malicious statements and innuendos about Ching.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the Dungs' argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Dungs make no other argument that there was insufficient evidence to support Ching's claim for defamation.

Malicious Prosecution\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Dungs argue that the Circuit Court erred in denying their motion for JMOL as to Ching's malicious prosecution claims. \"The tort of malicious prosecution permits a plaintiff to recover when the plaintiff shows that the prior proceedings were (1) terminated in the plaintiff's favor, (2) initiated without probable cause, and (3) initiated with malice.\"\n   <em>\n    Young v.

The first allegedly occurred after Ching stopped her vehicle at the top of the Easement, got out, and took a photograph of what she believed were encroachments upon the Easement. At that time, the Injunction was in effect and provided that Ching could not stop on the Easement and could only use it for non-stop access to her residence. The Dungs called the police, and Ching was arrested for harassment. Ching testified that, at the court hearing she attended with counsel, the prosecutor \"downgraded\" the charge to a parking citation to which Ching pleaded guilty; later in her testimony she agreed that she \"eventually acknowledged or pled to a parking violation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   As the Dungs argue, it is generally held that \"the termination of a criminal prosecution as a result of the accused's settlement or compromise of civil liabilities arising out of the same acts precludes a subsequent malicious prosecution claim by the accused, the termination being viewed as unfavorable to the accused.\" 52 Am.

Ching testified that she heard giggling, and one of the Dung sisters reached over their fence and began spraying water over the fence with their hose. Ching testified that she did not say anything to them, but instead sprayed water back at them, because she was concerned that her washer and dryer were getting wet. Ching testified that she was arrested as a result of this incident, that she went to trial, and that she was acquitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Dungs contend that this incident could not serve as a basis for submitting the malicious prosecution claim to the jury because (a) Ching's own testimony - that she admittedly sprayed her hose at the Dung sisters - established probable cause, and (b) probable cause was established by the independent determination made by the prosecutor's office to proceed with the case, which determination broke the chain of causation between the Dungs and the prosecution of Ching.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The Hawai'i Supreme Court has held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   [P]robable cause for the filing of a lawsuit exists where a person:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   reasonably believes in the existence of the facts upon which the claim is based, and either\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   (a) correctly or reasonably believes that under those facts the claim may be valid under the applicable law, or\n   (b) believes to this effect in reliance upon the advice of counsel, sought in good faith and given after full disclosure of all relevant facts within his knowledge or information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <em>\n    Arquette v.

To conclude otherwise would hold ordinary citizens to a higher standard of \"reasonable belief\" concerning the validity of claims under applicable law than law enforcement officers in similar circumstances. Here, there is no evidence in the record that any false statements were made by the Dungs to the prosecutor, that they withheld evidence, or that they exerted pressure or influence on the prosecutor who filed the charges and\n   took the case to trial. Ching's testimony was simply that she got arrested, the two Dung sisters testified, and that she was acquitted \"on both charges.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in denying the Dungs' motion for JMOL on Ching's malicious prosecution claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Further Issues Following Rulings on the Order re JMOL\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we have concluded that: although the Circuit Court did not err in denying JMOL with respect to Ching's nuisance claim, the verdict as to that claim must nevertheless be vacated; the Circuit Court erred in part when it submitted Ching's invasion of privacy claim to the jury; the Circuit Court did not err when it submitted Ching's defamation claim to the jury; and the Circuit Court erred when it submitted Ching's malicious prosecution claim to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The case was submitted to the jury with a form of Special Verdict that informed the jury that its verdict consists of a series of questions that must be answered, as directed in the Special Verdict. The questions included, serially, whether any of the Dungs engaged in a civil conspiracy against Ching, whether any of the Dungs engaged in any act of nuisance against Ching, whether any of the Dungs invaded Ching's privacy, whether any of the Dungs defamed Ching, and whether Denby and/or Darah Dung engaged in an act of malicious prosecution against Ching.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   After each of the civil conspiracy, nuisance, invasion of privacy, and defamation questions, if the jury had responded yes, the jury was asked to select, from a list, which of the Dungs engaged in the conduct; the civil conspiracy and nuisance lists included Annette, Dixon, Dean, Denby, and Darah, and the invasion of privacy and defamation lists included Annette, Dean, Denby and Darah (and not Dixon).

It cannot be determined from the Special Verdict whether the jury found that the Dungs conspired to engage in, for example, one or more acts of nuisance, or alternatively, that they all conspired to commit one or more of the other tortious acts alleged by Ching. Thus, based on our inability to determine whether the jury's finding of a civil conspiracy was based on the jury's finding of defamation or either the false light or unreasonable publicity theory of invasion of privacy arising out of the Facebook postings, as opposed to nuisance, a nonviable invasion of privacy theory, or malicious prosecution, Ching's civil conspiracy claim must be vacated and retried in order to establish vicarious liability for one or more underlying torts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   In addition to the above, the jury was asked, without distinction between claims, theories, or defendants, to determine Ching's special, general, and punitive damages.

In addition, Ching argues that this court should apply a doctrine that some courts call the \"general verdict rule,\" which provides that where several counts are tried, a general verdict will be upheld if any one count is supported by substantial evidence and is unaffected by error, in the absence of an objection to the form of verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The Dungs argue that, under the circumstances, it would be impossible for this court to determine what portion of the lump sum damages are attributable to vacated findings of liability, citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodrigues v.

In\n   <em>\n    Rodrigues\n   </em>\n   , the Hawai'i Supreme Court stated and held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   The trial court did not designate the sum awarded for each head of damages but awarded a lump sum for 'mental anguish and suffering, inconvenience, disruption of home and family life, past and future, etc.' The evidence did not warrant damages for 'future' disruption of home and family life. Also, it was clear error to include 'etc.' in the award as a head of damages. The State contends that the failure to award separate verdicts as to damages on each of the heads of damages was error. The award of a lump sum for different claims is not reversible error. However,\n   failure to state the amount awarded for each claim makes it impossible for the reviewing court, absent any other indication in the record, to amend the lump sum award when it is decided on appeal that error was committed concerning the consideration of a particular claim by the factfinder, the excessiveness or adequacy of an award, or the evidence necessary to sustain an award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mayne,\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n   534 (4th ed. 1884); Watson,\n   <em>\n    Damages and Personal Injuries\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 340 at 425 (1901); 4 Sedgewick,\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1276 at 2612 (9th ed. 1912). The result is an unnecessary retrial of issues. While in this case we must remand with instructions to reduce the lump sum award accordingly, we hold that where claims are independent and there is a likelihood that collateral questions concerning the claims may be raised in the future, the trial judge on his own motion or on motion by counsel should direct that separate verdicts on damages be returned on each of the claims to aid the reviewing court in isolating error and to prevent unnecessary retrial of issues.\n   <em>\n    Nylander v.

Ching further argues that, as joint tortfeasors and co-conspirators found liable for intentional torts against her, the Dungs are liable for the entirety of her damages and her damages need not be apportioned amongst them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , HRS \u00a7 663-11 (2016) (defining joint tortfeasors).

The Circuit Court denied the Motion for Additur or New Trial because it found that the evidence of attorneys' fees was inadequate to put to the jury because Ching was not competent to testify as to whether the attorneys' fees she incurred were reasonable and necessary.

[T]his court [has] adopted the majority view that a jury should be allowed to consider a plaintiff's attorney fees in determining the amount of a punitive damages award. There are two limitations: First, [w]hen considering attorney's fees in calculating the amount of the punitive damage award, the fee amount must be 'reasonable and necessary. Second, [a]ttorneys' fees cannot be awarded in addition to exemplary damages; rather, they must constitute the whole of the punitive damage award or be accounted for as a portion of the total punitive damage award.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   In this case, the Kekonas presented sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that they had accrued $600,000 in attorney's fees and expenses over fourteen years of litigation. Their attorney's fees reasonably corresponded to the extensive discovery required to expose the fraudulent transfer, three jury trials, the cost of hiring expert witnesses, voluminous pre-trial and post-trial motions, and several appeals to the ICA and to this court. Although Bornemann attempted to impeach Mrs. Kekona because she did not introduce written documentation of the attorney's fees she incurred,\n   <em>\n    the testimony of a single witness, if found credible by the jury, constitutes sufficient evidence to support a finding\n   </em>\n   .

First, he argues that the fees incurred were not solely incurred against him, and that large portions corresponded to litigation against other defendants. However, it is well settled that where the wrongful act of a defendant causes a plaintiff to engage in litigation with a third party in order to protect his or her rights or interests, attorney's fees incurred in litigating with that third party may be\n   chargeable against the wrongdoer as an element of the plaintiff's damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   Second, Bornemann argues that some of the attorney's fees corresponded to the original jury trial in the Hanauma Bay case.
