Other pertinent facts are included in the discussion of the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b64] On July 18, 2016, five-year-old RH accompanied his nine-year old brother, TP, his six-year-old brother, M, and a family friend to the El Marko Bowling Alley in Casper, Wyoming, to play arcade games. While there, they encountered Mr. Winters, a carnival worker who had just finished working at the Central Wyoming Fair &amp; Rodeo. Mr. Winters gave the boys money to play games. At some point, Mr. Winters claimed he was missing money. RH and TP helped Mr. Winters look for the money until they had to leave to report in with their mother at home. According to TP, Mr. Winters told them they \"have to come back to help him find his money, then he would give [them] some money.\" He also told them to tell their mom he was \"a friend.\" The boys went home, but RH returned to the bowling alley alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b65] It is unclear what occurred at the bowling alley upon RH's return. What is clear is RH and Mr. Winters eventually left the bowling alley and ended up at the North Platte River. Mr. Winters carried RH across the river. Ms. Kellie Brodrecht, a passing motorist, observed Mr. Winters and RH in the middle of the river. She testified Mr. Winters was \"struggling to walk\" because the water was \"pretty high.\" She stopped and ran to the point on the river bank where she could see the man and child. By that time, the man and child were across the river. The man was lying on the embankment and the child was in the bushes and trees. She yelled, \"Are you okay?\" but neither the man nor the child heard her so she yelled louder. This time the child peeked his head out from the trees and looked at her but did not say anything. The man got up, looked at her, said \"yeah, yeah, thanks,\" and waved her off. The man then walked into the trees. Because Ms. Brodrecht had no reason to believe they were in danger, she left. Once they were alone, Mr. Winters put his mouth on RH's penis and penetrated RH's anus with his tongue and penis. Mr. Winters threatened to kill RH's family if he told anyone what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b66] Mr. Winters and RH then walked south on Wyoming Boulevard to Fairside Road, where Mr. Winters left RH crying on the side of the road.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shannon Sierra, a passing motorist, eventually found RH and took him to the Mills police station. Casper Police Officer Levi Hallock met RH at the police station. RH's arms, legs, and clothing were covered with sand, his shorts and the back of his shirt were wet, and his left cheek was slightly swollen. Officer Hallock transported him to the Wyoming Medical Center, where he was seen by a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE nurse). The SANE nurse found no physical evidence or injuries indicating a sexual assault or anal penetration had occurred, which she testified was \"common.\" After the exam, RH was\n   transported to the Child Advocacy Project (CAP) center for a forensic interview (CAP interview). RH returned the next morning for a second CAP interview. Later DNA testing of RH's penile swabs was inconclusive as to the presence of Mr. Winters' DNA, but similar testing of RH's anal swabs revealed Mr. Winters to be the major contributor of the mixture of DNA present there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] The State charged Mr. Winters with aggravated kidnapping under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-201\">\n    Wyo.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-2-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(ii) and (b) (LexisNexis 2017) (Count 3). At trial, Mr. Winters admitted he met RH at the bowling alley and they ended up in the river. He claimed, however, RH followed him to the river, RH fell in the river, and he went in the water to save him. They came out of the river on the other side. Mr. Winters said he passed out on the river bank for 10-20 seconds and, when he came to, he saw RH walking away. Mr. Winters got up, grabbed RH's hand, and walked with RH to a pawn shop where Mr. Winters thought he had left his bags. He left RH in the parking lot while he went into the shop. When he came out, RH was no longer in the parking lot. Mr. Winters explicitly denied ever touching RH in a sexual manner. He also claimed to have been drinking heavily that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b68] The jury convicted Mr. Winters of all charges. The district court sentenced Mr. Winters to (1) not less than 50 years nor more than 70 years on Count 1; and (2) not less than 30 years nor more than 45 years on Count 2, which was merged with Count 3 for purposes of sentencing. The sentences on Counts 1 and 2 were ordered to run consecutively. Mr. Winters filed a timely notice of appeal challenging his convictions and sentences (Appeal No. S-17-0314).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b69] Subsequently, Mr. Winters filed a W.R.A.P. 21 motion, seeking a new trial based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel. After holding a hearing, the district court denied the motion. Mr. Winters appealed from that denial (Appeal No. S-18-0247). We consolidated both appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b610] Mr. Winters raises various claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. He also argues the district court abused its discretion in admitting other acts evidence under W.R.E. 404(b) ; there was insufficient evidence supporting his aggravated kidnapping conviction; and double jeopardy principles required his sentences for aggravated kidnapping and first-degree sexual abuse of a minor to be merged.

Failure to Challenge RH's Competency\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b614] Six months before trial, trial counsel told the district court at a scheduling conference he \"believe[d]\" he would be filing a motion to challenge RH's competency as a witness due to RH's age and the concerns he had after viewing the CAP interviews. But trial counsel \"changed [his] mind\" and never filed a motion for a competency hearing because he believed RH was competent to testify. He explained at the Rule 21 hearing that although the CAP interview gave him \"the impression [RH] had some issues with memory,\" he believed those issues were \"no different than [those] an adult might have in the same situation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b615] Mr. Winters now faults trial counsel for failing to challenge RH's competency to testify. According to him, RH's testimony, as well as the statements he made in the CAP interviews, in particular the second CAP interview,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   clearly demonstrate RH's inability to understand, receive, remember, and narrate impressions of what occurred. Moreover, while the district court made some inquiry as to whether RH understood an oath is a promise to tell the truth, Mr. Winters argues it failed to make any inquiry as to whether RH understood what it means to tell the truth and the importance of doing so at trial. Finally, he tells us counsel's failure to challenge RH's competency as a witness was prejudicial because RH was the only eye-witness (besides himself) to the events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b616] \"[ Wyoming Rule of Evidence 601 ] presumes ...

Specifically, RH testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 He met Mr. Winters at the bowling alley (corroborated by the bowling alley manager and Mr. Winters).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Winters gave him and his brothers money to play arcade games (corroborated\n   by the bowling alley manager and Mr. Winters).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Winters claimed to have lost money at the bowling alley (corroborated by the bowling alley manager and Mr. Winters) and he helped him look for it (corroborated by Mr. Winters).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 He and Mr. Winters eventually left the bowling alley (corroborated by the bowling alley manager) and ended up at the river (corroborated by Ms. Brodrecht and Mr. Winters).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Winters hid a bag on the way to the river (corroborated by law enforcement).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Winters carried him across the river (corroborated by Ms. Brodrecht and Mr. Winters).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 A female asked him and Mr. Winters if they were okay; he did not respond but Mr. Winters said \"[w]e're all right\" (collaborated by Ms. Brodrecht and Mr. Winters).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 He was found alone on the side of a road and was picked up by a different passing motorist with children in the car; this passing motorist brought him to the police station (corroborated by law enforcement and Ms. Sierra).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 He was transported from the police station to the doctor (corroborated by law enforcement and the SANE nurse).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b620] Finally, RH had the mental capacity to understand the attorneys' questions concerning the abuse and to express in words his memory of it. He told the jury Mr. Winters \"humped my leg,\" \"put his pee pee in my butt,\" \"stuck his tongue in my butt,\" and \"put his mouth on [my] pee pee.\" He testified that when Mr. Winters was \"humping\" him, Mr. Winters was laying on him and \"going up and down.\" He also explained his \"pee pee\" is in \"[f]ront.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b621] Nevertheless, Mr. Winters claims RH was not competent and was not properly evaluated for competency. As to the first\n   <em>\n    Larsen\n   </em>\n   factor, he argues there was no inquiry as to whether RH understood what it means to tell the truth and the importance of doing so as the judge's inquiry was limited to whether RH understood an oath is a promise to tell the truth. Mr. Winters misstates the scope of the judge's inquiry. The judge asked not only whether RH understood an oath is a promise to tell the truth but also ensured RH's willingness to tell the truth. RH then took an oath promising to do so at trial.

For example, he claims RH was inconsistent as to how he ended up in the river (claiming Mr. Winters wanted him to go into the river and took his hand but then claiming he \"slipped\" into the water) and why he returned to the bowling alley after checking in at home (first claiming his brother M told him to return and then claiming he did not know why he returned). Such inconsistencies, however, go to RH's credibility and the weight to be given his testimony, not his competency.\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822731\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/1108/\">\n    367 P.3d at 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (inconsistencies in child witness's testimony \"have more to do with her credibility and the weight to be accorded her testimony than her competence to testify\");\n   <em>\n    Sisneros\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8904486\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/121/790/\">\n    121 P.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567501\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/224/#p228\">\n    418 P.3d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[C]ompetence is not the same as credibility.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b625] Mr. Winters also claims RH gave non-sensical answers. For instance, when asked the positions of his and Mr. Winters' bodies when Mr. Winters \"humped\" his leg, RH stated his body was \"[s]cared\" and Mr. Winters' body was \"Good. But he got sick.\" When asked what he meant by the latter response, he said, \"When he went to jail, he got sick.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, when asked whether RH stayed in one place after Mr. Winters left him on the side of the road, he responded, \"I\n   <em>\n    walked into\n   </em>\n   a lady's car.\" (Emphasis added). And finally, when asked how he got to the other side of the river, RH said he swam yet admitted he did not know how to swim. These allegedly non-sensical answers correspond directly with the nature and quality of the questions posed to him. Moreover, they demonstrate the need to consider a child's testimony as a whole, rather than hone in on isolated statements as Mr. Winters does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b626] The State asked RH\n   <em>\n    \"[h]ow\n   </em>\n   were your bodies\" and \"\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   was [Mr. Winters'] body\" when Mr. Winters humped his leg. (Emphasis added). Although the State was seeking the\n   <em>\n    position\n   </em>\n   of RH's and Mr. Winters' bodies, it was not illogical, given the form of the question, for RH to respond with the\n   <em>\n    condition or quality\n   </em>\n   of their bodies, i.e., \"Scared\" and \"Good. But he got sick.\" Indeed, once the State clarified the question, RH responded Mr. Winters was \"[l]aying down ... [o]n me.\" Similarly, the State asked RH whether he stayed where he was or \"\n   <em>\n    walk[ed]\n   </em>\n   somewhere else\" after Mr. Winters left him on the side of the road; not surprisingly, RH responded, \"I\n   <em>\n    walked into\n   </em>\n   a lady's car.\" (Emphasis added). And, prior to asking RH how he got to the other side of the river, trial counsel asked RH how Mr. Winters got in the river. RH responded, Mr. Winters \"walked down to there and he holded me and he was swimming.\" Trial counsel then asked, \"And so now you're both in the river, right?\" and RH said, \"Yeah.\" Thus, when counsel asked RH, \"How did\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   get to the other side? Did\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   walk or swim?\" RH logically interpreted \"you\" to mean both him and Mr. Winters. (Emphasis added). From context, RH obviously meant Mr. Winters swam across the river while holding RH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b627] Finally, Mr. Winters claims RH testified to an impossibility. When the State asked RH whether his \"clothes ever c[a]me off,\" he responded, \"Huh-uh ... they stayed on.\" According to Mr. Winters, he could not have stuck his penis and tongue in RH's anus if RH's clothes never came off. But Mr. Winters could have accessed RH's genitals by lowering RH's shorts, in other words, without RH's clothes ever \"com[ing] off.\" Or RH could have been referring to the fact that while his shorts came off, his shirt remained on. Trial counsel's questions on cross-examination did not clarify the matter. He asked RH whether he knew what \"naked\" meant; RH said he did not. Counsel defined it as meaning \"you have no clothes on at all, like when you take a bath\" and RH indicated he understood. RH then testified Mr. Winters was \"naked\" but he was \"never naked.\" Again, that RH was \"never naked\" certainly does not render the sexual abuse an impossibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b628] Admittedly, RH's testimony was not perfect. But \"a witness need not be perfect to be competent to testify.\"\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822731\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/1108/\">\n    367 P.3d at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, RH needed to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Larsen\n   </em>\n   factors and his testimony reveals he did so. Because RH was clearly competent to testify, Mr. Winters was not prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to challenge his competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

Officer Hallock described responding to the Mills police station upon receiving notice RH had been found.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Hallock eventually placed RH in his patrol car to speak with him. Officer Hallock explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. ... I first asked him if he was all right. And he told me that he was not all right, he was not okay.

The State argued the statements were admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, but the district court sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b630] Later, RH testified. He told the jury that after he and Mr. Winters crossed the river, Mr. Winters \"humped my leg and he put his pee pee in my butt,\" \"stuck his tongue in my butt,\" and \"put his mouth on [my] pee pee.\"\n   <em>\n    After RH's testimony\n   </em>\n   , the State called Rosemary Bartle, who performed the first CAP interview. During her testimony, the State,\n   <em>\n    without objection\n   </em>\n   , played the videotape of the first CAP interview for the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other things, RH told Ms. Bartle during the interview that a man with a hat and \"mean\" clothes \"stole\" him from the bowling alley; he and the man walked to the \"lake\" and went in the water; the man was holding onto him in the water by his hip and then let go so he thought he was drowning; the man touched his \"private stuff\" with his mouth; and his private stuff \"makes [him] go to the bathroom.\" The State then re-called Officer Hallock as a witness. This time,\n   <em>\n    without objection\n   </em>\n   , Officer Hallock testified as to what RH told him had happened at the river:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   What the child told me was after going to a campsite near the river with a male subject, the male subject had touched him all over and put his mouth on his privates. ... [And] that the man told him if he screamed or told anybody about what had happened, he would kill him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b631] Mr. Winters complains trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the first CAP interview and RH's statements to Officer Hallock because both were clearly inadmissible hearsay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   W.R.E. 801 (\" 'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\"), W.R.E. 802 (stating hearsay is generally inadmissible). Yet, he acknowledges a declarant's prior consistent statements are \"not hearsay if ...

This rule makes clear a witness's prior consistent statements are not considered hearsay if four conditions are met: (1) the declarant testifies at trial; (2) the declarant is subject to cross-examination concerning the prior statement; (3) the prior statement is consistent with the declarant's trial testimony; and (4) the prior statement is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 98,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822731\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/1108/\">\n    367 P.3d at 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [\u00b632] The district court concluded the CAP interview and RH's statements to Officer Hallock were admissible as prior consistent statements under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) and trial counsel was not deficient in failing to object.

First, RH told Officer Hallock Mr. Winters had touched him \"all over,\" but RH testified Mr. Winters never touched him with his hands. This argument assumes that when RH told Officer Hallock Mr. Winters touched him \"all over,\" he meant Mr. Winters touched him \"all over\" with\n   <em>\n    his hands\n   </em>\n   . But RH never told Officer Hallock Mr. Winters touched him \"all over\" with\n   <em>\n    his hands\n   </em>\n   . We can imagine other ways Mr. Winters could have touched RH \"all over\" without using his hands, i.e., with his mouth or penis. Second, RH told Officer Hallock Mr. Winters put his mouth on his privates, but RH told the jury his clothes never came off. As we have already explained, there are several explanations for how Mr. Winters could have placed his mouth on RH's privates without RH's clothes ever being completely off. Third, RH told Officer Hallock Mr. Winters had threatened to kill\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   , whereas RH testified Mr. Winters had threatened to kill\n   <em>\n    his family\n   </em>\n   . RH consistently told both Officer Hallock and the jury that Mr. Winters had threatened lethal force, only the victim was different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b636] In the end, we do not find the differences between RH's statements to Officer Hallock and his testimony to be significant enough to render them outside the scope of Rule 801(d)(1)(B).

RH admitted: (1) his mother and the prosecutor had reviewed with him the things he had said previously, someone had helped him remember things, and it had helped him remember things; (2) he lied to Mr. Winters that TP had taken his money; (3) he \"slipped\" into the river; and (4) Mr. Winters \"help[ed]\" him get across the river by carrying him so he \"wouldn't drown.\" These latter two points were significant because they were consistent with Mr. Winters' version of events and undermined the State's theory it was Mr. Winters who took RH into the river.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   [\u00b650] In his reply brief, Mr. Winters expounds upon his prejudice argument, claiming had counsel interviewed RH prior to trial, he would not have asked RH on cross-examination whether Mr. Winters had put his mouth on RH's \"pee pee.\" According to Mr. Winters, it was not until this question that RH claimed Mr. Winters put his mouth on RH's penis. That is true. But, once again, we need not consider this argument as it was raised for the first time in his reply brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pena\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 44 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152901\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/98/857/\">\n    98 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   874 n.6. Nevertheless, it appears trial counsel's question was strategic. As we explain later, Mr. Winters' DNA was not conclusively found on RH's\n   penile swabs. However, trial counsel elicited from Ms. Normington that one would expect Mr. Winters' DNA to have been found on those swabs if Mr. Winters had put his mouth on RH's penis. Therefore, by having RH tell the jury Mr. Winters put his mouth on his privates and then having the State's expert admit that if that had occurred Mr. Winters' DNA would be on RH's penile swabs, trial counsel effectively undermined RH's version of events. Moreover, we fail to see how Mr. Winters was prejudiced by this question as the jury later heard RH telling Ms. Bartle (during the first CAP interview) and Officer Hallock that Mr. Winters had put his mouth on RH's privates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b651] Having failed to show prejudice, Mr. Winters claims prejudice is presumed in this case because RH was the only eye-witness to the abuse.

Additionally, as we will explain in more detail below, trial counsel effectively cross-examined Ms. Normington, downplaying the harmful DNA evidence and drawing key concessions from Ms. Normington which supported Mr. Winters' defense theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   [\u00b656] Trial counsel was not deficient in failing to interview RH or Ms. Normington prior to trial and, even assuming arguendo he was, Mr. Winters cannot show he was prejudiced as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

She testified for the State that a mixture of DNA was found on RH's anal swabs and the major contributor of that DNA was Mr. Winters. Her reports were also submitted to the jury. In one of her reports, but not specifically testified to, she concluded the swab of RH's left hand contained a mixture of DNA which included RH's DNA and that of another individual or individuals. However, no conclusion could be made whether the mixture included Mr. Winters' DNA because the \"data ... was too low to reliably interpret.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   [\u00b658] On cross-examination, Ms. Normington admitted she did not test the DNA to determine whether it came from semen or blood and the amount of Mr. Winters' DNA found on RH's anal swabs was .00037 nanograms,\n   a very small amount. She also testified there was a possible mixture of DNA on RH's penile swabs, but she could not make a conclusion as to whether RH or Mr. Winters was a contributor because the \"data was too low to reliably interpret.\" Yet, she admitted \"if an individual put someone else's penis in their mouth and it wasn't that long in time afterwards,\" you would expect to find the individual's DNA on a penile swab. She also told the jury a person's DNA can be transferred to another individual via innocent touch or DNA transfer, which Ms. Normington described as if Person A rubs Person B's sleeve with her hand and then Person C rubs Person B's sleeve with her hand, Person A's DNA could be found on Person C's hand. She conceded it was possible that if a person was holding someone's hand and one of the individual's \"scratched [his] butthole,\" the other person's DNA could be transferred to the individual's anus. And, she admitted even a major contributor's DNA could have arrived on the source via DNA transfer. Finally, she told the jury DNA evidence is not infallible and is subject to human error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   [\u00b659] During closing argument, trial counsel pounded the point home, emphasizing the extremely small amount of Mr. Winters' DNA found on RH's anal swabs\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Ms. Normington's admission that such small amount was consistent with DNA transfer. He then asked the jury, \"Is it so ridiculous to think when we've had testimony about a kid being in the river and he had sand, is it so ridiculous to think that that little boy's butt didn't itch and he didn't scratch it?\" He also highlighted the lack of DNA on RH's penile swabs, asking the jury, \"Do you think that if ... [RH's] penis was in my client's mouth, as the State wants you to believe, that there wouldn't be any DNA? None? That's ridiculous.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   [\u00b660] In his Rule 21 motion, Mr. Winters complained trial counsel was prejudicially deficient in failing to consult with or call a DNA expert at trial. In support, he provided an affidavit and testimony from Dr. Miller, a DNA expert and forensic scientist, who was available to testify at trial and would have told the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (1) no semen or sperm was detected by the crime lab;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (2) no serological testing, i.e., testing to identify bodily fluids, was carried out in this case but it should have been done;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   (3) DNA found on RH's left hand was consistent with Mr. Winters;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   (4) Mr. Winters' DNA was not found on RH's penis yet had Mr. Winters placed his mouth on RH's penis, as alleged, saliva would have been present and detectible;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   (5) RH's DNA was not detected on Mr. Winters' penis but an unknown person's DNA was present; if Mr. Winters had rubbed his penis against RH, as alleged, there was a \"strong possibility\" that RH's DNA would have been present on Mr. Winters' penis;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   (6) while Mr. Winters' DNA was a major contributor of the DNA found on RH's anal swabs, there was also DNA from RH and another unknown person, thereby demonstrating that a third person's DNA was transferred to RH's anus without any sexual contact;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   (7) given the level of interaction between Mr. Winters and RH, there are numerous innocent explanations for Mr. Winters' DNA being present on RH's anus, including RH holding Mr. Winters' hand and then scratching his anus, water from Mr. Winters could have run down the back of RH while coming out of the river, and Mr. Winters could have coughed or sneeze on RH while coming out of the river; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   (8) the amount of Mr. Winters' DNA on RH's anal swabs was exceptionally low and consistent with secondary DNA transfer rather than saliva.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The district court rejected the claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   [T]rial counsel was well versed in DNA testing and results. He was able to effectively cross examine the State's DNA expert, and point out areas of doubt in the DNA tests and the lack of positive DNA results for sperm and saliva. Mr.\n   Winters' defense was more than adequately presented by his own trial testimony, and trial counsel's cross examinations of the State's witnesses. Reviewing the evidence presented, it cannot be determined that trial counsel's failure to consult and call a DNA expert was ineffective assistance of counsel. Furthermore, even if trial counsel's failure was deficient, there has been no showing of prejudice to Mr. Winters. Mr. Winters has only shown that the defense's theory of the case was not accepted by the jury, and it is complete speculation to conclude that testimony from an expert would have changed the outcome of the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   [\u00b661] Mr. Winters reiterates the arguments he raised in the district court.

He had tried between 40 and 50 cases, including murder and sexual assault cases involving DNA. He attended a week-long seminar regarding DNA analysis, had consulted with DNA experts in the past, and had read various articles on DNA. While he knew he was not a DNA expert, he believed he had a \"fair understanding\" of DNA and a sufficient knowledge of it to \"make strategic decisions.\" His strategic decision in this case was to minimize the damaging DNA evidence through cross-examination of Ms. Normington. And, although that strategy did not result in Mr. Winters' acquittal, it was successful in addressing many of the matters Dr. Miller would have opined on, while at the same time avoiding testimony that would have hurt Mr. Winters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   [\u00b664] First, Ms. Normington admitted on cross-examination she did not know whether the DNA found on the anal swabs came from saliva or semen because no serological testing had been performed. Although she did not opine, as Dr. Miller did, that serological testing should have been done in this case, even Dr. Miller's opinion contained an important caveat: \"In this case, had testing been carried out\n   <em>\n    with subsequent negative results\n   </em>\n   (meaning no semen, sperm, or saliva was detected), this information would have been useful to Joshua Winters at trial.\" Consistently, Dr. Miller admitted at the Rule 21 hearing that asking for more testing is a \"double-edged sword\" and counsel should know the results will help his client before asking for more testing. Trial counsel agreed, stating further DNA or serological testing is always a gamble; while it could be helpful, it could also prove \"very hurtful\" to a defendant depending on the results and \"there's nothing worse than proving the State's case for them.\" That is why trial counsel did not seek more testing but rather was pleased the testimony simply showed no semen or saliva was found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   [\u00b665] Second, defense counsel downplayed the significance of the presence of Mr. Winters' DNA on RH's anal swabs, having Ms. Normington admit the amount of DNA was very small, consistent with DNA transfer, and possibly could have occurred from innocuous conduct-Mr. Winters holding RH's hand and RH subsequently scratching his anus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   [\u00b666] Third, trial counsel's questioning of Ms. Normington led her to concede the testing\n   of RH's penile swabs was inconclusive as to the presence of Mr. Winters' DNA, yet she would expect that had Mr. Winters put RH's penis in his mouth, as RH claimed, Mr. Winters' DNA would be found on RH's penile swabs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   [\u00b667] Admittedly, trial counsel did not specifically address the DNA found on RH's left hand, most likely because Ms. Normington found the test results were inconclusive as to whether Mr. Winters' DNA was present. And we acknowledge Dr. Miller could have testified, as he did at the Rule 21 hearing, that six out of the six alleles of DNA found on RH's left hand foreign to RH were consistent with Mr. Winters, which would have supported the defense theory that RH himself transferred Mr. Winters' DNA to his anus, especially given that the small amount of DNA found on RH's anal swabs was consistent with DNA transfer. Yet, Dr. Miller also admitted that, applying a similar analysis to the DNA found on RH's penile swabs, three out of three alleles of DNA foreign to RH were consistent with Mr. Winters. In other words, had Dr. Miller testified at trial regarding Mr. Winters' DNA being found on RH's left hand, the State would have elicited on cross-examination that the foreign DNA found on RH's penile swabs was also consistent with Mr. Winters. That would have contradicted Mr. Winters' theory that no sexual contact occurred, and it would have completely undermined the point trial counsel did make with Ms. Normington-if Mr. Winters placed his mouth on RH's penis, as RH contended, you would expect to find Mr. Winters' DNA on the penile swabs, yet his DNA was not found there. It is to this concern which trial counsel testified, \"there is a risk in calling just about any expert\" as the expert will be subject to cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   [\u00b668] Mr. Winters attempts to downplay Dr. Miller's conclusion regarding RH's penile swabs. First, he claims \"there is nothing to suggest that defense counsel was aware of this information at the time of trial, so it could not have formed the basis for a decision not to call a DNA expert.\" That is true; however, it does show Mr. Winters was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to call a DNA expert as the expert would have provided damaging testimony. Second, he claims while Dr. Miller said the DNA present on RH's penile swabs was consistent with Mr. Winters, he also said: \"This could be a single source person who just happens to match the two people. And it actually looks more like a single source profile.\" As Mr. Winters would have it, this testimony shows Dr. Miller to have believed the DNA on RH's penile swabs was from someone other than Mr. Winters. Mr. Winters misreads the testimony. Dr. Miller was correcting the prosecutor who stated there was a mixture of Mr. Winters' and RH's DNA on the penile swabs (even though Dr. Miller had previously stated \"it looks like just a small mixture of the two of them\"). In any event, while Dr. Miller may have been able to minimize his opinion, the jury still would have heard from him that the DNA found on the penile swabs was consistent with Mr. Winters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   [\u00b669] We also acknowledge Ms. Normington did not inform the jury that DNA from an unknown person was found on RH's anal swabs (thereby demonstrating DNA was transferred to RH's anus without any sexual contact) or that RH's DNA was not found on Mr. Winters' penile swabs even though RH claimed Mr. Winters rubbed his penis on him. However, that RH was not a contributor to the DNA found on Mr. Winters' penile swabs was contained in her report, which was admitted into evidence. Moreover, as to the additional DNA on the anal swabs, had Dr. Miller been called to testify to that information, the State would have cross-examined him, as it did at the Rule 21 hearing. During that cross-examination, Dr. Miller admitted the additional foreign DNA on RH's anal swabs, which consisted of a few alleles, could be explained by his mother folding the shorts he was wearing, living in the same house with him, or sitting in the same chair as him. According to him, \"everybody carries a little bit of foreign DNA on them.\" At the same time, Dr. Miller would have confirmed that Mr. Winters' DNA was present on RH's anal swabs, stating: \"To a scientific degree of certainty, that is Josh Winters' DNA on that anus, unless he has an identical twin.\" He also would have admitted that although the lab could not reach a conclusion as to whether RH's own DNA was present on his anal\n   swabs, Mr. Winters' DNA was in fact present there. Therefore, while counsel certainly could have called Dr. Miller to testify to the additional DNA on RH's anal swabs and the lack of RH's DNA on Mr. Winters' penile swabs, Dr. Miller would have also emphasized the presence of Mr. Winters' DNA on RH's anal swabs and opined that DNA on RH's penile swabs was consistent with Mr. Winters', which would have hurt his defense. As trial counsel aptly explained at the Rule 21 hearing: \"[E]ven if you think you have one point [or two points or three points or four points] that you can bolster [with the testimony of a DNA expert], an experienced [prosecutor] ... is going to get ... the negative things out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   [\u00b670] Finally, we realize there is something to be said for having an expert testify to matters supporting the defense. But, as trial counsel also stated at the Rule 21 hearing, \"it's powerful to get the State's expert to make certain points that would help your case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   [\u00b671] Mr. Winters relies on\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that defense counsel should have called an expert.\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable and does not provide the support Mr. Winters imagines.

In response, the State filed its notice seeking to introduce evidence that in 1998, when Mr. Winters was 15-years-old, he was convicted in Rhode Island Family Court (juvenile court) of molesting his then 11-year-old adopted sister, KW, and his then five-year-old nephew, JF. In an interview with Rhode Island State Police Detective Brian Casilli, Mr. Winters admitted (1) he had oral sexual activity with his adopted sister; (2) that in 1996-1997, over a period of six weeks, he rubbed his bare penis on her bare vagina until he ejaculated; and (3) he gave her gifts (candy, gum, loose change) in exchange for the sexual contact. He also admitted he touched JF's genitals with his mouth, hands, and penis on multiples occasions in 1998. The State argued admission of this evidence was probative to showing Mr. Winters' motive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, it claimed that because Mr. Winters denied the sexual abuse occurred and claimed he crossed the river only as part of his rescuing RH, the other acts evidence, which like the charged crime involved underaged children as the victims, was probative to show his motive in crossing the river with RH was sexual gratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   [\u00b675] After holding a hearing, the district court decided the evidence was admissible under W.R.E. 404(b). It concluded the evidence was being admitted for the proper purpose of demonstrating motive, the evidence was relevant, and its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. In doing so, it considered and weighed each of the factors required by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Gleason v.

He told the jury allegations were made in 1998 that Mr. Winters, then 15 years old, had molested KW, his 11-year-old adopted sister. Mr. Casilli interviewed Mr. Winters in the presence of his mother. During the interview, Mr. Winters admitted that on five or six occasions in 1997 (when Mr. Winters was 14), over a period of several weeks, he rubbed his bare penis against KW's bare vagina and ejaculated on her stomach and he once rubbed his fingers against her vagina. He also admitted he would give her loose change or candy in exchange for these acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   [\u00b677] JF (now 24 years old) also testified at trial. He told the jury that in May 1998, when he was five years old, he told his mother \"Me and Josh ... make babies.\" He also shared with the jury that on one occasion, while he and Mr. Winters were in the basement of a nearby abandoned house, Mr. Winters \"used baby oil and rubbed himself on [my genitals] while I was on my back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   [\u00b678] Mr. Winters argues the admission of this other acts evidence was error in two respects. First, the evidence came from Mr. Winters' Rhode Island juvenile court proceedings, which are confidential and could not be used against him at trial. Second, the other acts evidence is too remote in time and too dissimilar to the current incident to be probative as to Mr. Winters' motive in this case. We start with his latter argument first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   [\u00b679] Because Mr. Winters' pretrial demand for notice of Rule 404(b) evidence properly preserved his arguments for appeal, our review is for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Mayhew v.

The issue is motive in a child sexual abuse case, not intent or lack of accident in a child physical abuse case. In the latter-type cases, it is important that the other acts evidence and the charged crime be similar in victim or in circumstances as it is these similarities which \"make accidental repetition unlikely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <em>\n    Swett\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571865\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/431/1135/#p1140\">\n    431 P.3d at 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary, when the issue is motive in a child sexual abuse case, the key similarity between the other acts and the charged crime is, as we have already explained, the relationship between the victims and the defendant's actions toward them. In this case, both the victims of Mr. Winters' other acts and the victim in the charged crimes were prepubescent children and both the other acts and the charged crimes involved him using these children for sexual gratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   [\u00b689] Mr. Winters' final argument relates to the confidentiality of his juvenile court records. He cites two Rhode Island statutes, but neither was violated in this case. The first, \u00a7 14-1-40, states in relevant part: \"The disposition of a child or any evidence given in the [Rhode Island Family Court] shall not be admissible as evidence against the child in any case or proceeding in any other court ....\" Evidence is \"the testimony and matters presented at trial for the purpose of proving a fact in issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The district court explicitly prohibited the admission at trial of any evidence of the disposition of Mr. Winters' crime by the Rhode Island Family Court and none was admitted. Moreover, the record from Mr. Winters' Rhode Island Family Court proceedings is not in our appellate record. Therefore, Mr. Winters has failed to show any evidence given in the Family Court proceedings was admitted at trial in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   [\u00b690] The other statute Mr. Winters relies on is \u00a7 14-1-64:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   All police records relating to the arrest, detention, apprehension, and disposition of any juveniles shall be kept in files separate and apart from the arrest records of adults and shall be withheld from public inspection, but the police report relating to the arrest or detention of a juvenile shall be open to inspection and copying upon request and upon payment of copying costs in accordance with \u00a7 38-2-4 by the parent, guardian, or attorney of the juvenile involved.

As such, they remained free from \"public inspection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   [\u00b691] We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the Rule 404(b) evidence to prove motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

The evidence showed Mr. Winters \"moved [RH] from a place or position occupied,\" i.e., from the bowling alley and then across the river. RH told Ms. Bartle during the first CAP interview that Mr. Winters \"stole\" him from the bowling alley. He told Officer Hallock he left the bowling alley with the man \"that gave him things\" and the man \"had taken\" him by the river to show him his camp. Ms. Brodrecht testified she saw Mr. Winters carrying RH across the river. This evidence shows Mr. Winters and RH did not simply spontaneously arrive at the river, but that Mr. Winters lured RH there and then carried him across the river.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   [\u00b696] To the extent Mr. Winters is claiming there has to be physical contact or force to effectuate a removal, he is mistaken. Nothing in the plain meaning of the word \"remove\" or the kidnapping statute itself requires such physical contact for purposes of establishing \"removal.\" On the other hand, the statute does require the removal to be \"unlawful\" and states one way in which a removal is \"unlawful\" is if it is \"accomplished ... [b]y force, threat, or deception.\" Section 6-2-201 (a)(ii), (b)(i). But the statute also deems a removal \"unlawful\" if it is \"accomplished [w]ithout the consent of a parent, guardian or other person responsible for the general supervision of an individual who is under the age of fourteen (14) ....\" Section 6-2-201 (a)(ii), (b)(ii). That was the theory in this case and the State adequately proved it: RH was five at the time and his mother testified she did not know Mr. Winters and did not give him permission to take RH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   [\u00b697] With respect to Mr. Winters' argument there was insufficient evidence he intended to sexually abuse RH \"at the time of the removal,\" we disagree. \"Because direct evidence of intent is rare, and circumstantial evidence is most often the only proof available, we have held that intent may be proven by circumstantial evidence alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343831\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/393/1257/\">\n    393 P.3d at 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The circumstantial evidence of Mr. Winters' intent to sexually abuse RH at the time he removed RH from the bowling alley was substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   [\u00b698] The evidence showed Mr. Winters gave RH money to play video games, claimed to have lost money, and promised RH money if he returned to help him look for the money. RH told Officer Hallock he left the bowling alley with the man who \"gave him things\" and the man took him to the river to show him the man's camp. Ms. Brodrecht testified Mr. Winters struggled to carry RH across a deep river to a secluded area with lots of bushes and trees. When Ms. Brodrecht asked if they needed help, Mr. Winters told her they were alright and waved her off. A reasonable inference from this evidence is Mr. Winters gained RH's trust at the bowling alley, lured him back to the bowling alley with the promise of money, lured him to the river by telling him he would show him his\n   camp, and deliberately carried RH across the river to a secluded area to sexually abuse him. Moreover, the Rule 404(b) evidence revealed Mr. Winters' motive in removing RH from the bowling alley and carrying him across the river to be sexual gratification. All of this circumstantial evidence, taken together, is more than sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Mr. Winters removed RH from the bowling alley and took him across the river with the intent to sexually abuse him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Merger of Sentences\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   [\u00b699] As already stated, one of the elements of kidnapping is the unlawful removal of another \"with the intent to ... [f]acilitate the commission of a felony.\" Section 6-2-201. In this case, the district court instructed the jury that to find Mr. Winters guilty of kidnapping, it had to find,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , he unlawfully removed RH \"[w]ith the intent to facilitate the commission of a felony, to-wit: sexual abuse of a minor in the first degree or sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree as charged in counts two and three and as defined in Instruction Nos. 18 and 22.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   [\u00b6100] Mr. Winters argues that because the jury was told the intent element of kidnapping could be satisfied with the elements of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor, the elements of the latter became elements of the former. Therefore, he tells us each crime does not contain an element different from the other and they are the \"same offense\" for purposes of sentencing. Consequently, he argues the district court's failure to merge his sentences for these crimes violated double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 11 of the Wyoming Constitution, both of \"which prohibit double punishment for the same offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Section 6-2-314(a)(i). It has defined sexual intrusion as \"[a]ny intrusion, however slight, by any object or any part of a person's body, except the mouth, tongue or penis, into the genital or anal opening of another person's body if that sexual intrusion can reasonably be construed as being for the purposes of sexual arousal, gratification or abuse\" or \"[s]exual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, analingus or anal intercourse with or without emission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-301\">\n    Wyo.

In particular, first-degree sexual abuse of a minor requires sexual intrusion, whereas kidnapping does not. That the kidnapping charge in this case referred to the first-degree sexual abuse of a minor charge is of no moment. The jury was not required to find every element of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor to convict Mr. Winters of kidnapping. Rather, it had to find only that Mr. Winters removed RH\n   <em>\n    with the intent\n   </em>\n   to commit first-degree sexual abuse of a minor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   [\u00b6104] Because Mr. Winters failed to show trial counsel to be constitutionally ineffective, we affirm the district court's denial of his Rule 21 motion for new trial. We also affirm Mr. Winters' convictions and sentences because the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the Rule 404(b) evidence to establish motive, there was sufficient evidence supporting the aggravated kidnapping conviction, and double jeopardy did not require the aggravated kidnapping and first-degree sexual abuse of a minor sentences to be merged.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    A surveillance camera from the local water treatment plant captured RH following Mr. Winters south on Wyoming Boulevard.

Mr. Winters relies heavily on the second CAP interview to show RH was incompetent to testify. Because we conclude RH's testimony shows him to have been competent to testify and therefore Mr. Winters could not have been prejudiced by the lack of a competency hearing prior to trial, we need not consider the second CAP interview.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    Mr. Winters suggests in his briefs the district court erred in not\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    holding a pretrial hearing to determine RH's competency to testify and objects to the limited inquiry the court did make prior to RH testifying, as it was not an adequate substitute for a competency hearing.

As a result, Mr. Winters claims trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a taint hearing.

Nevertheless, because we conclude the district court correctly decided counsel was not deficient in failing to object to the admission of the first CAP interview given it was admissible under the prior consistent statement exception to the hearsay rule, we need not reach the question of whether the failure to object can be justified as strategic. As a result, we need not decide whether counsel was deficient for not offering the second CAP interview as evidence at trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    To the extent Mr. Winters is attempting to raise a stand-alone claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on counsel's failure to introduce the second CAP interview as evidence at trial, we decline to consider it because it was not specifically raised below and, while trial counsel admitted at the Rule 21 hearing he knew about the second CAP interview, appellate counsel did not ask him to explain his reasons for not offering it at trial. And, the State lost the opportunity to explain RH's performance during the second CAP interview was the result of him having \"just a few hours of sleep.\" Therefore, there is an insufficient record to decide the issue.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Boucher v.

As a result, Mr. Winters spends much of his opening brief contesting the district court's reasoning on this point.

However, as to these individuals, he claims only that they \"would have provided valuable and insightful information about RH and his ability (or inability) to perceive, remember, communicate, and be truthful,\" in other words, his competency. We have already concluded counsel was not ineffective in failing to challenge RH's competency because his testimony demonstrates he was competent. Additionally, even had these individuals somehow provided information that would have deemed RH incompetent to testify, the result would not necessarily have been different. As trial counsel explained at the Rule 21 hearing, had RH not been allowed to testify due to incompetency, his statements and allegations of abuse would have likely come in a different way and he would have lost his opportunity to cross-examine RH. Moreover, the jury would never have heard RH admit during cross-examination that he \"slipped\" into the river, which was consistent with Mr. Winters's version of events.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    Moreover, trial counsel testified he did not interview RH's parents because he does not find victims' parents to be \"very cooperative\" and does not \"expect to get much\" from them.
