Plaintiffs also appeal the court's subsequent grant of summary judgment denying their damages claims in trespass and for property damage resulting from a self-help removal and destruction of the gate(s) placed across the roadway by Plaintiffs to limit access to the adjoining land to themselves and their guests. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 We address the following restated issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    1.

The former ranch property includes 86 twenty-acre lots with platted roadways and common areas. Shining Mountains North, a limited partnership, was the subdivider and most recent common owner of the property. Shining Mountains North subdivided the property in 1973 by filing an unreviewed subdivision plat prior to the effective date of the 1973 Montana Subdivision and\n   Platting Act (Title 76, chapter 3, MCA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Lee Metcalf Wilderness (hereinafter \"USFS land\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) borders on the eastern perimeter of the subdivision along the eastern boundaries of Lots 41-45, 54, 55, 70, 71, and 86. The Mustang Ranches plat does not identify, describe, or depict the adjoining USFS land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Upon filing of the subdivision plat, Shining Mountains North filed a separate written declaration of protective covenants reciprocally burdening and benefitting the subdivision lands. In pertinent part, the covenants limited use of subdivision lands to \"residential purposes only\" and charged the Mustang Ranches Association (Association), a Montana non-profit corporation, with oversight and maintenance \"of all common areas,\" including \"grading and maintenance of the major traverse roads,\" and maintenance of \"the existing ranch fencing around the perimeter of the property. ...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the covenants\n   and unrecorded Association bylaws, the Association membership includes\n   all record owners of subdivision lots who are current on their membership dues. Though the non-record rules and regulations of the Association reference the adjoining USFS land, the recorded Mustang Ranches covenants do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The Mustang Ranches plat clearly depicts and labels a connected network of 60' wide roadways within the subdivision. Every subdivision lot borders on at least one of the platted roadways. The platted roadway network thus provides multiple points of ingress and egress to and from the subdivision and adjoining exterior lands at various points around the perimeter of the subdivision. Subdivision lots currently access the public road system by direct or indirect connection to a county road from the west terminus of the platted Airport Road running along the southern boundary of the subdivision to its southwest corner (southwest corner of Lot 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Four of the platted interior roadways (McDeed Creek Road, Elk Valley Road, Shell Creek Road, and Cedar Mountain Road) run east to west with eastern termini on the eastern boundary of the subdivision and adjoining USFS land. The mid-line of the Elk Valley Road runs along the southern boundaries of Lots 71-78 and the adjoining northern boundaries of Lots 63-70. The road thus runs over a 30' strip of land within each of those lots.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any ingress or egress to or from the subdivision and adjoining USFS land via Elk Valley Road must necessarily pass over one or both of the 30' wide strips within and along the adjoining boundary between Lots 70 and 71.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Figures 1-2. Like other interior subdivision roadways, Elk Valley Road currently remains unimproved-essentially two wheel tracks across a barren field.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Figure 1 - Mustang Ranches Subdivision\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Figure 2 - Platted Elk Valley Road\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 By 1985 warranty deed (recorded 1987), Shining Mountains North conveyed Lot 71 to Bob and Audrey Chamberlin by reference to the previously filed Mustang Ranches plat but \"[s]ubject to easements and restrictive covenants and reservations of record. ...\" In 2012, Plaintiff Audrey O'Keefe (formerly Audrey Chamberlin), acquired sole title to Lot 71 from Bob Chamberlin via a recorded quitclaim deed that conveyed the lot by reference to the Mustang Ranches plat \"together with all tenements\" and \"appurtenances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 By 1982 warranty deed (recorded 1992), Shining Mountains North conveyed Lot 70 to Ronald Lerch by reference to the previously filed Mustang Ranches plat but \"[s]ubject to easements and restrictive covenants and reservations of record. ...\" Following mesne conveyances by recorded deeds from Lerch to Lennis and Connie Williams (1992) and then from Connie to Lennis (1999), Plaintiff Tim Beardsley acquired Lot 70 in 2002 by recorded warranty deed from Lennis Williams. The 1992, 1999, and 2002 deeds all conveyed Lot 70 by reference to the previously filed Mustang Ranches plat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Beardsley and his guests have used Lot 70, via Elk Valley Road, for seasonal access to and from the adjoining USFS land for recreational purposes, primarily elk hunting. There is no record evidence of any other use of Lot 70 or 71 by the current or prior owners of those lots. Like Elk Valley Road, Lots 70 and 71 remain unimproved lots platted over a barren field.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 For some time after the 1973 subdivision of the former ranch land, a preexisting stock fence continued to exist along the eastern perimeter of the subdivision and adjoining USFS land. There is no evidence that the stock fence had any purpose other than to control ranging ranch stock. The record indicates that the stock fence was gone, down, or otherwise open at the east end of the Elk Valley roadway before the dispute arose in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Sometime prior to 2015, Beardsley became aggrieved with other Mustang Ranches landowners \"trespassing\" over his land on the platted Elk Valley Road to access the adjoining USFS land for elk hunting or other seasonal recreational purposes. According to Beardsley, the perceived trespassers would occasionally drive down and park their vehicles on Elk Valley Road either as a vantage point for spotting elk coming down from the mountains on the adjoining USFS land or as a point of entry thereto. With O'Keefe's \"knowledge and consent,\" Beardsley placed a cable gate (a cable hung between two wooden posts) across the platted Elk Valley Road where it crosses the western boundaries of Lots 70 and 71, along with approximately 100 feet of fencing running north and south from each end of the gate along the western boundary of each lot, thereby blocking access on the road over those lots from the interior of the subdivision to and from the eastern terminus of the road and adjacent USFS land. The gate remained undisturbed and unchallenged for several years until taken down by persons unknown. Within months, Beardsley installed another gate to again similarly block access over the eastern end of Elk Valley Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Another onsite incident occurred at some point in 2013 or 2014\n   when a Mustang Ranches lot owner, who was also an Association\n   officer, passed through the gate when left open by one of Beardsley's friends who had left his vehicle unattended on the road. While Beardsley's friend was away on the adjoining USFS land, the Mustang Ranches landowner immobilized the unoccupied truck by removing one of its wheels and then left. Following a criminal prosecution of the landowner, the roadway dispute later flared up again when two Mustang Ranches lot owners, who were also Association officers, took a backhoe down the east end of Elk Valley Road and dug up Beardsley's cable gate posts, leaving the posts and cable on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 On April 20, 2015, Beardsley and O'Keefe responded by filing a complaint in the Montana Fifth Judicial District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs asserted that the east end of Elk Valley Road, from the western boundary lines of Lots 70 and 71 to the east terminus of the road on the eastern boundary of the subdivision, benefitted only those lots to the exclusion of the other Mustang Ranches lots. Plaintiffs further sought compensatory and punitive damages based on trespass and asserted property damage to Beardsley's cable gate and fencing. In 2017, following hearing on the parties' cross motions, the District Court granted the Association, et al., summary judgment that the Mustang Ranches Plat and pertinent conveyances of subdivision lots by the common owner created a roadway easement over the disputed segment of Elk Valley Road to the benefit of the other Mustang Ranches lots for ingress and egress to and from the adjoining off-plat land. In 2018, the Court further granted summary judgment to the Association, et al., on Plaintiffs' damages claims based on its earlier ruling and resulting conclusion that Plaintiffs thus had no right to compensation for property damage to a wrongfully placed gate removed from the road easement way by easement holders. Upon entry of final judgment encompassing the District Court's summary judgment rulings, Plaintiffs timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 We review district court grants or denials of summary judgment de novo for conformance to M.

Here, neither the Mustang Ranches plat, nor any other instrument of conveyance, COS, or map of record, depicts or describes any off-plat parcel either owned by the common grantor or previously burdening the subdivided land. Thus, as a matter of law, the common grantor could not have previously granted or reserved an easement over any of the Mustang Ranches lots to the benefit of other commonly owned land, whether on-plat or off.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 70-17-105, -111(1)(a), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    Broadwater Dev.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 36 ;\n   <em>\n    Mularoni\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 29. Under these circumstances, the severance of Mustang\n   Ranches lots from common ownership by conveyance with qualifying deed language of \"reservation\" and by reference to the previously filed Mustang Ranches plat manifests clear and unequivocal intent of the common owner and grantor to create a common plan subdivision wherein every lot touched by the depicted network of connected subdivision roadways would be burdened by the roadways to the common benefit of all other subdivision lots. In turn, the deeds and referenced plat similarly manifest clear and unambiguous grantor intent to reciprocally benefit each so-burdened lot to the similar burden of other subdivision lots touched by the connected roadway network. The connected roadway network, with multiple roadway termini around the perimeter of the subdivision, clearly and unambiguously manifests the intended purpose and use of the depicted roads-to create and allow multiple points of ingress and egress to and from subdivisions lots and adjoining exterior lands over which rights of way or entry may independently have existed at the time or thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 The Mustang Ranches plat clearly labels, depicts, and describes by dimension the Elk Valley Road as a \"60' Road Easement\" traversing over and through Lots 70 and 71 along their adjoining boundary from the interior of the subdivision to its eastern perimeter.

We disagree.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   involved a seven-tract division of land straddling a state highway (Whitefish Stage Road) between Whitefish and Kalispell in Flathead County.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2. In 1979, the common owners (Davis and McCready) filed a COS subdividing a parcel of land bisected by the highway into seven smaller tracts-two adjoining tracts (Tract 1 and 4) on the west side of the highway and the other five on the east side of the highway.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2-4. Each of the five eastside tracts bordered either the highway or an intersecting county road to the north.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. The two westside tracts adjoined along their\n   respective southern and northern boundaries, with their eastern boundaries running along the west side of the highway.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b623 The originating 1979 COS clearly depicted a strip of land, labeled \"30' Easement Road,\" running east to west over Tract 1 inside its northern boundary between its western boundary and the highway.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. At the northwest corner of Tract 1, the depicted roadway turned and ran south inside the west boundaries of the adjoining Tracts 1 and 4 where it terminated at adjoining off-survey land to the south.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. The COS did not identify or depict the off-survey lands to the north and west of Tract 1 and to the south and west of Tract 4. After filing the COS, one of the common owners (Davis) \"assumed ownership\" of the two tracts (Tracts 1 and 4) on the west side of the highway and the other (McCready) \"assumed ownership\" of the other five tracts (Tracts 2, 3, and 5-7) on the east side of the highway.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2-5. Davis thereafter used the depicted roadway over Tracts 1 and 4 as a farm road between the highway and other off-survey lands that \"he owned to the south and west of Tract 4.\"\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b624 In 1987, by reference to the 1979 COS, Davis conveyed Tract 1 to the Lockmans, \"SUBJECT TO [a] 30 foot road easement as shown on\" the COS.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. Through a series of conveyances starting in 1999, the Sugar Shack Land Trust ultimately acquired Tract 1 to the benefit of the Waldhers.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b625 In 1989, by reference to the 1979 COS, Davis sold Tract 4 to the Fosters who later subdivided it into an eastern tract and a western tract.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. The Fosters then sold the new western sub-tract of Tract 4 to Blazer.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. Later in 1989, Blazer acquired the lands to the south and west of Tract 4 from Davis, thus giving Blazer ownership of the western sub-tract of Tract 4 and the adjoining off-survey lands to the south and west.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b626 In 2003, Blazer sued the Tract 1 owner and interested parties for declaratory and injunctive relief based on his asserted claim of right to use the easement depicted over Tract 1 in the 1979 COS.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Blazer asserted that the easement benefitted both Tract 4 and his adjoining off-survey properties to the south and west.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. Reversing a subsequent judgment in favor of Blazer, we held that the 1979 COS and 1987 Davis-Lockman deed that severed Tract 1 from common ownership with the retained Tract 4 and Davis's adjoining off-survey lands were insufficient to clearly and unambiguously express his intent to reserve the depicted easement over Tract 1, whether for the benefit of Tract 4 or Davis' adjoining off-survey lands.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 46-77. As a preliminary matter, we held that the qualifying\n   language \"subject to\" in the 1987 Davis-Lockman deed was insufficient alone to create an easement.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. As to Davis's retained off-survey lands, we further held that the deed and referenced COS were insufficient together to reserve the depicted easement benefitting the off-survey lands because nothing in the COS clearly described or depicted those lands with reasonable certainty\n   as an intended dominant estate over Tract 1.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 46-54. As to on-survey Tract 4, we held that 1987 deed and referenced 1979 COS were even insufficient to reserve the depicted easement over Tract 1 to the benefit of on-survey Tract 4 due to ambiguity on the face of the COS as to whether Davis intended to reserve the depicted easement for the benefit of the original Tract 4 (which already bordered the highway) or the other five tracts created by the COS on the other side of the highway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 56-77.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b627\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   is only superficially analogous here. Granted, as in\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , the parties here are disputing whether the conveyances severing Lots 70 and 71 from common ownership by reference to a record plat depicting a roadway easement over those lots were sufficient to burden them to the benefit of the other subdivision lots, thereby allowing the owners of other subdivision lots to access adjoining but unidentified off-plat land. However, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , the Defendants here are not asserting that the pertinent deeds and referenced Mustang Ranches plat created an easement over Lots 70 and 71 to the benefit of (i.e., running with title to) the adjoining off-plat land. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , the Defendants here are asserting that the pertinent deeds and referenced subdivision plat were sufficient to create an easement over Lots 70 and 71 to the benefit of (i.e., running with title to) the other subdivision lots-not unidentified off-plat land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b628 As to the on-plat lands at issue here,\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   is similarly analogous only to the superficial extent that the on-plat issue in\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   was whether the pertinent deed and referenced COS were sufficient to reserve a depicted easement over one on-survey tract (Tract 1) to the benefit of another on-survey tract (Tract 4). However, the qualifying\n   deed language in\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   (\"subject to\" the COS-depicted \"easement\") did not include the additional qualifying deed language of \"reservation\" present here.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   's Tract 4 holding further uniquely turned on an ambiguity on the face of the COS as to which of the on-survey tracts the grantor intended the depicted easement to benefit-the retained adjoining tract over which the depicted easement also traversed on the west side of the highway or the five tracts then in common ownership on the other side of the highway. No similar circumstance and resulting ambiguity exists here-the Mustang Ranches subdivision is wholly contained within a contiguous larger parcel without similar bisection, includes a platted network of connected roadways, and none of the subdivision lots at issue have independent adjoining access to an identified, previously existing public roadway as in\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   is thus legally and factually distinguishable in all material regards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b629 The terms of the originating instruments of conveyance determine the permissible scope of use of express easements.

Citing cases that did not involve easements by reference (\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Mix\n   </em>\n   ), the Court proceeds to reason that, \"[i]f the originating conveyance grants or reserves an easement in only general terms,\" then the scope of this generally granted easement \"includes any purpose reasonably related to the general purpose expressed.\" Opinion, \u00b6 29. The Court then concludes that access to the adjoining, off-plat lands is a purpose reasonably related to the easement indicated on the subdivision plat, crossing Plaintiffs' lots. Opinion, \u00b6 30. I respectfully disagree with these analytical propositions and the conclusion reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b639 There is no dispute that an easement by reference to the plat was created for purposes of accessing the lots of the subdivision. But the precise question here is whether an easement was properly created for a different purpose-accessing property beyond the subdivision. In my view, the issue here is not purely about the scope of a created easement, but is, foundationally, whether an easement for off-plat access was properly created in the first place. If it was, then questions about its scope-the particulars about utilization of the off-plat access, including what uses are \"reasonably related\"-would appropriately come into play. However, I do not believe that is now the question. Rather, there is a threshold issue here involving creation of the easement under proper application of the easement-by-reference doctrine, for which\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   is the seminal authority. While\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   did not involve identical facts, governing principles articulated there control the outcome here, because that case \"clarif[ied] exactly what is required to create an easement under the easement-by-reference doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b640 The \"dispositive issue\" in\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   -\"the adequacy of the description on [the] COS\" of the asserted easement,\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 45, is also the dispositive issue here. An easement created by reference in an instrument of conveyance to a plat or COS must be \"adequately described-must arise expressly, not by implication.\"\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 41.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   instructed further about an adequate description, explaining the intended easement \"must be\n   <em>\n    clearly and unmistakably communicated\n   </em>\n   on the referenced plat or certificate of survey.\"\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 43 (emphasis added). The reason for this requirement is that a buyer must be able\n   to know the extent of the burden upon the property he is purchasing-indeed, we have held the buyer acquires a right that the easement will only be used in the manner indicated on the plat: \"[W]here land is sold with reference to a map or plat showing a park or like open area, the purchaser acquires a private right, generally referred to as an easement, that such area\n   <em>\n    shall be used in the manner designated\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32 (internal quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis added). We explained that, \"in determining the existence of an easement by reservation in the documents of conveyance, it is necessary that the grantee of the property being burdened by the servitude\n   <em>\n    have knowledge of its use or its necessity\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 36, 56 (emphasis added). Critically, we have required as follows: \"[I]t is essential that an intention to convey or create a\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   interest in real property is\n   <em>\n    clearly expressed\n   </em>\n   in the documents of conveyance.\"\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 69 (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Charles W. Willey,\n   <em>\n    Montana Real Estate Transactions\n   </em>\n   141-42 (2010) (among other requirements \"the plat map or COS must also\n   <em>\n    show\n   </em>\n   the easement's use or necessity\") (emphasis added). We held that such clear indication of the particular purpose is mandatory, and explained that we\n   had previously upheld easements allegedly created by reference only if this purpose was clearly evident from the incorporated document.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 52. In contrast, \"we have never recognized an easement created to benefit a dominant tenement that was\n   <em>\n    not ascertainable\n   </em>\n   from the referenced plat or certificate of survey.\"\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 52 (emphasis added). In\n   <em>\n    Tungsten\n   </em>\n   , we rejected a claim that a parcel resembling a roadway on the incorporated plat, and for which there was \"no other conceivable purpose,\" constituted a road easement, because such purpose was not identified upon the plat.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tungsten\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b641 The \"particular\" purpose asserted in the present case is that the easement indicated on the plat not only provided access to the subdivision lots, but also burdened the lots with the provision of access to off-plat lands. The Court views the plat as obviously providing such access, stating broadly that \"[t]he platted roadway network [ ] provides multiple points of ingress and egress to and from the subdivision and adjoining exterior lands at various points around the perimeter of the subdivision.\" Opinion, \u00b6 5. However, in accordance with our precedent, I believe notification that the easement would burden individual lots with the provision of access to the off-plat lands must have been clearly expressed on the incorporated plat, giving knowledge of such designated use to the buyers of the property. Buyers had to be given knowledge of the \"designated manner\" in which the easement would be\n   used.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 30, 56. Here, the incorporated plat failed to provide notice to Plaintiffs that individual lots would be burdened with providing access to off-plat lands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b642 As noted by Appellants, a strikingly similar case, involving claimed access to off-plat public lands by way of a platted easement for a subdivision road, was decided by the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County.\n   <em>\n    Wirth v. Flaherty, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. DV-13-255B (Mont. Dist. Ct. Jan. 21, 2015). As here, lot owners claimed access to off-plat public lands by way of the subdivision road easement over Plaintiff Wirths' lot. The easement had been created by reference to a COS. The District Court noted the following facts and dispositive principles:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   COS 518 does not adequately depict an access easement to the Gallatin National Forest. First, there is no access point or outlet to the National Forest depicted on COS 518. Further, the Gallatin National Forest is not labeled on COS 518.... Thus, there is nothing depicted on COS 518 that would give prospective purchasers of Lot 8 (the burdened lot) knowledge that the road easement depicted across Lot 8 was for the additional use or necessity of accessing the National Forest. The fact that the eastern border of the road easement is conterminous with the western border of the National Forest is inconsequential. An easement by reference, such as the road easement at issue here, must be \"clearly and unmistakably communicated\" on the COS. The right to access the National Forest from the road easement cannot be found to exist through inference or implication.\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 43.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Wirth\n   </em>\n   , pp. 12-13. The\n   <em>\n    Wirth\n   </em>\n   District Court, in reliance upon the easement-by-reference doctrine outlined in\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   , denied the claimed access, properly reasoning that off-plat access was not indicated on the plat and that such access would burden the Plaintiffs' lot beyond that which was established by the referenced documents, and beyond which they were notified when they purchased the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b643 Virtually the same facts, and the same deficiencies these facts present under the easement-by-reference doctrine, that existed in\n   <em>\n    Wirth\n   </em>\n   could also be stated about the platted easement at issue here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same governing principles from\n   <em>\n    Blazer\n   </em>\n   should likewise control. I would reach that conclusion, and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Justices Beth Baker and Laurie McKinnon join in the dissenting Opinion of Justice Rice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The \"USFS Land\" label in Figure 2 of the Opinion is an addition to the plat made by the Court for clarification. That label is not on the original plat.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
