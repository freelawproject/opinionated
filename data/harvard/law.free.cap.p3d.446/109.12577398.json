(collectively, Children) to their paternal grandmother (Grandmother). M.C.W., Children's mother (Mother), filed a post-judgment motion challenging the court's permanency order. Mother argued (1) that the court should order additional investigation into the safety, fitness, and appropriateness of Grandmother's permanent home in another state and the relatives residing there; (2) that the evidence presented at the permanency hearing was insufficient to support Children's permanent placement with Grandmother; and (3) that the court should grant a new trial or alter or amend its findings of fact and conclusions of law to reflect evidence presented at trial that was not included in the court's permanency order. The juvenile court denied the motion, and Mother appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 Mother has appeared before the juvenile court twice for dependency proceedings initiated by the Utah Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS). In 2008, a juvenile court determined that Children were abused and neglected and removed them from Mother's custody. The basis for the removal was\n   Mother's substance abuse, a drug overdose, and incidents of domestic violence. After Mother's successful completion of reunification services, the juvenile court returned Children to her custody in 2009 and terminated further protective supervision services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 The second dependency proceeding followed Mother's arrest on July 19, 2016. Mother and Children were residing at a shelter for victims of domestic violence when police responded to a complaint that Children were assaulting staff members and damaging the facility. When they arrived at the shelter, police learned that Mother had an outstanding warrant. She was arrested, and Children were placed in the protective custody of DCFS. The juvenile court then determined that Mother abused and neglected Children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 At the first shelter hearing in July 2016, the juvenile court found that removal of Children from Mother's custody was necessary and in their best interests. The court determined that Children could be safely returned to Mother's custody only if DCFS provided protective supervision. The court appointed a guardian ad litem for Children and ordered DCFS to prepare a service plan for Mother. The service plan required Mother to provide meals, maintain safe and legal housing for Children, and undertake parent training. The court also ordered Mother to refrain from using drugs and alcohol, to submit to drug tests, and not to associate with anyone under the influence of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 At a second shelter hearing in August 2016, Mother conceded that she could not keep Children safe from each other and could not prevent their destructive behavior. Mother therefore voluntarily agreed to return Children to DCFS custody. Children were placed in the temporary custody of DCFS, and the juvenile court ordered DCFS to consider Grandmother, who lived in Arkansas but who was willing to relocate to Utah to care for Children, as a potential placement option for Children. The court was aware that Grandmother had assumed periodic custody of Children over the years when Mother and Children's father had been unable to provide for them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Thereafter, Mother requested that the juvenile court return Children to her custody. During a pretrial hearing in September 2016, the juvenile court postponed ruling on Mother's request and allowed the State and the guardian ad litem to continue to look into other possible placements for Children. The court allowed DCFS to make a provisional placement with Grandmother, who at this point had moved from Arkansas to Utah, once she successfully completed a background check. The court also ordered DCFS to provide reunification services to Mother for twelve months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 At the subsequent adjudication/disposition hearing, the court ordered Mother to undergo a psychological evaluation, parenting training, and family therapy; to obtain stable housing and a legal means of income; and to participate in an assessment to determine the family's needs. Mother made little progress in following this plan however. Her participation in individual therapy was a precondition for starting family therapy, but she did not think she needed therapy and did not attend any sessions for approximately five months after being notified of this requirement. The month she began attending therapy, Mother lost her job and housing, and she stopped attending family therapy. She had continued difficulties in visits with Children, and she often argued with Grandmother, the DCFS caseworker, and Children during those visits. Mother also had trouble following through with appropriate parenting skills during her parent-time and often blamed Children for the problems. During the reunification period, Mother did not maintain consistent employment or obtain stable housing. In contrast, after Children were placed with Grandmother, she consistently cared and provided for them. Grandmother relocated from Arkansas to Utah to care for Children, obtained an apartment and employment, and engaged in behavior-related training and therapy to learn how to better control Children's problematic behaviors. Grandmother\n   provided consistent discipline and ensured that Children attended school, therapy, and parent-time with Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Mother's permanency hearing began in July 2017 and lasted five days. Throughout the proceedings, the juvenile court recognized that it was in Children's best interests to be placed in a guardianship with a relative if they could not be returned safely to Mother's custody at the end of the reunification period. To that end, Grandmother had informed the court that she was \"willing to have [Children] placed with her if [it was] deemed appropriate.\" Because Grandmother was a permanent resident of Arkansas, she testified at the permanency hearing to the conditions she would provide for Children in Arkansas. Grandmother owned her own business and lived with her husband (Step-grandfather), Children's aunt (Aunt), and Aunt's two young children. Grandmother had been married to Step-grandfather for fifteen years, and he had attended classes for foster parents. They had purchased a five-bedroom house in May 2016, which was being remodeled. Grandmother informed the court about the school Children would attend, her plans to take them to school, and her intention to continue to facilitate their participation in therapy. Grandmother testified that Step-grandfather was once a drug user but that he had been drug-free for over forty years. Neither Grandmother nor Step-grandfather currently used any alcohol or controlled substances. Grandmother acknowledged that Step-grandfather once had Hepatitis C and cirrhosis, and had received a liver transplant; she also acknowledged that Step-grandfather was convicted of robbery forty-five years ago. Grandmother indicated that the records from these incidents have been sealed and that Step-grandfather eventually received a pardon from Arkansas's governor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Based on the evidence presented at the permanency hearing and Mother's failure to comply with the service plan, the juvenile court found by a preponderance of the evidence that returning Children to Mother \"would create a substantial risk of detriment to their emotional well-being.\" The court found that guardianship with a relative was the most appropriate plan for Children and thus awarded Grandmother permanent custody and guardianship, and it terminated reunification services for Mother. The findings of fact in the court's permanency order do not include information about Step-grandfather, Aunt, or Grandmother's household in Arkansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 After the permanency order was entered, Mother filed a post-judgment motion for a new trial or to amend the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. The juvenile court denied the motion, and Mother appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Mother appeals the juvenile court's permanency decision on several grounds. First, she contends that the court erred in denying her post-judgment request for additional investigation into Grandmother's living situation in Arkansas. This challenge requires us to determine whether the mandatory fitness and safety provisions contained in Utah Code section 78A-6-307, applicable at the initial stages of a child welfare proceeding, also apply to a juvenile court's permanent placement decisions. This is a question of statutory interpretation, which we review for correctness, giving no deference to the juvenile court's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    In re B.N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20224\">\n    2018 UT App 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574812\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/10/\">\n    438 P.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Second, Mother contends that the juvenile court's findings of fact are insufficient to support its decision to award Grandmother permanent guardianship of Children. \"We afford great deference to the juvenile court's findings of fact,\"\n   <em>\n    In re A.C.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994291\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/185/\">\n    2009 UT 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994291\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/185/\">\n    221 P.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and will overturn the court's decision only \"if it either failed to consider all of the facts or considered all of the facts and its decision was nonetheless against the clear weight of the evidence,\"\n   <em>\n    In re B.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362626\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/171/435/\">\n    2007 UT 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362626\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/171/435/\">\n    171 P.3d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, we give the juvenile court \"a wide latitude of discretion as to the judgments arrived at based upon not only the court's opportunity to judge credibility firsthand, but also based on the juvenile court judges' special training, experience and interest in this field.\"\n   <em>\n    In re E.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11102938\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/21/680/\">\n    2001 UT App 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11102938\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/21/680/\">\n    21 P.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Third, Mother contends that the juvenile court improperly denied her post-judgment request for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment, arguing that the court's permanency decision was not supported by sufficient evidence. We review motions for a new trial and motions to amend a judgment for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    In re A.F.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996946\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/216/980/\">\n    2009 UT App 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996946\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/216/980/\">\n    216 P.3d 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The [juvenile] court's denial of a motion for a new trial will be reversed only if the evidence to support the [judgment] was completely lacking or was so slight and unconvincing as to make the [judgment] plainly unreasonable and unjust.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jessop v.

Mother also contends that the factual findings set forth in the court's permanency order were inadequate to justify the court's legal conclusions. \"We review the legal adequacy of findings of fact for correctness as a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Shuman v.

Fitness and Safety\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Mother contends that the mandatory fitness and safety provisions of section 78A-6-307 of the Utah Code applicable to a juvenile court's initial and temporary placement decisions made at a shelter hearing also apply to the court's permanent placement decisions. Specifically, she argues that a harmonious reading of the statutes governing child welfare proceedings mandates that the fitness, safety, and appropriateness requirements contained in section 78A-6-307 apply throughout all phases of child welfare proceedings. When interpreting statutes, our primary objective \"is to give effect to the intent of the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    In re J.M.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982342\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/280/410/\">\n    2011 UT 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982342\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/280/410/\">\n    280 P.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If the court finds continued removal necessary but the child is not returned to the custody of the child's other parent, then section 78A-6-307(7) governs. Pursuant to that section, the juvenile court must first determine whether \"there is a relative or a friend who is able and willing to care for the child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256096\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-307(7)(a). \"If a willing relative or friend is identified under Subsection (7)(a), the court shall make a specific finding regarding\" the fitness, safety, and appropriateness of the placement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256096\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-307(10)(a).

At this stage, the court is not yet entirely familiar with all the circumstances of the case and has limited information about the parties. Therefore, pursuant to the plain language of the statute, to facilitate placement of a child with a friend or relative, the requirements in section 78A-6-307(11) are mandatory only in\n   connection with the initial placement of the child with a willing relative or friend.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256096\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-307(11)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 If the juvenile court determines that continued removal of a child is necessary, it then must establish a permanency plan and determine whether reunification services are appropriate for the child and the child's family.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256096\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-312(2). \"In all cases, the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the court's paramount concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256096\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-312(5).

Specifically, Mother argues that pursuant to subsection 78A-6-307(11), before Grandmother could be awarded permanent guardianship of Children, the court was required, at a minimum, to order a background check on Step-grandfather and the other individuals residing at Grandmother's house in Arkansas and to order DCFS to visit the Arkansas household. Mother contends that section 78A-6-307(11)'s requirements apply throughout the pendency of a child welfare proceeding. We disagree. A plain language reading of section 78A-6-307 demonstrates that the requirement for background investigations applies only to the determination of whether a child's placement is appropriate at the commencement of the reunification period. Section 78A-6-307 sets forth the required procedures for shelter hearings and the initial placement of a child who has been removed from parental custody. Subsection (11) states that the requirements concerning background checks apply to \"making the finding described in Subsection (10)(a).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256096\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-307(11).

She always made Children available for Mother's parent-time and never missed any therapy appointments. Grandmother also received significant training related to Children's behaviors.

One reason the court gave for its denial of Mother's post-judgment motion is that Mother failed to point the court to the portions of the record demonstrating \"which of the proposed facts were actually presented to the Court, whether they were disputed, or merely raised through questions by counsel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the juvenile court found that it lacked \"the ability to determine if these facts were raised at trial in such a manner that the Court could find them to be true or not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b634 Mother contends that because the juvenile court required her to cite the record in her motion, the juvenile court did not in fact consider any of the information Mother sought to be added to the court's permanency order. Mother argues that the juvenile court's alleged failure to consider her evidence \"make[s] the verdict plainly unreasonable and unjust.\" She claims that \"[h]ad the juvenile court reviewed the hearing audio, it would have discovered ... that the juvenile court, [DCFS], and Mother would benefit from additional time to gain more information.\" We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b635 To the extent that the proposed findings are supported by evidence in the record, Mother has not demonstrated that the court did not consider this evidence when making its permanency decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10342637\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/912/969/#p979\">\n    912 P.2d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979 (Utah 1996) (stating that the court \"is not required to recite each indicia of reasoning that leads to\n   its conclusions\").

The juvenile court was cognizant of this fact, stating that it chose to retain jurisdiction over Children \"purposefully so that those unknown issues could be addressed and monitored by the Court to the extent possible.\" The court's permanency order adequately sets forth the basis for its permanency decision, and the court was not required to give further explanation as to why Grandmother's testimony was credible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re S.T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11953762\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/928/393/#p398\">\n    928 P.2d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398-99 (Utah Ct.
