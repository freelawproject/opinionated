We are asked to answer a novel question: Must the district court appoint a court visitor and follow the statutory vetting procedures outlined in sections 15-14-304 and - 305, C.R.S. 2018, before it can appoint a guardian for an incapacitated person? We answer that question \"yes.\" We hold that the court is required to appoint a visitor for every petition for guardianship filed and that all prospective guardians must undergo the statutorily mandated process outlined in sections 15-14-304 and - 305 before the court can appoint a guardian. Because the ARC was not subjected to this statutory vetting process, we reverse the court's order and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Mr. Arguello, an adult resident of Pueblo, suffers from dementia, developmental disability, and mental health illness. He has spent most of his life with his parents in Denver. He moved to Pueblo sixteen years ago with his sister, Lynn Quintana, after his mother died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Mr. Arguello receives services from Pueblo Community Resources (PCR), where Nora McAuliff supervises his care. He lives in a host home with a caregiver he has known for many years. In 2016, the court appointed Ms. Balsick to be an emergency guardian when medical decisions needed to be made and family was unavailable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Soon thereafter, several persons petitioned the court to be appointed permanent guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Petitioner McAuliff initially nominated Ms. Balsick as sole guardian and later nominated Mr. Arguello's older sister, Adele Uballe, who lives in Pueblo, to be co-guardian with Ms. Balsick. Ms. Quintana and her daughter, Tammy Gonzalez, also petitioned the court to be Mr. Arguello's co-guardians. They both live in Denver and planned to move Mr. Arguello to Denver if appointed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The court appointed court visitor Julie Thompson-Polk to prepare a visitor's report concerning all prospective guardians, and it set the matter for a hearing. Ms. Thompson-Polk prepared three reports. The first report investigated and considered the appointment of Ms. Balsick as sole guardian. It did not recommend Ms. Balsick's appointment because of her employment with Bluesky and the existence of a potential conflict of interest under section 15-13-310(4), C.R.S. 2018 (precluding a long-term care provider from also serving as a guardian). A first amended report also investigated and considered the appointment of Ms. Quintana and Ms. Gonzalez as co-guardians. The amended report expressed concerns about Mr. Arguello living with Ms. Quintana and Ms. Gonzalez and being moved to Denver. A second amended report investigated and considered the proposed co-guardianship of Ms. Balsick and Ms. Uballe and repeated the potential conflict concerns about Bluesky and Ms. Balsick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 After several hearings, the court found that Ms. Quintana and Ms. Gonzalez were not suited to be co-guardians because a move to Denver would not be in Mr. Arguello's best interests. As well, the court found that Ms. Uballe would not be a suitable guardian due to her physical limitations, her advanced age, and her distant relationship with Mr.\n   Arguello. Finally, the court found that Ms. Balsick would not be a suitable guardian because she was employed by Bluesky, which also served as Mr. Arguello's long-term care provider, as defined in section 15-13-310(4), C.R.S. 2018, of the Colorado Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act (CUGPPA). The court concluded that a conflict of interest precluded Ms. Balsick's appointment because she could potentially be required to choose between Mr. Arguello's best interests and those of her employer, Bluesky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Finding no suitable guardian from among the petitioners, the court sua sponte appointed ARC, for good cause, because (1) ARC does not provide long-term care or case management services for individuals and, thus, would have no conflict of interest; and (2) the court was aware that ARC serves as guardian for many other individuals with developmental disabilities in Pueblo County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Bluesky and Ms. Balsick moved for reconsideration, contending that (1) the court erred in finding that Bluesky was a long-term care provider as defined by the statute and (2) ARC was improperly appointed because no petition nominating it as a guardian had been filed. The court denied the motion for reconsideration stating, \"[e]ven if the facts of the case do not fall squarely within C.R.S. \u00a7 15-14-310(4) [the prohibition against appointment of employees of long-term care providers], this Court has jurisdiction to appoint the guardian it believes will best serve [Mr. Arguello's] interests.\" The court also found that it had broad discretion to appoint a guardian and noted that Bluesky had offered no legal authority requiring that the guardian be reviewed by a court-appointed visitor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Refusing to Appoint Ms. Balsick as Guardian\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Bluesky first contends that it is not a long-term care provider under the statute and that PCR serves that role for Mr. Arguello. It reasons that because it provides case management services, not prohibited under section 15-14-310(4), the court legally erred in applying the statutory prohibition to Ms. Balsick. Bluesky further argues that the court's ruling effectively gives ARC a monopoly on professional guardian services in Pueblo. Because we conclude that the court acted within its discretion in finding that Mr. Arguello's best interests would not be served by appointing Ms. Balsick, given the potential for a conflict to arise, we need not decide whether Bluesky is a long-term care provider under section 15-14-310(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A. Additional Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The conflict issue first arose in the visitor's report. Ms. Thompson-Volk noted that Bluesky provides Mr. Arguello with case management services under Colorado's comprehensive services DD waiver, and she opined that this implicated the prohibitions listed in section 15-14-310(4) and (5). She noted that Ms. Balsick, as guardian, \"would have the duty and obligation to select the Respondent's service providers during the service plan meeting,\" and that, \"in theory, [she] could change the Respondent's service provide[r] so [that] [Bluesky] would provide additional services to the Respondent.\" Ms. Thompson-Volk further noted that the guardian would participate in Mr. Arguello's annual Supports Intensity Scale Assessment, used to determine his funding level, and that Bluesky, acting through Ms. Balsick, could theoretically \"generate additional income for itself.\" Finally, Ms. Thompson-Volk noted that the DD waiver required Bluesky to investigate mistreatment allegations, and she questioned whether appointing a Bluesky employee as guardian was in Mr. Arguello's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 At the hearing, petitioner McAuliff was asked to explain Bluesky's role in Mr. Arguello's life. She testified that Mr. Arguello has a Bluesky service coordinator whose function is to \"monitor the services that we, as an agency [PCR] provided, as well as coordinat[e] his services.\" She agreed that Bluesky provides case management services, and that she is \"subject to supervision from [Bluesky] as to how those services [were] being followed.\" She further explained that the Bluesky coordinator is involved in the annual staffing to determine who will provide what services for the coming year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Ms. Balsick testified that Bluesky's service coordinator is paid by Medicaid, while she, as Bluesky's guardianship coordinator, is paid through a grant. She admitted that she receives her salary and benefits from Bluesky, and that she is \"treated the same as any employee of [Bluesky].\" Ms. Balsick agreed that Bluesky provides Mr. Arguello with case management services which assist eligible individuals to \"gain access to needed medical, social, educational and other services.\" She also testified the same person cannot be both the service coordinator and the guardian of the same individual at Bluesky, but she conceded that Bluesky employs and pays persons in both positions. And she explained that PCR is Mr. Arguello's \"direct service provider.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.

The court may appoint a guardian if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is an incapacitated person whose needs cannot be met by less restrictive means. \u00a7 15-14-311, C.R.S. 2018. The court must appoint the person it believes is best suited to protect the best interests of the incapacitated person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 15-14-310, - 314(1), C.R.S. 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 While a nonprofit corporation is eligible for guardianship appointment, \u00a7 15-14-310 cmt., section 15-14-310(4) states that \"[a]n owner, operator, or employee of a long-term-care provider from which the respondent is receiving care may not be appointed as guardian unless related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or adoption.\" Long-term care is defined as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   services designed to provide diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitative, supportive, and maintenance services for individuals who have chronic physical or mental impairments, or both, in a variety of institutional and noninstitutional settings, including the home, with the goal of promoting the optimum level of physical, social, and psychological functioning of the individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00a7 25.5-6-104(2)(h), C.R.S. 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Case management services are defined as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   the assessment of a long-term care client's needs, the development and implementation of a care plan for such client, the coordination and monitoring of long-term care service delivery, the direct delivery of services as provided by this article or by rules adopted by the state board pursuant to this article, the evaluation of service effectiveness, and the reassessment of such client's needs....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00a7 25.5-6-104(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   C. Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 In finding that Bluesky is a long-term care provider under section 15-14-310(4), the court considered the definitions of long-term care provider and case management services,\n   as well as the official comment to section 15-14-310, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A professional guardian can still be appointed guardian if no one with priority is available and willing to serve or if the Court, acting in the respondent's best interest, declines to appoint a person having priority. A public agency or nonprofit corporation is eligible to be appointed guardian as long as it can provide an active and suitable guardianship program and\n   <em>\n    is not otherwise providing substantial services or assistance to the respondent\n   </em>\n   , but is not entitled to statutory priority in appointment as guardian.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b619 The court recognized that while the facts of this case may not fall \"squarely\" within the long-term care provider exception of section 15-14-310(4), they nevertheless demonstrated a potential conflict of interest between Bluesky and Ms. Balsick that rendered her unsuitable as a guardian for Mr. Arguello. And the record demonstrates that Bluesky \"provides substantial assistance\" to Mr. Arguello in the form of case management services. The court acknowledged Ms. Balsick's professionalism and experience, but determined that because she is employed by Bluesky, it would not be in Mr. Arguello's best interest for her to serve as his guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b620 We discern no abuse of discretion in the court's finding and conclude that it is well supported by the record. Indeed, petitioner McAuliff, an employee of PCR, admitted that she is supervised by Bluesky, which also employs Ms. Balsick. And Ms. Balsick admitted that Bluesky's service coordinator, with input from the guardian, determines Mr. Arguello's needed services and service providers, including whether to continue with PCR and whether to request additional services through Bluesky. Therefore, regardless of whether Bluesky technically meets the statutory definition of a long-term care provider, Ms. Balsick, as its employee, would have the ability, as guardian, to recommend increased funding for Mr. Arguello and thereby generate revenues for Bluesky. Moreover, as guardian, Ms. Balsick would have oversight of Bluesky's case management services and could be hesitant, as a Bluesky employee, to question Bluesky's actions. Because a trial court is in the best position to judge the character and appropriateness of those who would be guardian, we discern no abuse of discretion and therefore affirm the court's order refusing to appoint Ms. Balsick.\n   <em>\n    Runyon\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8 ;\n   <em>\n    Estate of Keenan v.

The Court Erred in Appointing ARC Without Appointing a Court Visitor Under Section 15-14-305(1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b621 Bluesky next contends that the court violated the statutory mandate in section 15-14-305(1) by appointing ARC without first appointing a visitor and receiving a report. Because the statute's plain language requires appointment of a court visitor, we agree. Therefore, we reverse the court's order appointing ARC as guardian for Mr. Arguello, and we remand the case to appoint a visitor, prepare a visitor's report, set a hearing, and enter a new order appointing a guardian for Mr. Arguello.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A.

App. 1995) (\"The use of the word 'shall' in the statute is presumed to indicate a mandatory requirement.\"). This construction is consistent with the official comments to the UGPPA explaining that the visitor is the information gathering arm of the process who protects the incapacitated person's right to due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Runyon\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12 (finding official comments persuasive). And neither the statute nor the comments contain an exception to this process that could be applied here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b631 Finally, we are not persuaded that the court's \"good cause\" finding requires a different result. The statute contains no \"good cause\" language permitting the court to appoint a guardian without first appointing a visitor and reviewing the visitor's report. And we may not read language into the statute that does not exist.\n   <em>\n    Boulder Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs v.

Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 We reverse the court's order appointing ARC as Mr. Arguello's guardian. We remand the case for the court to appoint a visitor, to follow the procedures set forth in sections 15-14-304 and - 305, and to appoint a suitable guardian for Mr. Arguello. In all other respects, the order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   JUDGE ROM\u00c1N concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   JUDGE WEBB concurs in part and dissents in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   JUDGE WEBB concurs in part and dissents in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b633 The majority concludes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that while the issue could not be resolved under section 15-14-310(4), C.R.S. 2018, a potential conflict of interest between Bluesky and Ms. Balsick rendered Ms. Balsick an unsuitable guardian for Mr. Arguello. In my view, this conclusion begs the question whether the court had any discretion to consider conflicts of interest other than those set out in section 15-14-310. Because I read this statute as fully addressing the conflict problem, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b634 On the one hand, section 15-14-310(1) identifies categories of \"otherwise qualified\" persons who may be appointed as guardians. The list includes spouses and adult children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b635 But spouses have the same potential conflict that the court visitor ascribed to Ms. Balsick. Where a spouse as guardian advocated for reduced services to the protected person, marital assets otherwise spent for such services would be available to the spouse. An adult child who was also a beneficiary of the protected person's will would have a similar conflict in that reducing services to the protected person would increase the value of the probate estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b636 On the other hand, the statute identifies relationships where the potential for conflict is disqualifying. The majority discusses section 15-14-310(4). In addition, subject to certain exceptions, under section 15-14-310(5), \"the same professional may not act as an incapacitated person's or a protected person's: (I) Guardian and conservator; or (II) Guardian and direct service provider; or (III) Conservator and direct service provider.\" Simply put, the General Assembly has squarely taken up the conflict problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b637 Neither ARC nor, for that matter, the majority, cites any authority for the proposition that where a statute has addressed a category-here, conflicts of interest-of prohibited conduct, courts retain discretion to broaden the scope of the prohibition. Nor have I found any in Colorado. To the contrary, \"[w]hen the legislature speaks with exactitude, we must construe the statute to mean that the inclusion or specification of a\n   particular set of conditions necessarily excludes others.\"\n   <em>\n    Lunsford v.
