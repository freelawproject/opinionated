Houck argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it imposed a condition of community custody that prohibited him from associating with known drug users and sellers and erred by imposing a condition of community custody that prohibited possession or consumption of medical marijuana under the Medical Use of Cannabis Act, ch. 69.51A RCW. Houck also challenges the trial court's imposition of LFOs and interest provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We hold that the trial court's imposition of community custody conditions was proper, but that the $200 criminal filing fee and interest provision must be stricken. We also hold that the State bears the burden of demonstrating that Houck's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has not previously been collected and remand for the trial court to consider whether the DNA collection fee should be imposed. Accordingly, we affirm in part and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 A jury convicted Anthony Houck of unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of\n   a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The trial court sentenced Houck to a term of confinement and community custody. The trial court imposed the following relevant community custody conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (B) While on community placement or community custody, the defendant shall: ... (4) not consume controlled substances except pursuant to lawfully issued prescriptions; ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [x] have no contact with known drug users/sellers except in [treatment] setting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 As a part of Houck's sentence, the trial court ordered Houck to pay the $500 crime victim penalty assessment, $200 criminal filing fee, and $100 DNA collection fee. The trial court waived interest on all fees until 90 days following his release from custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 Houck appeals the trial court's imposition of the aforementioned community custody conditions, the criminal filing fee, the DNA collection fee, and the interest provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I. COMMUNITY CUSTODY CONDITIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b66 Houck challenges the community custody conditions prohibiting him from association with known drug users and sellers and prohibiting him from consuming controlled substances except pursuant to lawfully issued prescriptions. Houck argues that the condition prohibiting association with known drug users and sellers is unconstitutionally vague. He further argues that the trial court did not have lawful authority to impose the condition prohibiting him from consuming controlled substances except pursuant to lawfully issued prescriptions because the condition subjects him to criminal sanctions if he possesses or consumes\n   marijuana for medical purposes in violation of the Medical Use of Cannabis Act.

Houck argues that the term \" 'local government' \" should be read narrowly to mean something similar to the other words associated\n   with the term, namely, \" 'correctional agencies' \" and \" 'jails.' \" Appellant's Opening Br. at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b627 Houck's arguments rely on the assumption that former RCW 69.51A.005(4) and RCW 69.51A.055(1)(a) create an exhaustive list of which agencies or departments can impose community custody conditions regarding controlled substances. However, the language of the statutes indicate otherwise. \"Nothing in this chapter diminishes the authority of correctional agencies and departments, including local governments or jails, to establish a procedure for ...\n   <em>\n    the effective supervision\n   </em>\n   of those on active supervision for a criminal conviction.\" Former RCW 69.51A.005(4) (emphasis added). \"The arrest and prosecution protections established in RCW 69.51A.040 may not be asserted\n   <em>\n    in a supervision revocation or violation hearing\n   </em>\n   by a person who is supervised by a corrections agency or department, including local governments or jails.\" RCW 69.51A.055(1)(a) (emphasis added). The statutes on which Houck relies apply to establishing procedures for \"effective supervision\" and to \"supervision revocation or violation hearing[s].\" Former RCW 69.51A.005(4) ; RCW 69.51A.055(1)(a). The imposition of community custody conditions fit into neither of these categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b628 Houck also argues that RCW 69.51A.055(1)(a) grants supervising entities, not courts, exclusive authority to restrict medical marijuana use. However, a supervising entity has the authority to execute only the court-imposed sentence by supervising offenders\n   <em>\n    on the basis\n   </em>\n   of conditions imposed by the court. RCW 9.94A.030(4), .704(2)(b). Furthermore, the DOC may exercise its authority only by imposing an additional community custody condition when it does not interfere or contradict conditions imposed by the court. RCW 9.94A.704(6). Therefore, although such agencies or departments may have authority to impose community custody conditions regarding controlled substances, their authority is limited by conditions imposed by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b629 Houck's argument also implies that the Medical Use of Cannabis Act supersedes RCW 9.94A.703. We disagree. A court is required to impose the following condition unless it exercises its discretion to waive it: an offender must \"[r]efrain from possessing\n   or consuming controlled substances except pursuant to lawfully issued prescriptions.\" RCW 9.94A.703(2)(c). As noted above, the Medical Use of Cannabis Act did not implicitly or explicitly repeal the statutory classification of marijuana as a schedule I controlled substance.\n   <em>\n    Atchley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3973671\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/142/147/#p164\">\n    142 Wash.

The trial court also ordered Houck to pay interest on his nonrestitution LFOs. Houck challenges the imposition of the $200 criminal filing fee and the $100 DNA collection fee, as well as the imposition of interest, on the basis that the trial court failed to consider his ability to pay those fees as required by RCW 9.94A.777(1) and based on recent statutory amendments that apply to his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b631 The State concedes that the $200 criminal filing fee and the interest provision should be stricken from Houck's judgment and sentence, but the State maintains that the imposition of the DNA collection fee was proper because Houck failed to prove that the State has previously collected his DNA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 43.43.7541.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b632 The legislature recently amended former RCW 36.18.020(2)(h) to prohibit the superior courts from imposing the $200 criminal filing fee and interest on the nonrestitution portions of LFOs on defendants found indigent under RCW 10.101.010(3)(a) through (c).

A defendant suffers from a mental health condition when the defendant has been diagnosed with a mental disorder that prevents him from participating in gainful employment. RCW 9.94A.777(2). Based on the evidence Houck presented at sentencing, the trial court was required to consider, under RCW 9.94A.777(1), whether Houck has the means to pay LFOs.
