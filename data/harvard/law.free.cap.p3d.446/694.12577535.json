Before Gorman-Lykken testified, defense counsel objected to the proximity of the corrections officer assigned to Gorman-Lykken while he was on the witness stand. Defense counsel suggested that this procedure was the \"usual protocol.\" 4 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 341. The trial court responded, \"Let me just touch base with the corrections officer.\" 4 RP at 341. The officer stated that \"If he's up here, we're up here.\" 4 RP at 342.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 The trial court then observed that sometimes one to three corrections officers were assigned to a defendant in court and that \"[s]ometimes those individuals are large, larger than average.\" 4 RP at 342. By contrast, the court noted that the corrections officer assigned to Gorman-Lykken was \"not one of [our] largest corrections officers, and there's only one of her.\" 4 RP at 342. The court also stated that \"the policy [of] the corrections staff is that ... they are to be in close proximity to somebody who is testifying that's been accused of a crime.\" 4 RP at 342.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 The trial court's only other discussion of the objection was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I don't think it's any surprise to the jurors that with the corrections officer what she's doing here, they've seen her throughout the trial. So with his repositioning ... to the witness stand - - I'm sensitive to the concern of - - the concern is I think that, well, we have to have this officer nearby because this person is dangerous, this person is going to run.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I mean, the jury could think many different things, and I think that's the concern that [defense counsel] in part is\n   expressing by bringing the motion to change the position of the corrections officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   4 RP at 342-43.

The court identified the potential prejudice, stating that the officer's presence would suggest that Gorman-Lykken was dangerous and was going to run. And the court noted that there was only one officer and that she was not very large. But the court never stated case-specific reasons\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   this case or this defendant created the need for this security measure. The court simply stated, \"I'm comfortable having the officer stay where she's at.\" 4 RP at 343.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b632 The only reason that appears in the record for having the corrections officer stationed by the witness stand was the officer's own preference and defense counsel's reference to the \"usual protocol.\" 4 RP at 341-42. Therefore, the record supports the conclusion that the trial court simply deferred its decisionmaking authority and discretion to the corrections officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b633 Accordingly, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the corrections officer to be stationed next to the witness stand when Gorman-Lykken testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   4.

And there is no indication that the State could show harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. Even though stationing an officer next to the witness stand may not be inherently prejudicial, allowing that measure created a risk that the jury might infer that Gorman-Lykken was dangerous or guilty. The State cannot show beyond a reasonable doubt that stationing the officer next to the witness stand did not influence the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b636 Further, the evidence of Gorman-Lykken's guilt was not so overwhelming that a guilty verdict was the only rational result. At trial, Gorman-Lykken's girlfriend testified that she had taken medication that essentially put her to sleep and that she had told Gorman-Lykken not to have sex with her while she was asleep. But Gorman-Lykken testified that he asked his girlfriend if she was up for sex, that she verbally agreed, and that she was coherent during the sexual activity. Therefore, the jury was presented with conflicting evidence, not evidence that overwhelmingly established Gorman-Lykken's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b637 We hold that the trial court's error in allowing an officer to be stationed next to the witness stand when Gorman-Lykken testified was not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b638 We reverse Gorman-Lykken's conviction and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   SUTTON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Melnick, J.

The court did not make an individualized determination of necessity. Whether or not this error alone requires reversal, I agree with Gorman-Lykken that cumulative error requires the reversal of his conviction. Additional errors included an inaccurate \"to convict\" jury instruction, as well as several improper statements by the prosecutor in closing arguments.

He argues that the instruction relieved the State of its burden to prove\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the elements of second degree rape beyond a reasonable doubt, and instead allowed the jury to convict him if the prosecutor proved\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   of the elements.

But the prosecutor was incorrect that defense counsel's statement about when the brother came forward was false.

On re-cross-examination, he affirmatively stated that the first time he had \"mentioned anything about this [case] to anyone connected with law enforcement was two days ago.\" RP (Sept. 15, 2017) at 386.

Defense counsel then made several arguments casting doubt on NK's credibility. Defense counsel also argued that because NK's blood test results were not admitted at trial, the jury should have questions about what sort of substances a pharmacologist might have found in her blood, and what effect a stimulant like Adderall would have in tandem with depressants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b658 Defense counsel also reminded the jury that Gorman-Lykken testified \"about abuse of Oxycodone and\n   abuse of Adderall by both he and [NK] and the history that they had of doing that. Shattering pills and snorting them to get a quick hit ... [the prosecutor] could have called [NK] to the witness stand to rebut that. He didn't do it.\" RP (Sept. 15, 2017) at 434. And defense counsel argued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   If you're looking at a trend, a habit of drug abuse involving those two drugs, Oxycodone and Adderall, in other words, an opioid and a central nervous system stimulant, all bets are off ... about what that really is going to mean in someone's brain, and that has everything to do with how somebody might be if they have taken a whole cocktail of drugs like Oxycodone, Gabapentin, and alcohol, but at the same time they're under the influence of an amphetamine-type stimulant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   RP (Sept. 15, 2017) at 435.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b659 The prosecutor responded in rebuttal, \"According to the defendant-and his theory is basically this-that drug addicts can't be raped, and that's not true and that's not fair.\" RP (Sept. 15, 2017) at 443.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b660 It is improper for a prosecutor to \"misrepresent[ ] defense counsel's argument in rebuttal, effectively creating a straw man easily destroyed in the minds of the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Thierry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453891\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/190/680/#p690\">\n    190 Wash.

Defense counsel's comments cannot fairly be interpreted as arguing that NK could not be raped because she was a drug addict.

He emphasized that there was \"uncertainty about exactly what [NK's] mental state was.\" RP (Sept. 15, 2017) at 434. Defense counsel's argument was that nobody knew whether the combination of drugs that NK had taken would affect her ability to give consent to sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b662 The court erred by failing to consider the prejudicial effect of the uniformed guard standing next to the Gorman-Lykken\n   while he testified.

I do not suggest a resolution on these issues because the other improper arguments made by the prosecutor, along with the other errors in this case, amount to cumulative error necessitating reversal.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
