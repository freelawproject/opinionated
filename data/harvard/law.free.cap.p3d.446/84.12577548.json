Heather Wollsieffer (Mother) moved the court to hold Father in contempt for his refusal to comply with certain terms of that judgment. After a bench trial, the trial court found Father in contempt for his failure to satisfy his child support obligations and awarded Mother the attorney fees she incurred in her enforcement proceeding. The court also modified Father's child support obligations. Father appeals. We affirm and remand to the trial court for a determination of Mother's attorney fees reasonably incurred on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Father and Mother divorced in Illinois in 2013. They entered into a settlement agreement, and based upon that agreement, an Illinois court issued a judgment (Illinois Divorce Judgment) awarding Mother sole custody of the parties' children, subject to Father's parent-time. Based on his income, the court ordered Father to pay $ 935.85 as\n   child support every two weeks. Moreover, the Illinois court directed Father to provide additional child support in the amount of 32% of any net bonuses and any income earned in excess of his annual income used for calculating child support (Additur Provision). The Illinois Divorce Judgment required each party to pay one-half of the daycare expenses for the children. When the decree was entered, the parties were living in different states. They anticipated daycare expenses of $ 2,000 per month, due in part to Mother's work-related travel. In the settlement agreement, the parties acknowledged that Mother planned \"to move to the state of California\" with the children, and Father, who resided in South Dakota at the time, was \"moving to Florida.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In 2015, both parties briefly resided in Utah and Father registered the Illinois Divorce Judgment with the Utah court. In August 2015, Father petitioned for modification of the Illinois Divorce Judgment, alleging that a substantial and material change in circumstances justified altering the existing orders. Father primarily sought a reduction in his child support obligation, but he also requested that the court \"make equitable orders regarding parent time and award [Father] statutory parent time\" because Mother had allegedly been interfering with his parent-time. Father served Mother with the petition to modify in October 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Mother moved to dismiss Father's petition, arguing that Father had failed to establish a substantial and material change in circumstances that would support modification of his child support obligation and the parent-time provisions of the Illinois Divorce Judgment. The court agreed with Mother that the parent-time provisions of Father's petition to modify should be dismissed but denied Mother's motion to dismiss with respect to the modification of the child support provisions. Mother also filed an order to show cause alleging that Father had failed to stay current on child support and daycare expenses as ordered by the Illinois Divorce Judgment. The parties proceeded to trial in April 2017 on these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 After hearing testimony and reviewing the evidence offered at trial, the court determined that both parties' incomes had materially increased and that the change in incomes justified a modification of the Illinois Divorce Judgment. Although the parties' incomes had both increased, Father's child support obligation, calculated pursuant to the Utah child support guidelines, changed only minimally. The trial court ordered that child support be paid monthly rather than every other week and eliminated the original 32% Additur Provision from the Illinois Divorce Judgment. Lastly, the court ordered the modification to apply retroactively beginning January 1, 2016. In fixing this date, the court reasoned that the children lived in Utah for only the latter part of 2015 and that they should therefore benefit from the Illinois Divorce Judgment's Additur Provision for that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Among other evidence presented at trial, each party offered an exhibit detailing the payments Father had made for child support and daycare expenses since the Illinois Divorce Judgment was entered in 2013. Relying on Mother's exhibit, the trial court determined that Father failed to pay $ 1,401.08 in past-due child support and $ 5,520 in daycare expenses. For Father's refusal to comply with the Illinois Divorce Judgment and meet these obligations, the trial court held Father in contempt. The trial court further determined that Father received income in 2015 above the Additur Provision's threshold, triggering his obligation to pay an additional amount of child support for that year. Pursuant to the terms of the Illinois Divorce Judgment, the trial court concluded that 32% of Father's excess 2015 income-calculated to be approximately $ 10,000 over the threshold-should have been directed to the parties' children in the form of additional child support. Because Father provided no child support under the Additur Provision for 2015, the court found Father in contempt and ordered him to pay $ 3,205 in unpaid additional child support. In total, the court found that Father was $ 10,126 in arrears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Each party requested an award of attorney fees at the end of trial. The trial court denied Father's request for fees for his modification action because he was not impecunious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Award of Attorney Fees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Father argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded attorney fees to Mother and when it fixed the amount of that award.

In other words, when one party refuses to comply with a court order, thereby compelling another party to seek its enforcement, that party risks liability for the fees and costs accrued in the enforcement proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tribe v.

The trial court ultimately agreed with Mother, in part, and found Father in contempt because, despite knowing of his support obligations, he willingly disobeyed the terms of the Illinois Divorce Judgment. The court determined that Father failed to pay $ 1,401 in base child support, $ 3,205 in additional child support under the Additur Provision, and $ 5,520 in daycare expenses. In total, the trial court found Father to be more than $ 10,000 in arrears as a result of unpaid obligations under the Illinois Divorce Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 Considering Mother's request for an award of attorney fees, the trial court observed that Mother sought to enforce the provisions of the Illinois Divorce Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the court concluded that Mother ultimately \"prevailed on her enforcement action\" based on the court's determination that Father was \"in contempt for failing to comply\n   with the existing support order.\" Included in the trial court's findings regarding why Mother prevailed, the court refers to its earlier findings and conclusions in which it resolved both Mother's enforcement motion and Father's petition to modify. It observed that Mother \"filed an order to show cause in which she alleged that [Father] was delinquent in his existing support obligations.\" The trial court also noted that \"some of [Mother's] enforcement efforts were unsuccessful,\" particularly her argument that \"[Father's] income was much higher than he was claiming.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Mother claimed that Father refused to pay his share of child support and other expenses as required by the Illinois Divorce Judgment. As a result, Mother asserted she was left to \"bear [these] costs\" of supporting the parties' children \"alone.\" She therefore sought the court's assistance in enforcing the terms of the then-existing order. The trial court ultimately found Father in contempt for his refusal to meet his obligations to his children, including providing base child support, additional child support under the Additur Provision, and daycare expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Father successfully argued that the amount of additional child support required under the Additur Provision-a support amount he nevertheless refused to provide-was significantly less than the amount Mother asserted in her order to show cause. Father thus argued below that he substantially prevailed, but the trial court concluded that Mother substantially prevailed because she won on her contempt claims. On appeal, Father argues that because Mother did not receive 51% or more of the amount she alleged Father failed to provide in child support, Mother did not substantially prevail on her claims. But Father cites no authority to support his contention. And without more, we are unpersuaded that Mother, who successfully proved Father's contempt, did not substantially prevail within the meaning of section 30-3-3(2) simply because she recovered less than half of what she sought in child support payments. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of the trial court's discretion in determining that Mother should be awarded attorney fees for her efforts to enforce the terms of the Illinois Divorce Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Father also challenges the amount of the attorney fees the trial court awarded to Mother. In fixing the amount of reasonable attorney fees, a trial court should generally consider (1) the legal work that was \"actually performed,\" (2) the amount of work that was \"reasonably necessary to adequately prosecute the matter,\" (3) the attorney's billing rate and whether it is \"consistent with the rates customarily charged in the locality for similar services,\" and (4) any other relevant factors, \"including those listed in the Code of Professional Responsibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Dixie State Bank v. Bracken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10398435\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/764/985/#p990\">\n    764 P.2d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 990 (Utah 1988). Here, Mother submitted the billing invoices from her attorneys documenting the amount of fees she had incurred and counsel's declaration attesting to the time spent, billing rates, and description of the work performed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Counsel's billing statements to Mother included the fees charged for work performed prior to Mother's filing of the order to show cause. And separately described and accounted for the work performed in responding to Father's petition to modify the Illinois Divorce Judgment and on Mother's motion to enforce the terms of the then-in-effect judgment. To limit Mother's award of\n   attorney fees to her \"efforts to enforce the existing decree,\" the trial court reduced Mother's requested fees to only those incurred in litigating Mother's motion to enforce the orders of the Illinois Divorce Judgment. The court also took into consideration the fact that some of Mother's enforcement efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 Considering the hours Mother's counsel spent litigating her order to show cause all the way through trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court determined that the time spent and the billing rates of counsel were reasonable in light of their experience. The court therefore awarded Mother $ 12,300 for the fees she incurred specifically litigating the enforcement action. Our review of the record and the court's findings reveals no abuse of the trial court's discretion in calculating reasonable attorney fees. We accordingly affirm the trial court's award of attorney fees to Mother and affirm its calculation of the amount of that award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II. Calculation of Daycare Expenses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 Father next argues that the trial court overlooked overpayments Father allegedly made with respect to his daycare expense obligations between October 2013 and July 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 Due to the parties' living in different states and work-related travel, the parties' Illinois Divorce Judgment obligated each parent to provide $ 1,000 per month toward daycare expenses for their children. During trial, each party submitted an exhibit summarizing, among other things, receipts for daycare expense payments. When Father moved for admission of his own exhibit, Mother objected, arguing that the calculations in his exhibit were unclear and asserting that his calculations included irrelevant information. During cross-examination, Father stated that he had not prepared a portion of his exhibit and therefore could not testify to its accuracy. Mother subsequently submitted her own exhibit, which documented all child support and daycare expense amounts provided by Father following entry of the Illinois Divorce Judgment. Father later submitted a substitute exhibit, and Mother withdrew her objection. Relying on Mother's exhibit, the trial court determined that Father had failed to meet his daycare-related obligations under the Illinois Divorce Judgment and was $ 5,520 in arrears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b623 On appeal, Father asks this court to consider the evidence presented at trial and reach a different finding. \"When reviewing a [trial] court's findings of fact on appeal, we do not undertake an independent assessment of the evidence presented during the course of trial and reach our own separate findings with respect to that evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    438 Main St. v.

Instead, we \"evaluate whether the court's findings are so lacking in support that they are against the clear weight of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152843\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/99/801/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 Here, the court considered the testimony of the parties as well as summaries of daycare-expense payments offered by both parties between the entry of the Illinois Divorce Judgment and December 2015. As a starting point, the trial court determined that over this period, the Illinois Divorce Judgment obligated Father to provide $ 1,000 per month for his share of the children's daycare expenses. Mother testified that she had hired a nanny in 2015 but that she had dismissed that nanny midway through December of that year because she did not need surrogate care for the children. Accordingly, the trial court credited Father with $ 500 for that month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 The court next considered the amounts Father actually provided to cover the costs of the children's daycare. Father asserted that he had overpaid during some months but acknowledged that he \"didn't pay anything\" toward daycare expenses for the last half of August 2015 through the end of that year. After considering the evidence submitted by both parties, the trial court found that Father owed $ 5,520 in unpaid daycare expenses-the amount Mother asserted remained outstanding. We are not persuaded that the trial court's finding-that Father failed to meet his support obligation for daycare expenses amounting to $ 5,520-is\n   against the clear weight of the evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III. Father's Unpreserved Issues\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b626 Finally, Father raises two issues that we conclude were not preserved for appellate review. First, he argues that the trial court erred when it purportedly failed to apply Utah Code section 78B-12-112(4) to fix the date for retroactive application of the modified divorce decree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-12-112(4) (LexisNexis 2012) (authorizing a court to retroactively modify a support obligation \"with respect to any period during which a modification is pending\" and requiring that \"the effective date of the modification shall be the month following service on the parent whose support is affected\"). We conclude that this issue was not preserved in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627 Father advocated at trial for retroactive application of the modified divorce decree, but he did not argue for the application of section 78B-12-112(4) or contend, as he does now, that the statute required that the divorce decree be modified effective November 1, 2015. Instead, Father cited no authority for his request and argued generally that the court should make the modified decree retroactive to either the date he filed his petition for modification or the date the petition was served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b628 On appeal, Father argues that the applicable statute requires the court to apply a date altogether different from the date he advocated for at trial and different from the date ultimately adopted by the court. Because Father did not argue to the trial court that it was required by section 78B-12-112(4) to make the modification retroactive to November 1, 2015, he has not preserved this issue for appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, he asserts that the trial court improperly used Father's 2015 gross income instead of his net income when it calculated his additional child support obligation under the Additur Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b630 In addition to obligating Father to provide a fixed amount of base support for the children, the Illinois Divorce Judgment obligated Father to provide additional support amounting to \"32% of the\n   <em>\n    net\n   </em>\n   of all bonuses he received, and 32% of\n   <em>\n    any income\n   </em>\n   in excess of\" his base salary. (Emphases added.) The trial court determined that, in 2015, Father \"earned approximately $ 10,000 in excess of the [threshold amount],\" thus triggering the Additur Provision. It accordingly found Father in contempt for failing to provide this additional child support and determined that he was $ 3,205 in arrears. Because Father did not challenge the trial court's interpretation of the Illinois Divorce Judgment's Additur Provision as requiring examination of his gross income as opposed to his net income, we conclude that this issue was not preserved and do not consider it further.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   IV. Attorney Fees on Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b631 Each party requests fees incurred on appeal. \"Generally, when the trial court awards fees in a domestic action to the party who then substantially prevails on appeal, fees will also be awarded to that party on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Osguthorpe v.

App. 1994) (quotation simplified). Because we affirm the trial court's award of attorney fees to Mother below and because she has substantially prevailed on appeal, Mother is entitled to the attorney fees she incurred on appeal.

The court also acted within its discretion when it fixed the amount of that award, and we discern no clear error in the trial court's factual findings regarding Father's unpaid daycare expense obligations. And Father's other claims are either inadequately briefed or unpreserved. Accordingly, we affirm and award Mother her attorney fees reasonably incurred on appeal. We remand to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining the amount of the award.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Father asserts a total of six issues on appeal. We address the merits of two of those issues and discuss Father's two unpreserved issues in the body of the opinion. Father's remaining arguments are discussed below: Father argues that the trial court should have credited him with alleged child support overpayments made \"shortly before\" entry of the Illinois Divorce Judgment. He also contends that the trial court erred when it dismissed his petition to modify the parent-time provisions of the Illinois Divorce Judgment. Because Father cites no supporting authority and offers no reasoned analysis on either of these issues, we conclude that he has inadequately briefed them and we do not consider them further.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah R. App. P. 24(a)(8) (requiring an appellant to \"explain, with reasoned analysis supported by citations to legal authority and the record, why the party should prevail on appeal\").
