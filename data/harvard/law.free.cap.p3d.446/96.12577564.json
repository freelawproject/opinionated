Hussein appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of UBS Bank USA.

Until July 2012, he was a director and the second-largest shareholder of Quality Systems, Inc. (QSI), owning 15.7% of the company-an interest \"worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In 2009, Hussein developed a relationship with a financial advisor (Financial Advisor) from UBS Financial Services, Inc. (UBS-FS), a brokerage firm and UBS subsidiary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To maintain a relationship with Financial Advisor and receive financial and investment services from UBS-FS, Hussein signed a Client Relationship Agreement (CRA), which governed his relationship with UBS-FS in connection with anticipated margin loans\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   between Hussein and UBS Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    The Loan Agreements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 In 2009 and 2010, UBS Bank extended two margin loans to Hussein totaling $ 35.5 million. Hussein secured the loans with 1.3 million shares of QSI stock, then valued at $ 77 million, and $ 5 million in diversified assets, but he also pledged his other UBS-FS accounts as collateral.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without the assistance of legal counsel, Hussein negotiated the terms of the loans and reviewed the loan documentation (the Loan Agreements), which granted UBS Bank the rights to call in the loans at any time and, upon the occurrence of certain events, to liquidate Hussein's collateral.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 In particular, UBS Bank could \"demand full or partial payment of the credit line obligations, at its sole option and discretion without cause, at any time.\" And if UBS Bank \"otherwise deems itself or its security interest in the Collateral insecure, ... then the Credit Line Obligations will become immediately due and payable (without demand) and the Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, liquidate, withdraw or sell all or any part of the Collateral.\" If the collateral \"decline[s] speedily in value\" or \"customarily is sold on a recognized exchange or market,\" then UBS Bank had the right to sell the collateral and to do so without \"prior notice\" to Hussein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The Loan Agreements also disclosed that UBS Bank and its affiliates were creditors whose \"interests may be inconsistent with, and potentially adverse to, [Hussein's] interests.\" Furthermore, UBS-FS would \"comply with entitlement orders originated by [UBS] Bank\" without consent from Hussein, and if UBS Bank asserted control over the collateral, UBS-FS would have to comply with UBS Bank's entitlement orders even if in conflict with Hussein's instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Separately, UBS Bank and UBS-FS had an agreement (the Servicing Agreement) whereby UBS Bank would offer margin loans to UBS-FS's clients \"to be collateralized by [UBS-FS] securities accounts and the securities, financial assets and other investment property ... in which a security interest has been granted to the Bank by the Borrower.\" UBS Bank would then have \"ultimate control over all entitlement orders and other instructions ... made with respect to the Accounts,\" and UBS-FS would have to \"comply with all instructions given by [UBS] Bank without further consent by any Borrower or Pledgor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 After issuing the loans, UBS Bank sent a letter to Hussein, stating that Financial Advisor could answer any questions about his credit line. And until 2012, Hussein's only interactions regarding the loans were with UBS-FS employees-not UBS Bank itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Meanwhile, Hussein also opened two Portfolio Management Program accounts (the PMP Accounts) with UBS-FS that held $ 8.7 million in assets. Financial Advisor also suggested a Prepaid Variable Forward (PVF), a financial product aimed at helping Hussein obtain liquidity from his substantial stock holdings in QSI and as an eventual replacement for the loans. Discussions on the PVF proposal continued between Hussein and UBS-FS employees until July 25, 2012, but a PVF was never finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    The Liquidation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 By July 2012, QSI's stock price had substantially declined, eroding the value of Hussein's collateral for the loans. On Saturday, July 21, 2012, Financial Advisor informed Hussein that \"[u]nfortunately, with the stock closing at $ 23.41 we are looking at a [margin] call on Monday\" and that Hussein needed to deliver $ 600,000 in cash or additional collateral in order to prevent such action. He also informed Hussein that selling from the PMP Accounts \"would not give us much coverage\" and that UBS Bank was \"insisting we first sell [the QSI] shares (about 25,000 shares), or bring in cash or additional Collateral that is not [QSI shares].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Hussein told Financial Advisor that he did not want UBS-FS to sell the QSI shares because of an ongoing proxy contest\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that he needed time to acquire cash to cover the margin call. He directed Financial Advisor to sell from the PMP Accounts before selling the QSI shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 For a period of five days, UBS Bank and UBS-FS did not touch the QSI shares, yet Hussein did not provide any cash or additional collateral to cover the equity shortfall in the account. On July 26, 2012, QSI stock continued to decline, reducing the value of the collateral by $ 23 million. UBS Bank started liquidating Hussein's QSI shares. After five days, UBS Bank had sold approximately 2,276,756 shares.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 Hussein lost the proxy fight and a substantial percentage of his QSI shares. He eventually filed suit against UBS Bank in an effort to recover his losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    The District Court's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Hussein asserted six causes of action against UBS Bank in the course of alleging that UBS Bank fraudulently induced him to enter into the loans, breached its contractual duties when it liquidated his QSI shares, and violated fiduciary duties it owed to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Following discovery, and relying in large part on the governing documents, UBS Bank moved for summary judgment, arguing that it \"acted within the scope of its contractual rights when it liquidated certain collateral that secured $ 35.5 million in loans that Hussein had received from UBS Bank, and did not breach any financial duties in that regard.\" Hussein responded by arguing that UBS-FS gave him \"bad investment advice\" as UBS Bank's agent and that UBS Bank wrongfully liquidated his QSI shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 The district court granted UBS Bank's motion, concluding that there were no genuine issues of material fact because UBS-FS did not render financial advice to Hussein as UBS Bank's agent. It also concluded that UBS Bank \"acted pursuant to its clear and indisputable rights under the Loan Agreements\" \"to 'liquidate any part of the Collateral' without notice to Hussein.\" Because the Loan Agreements contained an expansive indemnification provision, the district court awarded UBS Bank its costs and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Hussein appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Hussein raises two issues on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, he contends that the district court improperly granted UBS Bank's motion for summary judgment because there were genuine disputes of material fact concerning each of his claims against UBS Bank. Summary judgment is proper when \"the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 56(a).

Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 Hussein challenges the district court's grant of UBS Bank's motion for summary judgment on his claims for fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. Essentially, Hussein asserts two theories of liability on the part of UBS Bank. He first contends that UBS Bank induced him into taking out the loans by failing to disclose material facts and to provide investment advice that would have protected him from a margin call (referred to in the briefing as the Advisory Claims). Second, Hussein contends that UBS Bank wrongfully liquidated his QSI shares, breaching the Loan Agreements and the CRA (referred to in the briefing as the Liquidation Claims).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A. The Advisory Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 Hussein argues that UBS Bank failed to disclose material facts to him. He also argues that UBS Bank owed him fiduciary duties through its agent, UBS-FS. These assertions are the grounds for his breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and constructive fraud claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622 On these claims, the district court concluded that UBS Bank disclosed the potentially adverse relationship UBS Bank and UBS-FS could have with Hussein. The court also concluded that there was no existence of a confidential relationship between UBS Bank and Hussein, determining that the Loan Agreements \"established an arms-length borrower/lender relationship\" and Hussein \"cannot identify any fact which, if proven at trial, would permit a finding that UBS-FS rendered financial advice to Hussein as UBS Bank's agent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1. Fraud\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b623 Hussein asserts that, during the loan process, UBS Bank had a duty to disclose that UBS-FS employees would put UBS Bank's interests before his and that his loans could be canceled without notice and demand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He maintains that certain terms of the Servicing Agreement between UBS Bank and UBS-FS should have been disclosed, in particular that UBS-FS \"agreed to follow UBS Bank's instructions to liquidate Hussein's collateral in all circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 \"An action for fraud lies where there are false representations by defendant and reliance thereon by plaintiff to his damage,\"\n   <em>\n    Semenov v.

The district court concluded that UBS Bank \"acted pursuant to its clear and indisputable rights under the Loan Agreements\" in liquidating Hussein's QSI shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   1.

Any conflicts that these terms have with the other provisions of the Loan Agreements are resolved in favor of the specific provisions following them.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341128\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/985/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stating that \"to reconcile [an] apparent conflict\" courts will employ \"the concept that general terms and provisions are restricted by specific terms and provisions following them\" and \"the specific provision is treated as an exception to the general rule\") (quotations simplified). The specific provisions that followed the general acknowledgments section specified a number of events where UBS Bank could liquidate Hussein's QSI shares, including when \"the Bank otherwise deems itself or its security interest in the Collateral insecure.\" In such events, \"the Credit Line Obligations will become immediately due and payable (without demand).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b642 Nevertheless, Hussein argues that \"UBS Bank could not have deemed itself insecure,\" declaring that the loans were \"fully secured\" because he had assets totaling $ 85 million. The Loan Agreements stipulated, however, that UBS Bank could \"deem[ ] itself or its security interest in the Collateral insecure.\" The focus of these provisions was not on the insecurity of the loans themselves. Once UBS Bank deemed itself or its security insecure, \"the Credit Line Obligations will become immediately due and payable (without demand)\" and UBS Bank could \"in its sole and absolute discretion, liquidate, withdraw or sell all or any part of the Collateral.\" And \"[a]ny Collateral that may decline speedily in value or that customarily is sold on a recognized exchange or market\" could \"be sold without providing any Loan Party with prior notice of the sale.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b643 Because Hussein's collateral had declined substantially in value by July 2012, UBS Bank deemed itself insecure. Financial Advisor alerted Hussein to this fact, notifying him that \"[o]ur credit department is insisting we first sell [QSI] shares (about 25,000 shares), or bring in cash or additional [c]ollateral that is not [QSI].\" Despite Hussein's personal ability to cover the insecurity, the Loan Agreements provided that Hussein's loans became \"immediately due and payable (without demand)\" and UBS Bank had the right \"in its sole and absolute discretion\" to liquidate Hussein's 2,276,756 QSI shares and apply the proceeds as repayment. Because the shares \"decline[d] speedily in value\" and were sold on a market or exchange, UBS Bank did not have to give Hussein any notice of the sale given the terms of the Loan Agreements. Against the backdrop of these contractual provisions, Hussein has not provided any evidence establishing that UBS Bank improperly liquidated his collateralized QSI shares and breached the Loan Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   2. Breach of the CRA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b644 Hussein contends that by following UBS Bank's entitlement orders, UBS-FS breached the CRA when it failed to send Hussein a margin deficiency notice and that UBS Bank interfered with fiduciary duties owed by UBS-FS to Hussein. These are the grounds for his claims of tortious interference with contract and aiding and abetting breach of a fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b645 First, there is no evidence suggesting that the CRA required UBS-FS to send Hussein a margin deficiency notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The terms\n   of the CRA stipulated that UBS-FS \"may sell securities in your Account without notifying you\" and that UBS-FS had \"the right, at any time and without prior notice, to satisfy a margin call or to obtain full payment of a margin loan, without a demand for margin or additional margin.\" UBS-FS policies did permit margin deficiency notices to be given to the customer as a courtesy in some cases. And, as a courtesy, Hussein was notified prior to the liquidation that his margin account was deficient by $ 600,000, but five days passed and he had not taken any action to cover the shortfall in his margin account by some other means. Hussein has not shown the existence of disputed facts that undercut the conclusion that in following UBS Bank's entitlement orders, UBS-FS did not breach the CRA because no margin deficiency notice was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b646 Second, Hussein asserts that UBS Bank caused UBS-FS employees \"to ignore Hussein's order to sell the PMP Account[s]\" and therefore aided and abetted a breach of a fiduciary duty by UBS-FS. A party aids and abets the breach of a fiduciary duty when it \"knowingly join[s] a fiduciary in fraudulent acts, whereby the fiduciary breaches his or her fiduciary duties,\" and is therefore \"jointly and severally liable with that fiduciary.\"\n   <em>\n    Russell/Packard Dev., Inc. v.

This included his preference that the PMP accounts be liquidated first, which was a risk that he accepted when he borrowed the $ 35.5 million from UBS Bank on the terms he agreed to because \"any and all accounts\" with UBS-FS became collateral for the loans. Because UBS Bank could, \"in its sole and absolute discretion,\" liquidate the QSI shares as repayment for the loans when the value of the stock declined, it did not aid or abet UBS-FS in a breach of a fiduciary duty to Hussein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b648 Because Hussein fails to demonstrate that there are genuine disputes of material fact remaining on the Liquidation Claims, the district court did not err in determining that UBS Bank was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Hussein's breach of contract, tortious interference of contract, and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   II.

Accordingly, we look to the specific facts of this case to determine whether an agency relationship existed between UBS Bank and UBS-FS.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Hussein contends that UBS Bank failed to follow \"normal lending practices\" because it did not follow its own written procedures by issuing a margin deficiency notice to Hussein prior to selling his QSI shares. However, UBS Bank did not require margin deficiency notices be given to clients and gave them to clients only as a courtesy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Hussein also claims that UBS Bank and UBS-FS never notified him of the 50% margin maintenance requirement. However, Financial Advisor sent Hussein loan disclosure forms indicating that the Federal Reserve Board required an initial 50% margin requirement. From all that appears in the record, UBS Bank and UBS-FS did not adjust this margin requirement after the loans were issued and Hussein was required to maintain an ongoing 50% margin maintenance level in his account. But whether Hussein received this notification is not material to his Liquidation Claims because UBS Bank liquidated the shares after deeming itself insecure due to the declining value of the collateral and not because of Hussein's failure to maintain his margin requirement. A separate provision of the Loan Agreements would have granted UBS Bank the right to liquidate Hussein's shares had he not \"maintain[ed] sufficient Collateral in a Collateral Account\" or \"fail[ed] to maintain collateral as required.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    On Hussein's constructive fraud claim, he argued that UBS Bank and UBS-FS never disclosed to him that UBS Bank's interests would be put before his own. He contends that UBS-FS misrepresented to him that his QSI shares would not be sold. But while UBS-FS indicated that it would possibly give him time to either secure cash or additional collateral to cover the shortfall, Hussein did not produce evidence that UBS Bank gave him such assurances, and UBS Bank has shown that it was unwilling to take such a risk in waiting longer to see whether Hussein would cover the growing margin deficiency in some other way. Hussein was aware that, in such circumstances, UBS-FS would have to comply with UBS Bank's orders, not his.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Hussein argues that a Financial Industry Regulation Authority (FINRA) arbitration panel found UBS-FS to have breached the Loan Agreements and that therefore no attorney fees should be granted.
