Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12200362\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/385/744/\">\n    2016 UT App 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12200362\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/385/744/\">\n    385 P.3d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On September 28, 2018, Higley requested an ex parte civil stalking injunction against Buhler. Higley listed three stalking events in which Buhler allegedly drove by Higley's house a number of times on August 16, 2018, September 6, 2018, and September 22, 2018. The request contained allegations regarding Buhler's earlier alleged assault of Higley, listing a pending assault case involving Higley and Buhler with a court case number. Higley also attached two police reports. One described a call to police about alleged harassment on August 16, 2018. The other police report described the investigation of the alleged assault and demonstrated that the investigation culminated in Buhler's arrest for assaulting Higley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Buhler requested a hearing after the entry of the temporary civil stalking injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -3a-101(6) (LexisNexis 2017). At the hearing, Buhler conceded that there was a fight on July 7, 2018, between Higley and Buhler and that Higley's injuries required medical attention. But Buhler challenged the credibility of Higley's account of the events that led to the fight. Buhler also did not directly dispute that he drove by Higley's residence on one or more of the dates alleged in the request for a civil stalking injunction and flipped him off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Higley testified and also presented the testimony of his mother, who lived next door to him and had seen Buhler drive by her as she was walking and flip her off. Higley's adult sister testified that she also encountered Buhler, that she heard him refer to her as a \"bitch,\" and that he flipped her off as he drove away. Higley stated that his family felt threatened, unsafe, and uneasy. They were concerned that they did not know what Buhler was \"capable of anymore.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Buhler argued that his conduct could not meet the definition of stalking, claiming that flipping someone off is \"protected speech\" that cannot constitute an act of stalking unless it is accompanied \"with fighting words or some sort of threat.\" The court inquired about considering the gesture in the context of the fight between the two men. Buhler argued that the events were \"so remote in time and place ... and not even related to the same people. The flipping off would have to put them under some sort of emotional distress, which they didn't offer any testimony to that effect.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Buhler also argued that there was no proof of significant mental or psychological suffering and that there were credibility issues with Higley's account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 The court refocused the parties on the statutory requirements for a civil stalking injunction. In response to the court, Buhler conceded that the fight occurred, that Higley was harmed, and that he had to go to the hospital for treatment. The court then asked Higley about the allegations in the request for a civil stalking injunction \"that there were multiple events in which Mr. Buhler drove by your place of residence. ... How many times did he go by your place where you see him going by and he gave you the finger?\" Higley responded that he saw Buhler do this \"three or four times\" after the July 7 fight, \"like a day or two after he got out of jail from being released from the initial arrest for this, ... a day or two after that.\" These three or four additional events after the fight caused him to be in fear of harm. The court inquired whether Buhler wished to reexamine Higley, and his counsel declined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The district court found that there was a fight between Higley and Buhler that resulted in some level of harm to Higley. The court found that there was an additional witness-Mr. Higley's mother-who testified that she witnessed \"an event of her own being flipped off.\" The district court found that Buhler had options other than driving past Higley's residence to reach the landfill when he needed to go there for purposes of his work. Buhler also could have driven past the Higley residence without taking the additional action of flipping off Higley (or his mother). The district court found that, regardless of any claim of \"free speech,\" when considered in the context of the July 7, 2018, fight-\"where there apparently was significant harm\"-the court was required under the stalking statute to address the later instances as acts \"where ... the respondent directly observed or communicated to this petitioner,\" and determine whether those actions \"would cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress or be afraid for that person's own safety.\" The court considered the ensuring actions in \"the context of the fight and the resulting harm to Mr. Higley.\" Accordingly, the district court concluded that it was \"required ... at this point to confirm the status associated with that civil stalking injunction and have it remain in place.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 After the court ruled, Buhler's counsel inquired about potential issues regarding the school where both men had children attending. The court directed the parties to stay away from each other if they were both at the school. Buhler did not object at that time to the inclusion of other family members in the injunction's coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 Buhler argues that the district court erred in its interpretation and application of the statutory requirements for a civil stalking injunction. We review the \"interpretation and application of a statute\" for correctness, \"affording no deference to the district court's legal conclusion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Baird v.

He first claims that flipping someone off is constitutionally protected speech. This specific argument was not presented to the district court for a ruling.

While Buhler argued in the district court that flipping a person off was protected speech unless combined with other \"fighting words,\" the specific constitutional argument contained in his appellate brief was not presented to the district court and is not preserved for appeal. We do not consider it further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 Buhler also argues that the court improperly considered irrelevant evidence and that the evidence was otherwise insufficient to establish a course of conduct under the civil stalking injunction statute. In this case, the district court was required to consider the individual circumstances of the petitioner-Higley-and determined that Buhler's actions constituted a course of conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-106.5\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-106.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(e) (defining a \"reasonable person\" as \"a reasonable person in the victim's circumstances\"). As such, the court properly considered whether repeatedly driving past Higley's residence within days of Buhler's release from jail after his arrest for allegedly assaulting Higley would place a reasonable person in Higley's circumstances in fear for his and his family's safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12200362\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/385/744/\">\n    2016 UT App 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12200362\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/385/744/\">\n    385 P.3d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the district court did not err in determining that a threshold incident involving a threat with a gun \"impacted all future actions\" taken by the respondent directed toward the petitioner (quotation simplified)).
