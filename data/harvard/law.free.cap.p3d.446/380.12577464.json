R.P. Juv. Ct. 46(E), 64(C). We hold Rule 46(E) requires evidence of a meritorious defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Trisha A. (\"Mother\") is the mother of two minor children. On September 9, 2015, Mother was hospitalized for substance abuse treatment for heroin and methamphetamine use. Four days later, Mother left the hospital against medical advice without completing the treatment program. That day, the Department of Child Safety (\"DCS\") took custody of her two children, placed them with their maternal grandmother, and filed a dependency action, alleging the children were dependent due to Mother's substance abuse and neglect. On September 22, over Mother's objection, the juvenile court found the children dependent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Over the next eleven months, DCS offered Mother services to help her achieve sobriety and to reunify her with her children, including substance abuse testing and treatment, parent-aide services, and visitation with the children. However, Mother shunned the substance abuse testing and treatment, failed to achieve sobriety, missed most of the parent-aide sessions and many visits with her children, and failed to maintain contact with the DCS case manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On August 3, 2016, nearly a year after the dependency determination, DCS filed a petition to sever Mother's parental rights on the grounds of abandonment, substance abuse, and out-of-home placement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(1), (3), (8)(a). As part of the proceedings, Mother received and signed a \"Notice of Parental Termination Action,\" notifying her that failure to appear at certain proceedings could result in the court finding she had waived her legal rights and admitted the grounds against her and proceeding in her absence with a final termination adjudication hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Mother appeared at her initial severance hearing and initial mediation but, despite notice, failed to appear for a combined report and review status hearing and pretrial conference set for January 18, 2017 (the \"January hearing\"). Mother's attorney told the juvenile court he had informed Mother of the January hearing and he did not know why she had not appeared. Because Mother's attorney presented no good cause for Mother's absence, and pursuant to DCS's request, the court proceeded to an accelerated severance hearing under Rule 64(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 At the accelerated severance hearing, the DCS case manager testified that Mother had only sporadic contact with the children during the sixteen-month dependency, was unable to maintain a normal parental relationship with them, and failed to provide them with food and shelter. The case manager also opined that Mother was unable to discharge her parental duties due to substance abuse and her inability to maintain sobriety. Based on this testimony and the record in the case, the court found the three severance grounds proven by clear and convincing evidence and, by a preponderance of the evidence, that termination was in the children's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Nine days later, Mother moved to set aside the severance judgment pursuant to Rule 46(E), arguing that she failed to appear at the January hearing because she had been admitted that same day to an in-patient drug treatment program (\"Lifewell\"). Without giving DCS an opportunity to respond, the juvenile court granted Mother's motion to set aside the severance judgment due to her physical inability to attend the January hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 DCS objected to Mother's motion and filed a motion to have the court reconsider its order setting aside the severance judgment, arguing that she failed to notify her counsel or the court of her intended admission to Lifewell; she had refused to participate in drug treatment for more than a year and waited until the day of the pretrial conference to do so; and she checked out of Lifewell only four days after admission and did not complete the program. DCS also urged the court to deny Mother's motion because she failed to assert any meritorious defense to the underlying severance action. The court set a February 23 status hearing to consider whether to \"set aside the set-aside\" of the severance (the \"February hearing\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 Mother also failed to appear at the February hearing. DCS argued that Mother failed to establish good cause for her nonappearance at the January hearing because her Lifewell admission form indicated that she was admitted at noon on January 18-an hour and a half after the time the January hearing had been scheduled-and that Mother left four days after admittance, against medical advice. The children's guardian ad litem argued Mother failed to notify her counsel or the court that she could not attend the January hearing. In response, Mother's counsel argued that the Lifewell admission form did not indicate Mother's check-in time and that Mother had emailed him on February 19, stating that she had been in jail and the hospital since January 8. The court reinstated its January severance order finding Mother failed to establish good cause for her absence. Mother appealed, arguing only that the juvenile court erroneously reinstated its severance judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 On appeal, the court of appeals ordered supplemental briefing regarding (1) whether Rule 64(C) violates due process; (2) whether the court should reconsider\n   <em>\n    Christy A. v.

We also emphasize, as we did in\n   <em>\n    Brenda D.\n   </em>\n   , that juvenile courts' authority to accelerate termination hearings under Rule 64(C) is discretionary.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20437\">\n    243 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   448 \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12564752\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/410/419/\">\n    410 P.3d at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We note, however, that the juvenile court did not consider, much less impose, a meritorious defense requirement on Mother; rather, the court reinstated the severance order because Mother failed to show good cause for her nonappearance at the January hearing.

That is how quickly the State of Arizona can permanently dissolve a parent's legal relationship with her children. Not only after a full and fair evidentiary hearing intended and designed for that purpose, but, as here, during a routine status conference hastily converted into a final termination proceeding. Such a truncated proceeding and its consequences are intolerable in a free society that values the family relationship and guarantees due process of law.

Section 8-537(C) sets forth the consequences for a parent's failure to appear at any of the judicial proceedings involved in the process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   If a parent does not appear at the pretrial conference, status conference or termination adjudication hearing, the court, after determining that the parent has been instructed as provided in \u00a7 8-535, may find that the parent has waived the parent's legal rights and is deemed to have admitted the allegations of the petition by the failure to appear. The court may terminate the parent-child relationship as to a parent who does not appear based on the record and evidence presented as provided in rules prescribed by the supreme court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b640 This statute, the constitutionality of which we have never considered, is remarkable in two major respects. First, it implicitly requires the parent to appear not just at the final adjudication hearing where her rights will be determined, and not just at hearings where her presence may be beneficial or necessary, but at\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   court proceeding, no matter how routine, including status conferences. I know of no other area of law, including criminal law, in which parties are required to attend all such proceedings. Second, the consequences of failing to appear at even a minor hearing can be catastrophic: the parent may be deemed to have waived all her rights and admitted the allegations in the severance petition, and it allows the court to sever parental rights well before the scheduled final termination hearing. Again, I cannot think of a single instance elsewhere in the law in which failure to appear at a court hearing can lead to such dire consequences. The fact that the parent has notice that these consequences may occur if she fails to appear at a hearing cannot and does not license such a sweeping deprivation of fundamental rights. Transporting such a regime to the criminal law context would be unthinkable, and it should be equally so here, where the outcome is so drastic a deprivation of liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b641 The statutory command that the parent attend every hearing or risk termination of her parental rights is especially untenable given that the individuals involved may lack essential resources such as transportation, may be trying to hold a job, and may be involved in rehabilitation services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Melissa T. v.

R.P. Juv. Ct. 64(C).

It provides that the parent's rights may be waived and the allegations admitted only if the absence is \"without good cause.\" But it also provides that the final determination of parental rights may occur at\n   <em>\n    the same hearing\n   </em>\n   at which the parent failed to appear, rather than at the previously scheduled final termination adjudication hearing. This scenario is referred to as an \"accelerated hearing,\" which is what occurred here. As with the automatic waiver of rights and admission of allegations triggered by a parent's failure to appear at any judicial proceeding, we have not yet considered the constitutionality of such accelerated hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b644 Ordinarily, as DCS's counsel stated during oral argument, a final termination hearing can take hours, days, or even weeks. By contrast, a pretrial hearing accelerated into a final termination adjudication can be (as illustrated by the twenty-five-minute proceeding here) a perfunctory affair, the outcome of which is preordained. After all, the parent is unavailable to testify and her attorney is not expecting or prepared to put on a case and is unlikely to have brought witnesses or exhibits. And importantly, if the court finds that the parent has failed to appear without good cause, the absent parent is deemed to have admitted the allegations contained within DCS's petition to sever.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-537(C); Ariz. R.P. Juv. Ct. 64(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b645 Indeed, depending on how early in the process an accelerated hearing takes place, DCS may not have yet made initial disclosures, and the parent's counsel may not have had an opportunity to interview the state's witnesses.

She could not learn of that requirement from the relevant statute, or even the relevant juvenile court rule, which indicates that she need show only good cause for her absence. Instead, she would need to find a provision elsewhere in the juvenile rules that incorporates a provision in a different set of rules. Even when she examined the pertinent civil procedure rules, she would not learn about the meritorious defense requirement because it does not appear there either. Rather, she would have to determine that the applicable requirement is contained not in the rules but in court decisions, not in the juvenile law context but unrelated civil litigation, and then assume the requirement applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b671 For the foregoing reasons, I would not stray beyond the text of our rules to require more than good cause for failing to appear at a hearing in order to vacate a termination order resulting from an accelerated hearing.
