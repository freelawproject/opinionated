In 2005, pursuant to Ballot Measure 37 (2004),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   claimants sought, and received, waivers of land use regulations from Yamhill County and from the state. In the waivers, the county and the state agreed not to apply regulations preventing claimants from subdividing and building dwellings on their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to the waivers, in 2006, claimants obtained preliminary approval from the county to subdivide their\n   property into 41 residential lots. Claimants spent \"over $ 1 million to develop the property and recorded the final subdivision plat for the development before Measure 49 became effective on December 6, 2007.\"\n   <em>\n    Biggerstaff v.

In the fall of 2007, claimants sold four of the lots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Measure 49 took effect, extinguishing claimants' Measure 37 waivers, claimants applied to the county for a determination that, under section 5(3) of Measure 49, they had a vested right to complete and continue the subdivision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of Yamhill County v.

On remand, claimants applied to the county for a vested rights determination for a second time, and, in 2011, the county again determined that they had a vested right to complete and continue the subdivision. While that decision was before the circuit court on a writ of review, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Friends II\n   </em>\n   , in which it provided guidance about how to apply the factors that the court had previously established in\n   <em>\n    Clackamas County v.

To determine the ratio, the county must find \"two historical facts: (1) the costs that [the claimant] incurred to construct the planned development and (2) the estimated cost of the planned development.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n    at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n    264 P.3d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dividing the claimant's costs incurred by the total estimated cost of the planned development yields a percentage, which \"provides an objective measure of how far the landowner has proceeded towards completion of construction and thus serves as an initial gauge of whether the landowner has proceeded far enough that he or she has a vested right to complete construction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n    at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n    264 P.3d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Friends II\n   </em>\n   , claimants requested another remand to allow the county to conduct the vesting analysis consistently with that opinion. On remand, claimants again sought a vested rights determination from the county. In support of their contention that their expenditures represented a sufficient percentage of the total project cost to support a vested right, they relied on a purchase agreement submitted by a builder, which estimated that the cost to build the type of home that was likely to be built on the lots in the subdivision, as of December 2007, would have been $ 344,018.69. The county accepted that testimony and, multiplying that amount by 40 and adding other development costs, determined that the total project cost, the denominator of the expenditure ratio, was $ 15,017,937.50. Applying a numerator of $ 1,257,190.74, which represented claimants', the county determined that claimants had spent 8.32 percent of the total project cost. After considering the other\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   factors, the county determined that claimants had a vested right to complete and continue the subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Biggerstaffs and FOYC sought writs of review in the circuit court, the proceedings were consolidated, and\n   the state and claimants intervened.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant to this opinion, appellants raised two arguments. First, they contended that ORS 215.130, which requires nonconforming uses to be continuous, and a county ordinance implementing that statute applied to, and extinguished, claimants' claim under section 5(3) of Measure 49. Second, they argued that the county had misconstrued the law when it relied on the builder's testimony about the likely cost of building the homes in the subdivision. In their view, that evidence showed the amounts that buyers of lots would have spent building homes and not the cost of houses that claimants themselves planned to build. They asserted that the fact that claimants never planned to build houses themselves was fatal to their claim under section 5(3) of Measure 49, and the builder's testimony could not assist them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The circuit court rejected those arguments. As to the first argument, it reasoned that ORS 215.130 did not apply in this vested rights proceeding. As to the second argument, it held that that claimants had shown the denominator of the expenditure ratio through the builder's testimony about the likely cost of building homes in the subdivision, regardless of \"whether [claimants] personally constructed the buildings, did so in conjunction with third parties[,] or third parties undertook the construction on their own after purchase of a lot with a vested interest to complete construction that ran with the land.\" Based on that reasoning, the court concluded that the county had not erred in determining that claimants had a vested right to complete and continue the development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Biggerstaffs and FOYC, on one hand, and the state, on the other, appealed, and we consolidated the appeals. Appellants renew their arguments from below, and claimants\n   and the county defend the circuit court's reasoning.\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In an appeal from a writ of review where the parties' arguments raise only questions of law, as they do here, we review for errors of law. ORS 195.318 (allowing challenges to county vested rights decisions under Measure 49 by way of writ of review); ORS 34.040(1)(d) (in a writ-of-review proceeding, the circuit court must determine whether the county \"[i]mproperly construed the applicable law\"). As explained below, we conclude that ORS 215.130 does not affect claimants' claim. However, we conclude that claimants did not show a \"vested right to complete and continue\n   <em>\n    the use described in the waiver\n   </em>\n   ,\" Measure 49 \u00a7 5(3) (emphasis added), because claimants' planned development, subdividing the property and selling buildable lots, was not something that claimants could do pursuant to their Measure 37 waivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Discontinuation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the outset, we reject appellants' argument that ORS 215.130 operates to extinguish any vested right that claimants may have had. We recently addressed and rejected the same argument in\n   <em>\n    Oregon Shores v. Board of County Commissioners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576057\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/647/\">\n    297 Or. App. 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576057\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/647/\">\n    441 P.3d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019). We held that \"[t]he text of section 5(3) requires a showing that a claimant's vested right existed on December 6, 2007, and no other date.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576057\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/647/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576057\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/647/\">\n    at 279-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576057\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/647/\">\n    441 P.3d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Oregon Shores\n   </em>\n   , any discontinuance that may have occurred took place after December 6, 2007, the only date on which a vested right had to exist. Thus, the statute and implementing ordinance are immaterial to claimants' Measure 49 claim in this case, and the writ-of-review court did not err in affirming the county's determination that the statute and ordinance did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Vested Right to Complete and Continue the Use Described in the Waiver\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We turn to appellants' second argument. As noted above, the circuit court held that claimants had showed the necessary vested right to complete and continue the use described in their Measure 37 waivers even though they planned for buyers of the lots to build houses, rather than\n   planning to build houses themselves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants contend that claimants' plan to subdivide their property and sell lots, and their expenditures in pursuit of that plan, was not a \"use of the property [that] complies with the waiver,\" Measure 49 \u00a7 5(3), and could not yield a vested right to complete \"the use described in the waiver,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576057\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/647/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , because subdividing property and selling buildable lots was not something that a landowner could do pursuant to a Measure 37 waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin our consideration of that argument with section 5(3) of Measure 49, the provision under which claimants seek relief. That subsection provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"A claimant that filed a claim under [Measure 37] on or before [June 28, 2007,] is entitled to just compensation as provided in * * * [a] waiver issued before [December 6, 2007,] to the extent that the claimant's use of the property complies with the waiver and the claimant has a common law vested right on [December 6, 2007,] to complete and continue the use described in the waiver.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Thus, to succeed in a claim under section 5(3), a claimant must show (1) that \"the claimant's use of the property complies with the [Measure 37] waiver\" and (2) that the claimant has a common law vested right \"to complete and continue the use described in the waiver.\" Here, as described above, in claimants' waivers, the county and the state agreed not to apply regulations preventing claimants from subdividing their property and building dwellings on the subdivided lots. However, although claimants' waivers\n   allowed claimants to subdivide and build houses, claimants did not intend to build houses. Rather, they intended to subdivide their property and sell lots on which others would build houses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As we understand the circuit court's reasoning and claimants' and the county's argument on appeal, their view is that claimants' expenditures in pursuit of the development that they planned-subdivision of the land and sale of lots to others, who would build houses-created a vested right under section 5(3) of Measure 49 to complete not only the subdivision itself, but also the houses. In their view, that vested right runs with the land, so that, when claimants sell a subdivided lot to a buyer, the buyer receives the lot and the right to build a house on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Claimants and the county assert that the Supreme Court did not reject that possibility in\n   <em>\n    Friends II\n   </em>\n   , in which it held that the development that a claimant can have a vested right to complete is the one that the claimant intended, on or before December 6, 2007, to construct.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n    351 Or. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   246 &amp; n. 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n    264 P.3d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, to find the cost of \"the planned development,\" the county had to find the cost of building the \"type of homes [the claimant] planned to build\" before Measure 49 took effect). Rather, as they understand\n   <em>\n    Friends II\n   </em>\n   , the court required only that, if a claimant intended to subdivide and sell lots rather than actually constructing houses, the claimant must provide evidence from which the governing body can find, as a matter of historical fact, how much\n   <em>\n    buyers\n   </em>\n   of the lots would have spent in December 2007 to build houses in the subdivision. Once the governing body has found the amount that the claimant would spend to prepare the subdivision and the amount that subsequent buyers would spend to build the houses, it adds those amounts together and plugs the resulting number in as the denominator of the expenditure ratio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Appellants respond that, regardless of whether the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Friends II\n   </em>\n   leaves open that possibility, claimants nevertheless cannot make the necessary showing under section 5(3) of Measure 49 because Measure 37 did not allow claimants to sell lots on which others could build houses. They contend that relief under section 5(3) of\n   Measure 49 is limited to the same relief that was allowed under a claimant's Measure 37 waiver, and subdividing and selling buildable lots was not something that claimants could do under their Measure 37 waivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We agree with claimants that the court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Friends II\n   </em>\n   does not conclusively preclude their view of the correct calculation of the expenditure ratio. However, as explained below, we agree with appellants' alternative argument. Claimants cannot satisfy the requirements of section 5(3) of Measure 49 because their planned development was to sell lots on which others would build houses, but that arrangement was not allowed under their Measure 37 waivers. Said another way, section 5(3) of Measure 49 provides a way for claimants to finish projects that they began under Measure 37 waivers, but one of the limitations is that the claimants' plan had to be one that was allowed under Measure 37. Because (1) relief under section 5(3) of Measure 49 is limited to the same relief that was allowed under a claimant's Measure 37 waiver and (2) claimants' Measure 37 waivers did not allow them to sell buildable lots, they cannot obtain relief under section 5(3) of Measure 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Relief under section 5(3) of Measure 49 is limited to the same relief that was allowed under a claimant's Measure 37 waiver.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To evaluate appellants' first proposition, we return to the text of section 5(3) of Measure 49. \"In interpreting statutes, our goal is to discern the intention of the legislature or, in the case of ballot measures, the\n   voters, by examining the text, context, and any pertinent legislative history of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Oregon Shores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576057\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/647/\">\n    297 Or.

The circuit court, claimants, and the county have advanced three ways in which, in their view, claimants' Measure 37 waivers and claimants' acts of subdividing the property and preparing it for houses create a right for a buyer to build on a lot that claimants subdivided and prepared for a house. Below, we consider, and reject, each of the three theories: first, that claimants' Measure 37 waivers, in themselves, allowed buyers to build houses on lots purchased from claimants; second, that claimants' subdivision of their property was a \"use,\" as that term is used in Measure 37, that became nonconforming when claimants sold lots and thus allowed the buyers to build houses; and, third, that claimants' acts of subdividing the property and preparing it for houses created a vested right under Measure 37 that allowed others to build houses on the lots. Because we disagree with all of the theories that the circuit court, claimants, and the county have identified, and because we perceive no other way in which Measure 37 waivers could have allowed claimants to sell buildable lots, we conclude that Measure 37 did not allow claimants to sell buildable lots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Claimants' Measure 37 waivers, in themselves, did not allow buyers to build on lots purchased from claimants.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Measure 37 \"provided landowners with 'just compensation' for land use regulations, enacted after they had acquired their property, that restricted the use of the\n   property and, as a result, diminished its value.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n    351 Or. at 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675297\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/351/219/\">\n    264 P.3d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nothing in the text of Measure 37 implicitly or explicitly addressed the result of an owner's sale of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The first question is whether claimants' Measure 37 waivers allowed subsequent buyers to build on lots that they bought from claimants. As explained below, we conclude that, under Measure 37, a governing body's choice to allow an owner to use the property for an otherwise unlawful use applies only to the owner. If the owner sells the property, the buyer receives the property subject to the zoning regulations in effect at the time of the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The text of subsection 8 indicates that the present owner of the property is the only person whom a governing\n   body may allow \"to use the property for a use permitted at the time the owner acquired the property.\" The text authorizes a governing body \"not to apply\" certain land use regulations that otherwise bind the governing body's decisions, but only with respect to the present owner, that is, \"to allow\n   <em>\n    the owner\n   </em>\n   to use the property\" in an otherwise unlawful way.\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   ORS 197.352(8) (2005) (emphasis added). If the governing body were to allow someone other than the owner to use the property as described in the owner's waiver, it would be in violation of current zoning laws.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ORS 215.203 (providing that land within exclusive farm use zones \"shall be used exclusively for farm use except as otherwise provided in ORS 215.213, 215.283 or 215.284\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The structure of Measure 37 confirms the textual indication that the present owner of the property is the exclusive recipient of Measure 37 relief. Measure 37 did not limit those entitled to relief to people who owned property when Measure 37 passed; its application was prospective as well.\n   <em>\n    See former\n   </em>\n   ORS 197.352(1) (providing for \"just compensation\" for the owner of property whenever \"a public entity enacts or enforces a new land use regulation\" as well as when it enforces a regulation enacted before December 2, 2004). Thus, Measure 37 applied to every property owner, even one who acquired land from a previous Measure 37 claimant. And Measure 37 operated the same way for all property owners: It set the clock back to the state of the land use regulations that existed when the owner acquired the property, by providing a remedy for any decrease in value that had occurred during the period of ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   That suggests that a buyer who takes property from a Measure 37 claimant does not receive the seller's entitlement to relief under Measure 37 along with the property, because the buyer is entitled to his or her\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   remedy under Measure 37-albeit one that will compensate only for diminution in value that occurs after the date of purchase. Thus, the text and structure of Measure 37 unambiguously indicate that the relief granted by a Measure 37 waiver-the ability to \"use the property for a use permitted when the owner acquired the property\"-applies solely to the present owner. In this case, then, buyers of lots could not build houses pursuant to claimants' Measure 37 waivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Claimants' subdivision of their property was not a \"use,\" as that term is used in Measure 37, that became nonconforming when claimants sold lots.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Next we consider whether, by subdividing and preparing their property for houses, claimants established a \"use\" pursuant to their Measure 37 waivers. As set out above, a Measure 37 waiver allowed the present owner to \"use the property for a use permitted at the time when the owner acquired the property.\"\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   ORS 197.352(8) (2005). In\n   <em>\n    Friends I\n   </em>\n   , we interpreted \"the use of the property\" as that phrase is used in section 5(3) of Measure 49.

For similar reasons, we reach the same conclusion with respect to the meaning of \"use\" in \"a use permitted at the time the owner acquired the property\" in subsection 8 of Measure 37: The measure is drafted as a land-use statute, and, by employing \"use\" as a noun, it demonstrates voters' intent to adopt a standard land-use meaning: actual employment of the land for a particular purpose.\n   <em>\n    Friends I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206154\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/237/149/#p153\">\n    237 Or.

As we have explained, a Measure 37 claimant can subdivide the property and build a house. And the claimant has exclusive control of whether the completion of that use is allowed, because the only obstacle to completing the use is one created by claimant him- or herself, when he or she sells the property to someone who lacks the right to complete the use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the unique context of Measure 37, we conclude that, if the landowner never intended to complete the use him- or herself, the equities do not weigh in favor of creating a vested right to complete the use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, claimants intended to subdivide the land and sell lots to buyers who would build houses. However, claimants' Measure 37 waivers did not allow them to sell buildable lots. That conclusion is dispositive of claimants' vested\n   rights claim under Measure 49 because the relief allowed under section 5(3) of Measure 49 is no broader than the relief to which a claimant was entitled under the claimant's Measure 37 waivers. Here, claimants' project-selling buildable lots-was not permitted by their Measure 37 waivers; consequently, they could not satisfy the requirements of section 5(3) of Measure 49. The county and the circuit court erred in concluding otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    For a detailed explanation of the complex legal context in which this dispute arose, see\n    <em>\n     Friends of Yamhill County v.
