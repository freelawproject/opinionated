Ed. 2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). This right to due process is especially critical in a proceeding to terminate parental rights, where so much is at stake for both the parent and the child. Here, Nylysha Aradon and Carey Hayes seek reversal of the order terminating their parental rights to their daughter, A.H. They argue that they were denied a fair trial before an impartial tribunal. We agree.\n   \u00b62 After the termination trial, and after extensive posttrial proceedings on allegations of misconduct of the Snohomish\n   County Volunteer Guardian Ad Litem Program (VGAL Program), Judge Anita Farris recused herself from the entire proceedings, including the termination proceeding. Judge Farris concluded that the parents were \"denied their due process constitutional right to an impartial judge by having a Snohomish County Superior Judge preside over this case.\" Judge Farris explained that \"[t]he manner in which the [VGAL Program] was operated during this case creates doubt about the Snohomish County Superior Court's ability to be impartial in this case involving court employees directly participating in the litigation.\" Nevertheless, Judge Farris concluded that entry of the order was a ministerial act and entered the termination order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 We hold that the parents' due process rights were violated and that entry of the order was not a ministerial act. Therefore, we reverse the termination order and we remand to a county other than Snohomish County for a new trial. We also direct the trial court to vacate the CR 59, CR 60, and sanction orders entered after Judge Farris's recusal. On remand, we direct the court to appoint an attorney and a new guardian ad litem (GAL) for A.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 A.H. was born on February 24, 2013, to mother Aradon and father Hayes (parents). At birth, A.H. tested positive for methadone, and Aradon tested positive for methadone and marijuana. The parents had a verbal disagreement at the hospital, and A.H. was possibly dropped into her crib. Although A.H. was not injured, Hayes was escorted out of the hospital by security. Four days after her birth, the Department of Social and Health Services (Department) removed A.H. from her parents' custody and placed her with a foster parent with whom she has resided since her removal in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The Department filed a dependency petition in Snohomish County Superior Court (superior court) on February 28, 2013, and\n   A.H. was found to be dependent as to both parents on May 23, 2013. According to the order of dependency, Aradon's parental deficiencies included mental health and substance abuse issues and Hayes' parental deficiencies included substance abuse and a long-term domestic violence problem. The superior court ordered the parents to engage in services and gave each parent four hours of supervised visitation per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 During the dependency, the superior court appointed Denise Brook to serve as the volunteer guardian ad litem (VGAL). VGAL Brook was a volunteer with the VGAL Program, which is an agency of the superior court. The VGAL Program's staff members are considered court employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 It is undisputed that VGAL Brook believed it was in A.H.'s best interests to remain permanently with the foster parent and that VGAL Brook opposed expanded visitation with the parents. During her time on the case from 2014 to 2015, VGAL Brook committed numerous breaches of confidentiality that benefited the foster parent. She disclosed previous parental terminations and the parents' criminal records to the foster parent. She also lobbied the VGAL Program to cancel parental visitations if a strict food plan, which the parties later discovered was medically unnecessary, was not followed. At the same time, she opposed giving the parents access to A.H.'s medical providers. She also tried to attend a parenting class to observe A.H. and Aradon without Aradon's knowledge after an instructor told her she could not attend for confidentiality reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 VGAL Brook died in January 2015. In February 2015, the superior court appointed Susan Walker, VGAL Brook's program coordinator and an employee of the VGAL Program, as the replacement VGAL. The declaration submitted by VGAL Walker in support of her motion replacing VGAL Brook simply states that \" 'Ms. Brook is no longer able to work the case.' \" No one notified the superior court or the parties that VGAL Brook had died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 VGAL Walker was largely uninvolved in the case from the time of her appointment until the termination trial in August 2015. During her seven-month tenure as the\n   VGAL, Walker contacted only one service provider for one parent, observed only one parent at one visit, and never personally spoke to the parents. And despite concerns that A.H. was allergic to certain foods, VGAL Walker never contacted A.H.'s medical providers and did not inform the parents when A.H.'s issues were resolved and her food intake no longer needed to be restricted in the same ways previously communicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The six-day termination trial began on August 26, 2015, before Judge Farris. Many people testified, including both parents, VGAL Walker, several social workers, and several service providers. VGAL Walker's testimony was particularly troubling, and Judge Farris found it to be \"uninformed, inconsistent, dishonest, and biased.\" Judge Farris described seven specific instances during trial when VGAL Walker's testimony lacked candor. In one of those instances, VGAL Walker testified that she could not recall whether VGAL Brook sent the parents' criminal records to the foster parent's adoption agency. But during VGAL Walker's cross-examination, Aradon's attorney revealed an e-mail obtained from the VGAL Program during discovery that referenced an attachment appearing to be criminal records. Concerned that a VGAL would illegally forward criminal records to the adoption agency, Judge Farris ordered the VGAL Program to produce the attachment, which it had not turned over as part of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 The VGAL Program produced the requested attachment. The attachment revealed that VGAL Walker was the person who requested and sent the criminal records to VGAL Brook, who then illegally sent them to the foster parent's adoption agency. During a hearing on September 11, 2015, Judge Farris determined that VGAL Walker was deliberately untruthful about her knowledge of the e-mail and attachment and expressed her disappointment and\n   shock at the behavior of the VGALs and the VGAL Program in this case. After discussing other issues of credibility and bias of the VGALs and the VGAL Program, Judge Farris decided not to give VGAL Walker's testimony any weight. In the oral ruling, Judge Farris terminated the parents' parental rights to A.H. Judge Farris also ordered the VGAL Program to \"produce all documents, including emails, notes of all communications had with the foster parents and with the adoption agency.\" Judge Farris did not enter written findings or a written order of termination at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Shortly after trial, Aradon's attorney filed a formal complaint against VGAL Walker with the superior court. In October 2015, the parents moved to remove VGAL Walker based on her misconduct. In response to this motion, Sara Di Vittorio, an attorney with the civil division of the Snohomish County Prosecutor's Office, wrote a threatening letter on behalf of the VGAL Program to Aradon's attorneys on November 3, 2015. In that letter, Di Vittorio demanded that the attorneys \"cease disclosing\" confidential information about VGALs in court filings and in conversations with other members of the legal community, or the VGAL Program would \"consider further legal steps.\" At the end of November 2015, the superior court notified Aradon's attorney that his administrative complaint against VGAL Walker was deemed unfounded but that it had prompted the superior court to reassess and clarify the VGAL Program's complaint procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 Around this time, Kirsten Haugen, a staff attorney for the VGAL Program who also represented VGAL Walker, met with Di Vittorio and other lawyers and administrators for the superior court and discussed the motion to remove VGAL Walker. Di Vittorio advised Haugen to oppose the parents' motion to remove VGAL Walker by filing motions to strike and redact based on CR 11 and a local confidentiality rule. Di Vittorio's assistance to Haugen, who represented a party adversarial to the parents, was not disclosed to the parents' attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 Employees of the VGAL Program, and therefore employees of the superior court, also engaged in retaliation against attorneys in the same firm as Aradon's attorney. For example, they issued boilerplate objections to all discovery requests in every case involving that firm, refused to allow the firm's attorneys to enter the VGAL office without an escort, and contacted the firm's financial authority, the Office of Public Defense, as payback\n   for the administrative complaint against VGAL Walker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 In December 2015, Judge Farris entered an order continuing the parents' motion to remove VGAL Walker to January 2016 to allow the parties time to gather evidence in support of a full evidentiary hearing on the parents' motion to remove VGAL Walker. Judge Farris also ordered \"that the issue of whether the Court's prior termination decision can stand in light of any GAL improprieties found shall not be heard at the next hearing and shall be set for a date following the entry of final findings on the motion to remove GAL.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 On January 29, 2016, Judge Farris allowed VGAL Walker to withdraw from the case without a hearing. On February 11, 2016, Judge Farris appointed Paige Buurstra, an attorney guardian ad litem (AGAL), as GAL to A.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 Judge Farris held several evidentiary hearings in February 2016 related to the discovery issues and VGAL misconduct in the case. The parents' attorneys presented evidence that the VGALs resisted liberalized visitation for the parents, argued to impose onerous services on the parents, and engaged in abusive litigation tactics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 Judge Farris found that VGAL staff attorney Haugen proffered untruthful testimony during the hearings. For example, Haugen submitted a declaration from VGAL Walker that stated A.H.'s most current allergy testing occurred in 2014. But the most current allergy testing actually occurred in 2015 and showed that \"the food list pushed by the GAL was preventing [A.H.] from eating foods she could eat, and, more importantly, was failing to warn\n   [that A.H.] should not be fed tree nuts due to potential allergies.\" Haugen also argued that VGAL Brook's decision to send confidential information about A.H.'s siblings to the foster parent's adoption agency was harmless because the agency had handled the adoptions of all nine of A.H.'s siblings and thus already had the information. But the adoption agency's agent later testified that it had handled only one of the sibling's adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b619 Finally, Judge Farris found that \"abusive litigation tactics were used for improper purposes during these proceedings.\" Most notably, VGAL Brook's entire hard copy case file, which was in the VGAL Program's possession, \"mysteriously disappeared without a trace or any explanation in the middle of post-trial proceedings about misconduct of that VGAL.\" The VGAL Program also employed \"document dumps\" during posttrial production to make it hard to find information, destroyed or withheld case-related e-mails, and made false or misleading statements to cover up prior misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b620 On March 4, 2016, as a result of the VGAL misconduct that occurred and was uncovered during these evidentiary hearings, the parents filed a motion to vacate the decision to terminate their parental rights and for discovery sanctions against the VGALs and the VGAL Program. Judge Farris heard argument and testimony on this motion in late March 2016. On June 10, 2016, Judge Farris orally denied the motion. Although Judge Farris determined that there was \"pervasive and egregious\" misconduct by the VGALs and the VGAL Program in this case, Judge Farris found that the misconduct \"did not affect the verdict and did not prevent a fair procedure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b621 On September 6, 2016, the parents filed a new motion for sanctions against the VGAL Program, Haugen, and Snohomish County Superior Court Administration requesting substantial sanctions for each discovery violation and false fact presented since October 2015. The superior court, on behalf of the VGAL Program, opposed the\n   motion, arguing that it was not a party to the termination and that Judge Farris could not impose sanctions against the superior court. Judge Farris held a hearing on the sanctions motion on September 23, 2016. During this hearing, Di Vittorio represented both the VGAL Program and the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b622 On October 28, 2016, the superior court moved for Judge Farris to recuse herself from the sanctions portion of the proceeding, strenuously arguing that as a member of the superior court, Judge Farris had a conflict of interest in hearing the motion for sanctions. On November 18, 2016, Judge Farris\n   held a hearing on the recusal motion and decided she needed to recuse. In a subsequent hearing on February 17, 2017, Judge Farris heard argument as to whether it was still possible to enter a final written order on termination, which had been prepared for her signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b623 On May 17, 2017, Judge Farris entered an \"Order Regarding Entry of Trial Findings and Order on Recusal\" (recusal order) and recused herself from the entire proceeding, including the termination trial. Judge Farris also entered a written termination order. Judge Farris did not rule on the parents' outstanding sanctions motion. After her recusal, Judge Farris entered a 317-page memorandum decision explaining in great detail her reasons for recusing. Below is the table of contents from that memorandum decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I. THE WAY THE VGAL PROGRAM WAS OPERATED DENIED THE PARTIES THE DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE....\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Judicial conflicts were created by the following: using court employees as parties, lawyers and witnesses with no ethical boundaries or firewalls in place; allowing the court (VGAL Program) to enter into the case as a litigant and be represented by a lawyer; using one lawyer to simultaneously represent the GAL party and the Superior Court; and using the same lawyer that represented the Superior Court and its judges to also represent and assist the GAL's lawyer in litigating this case against the parents. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   B. Snohomish County Superior Court asserted a Snohomish County Judge cannot rule on matters involving the VGAL Program or its employees because the VGAL Program is the Superior Court, the acts of VGAL Program employees are the acts of the Superior Court, and judging or sanctioning the acts of VGAL Program employees is the Judge judging or sanctioning himself or herself. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   C. If the VGAL Program/Superior Court's assertion that all acts of VGAL employees are acts of the Superior Court is true, there is an appearance the Snohomish County Superior Court acted as judge, party, lawyer and witness in this one case. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   D. If Snohomish County Superior Court Judges are disqualified from hearing a motion seeking sanctions against a VGAL Program attorney because sanctions that impact the VGAL Program impact the Superior Court, then they are also disqualified from hearing other matters that impact the VGAL Program. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   E. There is no factual, logical or legal reason the grounds for disqualification apply only to the Motion for Sanctions. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   F. Recusal is constitutionally required to maintain the right to an impartial judge because there was no ethical boundary protocol or firewall to separate the Superior Court and its Judges from the VGAL Program in this pending litigation. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   G. The VGAL Program claims the way it is structured creates a system where the only way opposing parties can obtain protection from VGAL attorneys engaging in abusive litigation tactics is by litigating against the Superior Court; if that is true, opposing parties are denied equal rights to protection from abusive litigation tactics. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. RECUSAL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE IS AN APPEARANCE THE SNOHOMISH COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT ALIGNED WITH AND ASSISTED THE GALS' ATTORNEY IN LITIGATING THIS CASE AGAINST THE PARENTS ....\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. There is an appearance the Snohomish County Superior Court specifically directed the GAL's attorney to impede discovery requests from the mother's attorneys. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   B. The Superior Court granted ex parte court orders allowing the Superior Court Program to enter into this case as a party\n   separate from the GAL, permitted a lawyer representing the Superior Court's interests to appear and argue the Superior Court's interests to the Court, and permitted the same lawyer representing the Court's interests to simultaneously represent the GAL....\n   C. The Snohomish County Superior Court threatened to take legal action against the mother's attorneys personally for filing evidence in this case and to prevent them from filing additional similar evidence. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   D. The Superior Court assisted the GAL's attorney in filing Motions to Strike and Redact some of the opposing parents' pleadings and evidence. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   E. Employees of the Superior Court appeared to try to influence or pressure the parents' attorneys by threatening and retaliating against the parents' attorneys. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   F. The appearance that the Superior Court was responsible for withholding, losing or destroying evidence of GAL misconduct raises doubt as to the Court's impartiality. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   G. The Superior Court bench became directly involved in the Attorney Fees and Sanctions Motion that was part of a CR 59/60 Motion. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III. RECUSAL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE IS AN APPEARANCE THE SNOHOMISH COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT ATTEMPTED TO IMPROPERLY INFLUENCE OR PRESSURE THE TRIAL JUDGE....\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. The VGAL Program/Superior Court brought a last minute request to have this trial judge summarily rule in its favor in a manner that appeared to attempt to improperly exploit its connection to the court to influence or pressure the trial judge. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   B. There is an appearance a Snohomish County Superior Court employee tried to improperly influence or pressure the trial judge via ex parte contact by anonymously placing a memorandum addressing judicial disqualification in the judge's mailbox. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   C. There is an appearance prior attempts by the GAL's attorney to improperly influence or pressure the trial judge were acts legally attributable to the Superior Court. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. EVERYONE IN THIS CASE AGREED THE CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDING JUDGE COULD NOT FORM ANY LEGAL BASIS FOR JUDICIAL DISQUALIFICATION ....\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    V. RECUSAL IS NECESSARY ON THE MOTION AGAINST VGAL ATTORNEY HAUGEN BECAUSE FINDINGS WERE MADE WITHOUT SERVICE ON HER AND BECAUSE THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VGAL PROGRAM LAWYER AND THE VGAL PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT THE MOTIONS AGAINST THEM BE HEARD TOGETHER....\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In summary, Judge Farris concluded the memorandum decision by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   This memorandum decision is set forth to make the reasons the Motion to Recuse is being granted clear. I find and conclude herein only that at this time the facts, evidence and arguments set forth above create an appearance the parties in this case cannot obtain an impartial proceeding in Snohomish County Superior Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b624 On May 31, 2017, the mother filed a CR 60 motion to vacate the termination order and a CR 59 motion for a new trial based on the VGAL Program's misconduct and its relationship with the superior court. On June 5, 2017, the father joined in the mother's motions. On June 13, 2017, the governor appointed Judge T.W. Small of Chelan County Superior Court to preside over the case. In July 2017, Aradon filed an additional CR 60 motion to vacate, arguing that relief from judgment was necessary because the VGAL Program either lost or destroyed necessary evidence. After an October 6, 2017, hearing in Snohomish County, Judge Small denied the CR 59 and CR 60 motions and the motion for sanctions. The parents appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Due Process and Appearance of Fairness\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b625 The parents argue that the superior court violated both the appearance of fairness doctrine and their due\n   process right to a proceeding free from bias in this proceeding. Because the dependency, the termination\n   trial, and the subsequent proceedings occurred in a biased tribunal where the superior court assisted and advocated against the parents, we agree and reverse the termination order. We also direct the trial court to vacate the orders entered by Judge Small-the order denying the CR 59 and CR 60 motions and the sanctions order-and remand for a new trial to a county other than Snohomish County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b626 \" 'A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.' \"\n   <em>\n    Peters v.

But the sticky wicket is that the tribunal in which A.H.'s dependency and termination proceedings took place was biased because of the involvement of superior court employees working against the parents in this case. \"[U]nchallenged\n   findings are verities on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Dependency of M.S.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021555\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/1/#p9\">\n    174 Wash.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20P.3d%20234\">\n    271 P.3d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). And Judge Farris entered many unchallenged findings of fact in her recusal order and memorandum decision, which was incorporated by reference in the recusal order. For example, Judge Farris found that before the termination trial, \"the mother's attorneys and the GAL's attorney[, Kirsten Haugen,] got in a global discovery dispute\" and \"[t]he GAL attorney then had private meetings about the discovery dispute with the Head Superior Court Administrator and the Civil Division attorneys representing the Superior Court and Judges.\" The head administrator instructed Haugen to apply the following procedures to any discovery requests by Aradon's attorney:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   blanket object to every discovery request; refuse to produce any discovery ever unless a discovery conference is first conducted at the VGAL Offices; refuse to produce any discovery unless opposing counsel come to the VGAL Offices and read the discovery in the offices first and identify page by page the discovery requested; and avoid the requirement to provide free discovery to indigent parents by charging the court appointed attorneys personally for each page of discovery rather than charging the indigent clients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"When the parents' attorneys complained, the GAL's attorney advised them that this 'discovery procedure' was not being imposed by the GAL's lawyer, but had been dictated to the GAL attorney by the Head Superior Court Administrator and the Superior Court's lawyers on behalf of the VGAL Program, i.e., the Superior Court.\" Judge Farris explained that these \"discovery impediments\" had an effect on A.H.'s termination trial because they\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   remained in place during about the first two years of this dependency case when the GAL in the case was engaging in significant misconduct that was only much later discovered. That GAL misconduct was not discovered when it was occurring because GAL discovery was not being exchanged due to this \"discovery procedure.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b629 Additionally, Judge Farris found that after the termination trial and during the\n   subsequent litigation on VGAL misconduct, Di Vittorio met with Haugen and \"advised and directed [Haugen] to make motions to strike and redact the parent's pleadings in this case\" and gave \"directions on what to include in the motions and advice on the meaning of applicable law.\" Di Vittorio also \"sent the mother's attorneys a letter threatening to take legal action against them personally for filing certain evidence in this case,\" which \"essentially threatened to take some legal action against the mother's attorneys if they did not capitulate and allow certain pleadings to be stricken or redacted as was being requested\" by Haugen. These actions call the superior court's impartiality into doubt because \"the Superior Court's attorneys, as part of their representation of the Superior Court and its judges, threatened to take legal action against a litigant for filing evidence in a termination case when the case was pending before a judge of that same court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b630 Judge Farris also found that Di Vittorio also created an appearance of fairness issue when Di Vittorio repeatedly referred to the superior court and the VGAL Program collectively as \"the Court\" in response to Aradon's motion for sanctions. At the September 2016 hearing on sanctions, Di Vittorio identified herself as being present \"on behalf of the Snohomish County Superior Court.\" Di Vittorio's representation that she was there on behalf of \"the Court\" and the VGAL Program objectively created bias within the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b631 Furthermore Judge Farris explained that during the November 4, 2016, hearing on the recusal motion, Di Vittorio brought \"two other Superior Court Judges, including the Presiding Judge, to the courtroom for the hearing to sit directly behind [Di Vittorio].\" In addition to creating an appearance of \"improper influence or pressure\" on Judge Farris, this action \"also created an appearance of an attempt to try and intimidate or pressure the parents' attorneys.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The presence of these judges \"gave the appearance of trying to send home a message to defense counsel that Superior Court Judges were personally involved in opposing their motion and personally siding against them with the VGAL Program staff attorney who had clearly committed courtroom misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b632 Finally, Judge Farris found that the VGAL Program used abusive litigation tactics against the parents. These included posttrial \"document dumps\" that purposefully made information hard to find, the destruction or withholding of relevant e-mails, and the proffering of false and misleading statements. Perhaps most egregiously, VGAL Brook's entire hard copy file for this dependency mysteriously \"disappeared\" from the VGAL Program's possession during the posttrial proceedings regarding the VGALs' misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b633 In short, based on the above findings, Judge Farris correctly concluded that \"[t]he Superior Court, its direct agents, and its own attorneys, all under the supervision of the judges repeatedly aligned with and literally became a party litigating this case against the parents ... throughout the case.\" These circumstances, which existed before, during, and after the termination trial, resulted in a tribunal that was biased and violated both parents' right to due process and the appearance of fairness doctrine. Therefore, the termination order must be reversed. Although Judge Small was not a judge seated in Snohomish County, he heard oral argument on the motions in Snohomish County and relied on a record generated in that biased tribunal in making his decisions. For that reason, the orders entered by Judge Small do not escape the taint of the bias and must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b634 The Department argues that the termination order can stand. It contends that because the superior court's involvement in litigating against the parents occurred only during the September 2016 sanctions proceedings, the appearance of fairness doctrine and the parents' due process\n   right to an impartial tribunal were not violated during the termination trial. But that contention ignores the fact that superior court attorneys assisted the VGAL Program in litigation against the parents during discovery and during the motions regarding the VGALs' misconduct. Because the record establishes the superior court's attorneys were involved\n   in this litigation well before the sanctions motion, the Department's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b635 The Department also argues that\n   <em>\n    State v.

Before, during, and after the termination trial, attorneys representing the superior court aided the VGAL program in litigating against the parents. Indeed, the bias evidenced here was such that although Judge Farris herself did not participate in the superior court's improper acts or show any personal bias, Judge Farris determined that she was precluded from taking further action in the case.

Judge Farris based this determination, in part, on the fact that superior court attorneys communicated with, aligned with, and assisted the VGAL's attorney in the litigation in this case. In February 2017, Judge Farris heard argument from the parties on whether a termination order could still be entered given her recusal. Unsurprisingly, Di Vittorio and the Department argued that Judge Farris could enter the order, and the parents and AGAL Buurstra argued that Judge Farris could not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b641 On May 17, 2017, Judge Farris entered the recusal order. The same day, Judge Farris also entered the termination order. In the recusal order, Judge Farris concluded that entry of the termination order was merely a ministerial act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   entry of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Final Order of Termination from the termination trial is a ministerial act under the unique facts of this case that are set forth below. Therefore, final paperwork can enter and it has been signed and is hereby entering contemporaneously with this order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Judge Farris acknowledged that \"[n]ormally signing findings is not a ministerial act.\" But Judge Farris concluded that it was ministerial in this case because the findings conformed to her prior oral rulings and had already been drafted and signed by the parties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [A]ny disputes over the form of the findings and order had already been decided by me, I had very specifically directed the parties exactly how to prepare the findings, and had literally dictated them to a court reporter verbatim.

Thereafter, any party-should\n   they choose to do so-may file a motion to change venue to any county other than Snohomish County and may renew the motion for sanctions. On remand, the trial court is directed to vacate the termination order, the CR 59 and 60 order, and the sanctions order and appoint both a GAL and an attorney for A.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Dwyer, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Schindler, J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
