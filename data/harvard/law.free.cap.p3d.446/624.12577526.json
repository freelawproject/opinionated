Gerlach was extremely intoxicated at the time of the fall. At trial, Cove sought to limit its liability by proving that Gerlach's intoxication was the proximate cause of her damages and that she was more than 50 percent at fault, in accordance with the affirmative defense of voluntary intoxication\n   under RCW 5.40.060(1). Because the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of Gerlach's blood alcohol level at the time of the accident and that exclusion prejudiced Cove's ability to prove Gerlach's intoxication proximately caused her injuries, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 On October 26, 2012, Gerlach and her boyfriend Nathan Miller, along with Colin and Brodie Liddell,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   went to a birthday party and then to a bar within walking\n   distance of Miller's apartment. Miller lived in a second story unit at The Cove Apartments in Federal Way, which were owned by The Cove Apartments LLC and managed by Weidner Property Management LLC. After the bar closed in the early hours of October 27, Miller and Colin stopped by a convenience store to buy beer, while Gerlach and Brodie returned to Miller's apartment. Brodie stopped to smoke a cigarette before going inside. While he was smoking, he heard a snap and turned in time to see Gerlach in midair, just before she landed head-first on a concrete step on the ground floor. A rotted railing from Miller's balcony also fell near Gerlach. Gerlach suffered a life threatening head injury as a result of the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Gerlach sued Cove, alleging breach of contract, violations of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 (RLTA), chapter 59.18 RCW, and negligence. The breach of contract claim was dismissed on summary judgment because Gerlach was not a tenant and had no contractual relationship with Cove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Although no one witnessed how Gerlach fell and Gerlach does not remember the events of that night, her theory at trial was that the severely rotted railing on Miller's balcony gave way while she was leaning on it, causing her to fall to the ground. Relying on testimony from a biomechanical expert, Cove proffered an alternative theory: that Gerlach did not have a key to the front door, tried to enter the apartment via the balcony, and fell while trying to climb over the balcony railing from the outside. This theory supported Cove's affirmative defense under RCW 5.40.060(1) that Gerlach was intoxicated at the time of the accident, her intoxication was a proximate cause of her injuries, and she was more than 50 percent at fault. To this end, Cove attempted to introduce evidence that Gerlach's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of the accident was .238 and expert testimony on how a BAC of that level would affect a person's judgment, psychomotor functions, and cognitive abilities. The trial court excluded\n   this evidence and testimony because it found they were more prejudicial than probative. Instead, the trial court instructed the jury that Gerlach \"was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The jury found that Cove was negligent and that its negligence proximately caused Gerlach's injuries. It also found that Gerlach was contributorily negligent and seven percent at fault. The jury verdict was $3,799,793.78, and the net award to Gerlach was $3,533,808.23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Cove appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Exclusion of Gerlach's Blood Alcohol Level\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Cove argues that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of Gerlach's blood alcohol level and that the exclusion was prejudicial.

This defense, codified as RCW 5.40.060(1), provides a complete defense to Gerlach's action for personal injury if she was intoxicated, her intoxication was a proximate cause of her injury, and she was more than 50 percent at fault. RCW 5.40.060(1) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [I]t is a complete defense to an action for damages for personal injury or wrongful death that the person injured or killed was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug at the time of the occurrence causing the injury or death and that such condition was a proximate cause of the injury or death and the trier of fact finds such person to have been more than fifty percent at fault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Before trial, Gerlach moved in limine to exclude evidence of a blood test taken by the hospital less than an hour after the accident. The test showed that her serum alcohol measurement was 252 mg/dL, which roughly translates to a BAC of .238. After several hearings, the trial court granted Gerlach's motion because Gerlach offered to stipulate to the jury that she was intoxicated at the time of the accident. The court determined that if Gerlach admitted she was intoxicated, evidence of her blood alcohol level was not necessary to establish a defense under RCW 5.40.060(1). The trial court explained that, under\n   <em>\n    Peralta v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452166\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/888/\">\n    187 Wash.2d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20P.3d%20596\">\n    389 P.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), an admission of intoxication was sufficient\n   to establish intoxication under RCW 5.40.060(1) and the admission of Gerlach's blood alcohol level would have been more prejudicial than probative under ER 403. Because the trial court misapplied\n   <em>\n    Peralta\n   </em>\n   and ER 403, its exclusion of the blood alcohol evidence was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 ER 403 does not support the exclusion of the blood alcohol evidence. Although evidence of Gerlach's blood alcohol level was irrelevant to establish intoxication once she admitted that she was intoxicated, that evidence was still relevant to prove the extent to which her intoxication proximately caused her injuries. To that end, Cove was prepared to offer expert testimony that a person's physical and cognitive limitations at a BAC of .238 make it less likely that she could safely stand on a balcony or climb over a railing. Although Gerlach's high blood alcohol level could stimulate an emotional response in a jury, it is not so prejudicial that its probative value is outweighed. Because Gerlach's percentage of fault was reserved for the jury, the jury should have been able to consider Gerlach's level of intoxication and how it may have affected her physical and cognitive abilities.\n   <em>\n    Geschwind v.

It also held that if she did not intend to admit \"intoxication\" as that term is statutorily defined (i.e., having a BAC greater than .08 or being unable to drive a motor vehicle), Peralta was required to clarify her admission to reflect that distinction.\n   <em>\n    Peralta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452166\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/888/\">\n    187 Wash.2d at 904-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20P.3d%20596\">\n    389 P.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because it was not relevant to the issues on appeal, the court did not address whether Peralta's level of intoxication contributed to the jury's finding that her intoxication was a proximate cause of her injuries or its finding that she was more than 50 percent at fault. But the Supreme Court did note that there was ample evidence to support the State's voluntary intoxication defense, meaning there was evidence, other than Peralta's admission, of her intoxication presented at trial.\n   <em>\n    Peralta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452166\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/888/\">\n    187 Wash.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   900 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20P.3d%20596\">\n    389 P.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, the exclusion of Gerlach's blood alcohol evidence resulted in a complete absence of evidence as to the extent of her intoxication. For this reason,\n   <em>\n    Peralta\n   </em>\n   does not support the trial court's decision to exclude Gerlach's blood alcohol level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Gerlach argues that even if the trial court erred in excluding the blood alcohol evidence, the error did not prejudice Cove because Cove \"extensively examined Gerlach's companions concerning the extent and degree of\n   their alcohol consumption before returning to the Cove.\" The record does not support this contention. None of Gerlach's companions testified as to how many drinks Gerlach consumed that night or that she was extremely intoxicated. For example, Brodie testified that Gerlach was drinking that night but that he could not remember what she had to drink. Colin testified that they all \"had a drink\" at the birthday party and shared a pitcher of beer at the bar and that based on his own observations, he had no reason to believe Gerlach was impaired that night. Finally, Miller testified that he couldn't remember Gerlach drinking but \"would guess that she was.\" The lack of evidence of Gerlach's degree of intoxication prejudiced Cove's ability to prove its affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Alternatively, Gerlach argues that evidence of her blood alcohol level was properly excluded because there was no evidence that the required standards were met. This argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 RCW 5.40.060(1) provides that for purposes of the voluntary intoxication defense,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [t]he standard for determining whether a person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs shall be the same standard established for criminal convictions under RCW 46.61.502, and evidence that a person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs under the standard established by RCW 46.61.502 shall be conclusive proof that such person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   RCW 46.61.502 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) A person is guilty of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, marijuana, or any drug if the person drives a vehicle within this state:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (a) And the person has, within two hours after driving, an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher as shown by analysis of the person's breath or blood made under RCW 46.61.506 ; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (c) While the person is under the influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor, marijuana, or any drug; or\n   (d) While the person is under the combined influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor, marijuana, and any drug.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Notably, only subsection (1)(a) of RCW 46.61.502, which sets forth the standard for \"per se\" intoxication, refers to specific testing standards that must be met for a person's measured level of intoxication to be used against him or her at trial.

Dr. Vincenzi completed an analysis that included a conversion of Gerlach's serum alcohol measurement of 252 mg/dL at the hospital to the more commonly used BAC number of .238 at the time of the accident. He also testified in an offer of proof as to the\n   effect of the consumption of alcohol on a person based on his or her blood alcohol level. He opined that a person with a BAC of .200 or higher would experience severe psychomotor impairment.\n   \u00b624 The trial court excluded Dr. Vincenzi's testimony at the same time that it erroneously excluded the evidence of Gerlach's blood alcohol level. Dr. Vincenzi's testimony would have been helpful to the jury in understanding the effects of intoxication on a person with a high blood alcohol level. To the extent that the trial court excluded Dr. Vincenzi's testimony based on its erroneous ruling on Gerlach's blood alcohol level, that exclusion was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 Gerlach argues that Dr. Vincenzi's testimony was speculative and without foundation because it was based on the hospital blood test that did not comply with the testing standards of RCW 46.61.506. As explained in the previous section, those testing standards do not bar admission. Therefore, this argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 Gerlach also argues that Dr. Vincenzi's testimony was properly excluded based on\n   <em>\n    Purchase v.

But\n   <em>\n    Purchase\n   </em>\n   was a dramshop liability case and is distinguishable.

Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Purchase\n   </em>\n   does not control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b628 Finally, Gerlach argues that Dr. Vincenzi's testimony was properly excluded because testimony explaining that alcohol impairs a person's judgment is a matter of common knowledge understood by the average juror and, therefore, not helpful. But, Dr. Vincenzi's testimony was not limited to this basic fact. He explained that a person with a blood alcohol level of .200 or above will have a decrease in inhibitions, psychomotor impairment, and cognitive impairment. He also opined that \"[p]sychomotor impairment really starts at levels of .05 (unintelligible), about .05 to .06 or thereabouts and gets worse and worse, more and more impairment, and severe impairment in essentially everyone at levels of [.]200 or above.\" Dr. Vincenzi's opinion on how a person's physical and cognitive abilities are affected by his or her BAC would have been helpful to the jury and should have been admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Dr. Carhart\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b629 The trial court did not err in limiting Dr. Carhart's testimony. Dr. Carhart is an expert \"in the biomechanics of human injury and accident reconstruction, specializing in the areas of musculoskeletal dynamics, occupant dynamics, human injury tolerance, vehicular rollover, and occupant-to-glazing interaction.\" Dr. Carhart was prepared to testify that Gerlach's intoxication would have caused her to have \"diminished stability, psychomotor functioning, reaction time performance, and ability to manage complex motor tasks, such as trying to maneuver over a railing.\" He based this opinion on two studies that he cited as authoritative sources. But Dr. Carhart is not an expert in how alcohol affects the human body, and his testimony on this issue would have been speculative. Therefore, the trial court properly excluded Dr. Carhart's testimony on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Dr. Wickizer\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b630 The trial court also did not abuse its discretion by excluding Dr. Wickizer's expert testimony on the reasonable value of Gerlach's medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b631 A plaintiff \"may recover only the reasonable value of medical services received, not the total of all bills paid.\"\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

Specifically, Dr. Wickizer authored an analysis on the reasonableness of Gerlach's medical expenses, in which he explained that billing for the same procedures can vary greatly from hospital to hospital and the billed amount is not necessarily reasonable. In the analysis, he recalculated the \"reasonable value\" of all of Gerlach's medical expenses by applying a cost-to-charge ratio from the hospital's Federal Cost Report to each hospital inpatient charge. The Federal Cost Reports are compiled by the federal government and include cost and revenue information for all patients receiving care at that hospital. Additionally, Dr. Wickizer estimated the reasonable value of Gerlach's physician charges by applying the physician's agreed Medicare reimbursement rate to each physician charge. Cove intended this testimony to assist the jury in evaluating the reasonableness of Gerlach's medical bills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b633 The trial court properly excluded Dr. Wickizer's testimony. Evidence of what Gerlach's physicians accept from Medicaid and how the inpatient charges are affected by Dr. Wickizer's cost-to-charge ratio is not proof that Gerlach's medical expenses were unreasonable. In\n   <em>\n    Hayes v. Wieber Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"358420\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/105/611/#p616\">\n    105 Wash.

It reasoned that \"[t]he fact that the doctor accepted the first party insurance carrier's limit for his services does not tend to prove his charge for these services was unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"358420\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/105/611/#p616\">\n    105 Wash.

Evidence that, on average, a procedure costs less than the amount charged or that Gerlach's physicians accept a lesser payment for services from Medicare is not helpful to the jury in determining whether her medical expenses were reasonable. Furthermore, Gerlach met her burden to prove the reasonableness of her medical expenses under\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   because she presented expert testimony other than the medical records and bills themselves. Dr. Lowell Finkleman testified that the medical treatment Gerlach received and the resulting charges were reasonable and customary for this community and consistent with charges he had seen over the years. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow Dr. Wickizer to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b635 Cove argues that\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because Dr. Wickizer was not testifying on what was charged versus what was paid. We disagree. Although it is not clear from Dr. Wickizer's analysis whether the revenue figure used in the cost-to-charge ratios reflects the amounts billed or the amounts ultimately received for inpatient services, Dr. Wickizer's analysis of Gerlach's physician charges was based on the physicians' agreed Medicare reimbursement rate. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Dr. Wickizer to testify as to his analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Instruction on Voluntary Intoxication\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b636 Cove argues that the trial court erred by failing to give Cove's proposed jury instruction on its voluntary intoxication defense, which closely followed the pattern instruction.

Given these instructions, Cove was able to argue that Gerlach's intoxication was a proximate cause of her accident and that she was more than 50 percent at fault. But, WPI 16.03 contains a more succinct statement of the elements of the voluntary intoxication defense, and\n   while the trial court did not abuse its discretion by giving instructions 20 and 21, WP116.03 is a more appropriate instruction and should be used on remand.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Cove's Duty to Gerlach under the RLTA\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b642 Cove argues that because Gerlach was not Cove's tenant, the trial court erred in instructing the jury that Cove owed a duty to Gerlach based on the RLTA.

But\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Property\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 17.6 (1977) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A landlord is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the\n   <em>\n    tenant and others upon the leased property with the consent of the tenant or\n   </em>\n   his subtenant by a dangerous condition existing before or arising after the tenant has taken possession, if he has failed to exercise reasonable care to repair the condition and the existence of the condition is in violation of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (1) an implied warranty of habitability; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (2) a duty created by statute or administrative regulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Arguably, the language of section 17.6 permits a tenant's guest to recover from a landlord directly for breach of an implied warranty of habitability, a statute, or a regulation. But, we recently held that Washington has only\n   adopted section 17.6 in cases where a landlord's negligence is alleged by a tenant and that the section has not been adopted in the context of claims by nontenants.\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

Therefore, Gerlach cannot base any duty owed by Cove upon section 17.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b645 Here, Gerlach sued Cove for negligence, claiming it breached its implied and statutory warranty of habitability to Gerlach by failing to repair the rotted railing. Cove moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that Gerlach's negligence claim could not proceed because Gerlach was not a tenant and the implied and statutory warranty of habitability only applies to tenants under the RLTA. The trial court denied Cove's motion for summary judgment and instructed the jury on a landlord's duties under the RLTA. Because no Washington law has extended section 17.6 to apply to nontenants, the trial court erred by denying Cove's motion for summary judgment on this cause of action and instructing the jury that Cove could be liable to Gerlach for a violation of the RLTA. We hold that this cause of action cannot go forward on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b646 We reverse the jury verdict in favor of Gerlach and remand for retrial of the issues of liability and allocation of fault in Gerlach's negligence action against Cove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Andrus, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Schindler, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Because Colin and Brodie Liddell have the same last name, this opinion refers to each by his first name.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
