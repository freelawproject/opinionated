Lewd acts with a child under 12 is not a different or separate crime from lewd acts with a child under 16 as Chadwell argues. Rather, the paragraph at the end of Section 1123(A) simply provides different ranges of punishment for lewd acts committed with a child under 16 and for those committed with a child under 12. This paragraph provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Any person convicted of any violation of this subsection shall be punished by imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections for not less than three (3) years nor more than twenty (20) years, except when the child is under twelve (12) years of age at the time the offense is committed, and in such case the person shall, upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections for not less than twenty-five (25) years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thus, Chadwell was convicted for the crimes with which he was charged which were lewd acts with a child under 16. However, his argument that his jury should have been instructed that in order to assess punishment at not less than twenty-five years imprisonment they had to find that the victims were under twelve years of age at the time that the crimes were committed is not without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 In\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v.

I agree that, under\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's failure to instruct the jury properly was error, and the State has shown that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. I write separately to more fully address the instruction issue to give guidance to trial courts and counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b62 As the Majority correctly finds, lewd molestation of a child under the age of 12 is not a \"different or separate crime\" from lewd molestation of a child under 16, as the age difference only enhances the punishment range. The age of the victim of a lewd molestation crime under any subsection of Title 21 O.S. \u00a7 1123 is an element of the crime itself, but that age is 16 years or younger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial judge appropriately instructed the jury on the elements of the crime of lewd molestation of a child under the age of 16, as the State charged the Appellant with that specific offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b63 The Majority also correctly holds it was error to exclude from the instructions on punishment that the jury find the State proved the victim was 12 years or younger in order to consider an enhanced punishment. The jury instruction for lewd molestation (OUJI 4-129) should not change, but the instruction on the available punishment range, OUJI 10-13, should. The third paragraph of the instruction should read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   If you find the defendant guilty, you shall then determine the proper punishment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The crime of lewd molestation of a child under the age of 16 is punishable by imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections for not less than three years nor more than twenty (20) years. You may also impose a fine up to $10,000.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   If you find the defendant guilty, and find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim(s) (insert either initials of victim(s) or count(s) of the Information here if multiple victims) (was) (is) (were) (are) the age of twelve or under, then you may sentence the defendant to custody in the Department of Corrections for not less than twenty-five (25) years. You may also impose a fine up to $10,000.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although not raised in this appeal, the State must put a defendant on notice that it is seeking enhanced punishment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Information should state that the child is under the age of twelve.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    OUJI 4-129 notes that element.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    In this case notice was not an issue. The State first charged Appellant with Sexual Abuse of a Minor Child. That crime, like Lewd Molestation, also includes a finding that the victim was a child under the age of eighteen (18) and carries up to Life in prison. When the State requested to amend the charges to lewd molestation of a child under the age of sixteen (16), they argued that since the victim was under twelve (12) the maximum punishment would not change. Therefore, Appellant was put on notice of the range of punishment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
