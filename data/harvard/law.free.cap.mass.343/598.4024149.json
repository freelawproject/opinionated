He placed upon this land a mobile metal and wood trailer, eight feet by thirty feet in area. The trailer contained a living room, bedroom, equipped kitchen, and conventional bathroom. Sherman intended to transform the trailer into an immovable single family residence, permanently affixed to the land by means of a cement block foundation and connected to water, electricity, and a sewerage disposal system. He began construction of a concrete foundation, drove a well, installed electricity, an electric pump, and water tank, built a cesspool with underground drainage pipes leading from the trailer, built an access road, and did some landscape work.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">The town\u2019s zoning agent \u201cdenied . . . [Sherman] permission to reside in his trailer\u201d on the ground that it was in violation of \u00a7 HI (6) of the Brewster zoning by-law which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>reads, \u201cNo premises in . . . Brewster shall he used for . . .. (6) Residing in any trailer or tent on any parcel of land except in an existing commercial trailer park or camp. \u2019 \u2019 It is stipulated that \u00a7 III (6) is the only applicable provision of the zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Sherman\u2019s land is \u201cwithin . . . 300 feet of a large . . . concrete and cement block manufacturing plant.\u201d In the immediate area there are \u201cfive single family residences,\u201d four of which were converted from mobile trailers and the fifth is the usual conventional type frame house. All were on the land prior to the enactment of the zoning by-law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Sherman was denied a variance by the Brewster zoning board of appeals. The record does not indicate that any appeal has been taken from this denial under Gr. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21 (as amended through St. 1960, c. 365), although a criminal complaint against Sherman in the District Court \u201chas been continued pending\u201d the decision in the present case. Since the enactment of the zoning by-law \u201cno permission has . . . been granted to others seeking to live in a trailer structure . . . [in] like circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The town brought this bill in equity to enjoin the use of Sherman\u2019s premises in violation of the by-law and to require the removal of the trailer. The facts were agreed. It was stipulated that the \u201ccentral issue ... is the interpretation . . . [of] \u2018trailer\u2019 \u201d in \u00a7 III of the by-law and \u201cspecifically, whether a mobile home trailer continues to remain a \u2018trailer\u2019 when its mobility and transiency have been destroyed and it has been placed upon a concrete foundation . . . and equipped with the usual home utilities.\u201d The trial judge in the Superior Court ruled \u2018\u2018that the occupation of the trailer structure is in violation\u201d of the by-law and the purpose of Gr. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3 (inserted by St. 1954, c. 368, \u00a7 2). A final decree was entered that Sherman cease occupying the trailer as a residence and that he remove the trailer. Sherman appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The case is governed by <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Phillips, ante, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>p. 591. Brewster has used appropriate language in its bylaw to exclude trailers from areas other than existing commercial trailer parks or camps. We hold that the prohibition of residence in \u201cany trailer or tent,\u201d contained in \u00a7 III (6), taking the words in their most natural sense, sufficiently describes this type of trailer or mobile home unit whether it be still mobile or affixed with substantial permanence to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\"> No contention is made that placing this land in a single family residence zone was improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
