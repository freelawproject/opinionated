The defendant Augenstern concedes that he was in control of the area where the plaintiff fell. There was evidence that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tiff, a young woman of eighteen, had been in the store to make a purchase and on leaving noticed \u201cice, snow and slush\u201d on the inclined area which \u201csloped\u201d down from the door to the sidewalk. She took about two steps from the door and fell. It was about 9:30 p.m., January 8, 1957. It had snowed heavily on January 7 and until the early morning of January 8 but on the evening of January 8 it was clear. Augenstern testified that \u201che keeps the inclined entranceway shovelled and clear as it is part of the property he leases but that he has no recollection of any clearing or shovelling or maintenance of the entrance on the date of the accident.\u201d At the conclusion of the evidence the plaintiff \u201cdiscontinued\u201d all counts of the declaration against Vernhunt, Inc., a codefendant, which was the lessor of the store. She also \u201cdiscontinued\u201d all but counts 1 and 9 against Augenstern. Count 1 alleged negligence on the part of Augenstern by unreasonably permitting snow and ice to accumulate and remain in the entrance. A verdict was directed for Augenstern on count 9 in which the consequential damages of the plaintiff\u2019s father were alleged. A motion by Augenstern for a directed verdict on count 1 was denied subject to Augenstern\u2019s exception and the jury returned a verdict on that count for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Augenstern\u2019s exceptions must be overruled. No citation of authority is required to demonstrate that the plaintiff\u2019s alleged contributory negligence was a question for the jury. The evidence warranted findings that the snow and slush on the sloping area created a condition dangerous to one entering or leaving the store, that it resulted from the storm of the previous day and that it had remained there a sufficient length of time for Augenstern to have known of it and in the exercise of reasonable care to have removed it. <em>Lanagan </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>324 Mass. 540, 541. <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Pilotte, </em>329 Mass. 610, 613. <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>First Natl. Stores, Inc. </em>340 Mass. 222, 225. In her testimony the plaintiff made different statements as to the date of her fall. She said at one time it was on January 7 and at another time on January 8. Augenstern argues that she finally settled on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>January 7, in which case, he contends that, according to the weather report in evidence, it would have been in the midst of a snow storm and he would not have been guilty of negligence. We think her evidence does not bear out Augenstern\u2019s contention and make applicable the rule of <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>224 Mass. 405, 406. The plaintiff insisted that when she fell it was not snowing and when finally asked on recross-examination whether she \u201cwanted it left\u201d that the accident happened on January 7 answered \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
