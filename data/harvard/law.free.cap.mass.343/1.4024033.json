L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K to SIGrGr, as amended, see especially \u00a7 81BB. DoEner alleged in each appeal that he, as trustee, owned land in Millis and that, on April 8, 1959, he had applied for approval of a definitive subdivision plan. In one appeal filed June 2, 1959, Doliner also alleged that by letter dated May 26, 1959, the planning board had informed him of the disapproval of the plan for reasons stated below (see <em>Doliner </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Millis, post, </em>p. 10). In the other appeal, filed June 10, 1959, Doliner alleged that the planning board had failed \u201cto take any valid final action concerning\u201d his subdivision plan \u201cwithin sixty days following submission thereof as required by\u201d Or. L. c. 41, $ 81TJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The trial judge made the following findings. On April 8, 1959, a month after a town meeting had adopted a new zoning by-law, DoEner filed with the planning board, and on April 9,1959, with the town board of health, applications for approval of Ms subdivision plan. He notified the town clerk of this action. The board of health made no report upon this plan to the planning board within forty-five days of the date of the filing. On May 26, 1959, the planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>board notified the town clerk and Doliner that it had disapproved the plan because the \u201c[l]ot sizes fail to comply with the [z]oning [b]y-law and [m]ap as accepted . . . at the [a]nnual [t]own [m]eeting of March 9,1959.\u201d The planning board held no public hearing prior to this disapproval.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">At the town meeting on March 9, 1959, the town voted to adopt the proposed zoning by-law then on file with the town clerk and to repeal the then existing zoning by-law passed in 1956, \u201csuch repeal to be effective only if and when\u201d the new by-law should take effect after approval by the Attorney General and after publication. See G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32 (as amended through St. 1952, c. 337). On April 1, 1959, the town clerk forwarded the new by-law to the Attorney General, who approved it by letter dated June 9,1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The judge further found that Doliner\u2019s plan was \u201cfiled in accordance with the rules and regulations and the zoning [by-jlaws ... in existence\u201d on April 8, 1959, and that the new zoning by-law was not then in effect. He purported to \u201cfind,\u201d in effect thereby ruling, (a) \u201cthat no valid action . . . was taken by the . . . planning board within sixty days after\u201d Doliner\u2019s submission of his subdivision plan; (b) that the amended zoning by-law \u201cdid not control\u201d Doliner\u2019s plan; (c) that the board of health\u2019s failure to report within forty-five days \u201cis deemed . . . approval of the . . . plan\u201d; and (d) \u201cthat the failure of the planning board to approve or disapprove the . . . plan within sixty days ... is deemed . . . approval . . . and such approval became final on that date [June 8,1959].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">A final decree was entered that the plan was \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the planning board and the board of health \u201cby reason of . . . [their] failure ... to act thereon within the time prescribed in\u201d G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81TJ; that this approval has become final; and that \u201cthe lots shown on . . . [the] plan conform to the residential use requirements of the zoning by-law ... in effect on June 8, 1959.\u201d The planning board appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">1. Pertinent provisions of the subdivision control law</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>appear in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of Doliner\u2019s filing of his definitive plan on April 8, 1959, and on May 26, 1959, when the planning hoard notified him and the town clerk of its disapproval, none of the 1960 amendments of c. 41 (mentioned in footnote 1) had taken effect. Some of the pertinent statutory provisions were considered by this court in <em>Daley Constr. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Ran</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>dolph, </em>340 Mass. 149, 151-156, and in <em>Pieper </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Southborough, </em>340 Mass. 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The <em>Pieper </em>case decided (see pp. 159-161) that under \u00a7 81U (as amended through St. 1955, c. 324) disapproval of a plan by the planning board without granting a public hearing was not to \u201cbe treated as a nullity.\u2019\u2019 Statute 1958, c. 377, \u00a7 1, made changes in the language of \u00a7 81U, including the substitution of \u201cshall\u201d for \u201cmay\u201d in the language with respect to approval or disapproval of a subdivision plan. These changes do not require a different conclusion (from that in the <em>Pieper </em>case) as to the effect of planning board disapproval of a subdivision plan without holding the public hearing to which an applicant is entitled. Such disapproval, if intended by the planning board as final board action (and the letter of May 26, 1959, seems to have been so intended), operates as a disapproval and constitutes final board action, despite the failure to hold the public hearing contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The trial judge thus incorrectly ruled that the planning-board had approved Doliner\u2019s plan by failing to act on or before June 8. The board\u2019s action on May 26 not only gave Doliner the right to appeal to the Superior Court under \u00a7 81BB (as amended through St. 1957, c. 199, \u00a7 2) but also prevented approval of the plan through lapse of time without action.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">2. The planning board on May 26, 1959, disapproved Doliner\u2019s subdivision plan because it failed to comply with the new zoning by-law which had not then become effective under G-. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32, as amended. Whether this was proper action, apart from the failure of the planning board to grant a public hearing upon the plan, depends upon the interpretation of several possibly conflicting statutory provisions. See 1959 Ann. Surv. Mass. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 12.10-12.11. These appear in two separate chapters of the General Laws. Our duty is to reconcile these statutory provisions, if possible, so that they will accomplish harmoniously the legislative purpose so far as that can be ascertained. See <em>Real Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>311 Mass. 430, 436; <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>311 Mass. 572, 577-578.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The subdivision control law contemplates that the planning board shall ensure compliance of subdivision plans not only with the zoning by-law, but also with the rules and regulations which must be adopted under \u00a7 81Q (see the <em>Pieper </em>ease, at p. 163), by each planning board in a community where the subdivision control law is in effect. See also the legislative history reviewed in the <em>Pieper </em>case and in the <em>Daley Constr. Co. Inc. </em>case, 340 Mass. 149,153 et seq. Section 81M (see footnote 1, <em>supra) </em>states (1) that the planning board\u2019s powers \u201cshall be exercised with due regard . . . for insuring compliance with the applicable zoning . . . by-laws\u201d and also (2) that a plan \u201cshall receive . . . approval . . . if . . . [the] plan conforms to the recommendation of the board of health and to the reasonable rules and regulations of the planning board.\u201d Although under \u00a7 81Q the planning board\u2019s rules and regulations shall not relate to size of lots, except as they \u201cmay require compliance with . . . existing zoning . . . by-laws\u201d (see footnote 1, <em>supra), </em>the planning board seems to be expected under \u00a7 81M to require compliance with any applicable zoning by-law as well as with any rules and regulations of its own. It must be determined, however, in interpreting \u00a7 81M what is an \u201capplicable\u201d zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Under Gr. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32, the new Millis zoning by-law did not become effective until approved by the Attorney General on June 9, 1959 (and until there had been compliance with other provisions of the section), although it was adopted by the town meeting on March 9,1959. Nevertheless, under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, as revised by St. 1954, c. 368, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> no building permit (to build upon a lot shown on the plan) would protect the owner of the lot (a) if the lot did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>not comply with the new zoning by-law (and the planning board found that it did not) and (b) if the permit was issued after public notice had been given of the hearing before the planning board upon the proposed new zoning by-law. See Gr. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, as amended by St. 1957, c. 137. See also the later amendment of \u00a7 6 by St. 1959, c. 317, \u00a7 1. In the sense that c. 40A, \u00a7 11, and the new by-law would prevent issuing a valid building permit (if the new by-law was later adopted by the town, approved by the Attorney General, and published, see c. 40, \u00a7 32), the new by-law was \u201capplicable\u201d to Doliner\u2019s subdivision plan. Accordingly, having in mind e. 40A, \u00a7 11, the Legislature can hardly have intended that a planning board must disregard the terms of a zoning by-law, already adopted by the town even if not yet approved by the Attorney General, when called upon to consider a subdivision plan violating that by-law. Particularly is that true, where the submission of the plan, a substantial time after the town\u2019s action, could have been found to have been a belated attempt to circumvent the new by-law. If the planning board were to approve such a plan, its action would be an empty gesture, and, in view of \u00a7 11, might be seriously misleading to a purchaser of the lot from Doliner.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The situation is further complicated by the provisions of c. 40A, \u00a7 7A. This section was originally enacted by St. 1957, c. 297. It then contained only the second sentence of the 1959 form of \u00a7 7A, part of which appears in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By St. 1959, c. 221, effective July 20, 1959, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>first sentence was added. This amendment, of course, did not apply to the planning board\u2019s action on May 26, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In the circumstances, our efforts to reconcile these different statutes, enacted and amended at different times, lead us to the following conclusions. As the statutes stood on May 26, 1959, the planning board could properly have disapproved Doliner\u2019s subdivision plan (if it had held a public hearing on the plan) on the ground that the plan was inconsistent with the new by-law, in its discretion making its disapproval subject to permission to resubmit the plan if the Attorney General disapproved the new by-law. Because no public hearing upon the plan was held, however, the plan, in any event, must now be remanded to the planning board for new consideration, as was done in the <em>Daley Constr. Co. Inc. </em>(340 Mass. 149, 156) and <em>Pieper </em>(340 Mass. 157, 164). cases. If Doliner\u2019s plan should now be approved, the second sentence of the 1959 version of \u00a7 7A (see footnote 3, <em>supra) </em>by its terms does not purport to protect from the new by-law lots shown on the plan which do not conform to that by-law which we assume has become effective. The fair construction, in a manner consistent with the public interest, of all the statutory provisions presently effective, especially c. 40A, \u00a7 11 (footnote 2, <em>supra), </em>seems to us to permit the planning board now to rely upon the new zoning by-law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a basis for its action together with any other matters which it may properly consider under \u00a7 81U (e.g. imposition of provisions regulating the construction of ways and the installation of utilities) under any rules and regulations in effect when Doliner submitted the plan on April 8,1959. If, however, the planning board acts after St. 1961, c. 435, \u00a7 2, has become effective, questions may arise under \u00a7 7A, as thereby amended. Ho issue with respect to this 1961 amendment has been argued and the pendency of the amendment was not brought to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>attention. Accordingly, we express no opinion with respect to it or its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">3. It is not clear from the trial judge\u2019s subsidiary findings whether in 1959 the planning board considered any issue other than whether the plan complied with the new by-law. The planning board\u2019s letter of May 26, 1959, suggests that it did not do so. The board of health may have failed to act at all, because it was of the opinion that the plan in any event could not be approved because in violation of the new by-law. In the circumstances, the new decree (see c. 41, \u00a7 81BB) should appropriately give the board of health further opportunity to report on the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The judge\u2019s finding that the \u201cplan was filed in accordance with the rules and regulations and the zoning laws then in existence\u201d implies that some rules and regulations had then been adopted. Counsel at the arguments expressed doubt whether regulations had then been promulgated under \u00a7 81Q. If there were no such rules and regulations, any such rules and regulations adopted after April 8, 1959, would not be applicable to the planning board\u2019s action on Doliner\u2019s plan, by reason of the last sentence quoted from \u00a7 81Q in footnote 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">4. The final decree is reversed. A new decree is to be entered (a) annulling the decision of the planning board and remanding the plan to it for consideration; (b) directing the planning board to hold a public hearing upon Dol-iner\u2019s plan and to obtain the recommendations of the town board of health thereon, each to be accomplished within forty-five days from the date of the new decree; and (c) directing the planning board to take final action upon the plan within sixty days from the date of the new decree in a manner consistent with the applicable statutes, by-laws, and rules and regulations (if any), and with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-5\"> General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 81M (as amended through St. 1957, c. 265), reads in part: \u201cThe powers [under the subdivision control law] of a planning board . . . shall be exercised with due regard . . . for insuring compliance with the applicable zoning . . . by-laws ....
