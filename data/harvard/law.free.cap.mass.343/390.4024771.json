At the close of the evidence the defendant moved for a directed verdict which was denied. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff which was recorded under leave reserved. Thereafter, the defendant moved that the court enter a verdict for the defendant under leave re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>served. TMs motion was denied and the case is here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of both motions and to certain portions of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The plaintiff testified that she had been employed at the Fall River store of the J. J. Newberry Company as a clerk from March, 1950, and that on July 5, 1957, she was working at the toy counter. At about 4:30 p.m. on that day she was told to report to the \u201csign room\u201d which was located on the second floor of the store occupied by the company. There she saw two men who identified themselves as detectives from the Pinkerton detective agency. They told her that a shopper who had made a purchase from the plaintiff reported that the plaintiff did not \u201cring up\u201d the amount of the sale; that she did not give the shopper a receipt; and that she had kept the money from the sale. The plaintiff told the men that she did not keep the money but had rung up the sale and that she did not give the customer a receipt because the tape on the cash register had run out. She admitted that oftentimes she did not place a receipt in the bag with the article and that she knew this was a violation of the company rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The detectives informed the plaintiff that she had been observed \u201cfiddling with the paper bags underneath her counter.\u201d The plaintiff explained that she did so in order to keep her counter neat. The plaintiff further testified that she offered to be searched and asked the detectives to search her counter but they refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The plaintiff also testified that during the interview she had a conversation with the detectives concerning employees stealing from the company; that they asked her to give them the information regarding the thefts; that she would not give them the information; that she \u201cwould not give any names\u201d but was quite sure that \u201csomething [was] going over the counter that should not have been going over the counter but she could never prove it.\u201d During the course of the interview the detectives left the room for a period of five minutes while the plaintiff remained in the room. When they returned one of the detectives said, \u201cIf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>you sign this paper, we will let you off easy.\u201d The plaintiff said, \u201cI won\u2019t sign it, because I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d The detectives left the room again remaining out for about two minutes, during which time the plaintiff stayed in the room. When they returned the plaintiff was again asked whether she would sign the paper. She said \u201cNo\u201d and one of the detectives said, \u201cWell, then, as of now you are terminated from Newberry\u2019s.\u201d She remained in the sign room for about one hour. Her normal working hours were from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. On July 5, 1957,'she punched the time clock at 5:30 p.m. and received her pay for that day \u201cincluding the time up to 5:30 p.m.\u201d The plaintiff spoke to the store manager about being fired and was informed that the Pinkerton detective agency was employed by the J. J. Newberry Company and that the detectives had the right to fire her.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">There was testimony from one of the detectives that the plaintiff was informed that the store had been \u201ctested by shoppers\u201d; that the reports of the shoppers showed that \u201ccertain policies\u201d of the store had been broken; and that \u201csince her name had been mentioned on two or three of the reports they wanted her to clarify the reasons why her name was mentioned.\u201d They discussed the rule of the company that requires the clerks to place receipts in the packages after the sale and the rule concerning the immediate ringing up of a sale. The plaintiff told the detectives that sometimes she did not get around to ringing up the sale immediately and would put the money on the sill in front of the cash register and would ring up the sale when she got around to it. She also told them that sometimes the customer took the package before she was able to put the receipt in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">If the circumstances are such that an investigation is warranted, a person may he detained for a reasonable length of time and in a reasonable way. <em>Standish </em>v. <em>Narragansett S.S. Co. 1</em>11 Mass. 512, 517-518. <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Childs Dining Hall Co. </em>244 Mass. 438, 439. Since the plaintiff admitted violating company rules and since there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>evidence that she knew someone was stealing from the company, the defendant had a right to detain the plaintiff for a reasonable time and in a reasonable way in order to make a lawful inquiry and investigation into these matters. Such a right has been established in situations involving suspected shoplifters. G-. L. c. 231, \u00a7 94B (inserted by St. 1958, c. 337). See Restatement 2d: Torts, Tent, draft no. 1, 1957, \u00a7 120A.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The question is, therefore, whether, under the circumstances, the plaintiff was detained in an unreasonable way or for an unreasonable time. <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Childs Dining Hall Co., supra, </em>441.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The plaintiff was informed of reports which showed reasonable cause for her to be suspect and was given an opportunity to explain. She was not accused of stealing. There were no acts of physical force, threats or other conduct that indicate any restraint upon her. The only evidence appearing in the record which conceivably might indicate a basis for any apprehension on the part of the plaintiff was the detective\u2019s statement that \u201cIf you sign this paper, we will let you off easy.\u201d The contents of the paper do not appear in the record. In any event no effort was made to compel her to sign and she did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">On the most favorable aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the interview did not exceed one hour. This cannot be deemed an unreasonable length of time in view of her admitted violations of company rules and her statement that she was quite sure that \u201csomething [was] going over the counter that should not have been going over the counter.\u201d There was no evidence that the plaintiff was not at all times free to leave the premises. See <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>247 Mass. 277, 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted. In view of this, it is unnecessary to consider the defendant\u2019s other exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
