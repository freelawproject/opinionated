Inc. (Semper) for Semper\u2019s delivery of fill material to the job site in Braintree. Semper as principal and New Amsterdam Casualty Company (New Amsterdam) as surety gave Marinucci a \u201cLabor and Material Payment Bond\u201d (Semper\u2019s bond) conditioned that Semper \u201cmake payment to all claimants as hereinafter defined, for all labor and material used or reasonably required for use in the performance of . . . [Semper\u2019s subcontract].\u201d The bond defined \u201cclaimant . . . as one having a direct contract with . . . [Semper] or with a subcontractor of . . . [Sem-per] for labor, material, or both . . ..\u201d The bond gave the claimants the right to sue thereon in Marinucci\u2019s name, but the right to sue was conditioned on giving notice within a defined ninety day period to any two of Marinucci, Sem-per, and New Amsterdam and bringing suit within a year after Semper\u2019s cessation of work under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Semper did not pay several subcontractors. Seven of these unpaid suppliers filed claims against the statutory bond of May 14, 1957,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which Marinucci as principal and Maryland Casualty Company (Maryland) as surety had given the Commonwealth, conditioned on the payment for labor, materials, and other items. Petitions to enforce claims under this statutory security were filed by six creditors and the seventh intervened in one of the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Marinucci thereupon brought this bill against Semper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>and New Amsterdam seeking, in effect, to make Semper\u2019s and New Amsterdam\u2019s obligations under Semper\u2019s bond the primary obligations for the payment of Semper\u2019s subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The petitions of the seven creditors and this suit were referred to a master. He ruled that six of the creditors were entitled to be paid out of the sums retained by the Commonwealth under its contract with Marinucci<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as under the statutory bond. The master ruled that the seventh creditor was barred because its petition to intervene was filed more than one year after the filing of its sworn claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The master ruled that Semper\u2019s bond was not a statutory bond but \u201c was an offer . . . to claimants who relied thereon and who should accept the offer by bringing themselves within its terms. . . . <em>See Johnson-Foster Co. v. D\u2019Amore Constr. Co. </em>314 Mass. 416.\u201d He ruled also that Marinucci was not a claimant and had no standing to sue thereon. In a supplemental report he found that no suit was instituted on Semper\u2019s bond by any claimant in his own name, or Marinucci\u2019s, within the specified one year period, and that Marinucci did not, within that period, bring such a suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The final decree in the Superior Court embodied rulings like those made by the master and dismissed the bill. Mari-nucci appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Semper\u2019s bond was not the statutory bond to which all suppliers within the statutory specifications might turn if unpaid. The statute (Gr. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39; c. 149, \u00a7 29) specifies that that bond be given by the general contractor. In support of the contention that Semper\u2019s bond was unenforceable by any claimant thereunder who had rights against the statutory security, see <em>Philip Carey Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Peerless Cas. Co. </em>330 Mass. 319, 321-322. Compare <em>Johnson-Foster Co. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amore Constr. Co. </em>314 Mass. 416, 419, 420. <em>Robinson Clay Prod. Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Constr. Co. of Mass. Inc. </em>339 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Mass. 406. <em>Waite Hardware Co. </em>v. <em>Ardini &amp; Pfau, Inc. </em>339 Mass. 634, 637. We do not reach that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Marinucci was interested in the enforcement of Semper\u2019s bond for, otherwise, either through the retained percentage under its contract with the Commonwealth or its obligation as principal on the statutory bond, it would be obliged to pay Semper\u2019s creditors, and to the extent that it had not retained a sufficient sum under its contract with Semper it would be out of pocket. See <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Casassa, </em>301 Mass. 246, 255. We need not determine whether or to what extent Marinucci\u2019s interest gave it an equitable remedy. Whatever Marinucci\u2019s equitable right, it could not operate to increase the obligation of the makers of Semper\u2019s bond. Failure to meet the conditions of that bond is decisive. Marinucci\u2019s only suit was against New Amsterdam and Semper. It did not join any claimant under Semper\u2019s bond as would have been necessary if it sought to require enforcement of claimants\u2019 rights thereunder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, Marinucci\u2019s suit was filed December 30,1959, and alleged that Semper\u2019s last work was on or about September 22,1958. It is plain, as the master found, that neither any claimant nor Marinucci brought suit within the one year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The petitions of the six prevailing claimants to make good their claims against the statutory bond did not meet the conditions of Semper\u2019s bond. There is nothing in Marinucci\u2019s contention that New Amsterdam \u201celiminates any defense based on failure ... to comply with the provisions of . . . [Semper\u2019s] bond\u201d by agreeing that each of these six claimants had seasonably filed (1) a sworn claim with the Department of Public Works and (2) its petition in court, and had furnished labor or equipment to Semper.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs of the appeal to New Amsterdam Casualty Company.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-11\"> Gr.
