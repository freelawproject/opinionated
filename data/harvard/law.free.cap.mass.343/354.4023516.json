Items which were not brought by Sherman to the location at Norfolk Street were taken there by the customers themselves. Every day or every other day items at Norfolk\u2019s location were picked up by a truck of the Quality Wet Wash (hereinafter called Quality) and transported by it to its premises on Gribs on Street, Dorchester, for washing and laundering. In emergencies one of the plaintiffs would deliver the goods to Quality rather than wait for Quality\u2019s truck. Norfolk and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Quality were entirely independent companies. When the washing and laundering were completed, Quality returned the goods to Norfolk Street where they were sorted out and redelivered by Norfolk to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">On Tuesday, August 23, 1955, a fire at the Quality premises destroyed all of the goods which had been picked up from Norfolk on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday of the previous week.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The plaintiffs contend that the case should have been submitted to the jury and argue that the jury could find that (a) when the goods were on Quality\u2019s premises, they were \u201cin the custody of its [Norfolk\u2019s] collecting . . . [agencies\u201d] <em>; </em>and (b) the goods were \u201cin transit\u201d while on Quality\u2019s premises; and, therefore, on either ground were within the coverage of the policy. We disagree. The interpretation of the contract was for the judge to decide. <em>Ober </em>v. <em>National Cas. Co. </em>318 Mass. 27, 30, and cases cited. <em>Forte </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>336 Mass. 476, 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">If equivocal language is used in a contract of insurance such language is to be construed against the insurer. <em>August A. Busch &amp; Co. of Mass. Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>339 Mass. 239, 243, and cases cited. When, however, the words are plain and free from ambiguity they must be construed in their usual and ordinary sense. <em>Ober </em>v. <em>National Cas. Co. </em>318 Mass. 27, 30. <em>Forte </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>336 Mass. 476, 480, and cases cited. We perceive no ambiguity in the contract. It must be enforced according to its terms. <em>Hiller </em>v. <em>Submarine Signal Co. </em>325 Mass. 546, 550, and eases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The clause \u201cin the custody of its collecting agencies\u201d in context clearly means \u201cin charge of one who collects for and on behalf of Norfolk\u201d. The parties contemplated the relationship of principal and agent between Norfolk and the collector. The only collecting done by Norfolk was done by Sherman. Quality, an \u201centirely independent\u201d company, was not a collecting agent of Norfolk when it picked up the goods in bulk at Norfolk but rather was an independent contractor acting on its own behalf pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>to its contractual obligation \"with Norfolk to clean or launder the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">As to the second point we think it is an unreasonable construction of the contract to say that the goods, while on Quality\u2019s premises, were <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018in transit. \u2019 \u2019 The various meanings of the phrase \u201cin transit\u201d were discussed in <em>Koshland </em>v. <em>Columbia Ins. Co. </em>237 Mass. 467, 472-477, and need not be repeated. It is sufficient to say that the goods were not at Quality\u2019s premises as a part of or incident to transportation. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Mannheim Ins. Co. </em>237 Mass. 477, 481. They were there for the accomplishment of the very purpose for which they had been given to Norfolk by its</p>\n<p id=\"AnM\">customers. Moreover, to hold that the goods were in transit while on Quality\u2019s premises would make specific provisions of the coverage clauses meaningless. An interpretation which gives a reasonable meaning to all of the provisions of a contract is to be preferred to one which leaves a part useless or inexplicable. <em>Crimmins &amp; Peirce Co. </em>v. <em>Kidder Peabody Acceptance Corp. </em>282 Mass. 367, 375. <em>Edmund Wright Ginsberg Corp. </em>v. <em>C. D. Kepner Leather Co. </em>317 Mass. 581, 587. The obvious design of the policy was to insure the goods when they were (a) on named premises or on other premises subject to the control of Norfolk or (b) in movement or transit under Norfolk\u2019s control between such premises and the customer. Neither of these provisions would have been necessary if the construction argued by the plaintiffs had been intended. Simple blanket coverage would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Since the result is that the goods were not covered when on Quality\u2019s premises, it is unnecessary to discuss proof of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
