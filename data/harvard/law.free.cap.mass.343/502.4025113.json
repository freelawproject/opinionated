Ord. c. 41, \u00a7 1, which provides for a \u201cdirector of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>public works who shall exercise the powers of the city manager under . . . [his] direction ... in the administration and operation of the\u201d highway, water and sewer, and engineering departments \u201cand in matters involving public works in other departments.\u201d Section 2 provides that the \u201cdirector . . . shall be appointed by, and may be removed by the city manager; his appointment shall not be subject to\u201d G-. L. c. 31. Medford has a Plan E charter. See G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 93 et seq., as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Prior to his employment as director, Welch, a veteran of World War I, had been employed by the Commonwealth, the city of Somerville, and the town of Reading for more than twenty-nine years in employment classified as Group A under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (2) (g), as amended through St. 1954, c. 445, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He had been a member of the contributory retirement system within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16, as amended through St. 1956, c. 422, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">On August 17, 1956, Welch, aged fifty-five, applied to the then city manager, one Shurtleff, for retirement, \u201cat his own request, with the approval of the retiring authority,\u201d under G. L. e. 32, \u00a7 58 (as amended through St. 1950, c. 668, \u00a73) as a \u201cveteran who has been in the [public] service . . . for a total period of thirty years in the aggregate. \u2019 \u2019 Shurt-leff disapproved the request on September 5, 1956. No question based upon this disapproval has been argued. Cf. <em>Murphy </em>v. Boston, 337 Mass. 560, 564-565. Shortly thereafter Shurtleff indicated to Welch his dissatisfaction with Welch\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">On October 31,1956, Shurtleff asked for Welch\u2019s resignation and notified him that he would be removed on November 19 in the absence of a resignation. On November 19, 1956, Shurtleff notified the city council that Welch was to be removed from his employment, effective at midnight. On November 23, 1956, Welch resubmitted his petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>retirement to the then acting city manager. Shurtleff was then under suspension and was removed as city manager on December 11, 1956. On January 4, 1957, one Kennedy was appointed city manager. He appointed one Ellis as director. Ellis is still serving in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">On April 29, 1957, Welch wrote to the Medford contributory retirement board asking for a public hearing under GL L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), as amended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Related provisions of \u00a7 16<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are described in the margin. No hearing before the Medford contributory retirement board<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has been given to Welch. Welch has received no pay since November 19, 1956. Up to that date, he paid to the Medford contributory retirement fund the payments determined in accordance with the applicable statutes. These payments, from June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>6, 1954, to November 19,1956, were accepted and added to the fund theretofore established by Welch from his earlier employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">On June 14, 1957, Welch claimed an appeal to the contributory retirement appeal board and requested a hearing under c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4), see footnote 5, <em>supra. </em>The city filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, which was granted by the appeal board on February 2,1959. The motion was heard on a statement of agreed facts in which the foregoing facts appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Welch then filed this petition under Gr. L. c. 30A (the State Administrative Procedure Act) for review of the appeal board\u2019s action. A judge -of the Superior Court ruled that under Gr. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 104 and 105, Shurtleff \u201cwas within his rights in removing . . . [Welch] on November 19,1956, and that his employment with . . . Medford terminated on that day.\u201d He further ruled that, if Welch\u2019s \u201crights were violated[,] his remedy was by a petition of review in the [D]istrict [C]ourt . . . under\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a716 (3), see footnote 5, <em>supra. </em>Welch has appealed from a final decree dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Welch contends that the provisions of c. 32, \u00a7 16, are controlling and that, accordingly, because of Shurtleff\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 16 (2), Welch was not removed on November 19, 1956. The other parties contend that the provisions of Gr. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 104, 105, and of Medford Eev. Ord. c. 41, \u00a7 2, are to be given predominant effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">General Laws c. 43, \u00a7 104, provides, among other things, that the city manager (under the Plan E form of municipal government, see St. 1938, c. 378) shall \u201csupervise the administration of the affairs of the city\u201d and that he \u201cshall make all appointments and removals in the departments . . . and offices of the city . . . and shall perform such other duties as may be . . . required of him by ordinance. \u201d Section 105 provides in part that \u201c[s]uch officers ... as the city council, with the advice of the city manager, shall determine are necessary for the proper administration of the departments . . . and offices of the city for whose ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ministration the city manager is responsible shall be appointed, and may be removed, by the city manager.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The ordinance states that the director of public works is to \u201cexercise the powers of the city manager\u201d with respect to certain city departments and to certain matters involving public works. This clearly is an office \u201cfor whose administration the city manager is responsible\u201d within c. 43, \u00a7 105. In view of the provision of \u00a7 2 of the ordinance that the appointment of the director of public works shall not be subject to Gr. L. c. 31, we think that Welch was subject to removal at the pleasure of the city manager under c. 43, \u00a7 105, unless Gk L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), as amended, see footnote 4, <em>supra, </em>required that the city manager conform to the procedures set out in that section. There is no indication in the record that any official of Medford has given any notice of Welch\u2019s removal to the Medford contributory retirement board or any notice to Welch purporting to be pursuant to c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>City Manager of Haverhill, </em>330 Mass. 14, 17-19, we decided that a Plan D charter provision, closely resembling the Medford Plan E charter provision found in \u00a7 105, controls \u201cthe entire subject of removals of those in the service of the city,\u201d at least in respect of offices not subject to Gr. L. c. 31.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We said (p. 18), \u201cNowhere ... in the charter where the power of removal is conferred upon the city manager is there . . . any indication that it is to be limited in any way except as to persons in the classified civil service.\u201d It was held that Gr. L. c. 39, \u00a7 8A, inserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>by St. 1950, c. 132, \u00a7 1 (authorizing removals of council appointees for cause after public hearing) had no application to Haverhill\u2019s charter (see G-. L. c. 43, \u00a7 90), under which (pp. 17-18) \u201cfull and plenary power to make . . . [certain] appointments and removals . . . ha[d] been conferred upon the city manager in order to secure effective administration of those branches for which the city manager is responsible.\u201d It was pointed out (pp. 18-19), \u201cNowhere is it . . . stated that the removal must be for cause .... The only . . . duty . . . [of] the city manager with reference to [such] removals ... is to report them to the council. . . . He acquired a general power of removal . . . from the express terms of the . . . charter . . ..\u201d Cf. <em>City Manager of Medford </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn. </em>329 Mass. 323, 324-329. Cf. also <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>300 Mass. 244, 245-247; <em>Essex County Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>342 Mass. 322, 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The <em>Williams </em>case thus strongly indicates that the city manager at his pleasure could remove Welch, a key official not protected by civil service. The following considerations lead us to conclude that this power, even in respect of a long term member of a contributory retirement system, is not affected by c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), (3), and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">(1) In considering the specific charter provisions of c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 104 and 105, together with the general provisions of c. 32, \u00a7 16, weight must be given to the principle that \u201cstrong terms are required to show a legislative intent to supersede by a general act a special act which \u2018may be made in regard to a place, growing out of its peculiar wants, condition, and circumstances.\u2019 City charters are essentially [such] special enactments designed to provide for the particular needs of the various cities.\u201d See <em>Haffner </em>v. <em>Director of Pub. Safety of Lawrence, </em>329 Mass. 709, 714. See also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>City Manager of Haverhill, </em>330 Mass. 14,17.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">(2) If c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), operates as a limitation upon c. 43, \u00a7 105, then the local retirement board may reappraise, perhaps long after the event, whether a removal of a principal assistant by a city manager \u201cwas justified.\u201d The plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>language of \u00a7 105 seems to contemplate giving immediate effect to the removal and complete freedom of action by the city manager. Cf. <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., ante, </em>202, 205-206. Cf. also <em>Davis </em>v. <em>School C</em>o<em>mm</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Even if we were to assume that \u00a7 16 (2) has application to Welch\u2019s removal by the city manager, any review by the local board whether the removal \u201cwas justified\u201d could not be a broad one. It would not be an examination \u2018 \u2018 de novo \u2019 \u2019 of the propriety of the removal. Cf. a review of a removal for specified causes, as in Gr. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A (inserted by St. 1958, c. 462). Cf. also Gr. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42 (as amended through St. 1956, c. 132, \u00a7 2); <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 615-616. It is hard to see how any review under c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), of a removal at pleasure under c. 43, \u00a7 105, could result in reinstatement unless, perhaps, the local board could determine that the city manager\u2019s reasons, if any, stated for removal were nothing more than gross subterfuge. Cf. <em>Simonian </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy. </em>342 Mass. 573, 583. The extremely narrow scope of the only conceivable review indicates that no review at all under \u00a7 16 (2) was contemplated, as we decided in <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., ante, </em>202, 205-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">(3) Chapter 32, \u00a7 16 (5), as amended through St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, reads in part, \u201cThe provisions of this section [\u00a7 16] relative to the right of any member to a hearing or to the right of review by the district court shall not apply in the case of the removal ... of any state official or of any official of any political subdivision of the commonwealth for which provision is otherwise made in any general or special law, anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Chapter 43, \u00a7 105, is a section of a gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>eral law, made specifically applicable to Medford (and therefore, in a sense, the equivalent of a special law), in which a removal \u201cprovision is otherwise made.\u201d Section 16 (5), literally construed, would deprive an \u201cofficial\u201d (1) of any right to a hearing under \u00a7 16 (2) before the retirement board with respect to a removal (as distinguished from other forms of retirements, cf. <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>338 Mass. 628, 633), and also (2) of any review by the District Court under \u00a7 16 (3). See footnote 5, <em>supra. </em>Welch\u2019s position would seem to be of sufficient importance to come within the ambiguous term \u201cofficial,\u201d as used in \u00a7 16 (5), which appears to be more restricted in meaning than the term \u201cemployee,\u201d which is defined in c. 32, \u00a7 1. See McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed.) ^ 12.30,12.32,12.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The possible hardship to a long term member (not protected by civil service) of a retirement system in a Plan E city, (if he is held to have no rights to a hearing and review of his removal under c. 32, \u00a7 16,) and various new contentions made in the present case, have led us to reexamine what was very recently decided in <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., ante, </em>202, 205-206. There we decided that c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), \u201chas no application to\u201d the removal of principal deputies and assistants of the commissioner of insurance under G-. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 26, \u00a7 7. That section provides that the \u201ccommissioner . . . may appoint and remove, with the approval of the governor and council, a first deputy\u201d and certain other specified officials. We discuss various contentions made in Welch\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">(1) It is argued that, if the Legislature had intended to exclude noncivil service appointees of a Plan E city manager from the operation of c. 32, \u00a7 16, it would have done so expressly. This has been done in effect by \u00a7 16 (5) and, in any event, in view of the <em>Williams </em>case, 330 Mass. 14, the charter provision of c. 43, \u00a7 105, is controlling rather than c. 32, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">(2) It is argued that if an official like Welch can be removed under c. 43, \u00a7 105, without compliance with c. 32, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u00a7 16, then logic compels the conclusion that a civil service employee can be so removed without compliance with G-. L. c. 31. Chapter 43, \u00a7 105, provides that \u201cappointments by . . . the city manager, if subject to chapter thirty-one . . . shall be made in accordance therewith.\u201d This language may indicate sufficiently that, despite \u00a7 105, removals of civil service employees are to be subject to c. 31. In any event, in the light of the importance given to the protective policy of the civil service laws (see <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>300 Mass. 244, 246), we would be slow to treat statutory provisions for the removal of officials without a hearing as depriving civil service employees of the protection afforded by G-. L. c. 31 in the absence of explicit legislative language requiring such an interpretation. We think, however, that \u00a7 16 (5) has application in a case like the present one where the removal does not relate to a civil service employee. Indeed, one reason for the use of the word \u201cofficial\u201d in \u00a7 16 (5) may have been to limit the application of \u00a7 16 (5) to key officers (not under civil service) of the State and its subdivisions, leaving subject to \u00a716 (2) employees protected by civil service and also teachers. For the purposes of this case, we need decide no more than that \u00a7 16 (5) deprives an official without civil service protection, when removed under e. 43, \u00a7 105, of the benefits of a hearing, and review by the District Court, in accordance with \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">(3) It is suggested that the hearing and District Court review, provided in \u00a7 16 (2) and \u00a7 16 (3), respectively, are the only features of \u00a7 16 which \u00a7 16 (5) makes inapplicable to removals under c. 43, \u00a7 105. It is then contended (a) that, under \u00a7 16 (2), the city manager must still submit to the focal retirement board a fair summary of the facts upon which removal is based, and (b) that, upon the basis of this summary, the local board must determine whether the removal was \u201cjustified,\u201d even if it be assumed that \u00a7 16 (5) precludes any hearing at the request of the removed official and prevents the board from disputing the facts stated by the city manager as the basis of his action. This is too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>narrow a view of the effect of \u00a7 16 (5) which we construe as excluding removals under \u00a7 105 from the scope of \u00a7 16. The provisions in \u00a7 16 (2) for notice to the hoard, and the related provisions of \u00a7 16 (1), seem to us to relate only to the hearing before the local board, where one is permitted as in the case of an involuntary retirement, and to any subsequent review by the District Court. To such a hearing and review, by the specific terms of \u00a7 16 (5), an official removed under c. 43, \u00a7 105, is not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">(4) It is argued that, if \u00a7 16 (2) does not apply to removals under c. 43, \u00a7 105, then a long term system member may be deprived of benefits under c. 32, \u00a7 10, payable upon his removal, because of his inability to establish, in the absence of a statement under \u00a7 16 (2) by the city manager of the grounds of removal, that the removal is not based upon \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d No suggestion could be made on the facts of this case that Welch was removed for moral turpitude. We thus now have no occasion to consider how the presence or absence of \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 10 can be established by a removed retirement fund member to whom \u00a7 16 (2) is not applicable, or whether \u00a7 16 (2) and \u00a7 16 (3) \u201cdefine the only way in which . . . [it] can be established.\u201d See <em>Essex County Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>342 Mass. 322, 324-325.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">(5) It is argued that our decision in <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Springfield, </em>331 Mass. 738, requires us to hold that \u00a7 16 (2) is applicable to Welch\u2019s removal. In the <em>Duncan </em>case, and in <em>O\u2019Day </em>v. <em>School Comm. of West Brookfield, ante, </em>122, it was assumed (in cases which arose prior to the enactment of Gr. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, by St. 1958, c. 462) that \u00a7 16 (2) would be applicable in the event of the dismissal of a teacher under G-. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42, as then in effect, which gave to school committees broad powers to dismiss teachers for reasons specified in the statute. At least two answers can be made to this suggestion, (a) Chapter 32, \u00a7 16 (5), makes \u00a7 16 as a whole inapplicable only to removals \u201cof any <em>official </em>of any political subdivision . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>for which provision is otherwise made\u201d (emphasis supplied). Section 16 (5) also provides that nothing in \u00a7 16 shall \u201cimpair any right of any <em>teacher\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) under c. 71. There is thus some differentiation in \u00a7 16 (5) between an \u201cofficial\u201d and a \u201cteacher\u201d which suggests that \u00a7 16 (5) does not exclude teachers from the application of \u00a7 16. (b) The dismissal of a teacher upon a ground stated in c. 71, \u00a7 42, presents a substantive issue (viz., whether the ground in fact exists) reasonably adapted to an independent review. On the other hand, under the unrestricted power of removal given by c. 43, \u00a7 105, there is no substantial issue appropriate for independent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">(6) It is argued that Medford is estopped to deny that Welch is entitled to the protection of \u00a7 16 because Medford accepted payments by Welch to the Medford contributory retirement fund from June 6, 1954, to November 19, 1956. These payments gave Welch some advantages. In the event of involuntary retirement under \u00a7 16 (1), or of a voluntary retirement under c. 32, \u00a7 5, or of a retirement for disability (see \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7), Welch would have received benefits from his membership. He may make also claim for benefits under c. 32, \u00a7 10, based upon his removal. We think that Medford is not estopped to deny that Welch had benefits and rights under \u00a7\u00a7 16 (2), (3), and (4), which c. 32 does not in fact give him. See the somewhat analogous question discussed in <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>338 Mass. 704, 709, and <em>Weiner </em>v. Boston, 342 Mass. 67, 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">We follow the <em>Began </em>case and hold that Welch\u2019s removal was not subject to the provisions of c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\"> After November, 1956, \u00a7 3 (2) (g) was further amended, especially by St. 1958, e. 321, \u00a7 3, which, among other things, changed the name of Group A to Group 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\"> See amendments after 1956 by St. 1958, c. 321, \u00a7\u00a7 19-22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em> </em>General Laws e. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), as amended by St. 1951, e. 784, \u00a7 2, provides, \u201c (2) The removal ... of any member in service classified in . . .
