It was stipulated, after the plaintiff\u2019s opening, \u201cthat the issue to be determined ... is whether . . . the pilot, 'Paul Sriberg [not the insured], had the requisite number of hours of flying time as set forth in the policy.\u201d A jury returned a verdict for the insured. The case is here upon the company\u2019s exceptions to the admission of certain evidence, to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to revise a \u201cpreliminary finding as to the availability of a [certain] logbook\u201d of Sriberg, and to the judge\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict for the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The policy covered a Beech Bonanza G-35. Declaration numbered 5 of the policy provided, \u201cThe [a]ircraft will be operated only by the following . . . any currently certificated private pilot or commercial pilot possessing not less than 250 hours total flying time and approved by the insured.\u201d By rider attached to the policy, this was amended to read, \u201cGeorge A. Schroeder [the insured] and/or any duly certificated private pilot or better licensed by the Civil Aeronautics Administration who has at least 250 hours total flying time 25 hours of which have been in Beech Model 35 aircraft.\u201d The final paragraph of item 3 of the \u201cGeneral Conditions\u201d of the policy reads in part, \u201cClaims must be made separately for each section, each accident and each aircraft and must be supported by the exhibit as often as required, and at any reasonable time during the currency of this policy or thereafter, of aircraft or insured property or remains thereof and of logbooks, one each for pilot, airplane and engine, kept in order as required by Federal Regulations . .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Item 15 of the \u201cGeneral Conditions\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>defines \u201cFlight \u2014\u25a0 The period from the start of actual takeoff run, while in the air and until completion of landing run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Before evidence was offered, Sriberg was examined in the absence of the jury to determine whether the trial judge would admit secondary evidence of the contents of a logbook or logbooks said to have been lost. There was testimony that one logbook \u201cjust disappeared.\u201d Another was \u2018 \u2018destroyed by one of . . . [Sriberg\u2019s] children\u201d and thereafter thrown away. The judge ruled that <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>secondary evidence ... as to the number of hours\u201d flown by Sriberg prior to the accident might be received. Such evidence was received as to hours flown and \u201crecorded in this . . . logbook that . . . [Sriberg] lost . . . and the logbook . . . destroyed by his small child.\u201d Thereafter, subject to the company\u2019s exception, other evidence was admitted about Sriberg\u2019s flying time, through the testimony of Sriberg and of others, without clear indication that it was testimony about Sriberg\u2019s flying time as entered in any logbook which was no longer available. Indeed, subject to the company\u2019s exception, the judge asked Sriberg, \u201c [A]t the time this accident occurred in December, 1957, how many actual flying hours had you flown?\u201d To this Sriberg replied that \u201ca minimum of 294 hours is the best I can answer that . . ..\u201d The evidence on the issue was somewhat conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Secondary evidence clearly was admissible of the contents of those logbooks, which the trial judge had found (by preliminary findings) had been lost or were no longer available. <em>Fauci </em>v. <em>Mulready, </em>337 Mass. 532, 539-542. We think, however, that the policy did not restrict proof of Sriberg\u2019s flying time to that recorded in a logbook. The only reference to logbooks relied upon is that of the final paragraph of item 3 of the \u201cGeneral Conditions\u201d already quoted. This we interpret merely as requiring (at the request of the insurer) presentation of available logbooks in support of claims. It does not specifically preclude proof of flying time by evidence other than the contents of logbooks. If only this special method of proof of flying time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>was to be permitted and if production of logbooks showing flying time was to be a condition precedent to any recovery, then an explicit provision to that effect should have been made in the rider or elsewhere in the policy. Any such provision also should have been made expressly applicable to the rider provision limiting operation of the aircraft to pilots with stated hours of flying experience.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we apply the principle that \u201cevery doubt is to be resolved against the insurer and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Lustenberger </em>v. <em>Boston Cas. Co. </em>300 Mass. 130, 134-135. See <em>Insurance Co. of No. America </em>v. <em>Newtowne Mfg. Co. </em>187 F. 2d 675, 682, 684 (1st Cir.). Cf. <em>Woogmaster </em>v. <em>Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Ins. Co. Ltd. </em>312 Mass. 479, 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">There was no prejudicial error in admitting testimony that \u201ca pilot who has reached a certain level of skill and who is not going to go on, generally does not keep a logbook because he doesn\u2019t need to prove his time . . ..\u201d This evidence could reasonably be admitted as giving assistance in the interpretation of the somewhat ambiguous contract provision with respect to logbooks, for it tended to show the practices as to logbooks of those private aircraft pilots and users to whom policies of this type would apply. See <em>LaCouture </em>v. <em>Renaud, </em>325 Mass. 33, 36-37. See also <em>Gainsboro </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>339 Mass. 1, 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">There was in the policy no provision for the production of logbooks to prove hours of flying time at all comparable to the explicit provision imposing a condition precedent to the payment of a loss, considered in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. co. </em>112 Mass. 49. See <em>Hebert </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>191 Mass. 403, 413. See also <em>Constantino </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Acc. Co. </em>221 Mass. 464, 467-468. Cf. a requirement of proof of a particular type of loss, as in <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>329 Mass. 301, 303-304. We are not prepared to construe the policy provision about logbooks as requiring a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>method of proving a pilot\u2019s flying time, where no clear policy language so provides. The production of logbooks for any other purpose is not here in question in view of the agreement as to \u201cthe issue to be determined\u201d already mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Similarly, we see no reason to construe \u201cflying time,\u201d as used in the policy and the rider, as the equivalent of the defined term \u201cflight.\u201d We think that the definition of \u201cflight\u201d relates to that word as used in the schedule of coverage. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>172 F. Supp. 241, 243-244 (D. Mass.); <em>James </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co. 5 N. J. </em>21, 25-27. The definition of \u201cflight\u201d has no necessary application to the different terms \u201cflying time\u201d or \u201cflight time,\u201d the latter of which is defined in relevant regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Board as \u201cthe total time from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power for the purpose of flight until the moment it comes to rest at the end of the flight.\u201d 14 C. F. B. (1956) \u00a7 20.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In any event, upon the evidence, the jury were warranted in finding that Sriberg had accumulated the necessary flying time, not only 250 hours in aircraft of all types, but also twenty-five hours in aircraft of the type involved in the accident. The jury were not required to believe this evidence, but the arguments against admitting it advanced by the insurance company (e.g. that the time certain aircraft were flown by Sriberg \u201ccannot be checked\u201d or that the use of planes was unreliably measured by tachometer, see <em>Banaghan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>340 Mass. 73, 75) went to weight of the evidence rather than to its sufficiency. Upon the admissible oral testimony there was evidence which required submitting the case to the jury upon the issue left open by the stipulation. A directed verdict was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">There was no error in excluding questions in cross-examination relating to matters not within the limited issue to be tried in accordance with the stipulation. See <em>Supreme Coat Co. </em>v. <em>Lyon Warehouse &amp; Distrib. Co. </em>332 Mass. 505, 506-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\"> The paragraph also requires \u201cthe exhibit at such reasonable place as may be designated by the [i]nsurer for the purpose of making extracts or copies or otherwise of all books of accounts, bills, invoices or other vouchers, or certified copies thereof if originals be lost. The [i]nsured shall further submit to examination under oath by any person or persons named by the [ijnsurer and subscribe the same.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> Relevant Federal regulations do little to shed additional light upon the final paragraph of item 3 of the \u201cGeneral <em>Conditions.\u2019\u2019 </em>These regulations indicate that flying time recorded in logbooks is required to establish certain qualifications for particular categories of flight referred to in the regulations.
