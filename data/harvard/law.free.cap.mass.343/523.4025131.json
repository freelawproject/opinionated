The accident occurred in Arlington on November 30,1958. The writ is dated March 26, 1959. Subsequently, the Legislature enacted St. 1959, c. 259, amending G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9, entitled, \u201cAn Act providing that the failure to register or the improper registration of a motor vehicle shall not he deemed to render the vehicle a nuisance or to render any person a trespasser upon a way.\u201d This was intended as an abolition of the rule of <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Northampton St. Ry. </em>202 Mass. 443. See <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>333 Mass. 768; Thirty-Third Report of the Judicial Council (1957), Pub. Doc. 144, pp. 13-17; Thirty-Fourth Report of the Judicial Council (1958), Pub. Doc. 144, pp. 91-93. However unsound, that rule settled the substantive rights of the parties. See <em>Bucher </em>v. <em>Fitchburg R.R. </em>131 Mass. 156,158. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>no express mandate to make St. 1959, c. 259, retrospective, and no such intention appears by necessary implication. <em>Hanscom </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>220 Mass. 1, 3. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Mayor of Taunton, ante, </em>485, 487-488. Hence, the amendment is confined to prospective operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
