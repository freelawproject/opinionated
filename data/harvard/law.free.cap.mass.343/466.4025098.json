L. c. 41, \u00a7 810. On February 8, 1960, the plaintiff submitted a preliminary plan, \u00a7 81S, and on February 19, a definitive plan. On April 18, the board disapproved the definitive plan on two grounds, (1) because there had been no final approval of the suitability of the land by the board of health, and (2) because the plan did not conform to the zoning by-law adopted by the town. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the decision of the planning board under \u00a7 81BB.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">It was stipulated that the board, acting under the provisions of Gr. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, on February 4 and 11, 1960, caused the text and map of a proposed zoning by-law to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>published in a newspaper of general circulation in \"Whitman; that on February 25 the board held a public hearing on the proposal; and that at a town meeting on March 4 the town adopted the proposed by-law substantially unchanged. On March 24 the by-law was approved by the Attorney General, and it was duly posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">This by-law appears to have amended an existing zoning by-law and the judge of the Superior Court ruled that it \u201cwas not \u2018the zoning ordinance or by-law in <em>effect </em>at the time of the submission of the preliminary plan,\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied), namely, February 8,1960. He entered a final decree that \u201cthe decision of the planning board . . . was beyond the authority of the said planning board because the proposed zoning by-law, upon which disapproval was based was not in effect at the time of the submission of the preliminary plan. \u2019 \u2019 The planning board has appealed from the decree to this court. It argues only the validity of its second ground for disapproval of the plaintiff\u2019s plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Section 7A of c. 40A, as appearing in St. 1959, c. 221, provided that the preliminary and definitive plans of a proposed subdivision \u201cshall be governed by the zoning ordinance or by-law in effect at the time of the submission of the preliminary plan.\u201d The proposed by-law was not in effect when the plaintiff\u2019s preliminary plan was submitted since it had not been adopted by the town meeting. Compare <em>Doliner </em>v. <em>Planning Board of Millis, ante, </em>1. It was therefore error to disapprove the plan on the ground that it did not conform to the provisions of that by-law. The plaintiff was entitled to a decision governed by the zoning by-law then in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
