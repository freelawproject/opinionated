The final decree also ordered the defendants to remove a chain link fence and all other obstructions in the driveway and enjoined them from placing obstructions in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The litigation has been unduly prolonged because of the failure of the master to do his duty. Three successive orders of recommittal were necessary because, apart from a failure to comply with formal requirements as to notice to parties (see Bule 90 of the Superior Court [1954]), there was a failure to find the facts. Instead there was a recital of the testimony given by the several witnesses followed by a general conclusion. As finally confirmed, the report mainly consists of a recital of testimony but it is coupled with a statement by the master that he finds the testimony set forth to be true and reports it as constituting the material facts of the case. This procedure emphatically does not have our approval. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Noone, </em>341 Mass. 488, 490-491. In the particular circumstances, however, because the testimony on the issue of prescription is not conflicting and because it has not been controverted by the defendants, we are able to decide the case. Doubtless the same considerations prompted the judge to enter the decree and thus avoid further delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The order of reference did not authorize the master to report the evidence and there was no request for a summary of evidence as provided in Bule 90 of the Superior Court (1954). Accordingly, the master\u2019s findings must be accepted as final, unless they are mutually inconsistent or plainly wrong. <em>Peabody Gas &amp; Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of N. Y. </em>284 Mass. 87, 88. See <em>Sheppard Envelope Co. </em>v. <em>Arcade Malleable Iron Co. </em>335 Mass. 180,184-185.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The defendants contend that the findings are inconsistent in a particular which we shall discuss after summarizing the facts found. The plaintiffs and the defendants own adjoining lots on Summer Street in Lynn. A strip of land eleven to twelve feet wide separates the houses on the lots. The distance from the plaintiffs\u2019 house to the boundary line is seven and one half feet. Mrs. Brewer, a witness, lived in and owned the plaintiffs\u2019 house continuously from 1927 to 1949. \u201cHer husband owned automobiles during the whole period from 1927 to 1949, and . . . drove said motor vehicles on the strip . . . during that whole period of time.\u201d From 1935 on Mrs. Brewer herself drove an automobile on the strip between the two houses although \u201cshe never thought anything about driving in over [it]\u201d and \u201cby looking she could not determine where the end of the property line could be\u201d; \u201cshe didn\u2019t do it deliberately, but . . . \u2018there was nothing to stop us,\u2019 and they couldn\u2019t avoid it.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In 1949 the Brewers sold the property to the Mosleys who also drove over the strip to reach the garage. The plaintiffs bought from the Mosleys in 1950 and drove over the strip until June, 1954, when the defendants erected a chain link fence on the boundary line.. The areaway thereby became too narrow for passage by automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The defendants who bought their property in 1948 did not protest the use of the strip by the plaintiffs until 1952. The master concluded that \u201cthe plaintiffs and the[ir] predecessors in title have used a portion of the land of the defendants openly for a period of more than twenty years to drive motor vehicles into and out of the garage owned by the plaintiffs,\u201d that \u201cMo protest was ever made to the Flynns or their predecessors in title from 1927 to 1952 by the owners of the defendants\u2019 premises concerning the use of land owned by the defendants or their predecessors,\u201d and that the \u201cuse was open and notorious and continuous and under a claim of right,\u201d and covered an area to within three feet of the defendants\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The sole basis of the defendants\u2019 appeal is that the specific finding that Mrs. Brewer \u201cdidn\u2019t . . . deliberately\u201d drive over the strip, owned by the defendants is inconsistent with the finding that the use by the plaintiffs and their predecessors was \u201cunder a claim of right.\u201d This contention is of importance only if Mrs. Brewer\u2019s use is necessary to establish continuity in the adverse use. For the purpose of disposing of the contention we assume that Mrs. Brewer\u2019s use' is necessary to establish the continuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In <em>Truc </em>v. <em>Field, </em>269 Mass. 524, 528-529 (quoted in <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Poch, </em>321 Mass. 321, 324), it was said: \u201cThe rule in Massachusetts is that wherever there has been the use of an easement for twenty years unexplained, it wall be presumed to be under claim of right and adverse, and will be sufficient to establish title by prescription . . . unless controlled or explained.\u201d This court recently has stated: \u201cActs undeniably may evidence an intent to claim as of right, <em>Shoer </em>v. <em>Daffe, </em>337 Mass. 420, 423, and the physical facts of entry and continued possession may themselves evidence an intent to occupy and to hold as of right sufficient in law to support the acquisition of rights by prescription. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>324 Mass. 450, 454. That the uncommunicated mental attitude of the possessor is irrelevant where his acts import an adverse character to his holding is shown by cases involving disputed bound-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ari.es where the possessor intends to hold without intending to deprive any other of what is rightfully his. In <em>Van Allen </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>239 Mass. 571, a boundary case, the possessor was held to have acquired rights by prescription to a strip of land despite her statement to the plaintiff \u2018I do not want anything not belonging to me.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ottavia </em>v. <em>Savarese, </em>338 Mass. 330, 334. See Restatement: Property, \u00a7 458, comment on clause (a). We are of the opinion that, despite Mrs. Brewer\u2019s statement subsequently made, that \u201cshe didn\u2019t do it deliberately,\u201d her actual use of the strip for fourteen years without permission of the true owner constitutes a claim of right in accordance with the principle stated. See Am. Law of Property, \u00a7 15.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The case of <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Roosevelt, Inc. </em>258 Mass. 494, relied upon by the defendants, is distinguishable in that the master made findings to rebut the presumption of claim of right. See <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Poch, </em>321 Mass. 321, 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The interlocutory decree is affirmed. The final decree is affirmed with costs of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\"> The master\u2019s report is ambiguous on the point of the witness\u2019s marriage. He found that \"her husband\u201d (singular) used the strip from 1927 to 1949. When she bought the house in 1927 she was Mrs. Magg. When she sold it in 1949 she was Mrs. Brewer. Obviously the master meant each of her successive husbands. Only if she was unmarried between 1932 and 1935 could there be a gap in the continuity of use. In any event the master has found that the adverse use was continuous from 1927. Inasmuch as the evidence is not reported we must accept this as true, and the ambiguity mentioned does not affect the result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
