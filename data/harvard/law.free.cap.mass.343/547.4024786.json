After the filing of his report, the parties stipulated \u201cthat the auditor\u2019s report will be accepted as an agreed statement of facts, subject to . . . [certain] additions, modifications, and amendments.\u201d They also agreed that if, under the contract, <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> \u2018 </em>Construction was to do the work of sheeting and shoring, then the finding should be in favor of Yespa; if Yespa was to do the sheeting and shoring, then the finding should be in favor of Construction.\u201d The cases were tried by a judge in the Superior Court, without jury, \u201cupon the agreed facts.\u201d Both parties submitted requests for rulings of law. The judge \u201cfound\u201d for Construction in each case and, in the case brought by Construction, assessed its damages at $1,530.46. The case is here on Yespa\u2019s exceptions to the findings and to the granting and denial of vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ous requests for rulings. The facts are stated from the auditor\u2019s report as augmented.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In 1956, Vespa was laying sewer pipe under a contract with the town of Framingham. It became necessary to place the pipe and its casing under an aqueduct. Vespa approached Construction to do the work,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Construction offered to \u201ctake over the entire work that Vespa was to do in this segment [of the whole sewer job] \u2014 for . . . $5,000 . . .. Vespa refused this offer.\u201d Construction then offered for $2,500 \u201cto furnish the equipment and install the casing . . . [if] Vespa was to furnish the labor and materials and dig the required access trench.\u201d Construction submitted a proposal to this effect which in part is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The proposal was on a printed proposal form used by Construction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cVespa told Strickland, Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>struction\u2019s foreman, that he would not sign the contract if he were required to install sheeting and shoring. Strickland thereupon telephoned Van Nest, Construction\u2019s vice president, . . . and . . . repeated Vespa\u2019s objections. . . . Van Nest asked Strickland if Strickland thought sheeting and shoring would be necessary, and Strickland said \u2018no.\u2019 Van Nest then authorized Strickland to strike out the following words in the proposal as originally submitted [the omitted material included the words \u201csheeting and shoring if required\u201d and the other italicized words of the proposal, see footnote 2, supra] .... [B]oth parties initialed the deletions. Thereupon the contract was executed as per copy ...\u201d attached to the auditor\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\u201cShortly after the excavation work had started, water came into the trench in large quantities, causing the sloping sides to slough off and filling the trench so that pumps had to be operated continuously. This condition practically put a stop to the excavation work. Only thirty feet in length were completed and even that part was not fully down to grade. Pumps were supplied by Vespa and operated by Construction. At that point, the town engineer . . . ordered Vespa to put in shoring and sheeting at the aqueduct end of the trench, lest the stability of the aqueduct be affected by . . . erosion .... Vespa demanded that Strickland do the sheeting, but Strickland refused. Vespa thereupon installed some shoring and sheeting at the aqueduct end of the trench and about thirty feet down the sides, but not enough to box in the whole trench. . . . Vespa demanded that Construction pay for it. Construction refused. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">\u201cOver twelve days . . . had elapsed by this time, during which . . . Construction had had its equipment and men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>continuously on the job. The trench was still unfinished and it seemed unlikely that it could be finished at all unless a well-point system was installed. The sheeting used by Vespa . . . had been improperly placed. It failed to hold back either the water or the bank. It was in a state of collapse. Van Nest . . . inspected the work. . . . [H]e ordered Construction\u2019s equipment to be removed, and called off his working force. \u2019 \u2019 Vespa then entered into a contract with another firm to do the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The auditor found that, if there was a breach of contract by Construction, Vespa\u2019s damages were $3,500 and that, if there was a breach by Vespa, <em>\"</em>Construction should be awarded as . . . [the] sum by it expended . . . $1,530'.46 . . . in furnishing equipment and crew.\u201d His conclusions are summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">1. The agreement as to the facts contained in the augmented auditor\u2019s report, which had attached the contract itself, presents a case stated. No evidence was considered by the trial judge. It would have avoided some doubt and confusion if the parties had been explicit in stipulating that they intended to present a case stated. Nevertheless, this is the substance of what they have done. Their agreement was not merely an agreement as to evidence. Cf. <em>King Features Syndicate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Bdcst. Co. Inc. </em>317 Mass. 652, 653. The interpretation of the written contract is, of course, a matter of law. The requests for rulings need not concern us. They have no standing. It was the duty of the trial judge and it is our duty to order the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>judgment on the agreed facts. <em>Richard D. Kimball Co. </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>340 Mass. 727, 728-729.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">2. The interpretation of the contract<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> involves, among other things, the significance, if any, of (a) the deletion of the words \u201csheeting and shoring if required\u201d (see footnote 2, <em>supra, </em>at point [0]); (b) the presence in the proposal of such provisions as those with respect to a trench and a possible well point system (see footnote 2, <em>supra, </em>at points [N] and [P]); and (c) par. (14) of the printed standard proposal provisions (see footnote 3, <em>supra). </em>We consider these matters in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">(a) The deletion of the words \u201csheeting and shoring if required\u201d grew out of Vespa\u2019s refusal to \u201csign the contract if he [Vespa] were required to install sheeting and shoring.\u201d Although it was found that the words were omitted after Construction\u2019s foreman expressed the opinion that no sheeting and shoring \u201cwould be necessary,\u201d the precise reasons and motives for the deletion are not clear from the auditor\u2019s report. Construction may have agreed to the deletion, in part at least, because it was of opinion (a) that the deleted words were unnecessary or redundant, and that the remaining contract provisions adequately protected it, or (b) that they had at least primary reference to the burden of shoring as a safety precaution for workmen which was unlikely to be necessary, and which, perhaps, might be covered by par. (15). See footnote 3, <em>supra. </em>See <em>Fred C. McClean Heating Supplies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jefferson Constr. Co. </em>339 Mass. 356, 363. Even if we assume that the deletion of the omitted words may be used in interpretation as a part of \u201cthe circumstances attending the making of the contract\u201d (see <em>Krinsky </em>v. <em>Leventhal, </em>323 Mass. 160, 161-162 ; cf. <em>Kennon </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>236 Mass. 57, 59), the deletions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>themselves do not point with clarity to any particular interpretation of the remaining provisions. In view of the limited character of the wTork to be done by Construction (see footnote 1, <em>supra) </em>and of par. (14) of the printed provisions (see footnote 3, <em>supra), </em>imposing upon Vespa the obligation of preparing and maintaining the job site, and of Vespa\u2019s obligation (see footnote 2, <em>supra, </em>at point [N]) to provide a trench, we are of opinion that the ambiguous deletion cannot be viewed as creating an affirmative undertaking by Construction to provide sheeting and shoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">(b) Performance by Construction was prevented because \u201cwater came into the trench in large quantities .... This condition practically put a stop to . . . excavation .... Pumps were supplied by Vespa and operated by Construction.\u201d Then, to protect the aqueduct, the town engineer \u201cordered Vespa to put in shoring and sheeting.\u201d The water condition, as the auditor found, would probably prevent the trench from being \u201cfinished . . . unless a well-point system was installed.\u201d Such an installation was the responsibility of Vespa. See footnote 2, <em>supra, </em>at point [P ]. There is no finding by the auditor that\u2018 \u2018 shoring and sheeting\u201d were required to permit Construction to do its work or for any reason other than to protect the aqueduct. The explicit burden placed upon Vespa to install a well point system supports the conclusion that Vespa (and not Construction) was bound by the agreement to put in whatever facilities might become necessary to permit Construction\u2019s work to continue unimpeded, at least by water.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">(c) Paragraph (14)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> imposed on Vespa the duty \u201cto prepare and maintain the job site\u201d so that the work (see footnote 2, <em>supra, </em>at point [L]) could go on continuously. This provision in terms is broad enough to require Vespa to do whatever might become necessary (including any necessary sheeting and shoring) to maintain the job site in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>such condition that the work at no time would be impeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We reach this conclusion without interpreting par. (15) of the printed standard provisions (see footnote 3, <em>supra). </em>Paragraph (15) expressly relieves Construction of the cost of sheeting and shoring to comply with certain New Jersey statutory safety provisions (N. J. Rev. St. Tit. 34, c. 5, \u00a7 21), comparable to those found in Gr. L. c. 149, \u00a7 129A (as amended through St. 1956, c. 431). It thus is unnecessary to consider whether par. (15) has any application either outside of New Jersey or where sheeting and shoring are required for reasons other than to ensure the safety of workmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Since we construe the contract as imposing no affirmative obligation upon Construction to provide sheeting and shoring, it was not bound to pay for that demanded by the town engineer. Vespa\u2019s failure, for twelve days after Construction had its equipment and crew in place, to meet its obligation under par. (14) to put the job site in condition for immediate and continuous work and to complete the trench effectually prevented Construction from performing the contract. This, as the auditor concluded, \u201cjustified Construction in withdrawing its equipment' and crew.\u201d Vespa\u2019s failure was a material prevention of performance by Construction and a breach of a duty imposed upon Vespa by the contract which excused Construction from further performance. See <em>Hanig </em>v. <em>Orton, </em>119 N. J. L. 248, 251-252. See also <em>Nevins </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>320 Mass. 70, 73; <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Marlton Corp. </em>57 N. J. Super. 278, 285; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 947. Vespa\u2019s failure also prevents any recovery by it from Construction, and entitles Construction to its damages caused by the breach. See <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>316 Mass. 413, 416-418; <em>Dale Sys. Inc. </em>v. <em>Wichroski, </em>320 Mass. 319, 322-323; <em>Tanenbaum </em>v. <em>Francisco, </em>110 N. J. L. 599, 604-605. See also <em>Frank Stamato &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Borough of Lodi, </em>4 N. J. 14, 21; Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 269, 295, 312, 315. Cf. <em>Vander Realty Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>334 Mass. 267, 270; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Southgate Park Corp. </em>341 Mass. 534, 537-538.

In view of par.

See <em>Maxwell Shapiro Woolen Co.
