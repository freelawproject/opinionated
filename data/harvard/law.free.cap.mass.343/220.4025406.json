The issue is whether the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct in the operation of a pickup truck could have been found to be a contributing cause of the collision between another truck, operated by Eric Scott, and a convertible driven by Nason\u2019s friend Ronald Perham, in which a mutual friend, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, Oliver W. Nelson, Junior, was a passenger, which resulted in the immediate death of Perham and Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">Direct testimony, and reasonable inferences therefrom, warranted the finding of these facts: On the morning of December 7,1956, in Lincoln Plaza, Worcester, Nason (sixteen years of age), and Nelson left the school bus which had brought them from Boylston and got into Perham\u2019s car to drive back to Boylston. The three were \u201cgoing to play <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>hookey\u201d from school; Perham was to drive Nason to the point in Boylston Center at which he had left his father\u2019s truck; Nason was to drive the truck to Clinton to be repaired; Perham was to bring Nason home from Clinton. Dropping Nason near the truck as planned, Perham, with Nelson beside him, drove toward Clinton on Eoute 70; Nason followed in the truck. At Green\u2019s Orchard on Eoute 70, a mile or two from the point of collision, on a straight stretch of road, the convertible and the truck overtook and passed another automobile, driven by John J. Durkin, Junior, which was traveling at about fifty miles an hour. The speed of the overtaking cars was seventy or seventy-five miles an hour and the front bumper of Nason\u2019s truck was about a foot from the rear bumper of the convertible. The road between Green\u2019s Orchard and the point of collision was winding and hilly and its surface was wet. Just before the collision, which occurred at a curve, Nason\u2019s pickup truck, traveling about sixty miles an hour, passed Scott\u2019s truck, which was traveling in the opposite direction at about thirty-five miles an hour. Nason, coming \u201conto the straightaway . . . seemed to be fighting for control.\u201d As Scott entered the curve about four hundred feet farther along he saw the Perham car coming toward bim at a speed of over seventy miles an hour and at about that instant \u201cit seemed out of control and came into collision\u201d with Scott\u2019s truck. Durkin arrived at the scene of the accident within a minute and a half or two minutes after Perham and Nason had passed him at Green\u2019s Orchard. Nason denied racing, agreeing to race, betting on first arrival, or traveling at more than fifty miles an hour. He testified to overtaking Perham\u2019s ear and another automobile at Green\u2019s Orchard.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Persons who race automobiles on highways are liable in negligence for injuries to others caused by one of them. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>212 Mass. 392, 397. <em>Saisa </em>v. <em>Lilja, </em>76 F. 2d 380 (1st Cir.). <em>Carney </em>v. <em>DeWees, </em>136 Conn. 256, 262-263. <em>Landers </em>v. <em>French\u2019s Ice Cream Co. </em>98 Ga.

(b) knows that the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other . . ..\u201d Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 876. It was reasonable for the jury to infer that Nason\u2019s reckless close pursuit culminating in his passing Perham (at an unobserved but necessarily high speed) was a cause of Perham\u2019s excessive speed within the following moments up to the time of collision. There was evidence of challenge and response in the speed and relative positions of the two automobiles. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>212 Mass. 392, 396. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Northwestern Auto Supply Co. </em>93 Mont. 224, 227-228, 230.
