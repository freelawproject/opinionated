On October 21, 1958, Mrs. Kolikoff called the plaintiff into her place of business to inquire why his wife \u201chad stopped coming to the beauty parlor.\u201d As he was leaving, he opened the door and Mrs. Kolikoff \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>started to ask him, a question. \u2019 \u2019 He turned to answer her and fell. While he was holding the door open, his foot was near the step at the entranceway. The sidewalk in front of the store was at an incline and the step was about five or six inches above the sidewalk. \u201c[T]he step becomes less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>as you move from the north to a southerly direction. \u2019 \u2019 \u201c [T]here was a little incline in the entrance platform which drops towards the sidewalk.\u201d The step was constructed \u201cbefore Mrs. Kolikoff took the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The store was leased to Mrs. Kolikoff beginning March 15, 1958, under a lease which described the demised premises as \u201cthe store with the basement thereunder numbered and known as 1614 Commonwealth Avenue.\u201d Mrs. Koli-koff testified that \u201cshe spoke to Mr. Lushan about the construction of the premises in reference to the grade\u201d; that \u201cshe wanted the grade changed\u201d; and that \u201che was going to correct it for her so it would go directly into the door, because of the unevenness of the concrete.\u201d After the plaintiff\u2019s injury, Lushan, the defendant\u2019s husband, had the step removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Lushan testified that he or the defendant \u201cmanaged and controlled the premises ... at all times from the date of their purchase up to the present time.\u201d He also testified that he first learned of the plaintiff\u2019s injury when he received a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and that he sent the letter to the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">A pre-trial agreement entered into between the parties and read to the jury stated that the defendant\u2019s husband \u201cacted as her agent with respect to the management affairs and control of the property . . ., including, but not limited to, all matters relating to repairs and alterations to and the leasing of the aforementioned premises from the original purchase of the property by Kose Lushan to the present time. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Assuming, without deciding, that the defendant retained control over the entranceway and step, the duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff with respect to those portions of the premises \u201cis that of due care to keep- . . . [them] in such condition as . . . [they were] in, or appeared to be in, at the time of the letting.\u201d <em>Dias </em>v. <em>Woodrow, </em>342 Mass. 218, 221. <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>326 Mass. 177, 179. <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>327 Mass. 287, 290. .</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The defect which the plaintiff complains of appears to be the construction of the entranceway and step with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>to the adjacent sidewalk. There is evidence that the construction was completed prior to Mrs. Kolikoff\u2019s tenancy. There is no evidence of any change in the condition of the entranceway and step during the period between the construction and the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The plaintiff had the burden of proving that the alleged defect did not exist nor appear to exist at the commencement of the tenancy. <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>340 Mass. 336, 338. <em>Dias </em>v. <em>Woodrow, </em>342 Mass. 218, 220. This he failed to do. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In view of the foregoing there is no point in our discussing the other exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
