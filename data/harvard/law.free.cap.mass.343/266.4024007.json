The building inspector denied the application \u201cbecause the proposed building did not conform to the requirements of the [b]uilding [c]ode and zoning by-laws of . . . [Natick],<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that the location did not have sufficient frontage on a recognized street [see code \u00a7 4. 4. 6], as defined in\u201d \u00a7 2. 1 of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Within six days of the denial of the permit, Church filed this petition for a writ of mandamus to command the building inspector to issue the permit. The trial judge denied the writ and ordered the petition dismissed, among other reasons, because Church had \u201cfailed to avail himself of the provisions of the statute and of the . . . [b]uilding [c]ode by appeal.\u201d The evidence is reported on the present appeal by Church from the judge\u2019s order. See G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 ID (as amended through St. 1957, c. 155).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Section 4. 4. 6 of the code, upon which the building inspector relied in denying the permit, is found in c. 4 of the code. It requires specified street frontages for lots of designated types. This chapter, entitled \u201cGeneral Building Restrictions,\u201d contains provisions establishing a central fire district, prescribes building height limits, and (in \u00a7 4. 4) regulates the location of buildings on lots. This last mentioned heading in turn covers such items as (a) percentage of open space, (b) front, rear, and side yards, (c) structures allowed in yards, (d) size of lots, (e) maintaining open spaces, and (f) special restrictions in particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>parts of the town. The general subject matter of these provisions is appropriate to a zoning by-law and, so far as now relevant, may be dealt with by use of the municipal legislative authority granted by the zoning enabling statute. See G. L. c. 40A,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>- \u00a7 2 (as amended through St. 1959, c. 607, \u00a7 1) and \u00a7 3; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Wellesley, </em>336 Mass. 517, 521. See also <em>Gem Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>341 Mass. 99, 101-102; <em>Jenckes </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Brookline, </em>341 Mass. 162, 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 12, requires a town building inspector to \u201cwithhold a permit for the construction ... of any building ... if the building ... as constructed . . . would be in violation of any zoning . . . by-law.\u201d Chapter 40A, \u00a7 13 (as amended through St. 1955, e. 325, \u00a7 1), permits an appeal to the board of appeals \u201cby any person aggrieved by reason of his inability to obtain a permit from any administrative official under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Church has not taken such an appeal, which is specifically provided by \u00a7 1. 2. 6 of the Natick code (see footnote 1, <em>supra). </em>The trial judge correctly ruled that Church could not proceed by petition for a writ of mandamus before he had exhausted his remedy authorized by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 13, and provided for in the Natick code. See <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>337 Mass. 758, 761; <em>O\u2019Day </em>v. <em>School Comm. of West Brookfield, ante, </em>122, 124. Cf. <em>Hinves </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works of Fall River, </em>342 Mass. 54, 57, where there was no writing establishing the content of an order or decision from which an appeal could be taken under \u00a7 13. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dennis, </em>342 Mass. 499, 501-502, does not establish that no remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>existed here by appeal under e. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 21, and related by-law provisions. In that case, upon a meager record which did not reveal the contents of the Dennis zoning by-law, it was held that an appeal could not be taken under G-. L. e. 40A, \u00a7 21, by an abutting landowner from a decision granting a variance from the application of provisions only shown to exist in the town building code, on the basis of which a permit was later issued. Section 21 was held to relate to appeals arising with respect to zoning ordinances and by-laws and not to appeals arising only under a building by-law. The <em>Bice </em>case differs from the present case in that this is an appeal by one denied a permit because of a by-law provision appropriate to a zoning by-law in a town where the zoning and building by-law provisions have been combined.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\"> Natiek in 1931 had. adopted a zoning hy-law which has been published in a single volume with, and as part of, the then existing building code. Section 1. 2. 6 of the code (described in \u00a7 0.1 as \u201cThe Building Code and Zoning ByLaws\u201d [1953 ed.]) provided that \u201c [a]ny person aggrieved by an order . . . Of refusal of a permit ... or by a ruling on . . . any part of this [c]ode by the [i]nspeetor, may appeal to . . . [the] [b]oard [of appeals created by \u00a7 1. 2. 6] within ten days of the date thereof by filing a written notice of appeal with the [i]nspector.\u201d The board may \u201caffirm, annul or modify such order . . . refusal, ruling or application, or shall determine the true intent and application of any provisions of the [e]ode in question.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> The combined Natick building code and zoning by-laws were adopted prior to the enactment by St. 1954, e. 368, \u00a7 2, inserting, as G. L. c. 40A, a new zoning enabling act. The code seems in part to be based upon the authority then found in G. L. e. 40, \u00a7 25 (as appearing in St. 1933, c. 269, \u00a7 1, and as amended by St. 1950,- c. 925, \u00a7 i), and in part upon the authority found in G. L. e. 143, \u00a7 3 (as amended through St. 1951, e. 85, and more recently amended by St. 1958, c. 515, and St. 1959, c. 607, \u00a7 2). The provisions of e. 40A <em>\u201cso </em>far as they are the same as those\u201d of earlier repealed provisions (see c. 368, \u00a7 1) are to \"be construed as continuations of\u201d the earlier provisions. See St. 1954, c. 368, \u00a7 3. Section 3 of the 1954 statute also provided that its enactment should \"not affect the validity of any action lawfully taken\u201d under earlier provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
