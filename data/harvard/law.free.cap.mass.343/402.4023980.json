At a second trial of this action of tort the plaintiff had a verdict which was reduced by a remittitur of $5,000 to $17,642.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">1. The defendant urges error in respect of a hypothetical question put to Dr. George W. Papen, \u201ca duly qualified physician specializing in surgery.\u201d The issue was whether Molloy\u2019s injuries ascribable to the accident included a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>broken, left femur. Records of The Boston City Hospital were in evidence. Dr. Papen read entries in respect of a fracture of the right acetabulum (hip socket) as shown by X-rays taken on December 27,1954. The record stated that Molloy was \u201cplaced on bed rest and treated symptomatically and on 1/2/55 . . . was discharged improved to be followed in the out-patient clinic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Dr. Papen then read the out-patient records which recorded the patient\u2019s discharge from the hospital, \u201chaving sustained \u2018fractured pelvis\u2019 on 27 Dec. \u201954. Was on crutches when discharged. Now walking on 1 crutch \u2018because I can walk better that way.\u2019 \u201d The out-patient records included two typed reports of X-ray diagnoses. The first, on February 21,1955, of the pelvis, recorded: \u201cNegative report. . . . Some demineralization . . . consistent with the age of the patient .... Calcification . . . is . . . noted. IMP: No fracture seen.\u201d The second report, dated March 1, 1955, recorded: \u201cLt. Hip: There is some deformity in the neck of the left femur, consistent with an old, healed fracture, probably a subcapital fracture. No evidence of bone reaction, resorption or destruction is noted at this time. IMP: Fracture of the left hip, healing well.\u201d A longhand entry of March 1, 1955, in the out-patient record read, \u201cExcept for slight pain in rt. thigh, pt. is asymptomatic. However, X-rays [it later developed that these were taken on March 1, 1955] show suspicious osteolytic-like areas in left hip (acetabulum and neck). . . . Return in one wk. at which time official X-ray reading should be available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">It is inferable that no one connected with the litigation knew of the left hip injury until the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Dr. Papen testified that he saw the patient in April, May, June, July, and August, 1955; in August Molloy\u2019s \u201cright hip was still stiff after he walked on it a long time\u201d; X-rays taken for Dr. Papen on June 20, 1955, \u201cshowed no evidence of fracture or dislocation of the hip at that time. The fracture site was well healed.\u201d On cross-examination, Dr. Papen testified that Molloy never complained to him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>pain in the left hip; he gave Molloy tests for \u201cflexion and abduction to both hips and never observed anything with the left hip\u201d; he was not asked to express any opinion at the previous trial about the left hip; the March 1, 1955, X-ray, \u201caccording to the records\u201d showed a subcapital fracture of the neck of the left femur but \u201che . . . had never seen that X-ray and never knew anything about the subcapital fracture until now when he was testifying\u201d; all that he knew about the left hip was \u201cwhat was in the outpatient record as he read it today. [H]owever, from the records and from looking at X-rays he was of the opinion that the type of injury described to the left femur could have been caused at the time of the accident ... it is probable that the left femur fracture could have been undetected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On redirect examination Dr. Papen was asked to examine in a view box \u201cthe Boston City Hospital X-rays previously referred to.\u201d The witness \u201cfirst examined the X-ray taken December 27,1954, and pointed out the fracture of the right acetabulum appearing in that X-ray. The witness was then asked the following question: \u2018Now . . . considering not only the in-patient reports of the Boston City Hospital, plus the X-rays of the Boston City Hospital, plus your own examinations and taking of history from this patient, as to whether or not you have an opinion as to whether this patient, the late Thomas Molloy, had a fracture of the right acetabulum as demonstrated in this X-ray on December 27 at The Boston City Hospital and a fracture of the left sub-capital area of the left femur \u2014 whether or not you have an opinion as to whether or not those fractures are causally related to the fall of December 27,1954.\u2019 \u201d The defendant objected and excepted. Dr. Papen, having answered that he had an opinion, was asked for it, and answered \u201cThat the fracture of the right acetabulum and the subcapital fracture of the left femur happened at the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The hypothetical question was confusingly double and, as shown below, risked the prejudicial ambiguity which resulted from the answer. The failure to exclude it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>prejudicial error. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>336 Mass. 609, 613-614.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We assume that the report of the March 1, 1955, X-rays was some evidence of a fracture at a recent time, notwithstanding the words \u201cold, healed fracture.\u201d The hospital records came into the case without objection and they are evidence of the medical facts which they purported to state. <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Grandchamp, </em>261 Mass. 40, 44. <em>Caccamo\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 358, 362. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>322 Mass. 239, 241. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The report of the March 1 X-rays was, however, possibly self contradictory and the jury could have regarded it of little weight to show a recent fracture in the absence of medical testimony to amplify and explain it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In the circumstances, it would have helped the plaintiff to have adduced the opinion of an expert, on adequate data, that Molloy in 1955 had a recent left as well as a recent right fracture, both causally related to the fall on December 27, 1954. Dr. Papen\u2019s answer to the question is subject to being construed as such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">If it is so construed, however, the answer, by necessary implication, includes Dr. Papen\u2019s construction of the March 1,1955, report, based on X-rays of that date, as shewing to him a recent fracture of the left femur, even though he had not seen the X-rays. The basis for Dr. Papen\u2019s making such a construction of the hospital record is not clear, but in any case the question was not adequately addressed thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Alternatively, Dr. Papen may have thought he was being asked to assume that the March 1 X-rays and the record thereof showed a recent fracture of the left femur. If the witness thus narrowly understood the question, the broader implications of the answer were necessarily prejudicial. Dr. Papen\u2019s care, in the earlier stages of his examination, to show that his knowledge of the left hip injury was seeond-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>hand tends to suggest that he construed and answered the hypothetical question in this more limited sense. But, however he construed it, the defendant was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The plaintiff asks us to construe the bill of exceptions to show that Dr. Papen examined the March 1, 1955, X-rays, or one such, before answering the question. We are unable to do this. The bill of exceptions is regrettably imprecise, but we understand the statement of Dr. Papen\u2019s testimony as follows: After his testimony that he had never seen \u201cthat X-ray\u201d of March 1, 1955, and knew of the left hip injury only from the record as he read it, he did not examine any X-rays up to the point at which he was asked \u201cto examine in a view box the . . . X-rays previously referred to.\u201d His testimony, prior to beginning that examination, that \u201cfrom the records and from looking at X-rays he was of the opinion that the type of injury described to the left femur could have been caused at the time of the accident,\u201d did not show or contain a reference to an examination by him of the March 1 X-rays. It was, rather, a reference to his experience generally in looking at X-rays. It was \u201cthe type of injury described\u201d in the hospital report, and not an injury which he himself saw evidenced in a March 1 X-ray, to which he referred. Dr. Papen, as we read the bill, did not look at a March 1 X-ray in the view box. The bill is explicit that he \u201cfirst examined the X-ray taken December 27\u201d and \u201cwas then asked the . . . question.\u201d The reference in the question to \u201cX-rays\u201d does not negative the other indications that the witness was not answering it from his own examination of any March 1 X-ray. The words \u201cconsidering . . . the in-patient reports . . . plus the X-rays of the Boston City Hospital\u201d were in context reasonably construable as including by way of reference to the March 1 X-rays only the record description thereof. On recross-examination Dr. Papen was examined \u201cas to the out-patient clinic X-ray, taken February 21, 1955, of the pelvis and admitted that it was impossible to determine . . . which was the right or left acetabulum or hip. \u201d There is no further reference to the March 1 X-rays.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Four of the five X-rays which are before us pursuant to the bill<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are dated 6 612-27. \u2019 \u2019 The fifth is dated 1 \u2018 6-20-55. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The answer, of course, was not directly responsive to the question; it does not expressly connect either injury to the accident. There was, however, no motion to strike and we do not deal with the defect in the answer as a ground of exception. But the ambiguity of the answer may have resulted from the objectionably obscure question.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">2. There is nothing in the defendant\u2019s point that the motion for a new trial should have been allowed because of the weakness of the evidence of liability. The bill states that a \u201cdrainpipe on one side of the [defendant\u2019s] premises collected melting snow water from the roof, discharging it onto the lawn from whence it flowed onto the sidewalk . . . where, on the day of the accident, it froze into a patch or square of ice, four or five square feet . . . with an irregular rutted surface.\u201d A police officer described the ice as \u201crunning from the open end of the drain pipe out across the ground, thence across the sidewalk . . ..\u201d Another police officer testified that \u201cthe ice was continuous from under the drain pipe across the ground and the sidewalk, out to the street. \u201d On this evidence the defendant may not contend with any conviction that \u201cit would be . . . impossible ... to determine that the ice . . . was formed from water from the downspout. \u201d See <em>Delano </em>v. <em>Mother\u2019s Super Market, Inc. </em>340 Mass. 293, 296, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">3. The error in the hypothetical question requires that the defendant\u2019s exception be sustained. But the issues of Molloy\u2019s fall, and the defendant\u2019s liability for such injuries as he sustained, have been determined for the plaintiff without error shown in respect thereof, and need not be retried. The retrial will be confined to the issues of the extent of Molloy\u2019s injuries and the damages to be awarded therefor. Q-. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 124, 132. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>210 Mass. 563, 564-568.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\"> No witness explained what \"old, healed <em>fracture\u2019\u2019 </em>or \"healing well\u201d meant in context.
