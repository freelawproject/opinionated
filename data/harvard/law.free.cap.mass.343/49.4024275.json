Ch. 136, Sec. 5.\u201d Waiving a jury, they were tried on a statement of agreed facts, were found guilty, and have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Each defendant \u201cis the owner and operator of [a] coin-operated automatic laundry\u201d in Middleboro. On Sunday, December 13,1959, the \u201cplace of business\u201d of each defendant was open, and the doors were unlocked. Neither defendant nor any employees were present. Washing machines and drying machines were available and in use by patrons. To operate, patrons place laundry in them and insert a coin. Power and water are supplied automatically. The patrons perform all the labor, and on Sundays, when no merchandise is sold or offered for sale, furnish their own washing materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">The defendants first contend that an automatic laundry as operated by them is not a \u201cshop\u201d within the meaning of G-. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 136, \u00a7 5, which provides: \u201cWhoever on the Lord\u2019s day keeps open his shop, warehouse or workhouse, or does any manner of labor, business or work, except works of necessity and charity, shall be punished by a fine of not more than fifty dollars. \u201d We disagree. As was said in <em>Boston Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, 137 </em>Mass. 332, 336, \u201c \u2018Shop,\u2019 in its popular as well as legal meaning, is not confined to a workshop. It is a word of various significance, and \u2018store\u2019 and \u2018workshop\u2019 are both included in it, and do not exhaust its meaning.\u201d We think that each \u201cplace of business,\u201d to quote a phrase from the agreed facts, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201cshop\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moriarty, </em>311 Mass. 116, 119-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The defendants\u2019 shops were open for the doing of business, as alleged in the complaints. The furnishing of machines, water, and power in return for a consideration is doing business. \u201c \u2018Business\u2019 ... is a word of extensive use and indefinite signification.\u201d <em>Collector of Taxes of Boston </em>v. <em>New England Trust Co. </em>221 Mass. 384, 388. <em>Boston &amp; Providence R.R. </em>v. <em>Old Colony R.R. </em>269 Mass. 190, 197. See <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Culton, </em>269 Mass. 471, 476. The sweeping effect of the statute embraces the laundromat of which each defendant \u201cis the owner and operator,\u201d again to quote a phrase from the agreed facts. There need not be a sale of goods. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dextra, </em>143 Mass. 28 (barber shop). In this day of automation the physical absence of the defendants or of employees was without significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The defendants\u2019 brief makes the assertion that \u201cin allowing their establishments to remain open on Sunday to permit housewives and mothers or anyone else to launder their own or their family\u2019s clothes, there is nothing which adversely affects public safety, health, morals, or the general welfare of the public; nor is in any way inimical to the public interests. To legislate against this, whether the right to so legislate is to be interpreted broadly and liberally or with strictness, is an improper exercise of the police power.\u201d The defendants rely upon the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the \"United States and art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The constitutionality of \u00a7 5 under the Constitution of this Commonwealth has been upheld by this court in two decisions which do not specifically refer to art. 1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Has, </em>122 Mass. 40, 42. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chernock, </em>336 Mass. 384, 386. We now hold that there is nothing in \u00a7 5 which is violative of art. 1. \u201cOne assailing a statute on constitutional grounds has the burden of proving the absence of any conceivable grounds upon which the statute may be supported.\u201d <em>Merit Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Director of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>319 Mass. 301, 305. The burden is not sustained by generalities, whether of law or fact. The presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by specific allegations. None has been made. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The reliance upon the Fourteenth Amendment is twofold: denial of due process and denial of the equal protection of the laws. At the time of the arguments before us a three-judge court in the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, by majority vote had decided that our \u201cso-called \u2018Lord\u2019s day\u2019 statute\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was unconstitutional as applied to the owner and customers of a Kosher market and as to rabbis having the duty of inspection. <em>Crown Kosher Super Mkt. of Mass. Inc. </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>176 F. Supp. 466. The grounds given, all under the Fourteenth Amendment, were (1) violation of the due process clause by (a) denying the free exercise of religion and (b) depriving of property or liberty arbitrarily and (2) denial of the equal protection of the laws (see, particularly, pp. 471, 474-476).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Although no question of the Jewish Sabbath is directly presented in the cases before us, we have awaited the outcome of the <em>Grown Kosher </em>case upon appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. That tribunal has now reversed the decision of the majority of the three-judge court, and has held that Gr. L. c. 136, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6, are not violative of the Constitution of the United States. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Crown Kosher Super Mkt. of Mass. Inc. </em>366 U. S. 617. At the same time decisions were rendered upholding the Maryland and Pennsylvania Sunday closing laws. <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U. S. 420. <em>Two Guys From Harrison-Allentown, Inc. </em>v. <em>McGinley, </em>366 U. S. 582. <em>Braunfeld </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>366 U. S. 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The defendants \u2019 remaining argument as to denial of the equal protection of the laws is also made by way of generalization. Their brief contends that \u00a7 5 \u201chas become so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>riddled with exceptions and limitations which are set forth in said c. 136, and for the most part are found in \u00a7 6, that the result is the granting of undue favor and individual or class privilege for those covered by such exceptions and limitations. Such inequality of treatment of all persons bears no reasonable relationship to the objects to which \u00a7 5 is directed.\u201d As matter of policy, this subject is one for legislative determination. As matter of law, the defendants have not sustained the burden of showing that the Legislature had no rational basis for making the exceptions found elsewhere in c. 136, chiefly in \u00a7 6. This has been so adjudicated in <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Crown Kosher Super Mktr. of Mass. Inc. </em>366 U. S. 617, 622-624. See <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U. S. 420, 425-428.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\"> See 176 \u00cd1. Supp. at page 468, where the reference is to G.
