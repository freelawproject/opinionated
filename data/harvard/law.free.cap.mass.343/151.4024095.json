In June, 1959, the plaintiff was street superintendent in Springfield. Bach defendant published a newspaper in Springfield. During the period June 10 to 12, each defendant published articles which contained, or referred to, allegations (1) that the plaintiff had registered his automobile in the name of a firm organized by the plaintiff and known as Public Service Enterprises and that no business certificate \u201crequired by law\u201d for this firm had been filed by the plaintiff in the city clerk\u2019s office (see C. L. e. 110, \u00a7 5, as amended through St. 1959, \u00a7 63); and (2) that the plaintiff\u2019s wife had been driven to work in an automobile owned by the city. Each count referred to one particular newspaper edition and alleged that the defendant therein published a specified article, referring to at least one of the foregoing allegations, \u201cmaliciously intending to defame the plaintiff\u201d and thereby \u201cto imply . . . that the plaintiff in respect of his official person . . . was not an honest . . . man.\u201d One or more of the articles referred to the firm as a \u201cfictitious company,\u201d or mentioned that the registry of motor vehicles would investigate the legality of the registration, or said that violators of the business name registration law \u201cmay be punished by fines . . . for as long as violations continue.\u201d One article stated that the plaintiff and the mayor had been involved in \u201chassles\u201d and that the former had \u201ctaken a stand against\u201d the mayor \u201cin the political campaign now getting underway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">By orders entered several months prior to our recent decision in <em>Boston Nutrition Soc. Inc. </em>v. <em>Stare, </em>342 Mass. 439, the trial judge sustained a demurrer by .each defendant, asserting (1) that the declaration \u201cdoes not state a legal cause of action\u201d and (2) that the alleged statements were not \u201clibelous of the plaintiff.\u201d The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Certain of the articles purported to state the plaintiff\u2019s explanation of the various phases of the situation at some length and their content suggested that they might constitute fair comment by a newspaper upon the conduct of a public officer in a matter of public interest. See Restate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ment: Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 606, 607; Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7 5.28; Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 95; Note, 62 Harv. L. Rev. 1207. In the <em>Boston Nutrition Soc. </em>case, however, it was stated (at p. 442) that a \u201cdemurrer to a declaration in libel cannot be sustained unless the words are not reasonably capable of any defamatory meaning,\u201d and (at p. 443) that \u201cthe qualified privilege of fair comment upon a matter of public interest is a matter of defence, ordinarily not open on demurrer.\u201d That decision controls this case. We cannot say that, as a matter of law, the statements objected to (although not expressed in extreme or unrestrained terms) were not susceptible of a defamatory construction. They could be viewed as suggesting criminal, or at least unlawful, action by a public officer. That the evidence at a trial on the merits may establish that the statements were fair and reasonable comment does not help the defendants upon demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>Orders sustaining demurrers reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
