McGrath, auctioneer of the city . . . more specifically . . . questions ... as to . . . [his] conduct\u201d relating to \u201cabout 1,350,360 square feet of land\u201d in Hyde Park. The transcript<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of these hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>ings, which, took place on October 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, and 25, covers 1,108 typewritten pages. The commission heard a number of witnesses including McGrath, who on \u201cvarious days up to and including October 20, 1961 . . . appeared . . . voluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">On October 20, McGrath was served with a subpoena duces tecum, which gives rise to this controversy. The second paragraph of this subpoena (which showed the title of the proceedings as \u201cIn the matter of an investigation of the official conduct of John J. McGrath, city auctioneer\u201d) required production of \u201call records of every description including bank statements and cancelled checks in connection with checking accounts, pass books for accounts in savings banks, savings and loan associations, cooperative banks and similar savings institutions, with respect to accounts in the names, individually or jointly, of John J. McGrath, Mary A. McGrath, or of any person acting as .your nominee during the period from 1950 to 1961 inclusive; and . . . copies of your personal income tax returns, both federal and state, for the years 1950 to 1961, inclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">On October 23, McGrath (through his counsel) informed the commission that \u201che would not produce the records called for by the subpoena and . . . left the hearing, refusing to testify further. \u2019 \u2019 A bill in equity was brought by the members of the commission to compel McGrath\u2019s attendance and the production of the records. After hearing, a Superior Court judge denied McGrath\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss \u2019 \u2019 the bill. He also made a report of material facts and filed an order for a decree. On November 2, 1961, a final decree, entitled \u201corder,\u201d was entered directing McGrath to appear before the commission on November 15, and then to \u201cproduce all records of every description pertaining to such matters as are now being investigated by the . . . [commission], including bank statements and cancelled checks in connection with checking accounts, passbooks for accounts in savings banks, savings and loan associations, co-operative banks and similar institutions, with respect to accounts in the names, individually or jointly, of John J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>McGrath, Mary A. McGrath or of the Richview Trust during the period from 1950 to 1961 inclusive. \u2019 \u2019 Both the commission and McGrath appealed from the final decree. McGrath also filed a bill of exceptions. All matters raised by the bill of exceptions are presented by the appeals, if they are properly before us. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">1. The bill is brought under St. 1908, c. 562, \u00a7 3, which reads, \u201cIf any person so summoned [before the commission] . . . shall refuse to attend ... or to answer any question, or to produce any book, contract, document or paper pertinent to the matter of inquiry . . ., a justice of the supreme judicial court or of the superior court, <em>in his discretion, </em>upon application by the commission . . ., may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the commission, and to produce his books, contracts, documents and papers and to give evidence touching the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">This is a special statutory proceeding. One application of this general character (under a legislative resolve) seems to have been dealt with on the equity side of the Superior Court <em>(Cabot </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>332 Mass. 44, 52). Resort also has been had to the law side of the court. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Brissenden, </em>271 Mass. 172,175. See also <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>175 Mass. 179; <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>329 Mass. 265, 279; Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev.) \u00a7 2195 et seq. The foregoing cases do not discuss the issue whether the statutory proceedings were equitable or legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The 1908 statute does not state the nature of the proceeding. There is no occasion to restrict its usefulness by confining it within the scope of any particular preexisting remedy. The Legislature, by implication, has left the courts free reasonably to assimilate the special statutory proceeding to any appropriate established procedures. There is, perhaps, some resemblance betw\u00e9en this statutory procedure and an equitable bill for discovery in aid of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>proceeding. See <em>MacPherson </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>336 Mass. 94, 98-103. In some cases applications for enforcement may involve some element of declaratory relief, which in most eases is granted on the equity side of the court. See G. L. c. 231A (inserted by St. 1945, c. 582, \u00a7 1). Applications for enforcement of administrative process also are likely to be met with assertions of personal constitutional rights and immunities of a character involving careful balancing of public and private interests. Each such interest can be more effectively protected by the flexible procedures and remedies and the broader appellate review available in equity than by a proceeding at law. All relevant considerations thus make it appropriate for us to treat the proceeding as governed by equitable procedure and principles, so far as reasonably applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The \u201cmotion to dismiss,\u201d treated as a demurrer (see <em>Maltzman </em>v. <em>Herts, </em>336 Mass. 704, 705), was properly overruled. The only grounds stated in the motion were (a) that the petition could only be brought at law, a matter dealt with above; and (b) that the proceeding before the commission was \u201cinvalid\u201d and the subpoena \u201ca nullity.\u201d The allegations of the bill were sufficient to establish jurisdiction in the commission to make investigation of at least some of McGrath\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">2. The following statement of parts of the evidence before the commission is based upon the trial judge\u2019s summaries, supplemented by a few references to the testimony itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">(a) On August 10, 1950, McGrath \u201csold to John J. Ellis, his straw, for $5,500, while acting in his official capacity as [c]ity [ajuctioneer\u201d a parcel of foreclosed tax title land in Hyde Park containing 1,350,360 square feet. For this McGrath made a cash deposit of $500 with his then superior, one Carp, chairman of the city\u2019s board of real estate commissioners, \u201cthe only other person present at the sale. [The b]alance of the . . . price was to be paid by September 9, 1950; but was not paid until March 7, 1952.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>March 26, 1952, a deed\u201d to Ellis was recorded. \u201c [T]he property remained in his name until November 20, 1957, when a deed, dated November 16, 1954, was recorded, revealing . . . [McGrath] as the owner.\u201d Revenue stamps on this deed indicated a sale by Ellis to McGrath for $25,000 \u201calthough no money had been passed. On December 11,1958 . . . [McGrath] caused to be recorded a mortgage\u201d to the trustees of the \u201cRichview Trust,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to secure what purported to be a $75,000 note which . . . did not exist.\u201d In 1960, the metropolitan district commission took about 298,000 square feet of the Hyde Park land. McGrath refused the appraised price of $15,000, and has had offers of $15,000 to $60,000 for the entire lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">McGrath\u2019s counsel refused to permit him to testify before the commission about using Ellis as \u201cstraw\u201d in any other transaction. Although counsel allowed McGrath to give testimony about applications to the Boston assessors for abatement of taxes upon the Hyde Park property, McGrath did not testify about appeals from the assessors to the Appellate Tax Board. After the service of the subpoena, McGrath\u2019s counsel told the commission that he was \u201cwithdrawing . . . [his] client as a witness\u201d and that the commission should \u201cproceed with a court adjudication of . . . [its]rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">(b) In November, 1950, the Boston housing authority applied for Federal funds to take a parcel of land on Popes Hill Street, Dorchester. This action \u201cwas unknown to the general public.\u201d On March 14, 1951, the parcel was conveyed to Ellis for $4,500. On November 27, 1951, a taking of the property by the housing authority was recorded. About a year later, the authority secured an option to purchase the property for $13,300. A check for $13,147.87 was sent to Ellis at McGrath\u2019s office on April 15, 1953. On April 9, 1953, papers had been passed by the authority and Ellis, who was then accompanied by one Swinderman. There was a bookkeeper and stenographer named Swenderman in McGrath\u2019s office. Ellis was an elevator operator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>of limited means. An officer of the bank upon which the check for $13,147.87 was drawn was unable to furnish information about its cashing or disposition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">McGrath contends that, in large measure, the commission is investigating McGrath\u2019s individual activities rather than his official conduct; and that the commission is exceeding its statutory scope of inquiry. In particular, McGrath objects to any inquiry about tax appeals, relating to the Hyde Park land, before the Appellate Tax Board and to questions about the Dorchester land which the Boston housing authority has acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Section 18 of the 1909 statute (see footnote 1, <em>supra) </em>gives the commission authority \u201cto investigate <em>any and all matters </em>relating to appropriations . . . accounts, and methods of administration <em>affecting </em>. . . Boston or the county of Suffolk, or any department thereof\u201d (emphasis supplied). This statutory language shows that the Legislature intended the commission\u2019s range of inquiry to be broad, as was that of (a) the predecessor commission existing under orders of the Boston city council entered on January 29, 1907, as amended, March 7, 1907 (see 1 [Boston] Pin. Com. Bep. 1-10; St. 1907, c. 481) and (b) the commission created by St. 1908, c. 562 (footnote 1, <em>supra). </em>See communications early in 1908 from the then existing finance commission to a committee of the Legislature, 1 Pin. Com. Bep. 209-210, 244-245. Section 18 amply empowers the commission (as a continuing independent body charged with watching city operations constantly and reporting what it observes to \u201cthe mayor, the city council, the governor or the general court,\u201d as may be appropriate) to investigate at least those matters which, in its opinion entertained reasonably, have substantial relevance to the proper management of the city\u2019s affairs and the appropriate conduct of city employees in relation to matters in which the city has an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Statute 1908, c. 562, \u00a7 2, which is incorporated by reference in St. 1909, c. 486, \u00a7 21 (see footnote 1, <em>supra), </em>provides that the commission, in conducting investigations, may summon witnesses and compel the production of documents \u201cto enable the general court to receive . . . [the commission\u2019s] findings and recommendations as a basis for such laws relating to the government of said city as the general court shall deem meet to enact,\u201d as well as to enable the commission (St. 1908, c. 562, \u00a7 1) \u201cto inform itself.\u201d The commission\u2019s position thus in these respects is analogous to that of a legislative committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The commission\u2019s range of inquiry is not unlimited. The statutes indicate that its investigations must have a reasonable relation to the finances and methods of management of the city. Except as individual situations arise, however, it is not either possible or appropriate to be precise in defining what the commission may examine. Questions of the scope of jurisdiction to inquire and of relevance (see Wigmore, Evidence [3d ed.] \u00a7 27) almost invariably involve questions of judgment in particular circumstances, especially as to (a) administrative boards and (b) legislative inquiries in aid of possible legislation. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Brissenden, </em>271 Mass. 172, 177-180, 184 \u2014 185, and cases cited; <em>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Walling, </em>327 U. S. 186, 209; <em>Barenblatt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U. S. 109, 125-134. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rumely, </em>345 U. S. 41,42-47, where a Congressional resolution was narrowly construed in order to avoid constitutional questions, not here present.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The courts, of course, should not assist the commission to obtain the production of plainly irrelevant records, or improperly to invade witnesses\u2019 privacy to the extent that privacy is constitutionally protected. See <em>Stahlman </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commn. </em>126 F. 2d 124, 128 (Ct. App. D. C.). See also <em>Federal Trade Commn. </em>v. <em>American Tobacco Co. </em>264 U. S. 298, 305-307; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>298 U. S. 1, 25-27; Frankfurter, J. dissenting in <em>Penfield Co. </em>v. <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>330 U. S. 585, 604, and cases there collected. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number><em>Morton Salt Co. </em>338 U. S. 632, 641-642. Nevertheless, the commission may not be denied the power to investigate fairly, by comprehensive bnt reasonable methods, matters which it is justified in regarding as affecting the finances and management of Boston. In the first instance, subject to judicial determination whether subpoenas may properly be enforced (see discussion of St. 1908, c. 562, \u00a7 3, in part 6 of this opinion, infra), the statutes leave to the commission the determination whether the inquiry is relevant to the statutory functions, and whether particular methods of inquiry are necessary. See <em>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Walling, </em>327 U. S. 186, 194 et seq., 208-209, 214; <em>Barenblatt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U. S. 109, 125-134; <em>McPhaul </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U. S. 372, 380-382. See also <em>Endicott Johnson Corp. </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>317 U. S. 501, 507-510; <em>Dossett </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>161 F. 2d 839, 842 (6th Cir.) cert. den. 332 U. S. 771 ; <em>Hunt Foods &amp; Indus. Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commn. </em>286 F. 2d 803, 806-809 (9th Cir.), cert. den. 365 U. S. 877; <em>Long Beach Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Federal Home Loan Bank Bd. </em>189 F. Supp. 589, 602-605 (D. Cal.).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The Legislature has shown that it intends that the commission\u2019s inquiries shall be fairly and reasonably conducted and that witnesses shall have opportunity to bring out relevant facts and to protect their reputations by cross-examination and offering testimony. See St. 1909, c. 486, \u00a7 21, footnote 1, <em>supra. </em>The duty to testify before the commission is subject to relevant constitutional guaranties. See St. 1908, c. 562, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">3. McGrath must answer questions and produce records relating to his appeals to the Appellate Tax Board under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65D, as amended, from assessments upon the Hyde Park property. The commission could reasonably consider that Boston or its interests might be affected by McGrath\u2019s alleged conduct with respect to the Hyde Park land, even if he was only a part time<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> city employee. It could investigate all relevant aspects of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>The proceedings before the Appellate Tax Board are against the Boston assessors, are defended by city lawyers, and relate to taxes paid to the city collector. In addition to these obvious facts, there might be further reason to ascertain whether there has been abuse of the statutory procedures before the board, or failure to comply with conditions precedent to initiating the appeals e.g. payment of taxes, see Gr. L. c. 59, \u00a7 64, as amended through St. 1956, c. 544, and \u00a7 65, as amended through St. 1945, c. 621, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">4. We have said that, under the statutes (see Gr. L. c. 121, \u00a7\u00a7 261-2600, as amended), a housing authority, \u201calthough organized by and in each city and town in cooperation with the State, is nevertheless, when organized, a complete corporate entity in itself, distinct from the municipal corporation within whose territory it is set up. \u2019 \u2019 See <em>Johnson-Foster Co. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amore Constr. Co. </em>314 Mass. 416, 419. Such an authority, or any similar authority for other purposes, is a public body, analogous in various respects (see <em>Costonis </em>v. <em>Medford Housing Authy., ante, </em>108, 115; see also <em>Ayer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Admn. &amp; Fin. </em>340 Mass. 586, 592-595) to a municipal corporation. In substantial respects, such an authority may vitally affect the interests of the community or communities in which its functions are executed. Under Gr. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26K (as amended through St. 1954, e. 72, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2) the city initiates the operations of a housing authority. Its members (see \u00a7 26L, as amended through St. 1961, c. 496, \u00a7 1) are in part appointed by the mayor, who under \u00a7 26M (as amended through St. 1955, c. 128, \u00a7 2) has certain powers of removal. Under \u00a7 261ST, inserted by St. 1946, c. 574, \u00a7 1, \u201cSo far as practicable, a housing authority shall make use of the services of the agencies, officers and employees of the city . . . and such city . . . shall, if requested, make available such services.\u201d The city has power to assist its housing authority to carry out its functions. See \u00a7 26Q, as amended through St. 1961, c. 188, \u00a7 2. The housing authority\u2019s real estate and tangible personalty are exempt from local taxation, subject, however, to arrangements for payments in lieu of taxes. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u00a7 26R (inserted by St. 1946, c. 574, \u00a7 1). These statutory provisions are examples of areas in which a housing authority\u2019s operations are inevitably interwoven with the management and interests of the city in which it operates. Even without such explicit provisions, the operations of such an authority might be, in some degree, matters \u201caffecting\u201d the city. See St. 1909, c. 486, \u00a7 18 (footnote 1, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In the light of these considerations, the commission is justified in investigating whether a Boston employee, having responsibilities relating to city real estate (and, perhaps, in a position to learn about the authority\u2019s plans and real estate needs) has acted in a manner likely to involve conflict between the employee\u2019s private real estate operations and his public duties. McGrath must answer questions, and produce documents, relevant to any dealings affecting the Boston housing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">5. We interpret the subpoena (apart from its demand for copies of tax returns, discussed <em>infra), </em>as calling only for such \u201crecords of every description . . . with respect to bank accounts in the names, individually or jointly, of John J. McGrath, Mary A. McGrath, or of any person acting as . . . [McGrath\u2019s] nominee during the period from 1950 to 1961 inclusive,\u201d as were relevant to the inquiries into McGrath\u2019s activities. The trial judge, by the final decree, required McGrath to produce only those records of bank accounts \u201cpertaining to such matters as are . . . being investigated by the\u201d commission. Those matters specifically brought to the judge\u2019s attention were the Hyde Park and Dorchester land matters and the Readville auction matter (see footnote 5, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">McGrath contends that the subpoena is so broad as to be unlawful and an unreasonable search and seizure. The commission, on the other hand, contends that the judge has unreasonably excluded records of bank accounts of McGrath\u2019s \u201cnominees\u201d from the scope of the subpoena, as well as copies of certain Federal tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">No actual search or seizure of documents, pursuant to a warrant, is proposed. The question (both under the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, and, under Art. 14 of the Declaration of Eights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth) is whether the subpoena, fairly interpreted, is too broad and, therefore, unreasonable. If it is unreasonable, it must be quashed or modified. See <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Henkel, </em>201 U. S. 43, 70-77; <em>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Walling, </em>327 U. S. 186,195, 202, 208-209; <em>McPhaul </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U. S. 372, 382-383; <em>McGarry </em>v. <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>147 F. 2d 389, 392 (10th Cir.); <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Truck Drivers Local Union No. 299, </em>293 F. 2d 807, 814^815 (6th Cir.), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In the <em>McPhaul </em>case, 364 U. S. 372, 382, the Supreme Court said: \u201cThe . . . inquiry . . . was . . . relatively broad . . . and the permissible scope of materials that could reasonably be sought was necessarily equally broad. It is not reasonable to suppose that the Subcommittee [there making the inquiry] knew precisely what books and records were kept . . . and therefore the subpoena could only \u2018 specif [y] ... the subjects to which the documents . . . relate\u2019 . . .. The call of the' subpoena for \u2018all records, correspondence and memoranda\u2019 . . . relating to . . . specified subjects describes them\u201d as precisely as the situation would permit and sufficiently to enable the person served to know what documents were required and to select them.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">We are of opinion that the subpoena, as interpreted by the trial judge, does not exceed reasonable limits, (a) It is reasonable in time. McGrath\u2019s activities with respect to the Hyde Park land began in 1950 and are still continuing. If he was interested in the Dorchester land, his and Ellis\u2019s activities concerning that land took place in the years 1951 through 1953. (b) The documents asked for are susceptible of identification. McGrath can ascertain what bank accounts, he, Mrs. McGrath, and the Eichview Trust have had during the last decade. To the extent that records of these still exist, it is unlikely that they are unreasonably voluminous, (c) The records cannot be said to lack relevance to the inquiry, particularly to the inquiry about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Dorchester land, for they may reflect whether McGrath has received particular payments at particular times.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The subpoena cannot require McGrath to produce documents not now within his possession or reasonable control. He may raise questions with respect to such possession or control before the commission, if he is unable to produce a particular record. See <em>McPhaul </em>v. <em>United States, </em>272 F. 2d 627, 630 (6th Cir.), aff\u2019d 364 U. S. 372; 8 Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev.) \u00a7 2200, p. 129. See also <em>McGarry </em>v. <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>147 F. 2d 389, 392-393 (10th Cir.). The subpoena and the judge\u2019s order, of course, leave open to McGrath \u201cample opportunities for objecting, on relevant grounds, to the admissibility ... of any particular document.\u201d See <em>Civil Aeronautics Bd. </em>v. <em>Hermann, </em>353 U. S. 322, 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In one respect the trial judge\u2019s order is too narrow. He limited McGrath\u2019s obligation to produce records of bank accounts of his \u201cnominees\u201d to those of the Bichview Trust (see footnote 4, <em>supra) </em>but excluded \u201cthose of nominees as yet unnamed or [not] indicated.\u201d To the extent that McGrath actually operated through \u201cnominees\u201d or agents in respect of matters being investigated, their bank account records may be relevant. In addition to the Bichview Trust, McGrath has been shown to have operated through Ellis as a \u201cstraw.\u201d If he had other nominees, they would bear a similar agency or fiduciary relationship to him. We think that the commission is entitled to have McGrath produce his nominees \u2019 records of bank accounts so far as they relate to the subject of investigation and are within McGrath\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">6. The commission properly no longer seeks the production of copies of McGrath\u2019s Massachusetts tax returns. <em>Leave </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>306 Mass. 391, 398-403. Compare Ca<em>vazza </em>v. <em>Cavazza, </em>317 Mass. 200, 202-203. The copies of McGrath\u2019s Federal tax returns stand on a somewhat different basis. In a very recent case (decided since the final decree in the Superior Court), the Supreme Court of the United States has indicated that copies of Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>tax returns in the hands of the taxpayer are \u201csubject to discovery.\u201d See <em>St. Regis Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U. S. 208, 218-219. Such production, of course, should be allowed only where the information in the returns is relevant to some legitimate subject of inquiry or issue in the proceeding. See <em>Tollefsen </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>16 F. R. D. 348, 349 (D. Mass.). See also <em>June </em>v. <em>George C. Peterson Co. </em>155 F. 2d 963, 967 (7th Cir.); <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co.

H. 205, 206-207 (\u201cdiscovery of federal . . . tax returns is discretionary . . . but it should not be used as a means of harassment or impertinent intrusion\u201d); 8 Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton rev.) \u00a7 2377 (f), pp. 781-782; McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 149, p. 312. Compare <em>United Motion Theatre Co. </em>v. <em>Ealand, </em>199 F. 2d 371 (6th Cir.); <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>8 F. R. D. 556, 557 (E. D. Pa.), where the court held that the plaintiffs had \u201cnot shown any necessity for . . . production of\u201d tax return copies or that they were \u201creasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence. \u2019 \u2019 Compare also <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of Cal. </em>49 Cal. 2d 509, 512-513. In the Federal courts, a taxpayer who does not have a copy of his Federal tax return may even be required to request one from the Internal Revenue Service as he is entitled to do. See the <em>Tollefsen </em>case, 16 F. R. D. 348; <em>Paramount Film Distrib. Co. </em>v. <em>Ram, </em>91 F. Supp. 778, 781 (E. D. S. C.).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">As to copies of Federal returns (despite our preference for the reasoning in the <em>Leave </em>case, 306 Mass. 391, 398-403), we would follow the Federal decisions if substantial necessity for production of the copies had been established. If these later are shown to be of real significance, the commission will be entitled to have them produced, subject to the limits of the trial judge\u2019s \u201cdiscretion\u201d mentioned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>St. 1908, c. 562, \u00a7 3, incorporated by reference in St. 1909, e. 486, \u00a7 21 (and quoted in part 1 of this opinion, <em>supra). </em>Section 3 of the 1908 statute gives the trial judge some range of discretion to refuse to order production of documents. Like other discretions, this discretion cannot be exercised arbitrarily, but a trial judge, before ordering the production of documents, at least may require the commission to demonstrate that the investigation is within its powers, and that the information sought is relevant. We are of opinion that the trial judge, upon the showing made to him at this stage of the inquiry, correctly exercised his discretion to deny production of copies of McGrath\u2019s Federal tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">7. McGrath principally complains of the scope of inquiry rather than of the conduct of the hearings. He, however, does argue that the commission unduly delayed and interrupted his scheduled testimony. The order of testimony was within the commission\u2019s sound discretion, although any such body naturally will avoid, so far as practicable, unnecessary inconvenience to witnesses. See <em>Horowitz </em>v. <em>Bokron, </em>337 Mass. 739, 742. See also <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Ashkins, </em>266 Mass. 374, 379-380.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">8. This seems to us to be a case in which, as the inquiry proceeds, there may be occasion for further resort to the Superior Court to compel testimony or the production of documents. The propriety of various inquiries may require prompt resolution to protect the proper interests of the public and of McGrath. See <em>Hermann </em>v. <em>Civil Aeronautics Bd. </em>237 F. 2d 359, 363-364 (9th Cir.), revd. as to issues not in this respect material, sub nom. <em>Civil Aeronautics Bd. </em>v. <em>Hermann, </em>353 U. S. 322, 323-324. Accordingly, the Superior Court, in its decree after rescript, will retain jurisdiction, with leave to the parties to apply, by further petition or by motion, and upon short notice, for additional relief as occasion may arise. See <em>Nassif </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine R.R. </em>340 Mass. 557, 566, and cases cited; <em>Hunt Foods &amp; Indus. Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commn. </em>286 F. 2d 803, 811, 813 (9th Cir.), cert. den. 365 U. S. 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>9. The final decree is to be modified to provide (a) for the production of records of bank accounts of any nominee of McGrath, to the extent that such records are relevant to any proper subject of the commission\u2019s inquiry and are within McGrath\u2019s possession or control, and (b) for the retention of jurisdiction by the Superior Court, in the manner outlined in this opinion. Subject to such modifications, the final decree is affirmed. Because all issues have been dealt with upon the appeals, the bill of exceptions is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-12\"> Section 18 provides that it \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>shall be the duty of the . . . commission from time to time to investigate <em>any and all </em>matters <em>relating </em>to appropriations, loans, expenditures, accounts, and methods of administration <em>affectmg </em>the city of Boston or the county of Suffolk, or any department thereof, that <em>may appear to the commission </em>to require investigation, and to report thereon from time to time to the mayor, the city council, the governor, or the general court.
