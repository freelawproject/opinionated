L. c. 40A, \u00a7 22, inserted by St. 1954, c. 368, <em>% 2) </em>seeks to require the removal of a \u201cmobile home\u201d from land owned by Phillips, on the ground that it was placed there in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Manchester zoning by-law (see footnote 1, <em>infra). </em>In the Superior Court a decree was entered dismissing the bill. The town appealed. The evidence is reported. The facts, as found by the judge, are stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The relevant provisions of the by-law are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Phillips\u2019 land is in a single residence district. On September 12,1960, Phillips gave notice to the selectmen that he proposed to place upon his land a \u201ctrailer to be made [a] permanent home on permanent foundation connected with water, sewer, electricity.\u201d Receipt of the notice was acknowledged on the next day. Phillips then applied to the water department and the electric company for water, sewer, and electric service. He \u201ccontracted for a . . . concrete strip [six inches deep on four inches of stone fill] 51 feet long and 20 feet wide to be erected on his land. \u201d He \u201cpurchased, for an overall cost of more than\u201d $7,000 a \u201cmobile home . . . without the wheels\u201d which he intended to place permanently upon his land by affixing it to the concrete foundation by steel connecting rods.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Water and sewer connections were made and the electric company installed its underground service. After the delivery of the mobile home, its \u201cwheels . . . were removed and are the property of the vendor.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Phillips planned to add, at a cost of about $350, a canopy thirty-five feet long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>and ten feet wide with six wrought iron supporting pillars enclosed in a screen. This was to be a veranda. He intended to build brick steps to his doors. He bought forty-five yards of loam to prepare for a lawn and \u201cmade arrangements to secure 1,300 privet bushes preparatory to his intended extensive landscaping.\u201d The completion of the foundation, the permanent affixing of the unit thereto, the construction of the veranda and the brick steps, and the landscaping have been prevented by injunction secured by the town on December 28, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The mobile dwelling was \u201ca well designed compact living unit, elaborately equipped with kitchen, living room, two bedrooms, a bath and a long connecting hall. \u2019 \u2019 It contained a washing machine, dryer, refrigerator, and oil heat which was to have been converted to gas. Pictures show what is unmistakably the superstructure of a partly metal mobile unit, situated in an area in which there are modest but neat conventional frame houses. A pencil sketch showed this unit as to be somewhat disguised by the canopy, the planting of some shrubs, and the laying out of low privet hedges.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The trial judge referred to the provisions of Gr. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32L, and Gr. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 128B, 128D.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He saw in these statutes \u201ca reaffirmation that a mobile home is a type of vehicle,\u201d despite the reference to foundations in \u00a7 32L. He then stated that the \u201cproblem . . . reduces itself to . . . determining whether what clearly was once a mobile home is forever to remain such\u201d and concluded that the by-law did not exclude from a single residence district \u201ca mobile home . . . severed of its mobility\u201d and ruled \u201cas matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of law that the defendant\u2019s dwelling is not in violation of the zoning by-law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact were justified. The principal question is the interpretation of the by-law (see footnote 1, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The permitted use (\u00a7 III, A, 1) was a \u201c [djetached one-family dwelling.\u201d Without more, this language would import only \u201cstructures of the type ordinarily thought of as houses.\u201d See <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>334 Mass. 602, 604, where we said that the term \u201c [o]ne-family detached houses\u201d had reference to \u201cbuildings of some permanence and solidity which would be appropriate in a normal single family residential district,\u201d and that a \u201ctrailer on wheels . . . [was] not adapted for the type of permanent dwelling use . . . contemplated by the by-law.\u201d We there dealt, of course, with a trailer, not affixed to the land, which could be moved at any time and had insubstantial connection with water and electric utilities. Some reliance was placed upon these circumstances and upon the fact that the Marblehead by-law prohibited a \u201ccamp\u201d as an accessory use. We noted that a movable trailer \u2018 \u2018more naturally comes within the term \u2018camp\u2019 \u201d than the term \u201chouse.\u201d Nevertheless, the language of the decision recognized a possible broader scope of the by-law\u2019s prohibition, for it was said (p. 605), \u201cIn adopting the by-law, there plainly was no intention to include, within the class of dwellings permitted by \u00a7 4 in single residence districts, trailers and similar vehicles <em>or structures, </em>for they would be inconsistent with the sound and natural development of such a district. The terms used in \u00a7 4 of the by-law must be construed in a manner fairly to come within its spirit and intent\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The Manchester by-law is more explicit. The 1958 amendment I, A, 8, see footnote 1, <em>supra), </em>adopted about one year and a half after the <em>Marblehead </em>decision, excludes from the term \u201c [d]welling,\u201d any \u201covernight camp, trailer, or mobile home. \u201d It is contended, however, that the amendment excludes only units which remain mobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>A town has power by its zoning by-law, and by other by-laws, to regulate trailers and mobile homes. See <em>Granby </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>341 Mass. 443, 445. The zoning power includes the power within districts to \u201cregulate and restrict the erection ... or use of buildings, and structures, or use of land.\u201d G-. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 2 (as amended through St. 1959, c. 607, \u00a7 1). That power may be exercised, not only to conserve the obvious aspects of health and safety (cf. <em>Gillam </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Saugus, </em>327 Mass. 621, 622) but also (\u00a73) \u201cto conserve the value of land and buildings; to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the . . . town; and to preserve and increase its amenities.\u201d See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>333 Mass. 773, 778-780; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>333 Mass. 783, 787-788; <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>348 U. S. 26, 33 (\u201cIt is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well-balanced as well as carefully patrolled\u201d). A town may reasonably consider that this type of dwelling unit, frequently but not always found on wheels, (a) is detrimental to the values of adjacent conventional single family houses, even if the body of a once mobile unit is permanently affixed to the land; and (b) tends to depreciate, contrary to the public interest, the amenities and appearance of a residence district. The presence of trailers may also \u201ctend to stifle development of the area for residential purposes.\u201d See <em>Napierkowski </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>29 N. J. 481, 493-494. There is ample justification for confining trailers and mobile units to areas where they will not injure the investment (perhaps representing a substantial part of family resources) in conventional houses of other owners, hurt taxable values, and impede town development.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We think that Manchester by apt words has excluded the mobile home type of unit from the category of dwellings. The words of the by-law, interpreted \u201caccording to their natural import in common and approved usage\u201d (see <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Mayor of Beverly, </em>315 Mass. 567, 569; <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>334 Mass. 602, 605), have equal application to this type of unit whether equipped with wheels or without them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>They refer, we think, to this species of self contained unit, which frequently is in form a mobile trailer, in contrast with the conventional type of house usual in, and appropriate to, a single family residence district. In ordinary parlance the unit shown in the exhibits will be spoken of as a trailer or a mobile home, even if it has not been sold with wheels or its wheels have been taken away, and even if it has been affixed to the land. It looks like a trailer, has the qualities of a trailer superstructure, and has been built as a trailer. There is no such ambiguity about the language of the by-law as to lead us to interpret it strictly against the public interest because it will operate in derogation of the landowner\u2019s ability at common law to make unrestrained use of his property. Cf. <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>S. S. Kresge Co. </em>313 Mass. 299, 303-304.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The interpretation of by-laws and ordinances of this general type is a matter upon which courts have differed. Some support for the interpretation which we make is found in decided cases. Certain of these seem to us to express a view consistent with the general purpose of such zoning, although they state a diversity of reasons for the results and deal with provisions of statutes, ordinances, and by-laws in various respects different from those in force in Manchester. See <em>Napierkowski </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>29 N. J. 481, 485, 490-494 (concrete foundation, but whether wheels to be removed not clear); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>66 So. 2d (Fla.) 702, 704-706 (trailer may not have been affixed to land); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Beiber, </em>251 Iowa, 969, 973 (trailer with wheels removed and mounted on cement blocks held within a restrictive covenant forbidding a \u201cgarage, trailer, shack or hut . . . [to] be used for living purposes\u201d); <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>Louviere, </em>52 So. 2d 751, 752 (Ct. App. La.) (wheels not removed, placed on temporary blocks to preserve tires); <em>Connor </em>v. <em>West Bloomfield Township, </em>207 F. 2d 482, 483 (6th Cir.) (where the trailer may still have been mobile).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>In other cases, zoning, building, and other regulatory provisions (not as specific as those in force in Manchester) have been interpreted favorably to the admission to residential areas of permanently fixed trailers. <em>Lescault </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Review of Cumberland, </em>R. I. , . <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Re Willey, </em>120 Vt. 359, 363-366 (strict construction of ordinance adopted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Upon receipt of notice on September 12,1960, of the defendant\u2019s intention to place such a unit upon his land, the selectmen appropriately might have moved much more promptly to enforce the by-law. They did move on December 21,1960. In any event, the town is not estopped to take enforcement action. See <em>Building Commr. of Medford </em>v. <em>C. &amp; H. Co. </em>319 Mass. 273, 283; <em>Haverhill </em>v. <em>DiBurro, </em>337 Mass. 230, 238; <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., ante, </em>502, 512. See also <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>338 Mass. 704, 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The final decree is reversed. A new decree is to be entered enjoining the defendant from using his mobile home unit as his residence and directing that it be removed from the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\"><em>a </em>, , <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\"> The zoning by-law was adopted in 1945 and, as in force on March 12, 1956, read in part, \u2018 \u2018 Section III.
