Mullen, late chief of the Shrewsbury fire department. The return of the appeal board contained a transcript of the evidence from which the following facts could have been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">On the morning of December 24, 1953, the Shrewsbury fire station was notified by radio of a gas leak at the home of one Perez. The fire truck was brought out and a fireman named Michalak went up and notified Chief Mullen who was in his office on the second floor. The chief came down the stairs in \u201ca minute or so\u201d at his usual \u201cmedium rate\u201d of speed and Michalak noticed that he was very pale. Michalak said, \u2018 \u2018 Chief you don\u2019t look too good. \u2019 \u2019 The chief replied, \u201cI don\u2019t feel too good.\u201d He put one arm into his coat which was hanging in the office where Michalak was sitting. He was going to put the other arm into the coat and started to collapse. Michalak rushed to him and held him up. He was taken to a Worcester hospital and died on December 26 from the result of a coronary thrombosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Dr. Hunter, the deceased\u2019s physician, testified that the chief \u201cprobably had a fairly advanced degree\u201d of coronary sclerosis and \u201cin the effort of coming down the stairs or the excitement of the moment, whatever it was, he developed this attack of coronary insufficiency. . . . That means a spasm of the coronary vessels when the heart is called upon to do additional work than just sitting quietly or lying down, and this coronary insufficiency manifests itself by intense pain in the chest, the anginal pain, so-called. . . . And, the coronary insufficiency leads to coronary thrombosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">On August 5, 1954, the appeal board affirmed the denial of the petitioner\u2019s application for accidental death benefits stating that it was not satisfied that she had established her rights to the same and that the decision of the Shrewsbury retirement board was consistent with the facts and the law as applied to those facts. The petition for certiorari was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>filed on July 22, 1955. Before the enactment of the State Administrative Procedure Act, St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1 (now Gr. L. c. 30A), which became effective July 1,1955, certiorari was the appropriate remedy for the correction of errors by the appeal board. <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>309 Mass. 534, 535, and cases cited. <em>Cassier </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>332 Mass. 237, 238. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>332 Mass. 625, 626. Although it was held in <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>335 Mass. 610, 616, that since the enactment of St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, a writ of certiorari does not lie we think that on the facts of the instant case certi-orari may be invoked. Under the procedure act the appeal must have been taken within thirty days after the administrative decision (c. 30A, \u00a7 14 [1]). The procedure act had not become effective when the decision of the appeal board was rendered and the petitioner\u2019s only remedy was by writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">A judge of the Superior Court dismissed the petition ruling that \u201c [t]he writ of certiorari lies only to correct errors in law, and not to revise a decision of a question of fact upon the evidence introduced at the hearing before the Board, or to examine the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding, unless objection was taken to the evidence for incompetency so as to raise a legal question.\u201d It is provided by Gr. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, as amended by St. 1943, c. 374, \u00a7 1, that at the hearing upon <em>\u201c </em>[a] petition for a writ of cer-tiorari to correct errors in proceedings which are not according to the course of the common law ... [i]t shall be open to the petitioner to contend at the hearing upon the petition that the evidence which formed the basis of the action complained of or the basis of any specified finding or conclusion was as matter of law insufficient to warrant such action, finding or conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In view of this statute, the judge was probably wrong in ruling that the writ did not lie to examine the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding, but irrespective of the ruling we think that the petition was rightly dismissed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>Waterman </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>338 Mass. 284, 286. The question presented for the decision of the appeal board was whether the petitioner\u2019s husband, while a member of the contributory retirement system, \u201cdied as the natural and proximate result of a personal injury sustained ... as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties at some definite place and at some definite time.\u201d Gf. L. c. 32, \u00a79 (1), as appearing in St. 1945, e. 658, \u00a7 1. The evidence was sufficient to warrant the appeal board in finding it had not been shown that the death of Chief Mullen was the result of a personal injury sustained as a result of the performance of his duties. See <em>Cataldo </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., ante, </em>312, 314. See also <em>Herlihy\u2019s Case, </em>267 Mass. 232, 234-235.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><em>A </em>conclusion was not required that the coronary attack was the result of present physical exertion or emotional excitement and strain. Cf. <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>337 Mass. 495, 501; <em>McMurray\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 29, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing petition affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
