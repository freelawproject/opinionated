S. 5370, 5371, and amendments thereof. At the September Term, 1917, Chittenden County, <em>Fish, </em>J., presiding, the respondent demurred to the information. To the overruling of the demurrer, and the court\u2019s refusal to pass the case to the Supreme Court before trial on the merits, the respondent excepted. The respondent then entered a plea of not guilty, and there was a trial by jury. Verdict, guilty; and judgment thereon. The respondent excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-13\">The substantial allegations in the three counts of the information are similar. The first count, after alleging that the respondent was not licensed to practice osteopathy, medicine, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>surgery in Vermont, and was not a person excepted from the provisions of the statute, alleges that the respondent, at Burlington in the county of Chittenden, on January 29, 1917, did then and there advertise himself and hold himself out to the public as a physician and surgeon and therein circulated among the people and inhabitants and made public in said Burlington and in divers and many other towns, places and localities in said county of Chittenden, an advertisement or advertisements reading and appearing in manner and form as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">\"CHIROPRACTIC</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">(Ki-ro-prak-tik)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">Spinal Analysis Chart</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUeN\">You need not be Sick</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHR\">Chiropractic Adjusts</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXne\">The Cause of Disease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-8\">and also an advertisement and advertisements reading and appearing in manner and form as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-9\">\u201cWhat is Chiropractic?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-10\">(Ki-ro-prak-tik)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">It is nof Medicine; Not Surgery;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-12\">Not Osteopathy</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-13\">It Deals directly with the Cause of-111 Health</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axr\">\u201c It is a scientific method of adjusting the cause of \u2018 disease \u2019 without drugs or instruments, based on correct knowledge of anatomy, especially the nervous system. The Chiropractic idea is that the cause of so-called \u2018disease\u2019 is in the person afflicted, and the adjustment in overcoming that cause. The function of every organ in the body is controlled by mental impulses from the brain, which it transmits over the nerves. Any impingement of these nerves interfering with the transmission of mental impulses results in an abnormal function commonly called \u2018 disease. \u2019 This interference is produced by subluxated vertebrae pressing upon the nerves as they pass out from the spinal cord. The trained adjuster locates the obstruction or interference, and by means of adjusting the subluxated vertebrae overcomes the cause, and normal condition or health is the result.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-14\">\u201cInvestigation costs nothing, and means health and happiness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-15\">Frank C.

The demurrer was overruled, and to this the respondent excepted. Upon the overruling of the demurrer, the respondent moved to have the case sent to this Court before final trial. This motion was overruled, to which action of the court the respondent excepted. The ease was then tried by jury, and a verdict of guilty was found, and the. case comes here on the exceptions to the overruling of the respondent\u2019s demurrer and motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The only ground <em>ot </em>demurrer stated in the respondent\u2019s brief is that the information does not specifically charge the respondent with having practiced medicine without a license. No such ground is stated in the exceptions nor in the demurrer, and the prosecution is not for practicing medicine contrary to law. The respondent commences his exceptions by saying: <em>\"</em>This is a prosecution against the respondent for advertising and holding himself out to the public as a physician and surgeon.\" It was, therefore, unnecessary to allege that the respondent practiced medicine without a license, and the information was not subject to demurrer for failure to so allege. The point argued is not raised by the exceptions and no other ground of demurrer being stated and relied upon in the respondent\u2019s brief, we do not, to reverse a case, search the record for defects or errors not called to our attention by the respondent. Exceptions not briefed are waived: <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>90 Vt. 41, 96 Atl. 417; <em>Parry &amp; Jones </em>v. <em>Empire Granite Co., </em>90 Vt. 231, 97 Atl. 985; <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>90 Vt. 576, 99 Atl. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The other exception relied upon by the respondent is to the trial court\u2019s refusal to pass the case to this Court before final trial. No authorities are cited in the respondent\u2019s brief supporting this exception and none, we think, can be found. It was a matter wholly within the discretion of the trial court (G. L. 2262), and being within the discretion of the trial court, and it not appearing that that discretion has been abused, it is not reviewable by this Court <em>(Lincoln </em>v. <em>C. V. Ry. Co., </em>82 Vt. 187, 72 Atl. 821, 137 Am. St. Rep. 998; <em>Manley Bros. </em>v. <em>B. &amp; M. R. R. et al., </em>90 Vt. 218, 97 Atl. 674) ; besides the respondent has not been harmed by the court\u2019s refusal to send the case here before final trial, for, being a criminal ease, the demurrer was not waived by going to trial on the merits, and the respondent could be heard on his demurrer as well after as before trial in county court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Bosworth, </em>74 Vt. 315, 52 Atl. 423; <em>State </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>88 Vt. 121, 92 Atl. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">\n<em>Judgment that there is no error and that the respondent take nothing by his exceptions.
