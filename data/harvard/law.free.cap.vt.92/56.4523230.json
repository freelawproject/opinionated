Motion granted and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-14\">After verdict and before judgment, defendant moved in arrest, alleging that the plaintiff had joined in the declaration two separate and distinct causes of action, inconsistent with each other.

Case and trover could always be joined at common law and their joinder does not depend upon any statute. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Ayer </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>9 Pick. 156, 74 Am. Dec. 472, a declaration containing a count in trover was allowed to be amended by adding a count in case. It is stated in 23 Cyc., 391, \u201c Trover and case may be joined, trover being originally an action on the case. So when an action is originally trover, new counts in case may be added by way of amendment.\" In <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Witherell, </em>52 Me. 237, it is held that a declaration containing a count in case may be amended by adding a count in trover. There was no misjoinder in this case and the court in its discretion committed no error in allowing an amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
