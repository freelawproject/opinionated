This case was heard below on a referee\u2019s report and defendant\u2019s exceptions thereto. The exceptions were overruled and judgment rendered for the plaintiff to recover the amount found to have been expended by it in the support of the pauper, L. GL Bush and his wife. Defendant excepted to the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">The evidence taken before the referee, in respect of the intent of the alleged pauper as to residence, is made a part of the report, solely on that question. The ultimate issue was whether the pauper last resided in the defendant town for the space of three years, supporting himself and family, as was necessary by statute (P. S. 3667), in order to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery for the assistance rendered. The assistance was furnished by the plaintiff town, part in February, 1914, and part in April, 1914, when Bush was a resident therein, was poor, and in need thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">At all times mentioned in the findings, Bush had a wife whose needs and poverty increased or were relieved, according as her husband\u2019s poverty and means were increased or relieved, and who shared with him in the benefit of the assistance furnished. Bush and his wife went to defendant town as early as January, 1908, and immediately took up a residence therein, moving upon and occupying a farm, keeping house, supporting themselves, and never received any assistance from the town while either remained therein. In October, 1910, they moved from this farm, taking with them their household goods, storing them in an old building in the town, belonging to one Carl Thompson (whose wife is a cousin of Mrs. Bush), after which Bush and his wife did not keep house in that town. From the time last mentioned until the following April, Mrs. Bush remained with her said cousin for the most part, but visited occasionally among neighbors living in the same town, and continuously resided in that town from January 31, 1908, until April, 1911. Mr. Bush also resided' continuously therein, from January 31, 1908, except as stated below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\">Immediately after leaving the farm as stated above, Mr. Bush made a visit to Derby, remaining about a week, and returning to defendant town where he and his wife continued to visit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>with the Thompsons until after the following January, during which time Bush and his wife helped the Thompsons a bit, and during which time Bush worked out to some extent in the town; but otherwise neither he nor his wife paid the Thompsons anything for their support, nor-did the Thompsons pay them or either of them anything for their assistance. Mrs. Thompson tired of the presence of Mr. Bush as a guest and finally told him to get out, that she had had him there as long as she wanted him. The referee states that he is unable to find that Bush left the Thompsons by reason of the inhospitable suggestion of Mrs. Thompson; but thereafter, pursuant to a previous contract of hiring, Bush, on the first day of January, 1911, went to the plaintiff town to work for one William Graham, leaving his wife at the Thompsons in the defendant town. Bush remained in Glover in the employ of Graham until February 1, 1911, when he completed his work there, but by reason of a heavy snowstorm remained a few days longer, after which he returned to the. Thompsons\u2019, where he stayed a day or so with his wife. From that time on until his final removal from defendant town as mentioned below, the referee states that he is unable to find where Bush kept himself, but he was at the Thompsons\u2019 only a small portion of the period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-3\">In the following April (1911) Bush and his wife, taking their household effects from the old building where stored as stated above, moved from defendant town to plaintiff town, and have ever since remained there. After such removal and prior to March, 1913, the overseer *of the poor of the latter town had occasion to help them, and on February 27, 1914, sent notice to the overseer of the poor of defendant town, in accordance with the provisions of section 3667 of the Public Statutes, concerning which no question is made. The assistance for which re'covery is here sought, was rendered after the giving of -such notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-4\">The referee finds that prior to such removal in April, 1911, Bush had been thinking of so doing, and had been thinking of permanently leaving Greensboro, but was unable to find that he ever definitely determined permanently to abandon that town and take up his residence elsewhere until at the time of his removal with his wife in the month last mentioned. His leaving, that town on previous occasions is found to have been at most but temporary absences, and his residence there is found to have continued from the 31st day of January, 1908, until April, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Defendant excepted to the finding last stated, as not supported by the evidence, and as inconsistent with the other facts found, especially that: \u201cWhen he (Bush) left defendant town and went to plaintiff town January 1, 1911, he went under an agreement to work for Graham two months, but as stated worked only one month, and while at said.Graham\u2019s had no home in defendant town other than with the Thompsons, to whose place he could not return as a matter of right. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-5\"><em>John W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZK\">There can be no doubt, on the facts found, that the alleged poor person was a resident of the town of Greensboro from January 31, 1908, to January 1, 1911, supporting himself and family, within the meaning of the law. The real question is, whether on the day last named, when he went to the town of Glover to work for Graham under a contract- of hire, he changed his residence to that town. If he did, his continuous residence in Greensboro was thirty days short of three years, the time essential to the latter\u2019s liability. But if he did not, then he last resided in that town for the space of. three years, supporting himself and family, and a recovery can.be had for the assistance furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The intention of a person in respect of making a change in his place of residence is important to consider; but it is not alone determinative of the fact of effecting the change. Domicile is not a thing resting wholly in intention, and residence is a fact. <em>Jamaica </em>v. <em>Townshend, </em>19 Vt. 267; <em>South Burlington </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>67 Vt. 411, 31 Atl. 891. The person\u2019s purpose to change, unaccompanied by actual removal or change of residence, does not constitute a change of domicile. The fact and the intent must concur. He must remove without the intention of going back. <em>Mount Holly </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>89 Vt. 301, 95 Atl. 572. To constitute domicile, the fact of residence and the intent to make the place of residence the home of the party must concur. <em>Fulham v. Howe, </em>62 Vt. 386, 20 Atl. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The question of the change of residence in the ease before us was to be determined on all the evidence as to intent, combined with that bearing on the actual removal. We think the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>finding of the referee to which exception was taken, was amply supported by the evidence, and is not justly subject to the criticism made. Nor is such finding inconsistent with the other findings quoted in the exception, that while working for Graham in plaintiff town, Bush \u201chad no home in defendant town other than with Thompson, to whose place he could not return as a matter of right.\u201d One element of the finding objected to being that the occasions when Bush was away from the latter town previous to moving away with his wife in April, 1911, \u201cwere at most but temporary absences,\u201d there is not even color of inconsistency between the two findings, for he had not abandoned that town as the place of his residence. <em>Mount Holly </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>cited above. The exception is not sustained in either respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The exceptions saved in connection with the admission and use of evidence, have not been briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
