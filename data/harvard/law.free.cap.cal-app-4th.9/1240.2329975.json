The jury further found true the alleged enhancements that appellant was statutorily ineligible for probation because he occupied a position of special trust and committed an act of substantial sexual conduct upon his victim (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (a)(9)), and because he employed force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury in committing the section 288 violation (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Appellant was sentenced to prison for the middle term of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Statement of Facts; Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AI6r\">I. <em>Substantial evidence supports a finding of the use of force.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">II. <em>The instructions and jury forms relating to the enhancement allegations were adequate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">\n<em>A. Definition of \u201csubstantial sexual conduct. \u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">Section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(9) bars probation for \u201c[a] person who occupies a position of special trust and commits an act of substantial sexual conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">\u201cSubstantial sexual conduct\u201d includes oral copulation. (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (b).) Consequently, the jury was instructed on \u201coral copulation\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>\u201cAny contact, however slight, between the mouth of one person and the sexual organ of another person constitutes \u2018oral copulation\u2019. Penetration of the mouth is not required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The above definition of \u201coral copulation\u201d was derived from CALJIC No. 10.10 (5th ed. 1988 bound vol.). However, the 1989 revision (5th ed. pocket pt.) of that instruction changed the definition, which now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">\u201c \u2018Oral copulation\u2019 consists of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">\u201c1. Any penetration, however slight, of the mouth of one person by the sexual organ ... of another person, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">\u201c2. When there is no penetration, any <em>substantial </em>contact between the mouth of one person and the sexual organ ... of another person.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">In the instant case, it was clear from the victim S.G.\u2019s testimony there was no penetration by appellant\u2019s penis into S.G.\u2019s mouth. Under the definition of oral copulation read at trial, \u201c[a]ny contact, however slight,\u201d between S.G.\u2019s mouth and appellant\u2019s penis would constitute oral copulation. Under the more recent definition, however, \u201csubstantial\u201d contact between S.G.\u2019s mouth and appellant\u2019s penis would have been required to constitute oral copulation, and therefore substantial sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">The question thus becomes whether the older version of CALJIC No. 10.10 or the newer one represents the true state of the law. If the old version read at trial was not an accurate legal definition of oral copulation, respondent \u201cagrees that the error was prejudicial inasmuch as the evidence was not clear as to whether there was substantial contact or minimal contact between appellant\u2019s penis and [S.G.\u2019s] mouth . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">The CALJIC pocket part makes no explanation for the change in the definition of \u201coral copulation\u201d in instruction Nos. 10.10 through 10.16 and 10.45 through 10.46, except to cite to 2 Witkin and Epstein, California Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) section 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">The aforementioned section of California Criminal Law addresses the legal elements of oral copulation, tracing primarily the question of whether penetration is necessary. Included in this discussion is the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-14\">\u201cOther decisions find <em>substantial contact without penetration </em>sufficient. Thus, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 18, 26 [], the conviction was affirmed on evidence that the male defendant kept his mouth against the female victim\u2019s private parts for 5 to 10 minutes. The <em>Angier </em>case <em>[People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number><em>Angier </em>(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 417] was distinguished on the ground that the equivocal evidence, if it did establish an actual touching, at most showed a single act of kissing or licking a child\u2019s private parts.\u201d (2 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 885-886, italics in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">We have examined the significant cases dealing with marginal oral copulation evidence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Angier </em>(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 417 [112 P.2d 659]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 18 [127 P.2d 309]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hickok </em>(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 621 [216 P.2d 140]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1951) 108 Cal.App.2d 84 [238 P.2d 158]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>(1953) 119 Cal.App.2d 224 [259 P.2d 476]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 507 [97 Cal.Rptr. 774]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Minor </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 194 [163 Cal.Rptr. 501]). Only <em>People </em>v. <em>Minor </em>mentions \u201csubstantial contact\u201d or anything similar, and there the court was saying that substantial contact is <em>not </em>required.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\u201cAppellant contends that the verdict on the charge of forcible oral copulation is not supported by substantial evidence in that there was no evidence of penetration or of substantial sexual contact with the mouth of the victim. This contention cannot be sustained. The offense is complete when, as occurred here according to the testimony of the victim, the mouth is forcibly placed upon the genital organ of another [].\u201d (104 Cal.App.3d at pp. 196-197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">With all due respect to Witkin and Epstein, we conclude the older CALJIC No. 10.10, \u201cAny contact, however slight,\u201d is a more accurate statement of existing case law than is the 1989 revision. Consequently, we find no error in the instruction read below.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">B.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Harris, Acting P.
