(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11352, 11351.5.) He was sentenced to eight years in state prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">I, II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Defendant asserts that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his trial counsel\u2019s comments on his manner during testimony and by counsel\u2019s failure to object to inadmissible evidence. Defendant\u2019s appointed appellate counsel was also his appointed counsel at trial; counsel notes that he raises these issues because his client asks that this court \u201cbe informed of all arguable instances of ineffective assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We believe that there is an inherent conflict when appointed trial counsel in a criminal case is also appointed to act as counsel on appeal. We therefore discourage the practice of allowing such appointments even when, as here, the client signs a declaration under penalty of perjury that he does not believe \u201c. . . there is any reason for another lawyer to review the records of my case regarding potential issues of ineffective assistance of counsel. I do not believe that such issues exist and I make no such request.\u201d We know, of course, that defendant later specifically requested his counsel raise such issues on appeal. In fact, defendant may now be estopped from raising such issues because of his declaration. Such manipulation by a defendant who, from the moment the trial began,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> attempted to use the issue of the adequacy of counsel as a ploy to stall proceedings will undoubtedly result in further proceedings on appeal to keep the \u201cgame\u201d going.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The American Bar Association\u2019s Model Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.7(b) provides: \u201cA lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests ....\u2019\u2019  And, as the comment points out, \u201cThe critical questions are the likelihood that a conflict will eventuate and, if it does, whether it will materially interfere with the lawyer\u2019s independent professional judgment in considering alternatives or foreclose courses of action that reasonably should be pursued on behalf of the client.\u201d (ABA Model Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.7(b); see also rule 3-310(F) Rules Prof. Conduct of State Bar.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The result is often that which is evidenced here; namely, bogus issues are raised without much analysis of whether representation was deficient. Counsel is in the untenable position of urging his own incompetency. (See <em>In re Fountain </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 715, 719 [141 Cal.Rptr. 654].) The issue of effective assistance of counsel is thus left open to further attack without a final resolution. <em>(In re Benoit </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 72, 78 [109 Cal.Rptr. 785, 514 P.2d 97] [habeas corpus available to attack denial of right to effective appeal].) We, therefore, disapprove appointed trial counsel being appointed to represent a defendant on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Haning, Acting P.

(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11370, 11370.2, subd. (a); Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1203.07, subd. (a)(ll), 667.5, subd.

For example, on the morning of trial, defendant requested a continuance in order to hire his own counsel. After a lengthy discussion of defendant\u2019s concerns, the trial court determined the motion was not truly a <em>Marsden </em>request for new counsel and denied the motion for continuance. The court made clear, however, that should defendant appear with new counsel ready to proceed, a substitution would be granted. This never occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
