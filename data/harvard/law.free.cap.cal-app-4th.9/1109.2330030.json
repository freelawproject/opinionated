A.), J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"AVa\">Anita M., mother of the minor, DeLonnie S., seeks review by direct appeal and petition for a writ of mandate of a disposition order, an order that no reunification services were to be provided, an order referring the cause for a permanency planning hearing and an order entered after a permanency planning hearing terminating her parental rights. The writ and the appeal have been consolidated for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Procedural Background and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">On August 27, 1990, one-year-old DeLonnie S. was admitted to Ridgecrest Community Hospital; he had suffered multiple injuries, including extensive bruises or marks over his face, chest, abdomen, thighs, arms and buttocks. He was also diagnosed as suffering from anemia and significant developmental delay. The mother admitted she \u201c \u2018just went off on him and hit him everywhere.\u2019 \u201d The child was immediately placed in protective custody and dependency proceedings were instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">At a jurisdictional hearing held on February 6, 1991, the mother admitted she had physically abused DeLonnie S. and that he was a minor described by Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 300, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The juvenile court dismissed other specific allegations and bases for jurisdiction contained in the petition filed by Kern County Department of Human Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">The juvenile court conducted a dispositional hearing on February 22, 1991, at which time it adjudged DeLonnie S. a dependent child of the court. The court continued the child\u2019s out-of-home placement, having found from clear and convincing evidence that there was a substantial danger to the child\u2019s physical health if he were to be returned home and there were no reasonable means to protect the minor\u2019s physical health without removing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>him from his mother\u2019s physical custody. The mother, by this time, had pled guilty to felony child abuse (Pen. Code, \u00a7 273d) and was serving a four-year prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The court further ordered no reunification services were to be provided to the mother pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (e)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because services would be detrimental to the minor. In making its determination, the court said it had considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201c. . . the age of the child, the degree of parent and child bonding, the length of the sentence imposed upon the mother, the nature of the crime for which the mother is incarcerated, the degree of detriment to the child if services were not offered, as well as the nature of the treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201cThe Court finds in these instances that there has been little bonding between the mother and child. The age of the child is eighteen months. The length of the sentence is four years, but the Court takes judicial notice of the representation by counsel that the sentence as it now stands would probably be at most one year and four months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cThe Court also finds that the nature of the crime is child abuse upon this child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201cThe Court has also taken into consideration reports of the psychological evaluation performed by Dr. Byrum, and particularly with emphasis to the recommendation that there be no reunification pursued, that it would be detrimental to the interest of the child for the Court to make such an order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The court in turn set the matter for permanency planning pursuant to section 366.26 and authorized the county adoptions agency to prepare an adoption assessment of the minor for the section 366.26 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">At the subsequent section 366.26 hearing held on September 4, 1991, the court found by clear and convincing evidence that the minor was likely to be adopted and accordingly ordered the termination of the mother\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>I. Termination of Parental Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We will conclude the order terminating Anita M.\u2019s rights must be reversed because section 366.26 (c)(1) does not authorize the termination under the facts before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Under California\u2019s statutory scheme relating to post January 1, 1989, dependency adjudications, the juvenile court may terminate a parent\u2019s rights when it makes: (1) a finding at the permanency planning hearing that the dependent child is likely to be adopted; and (2) any one of five additional findings listed in subdivision (c)(1) of section 366.26,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> each of which is made at a hearing prior to the permanency planning hearing. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In other words, the fact that a dependent child is likely to be adopted will not by itself support an order terminating parental rights. Rather, in addition the Legislature has identified any one of five specific findings as sufficient bases for a termination order when the dependent child is likely to be adopted. The juvenile court in this case did not make any one of the five findings spelled out in section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">This case reached the permanency planning stage because the juvenile court did not offer the mother reunification services. The court did so after finding under section 361.5, subdivision (e) (see fn. 3, <em>supra) </em>that services for the mother who was incarcerated at the time would be detrimental to the child. The Legislature has specifically recognized the juvenile court\u2019s denial of reunification services to a parent as a sufficient basis for terminating his or her rights. However, the Legislature has also clarified this basis <em>only </em>exists when the juvenile court decides not to provide reunification services pursuant to the terms of section 361.5, subdivision (b)\u2014not subdivision (e) of section 361.5 relied on in this case. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1).) Subdivision (b) of section 361.5 has an entirely different set of requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Moreover, when reunification services are ordered not to be provided, the statutory scheme limits the court\u2019s authority to refer the cause for a permanency planning hearing immediately to cases where the denial of services is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>pursuant to subdivisions (2), (3), (4), or (5) of subdivision (b) of section 361.5. (See subd. (f) of \u00a7 361.5.) This scheme conforms to the provisions of section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1) which refers to subdivision (b) of section 361.5, not subdivision (e), as the only basis for termination when services are not provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Thus, under the current statutory arrangement, when reunification services are not ordered pursuant to subdivision (e)(1) of section 361.5, as in the case at bench, the parent and minor are left in limbo\u2014they are not entitled to reunification services yet the order cannot serve as the basis of terminating the parental relationship; a situation which cries out for legislative correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Respondent urges the court to correct the problem by adding subdivision (e)(1) of section 361.5 to section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1).  We decline to engage in such judicial legislation for two reasons among others. It is not the court\u2019s function to amend duly enacted legislation by judicial fiat. Secondly, we have no way of knowing what the Legislature intended. If called to its attention, the Legislature may correct this oversight in any one of many ways, some of which may be tire elimination or modification of subdivision (e)(1) of section 361.5; adding subdivision (e)(1) to section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1), or it may devise some other arrangement to provide, after a period of time, for a hearing to determine whether reunification services should be provided or to make other findings which could serve as a basis of terminating parental rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>In any event, because subdivision (e)(1) of section 361.5 is not included in section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1) as one of the five bases for terminating parental rights, the judgment terminating parental rights lacks statutory authority and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">II.
