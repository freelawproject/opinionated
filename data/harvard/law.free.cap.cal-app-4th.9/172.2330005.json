J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amn\">We have consolidated these writ petitions arising from similar pretrial motions in unrelated capital cases to resolve these questions: Do the reciprocal discovery provisions of Penal Code section 1054 et seq. require defense disclosure of penalty phase evidence? <em>Yes. </em>Are they constitutional? <em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">In both cases the prosecution served informal requests for discovery pursuant to Penal Code section 1054.5, subdivision (b), part of Proposition 115\u2019s \u201cCrime Victims Justice Reform Act.\u201d Defense counsel reftised to cooperate, and the district attorney brought motions to compel the identification of witnesses to be called in the penalty phases. Defendants answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that such discovery was not authorized under the statutory scheme and would violate various constitutional rights if it were.  The prosecution motion was granted in Daniel Michael Duffy\u2019s case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, but denied in that of Gregory Allen Sturm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Proposition 115, an initiative measure on the June 5, 1990, ballot, was designed to eliminate all or many of the rights of criminal defendants under the state Constitution. (See Prop. 115, \u00a7 3.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among many other things, it added a constitutional provision calling for reciprocal discovery in criminal cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 30.) In addition, implementing statutes were enacted by the initiative: Penal Code section 1054 provides, \u201cThis chapter shall be interpreted to give effect to all of the following purposes: [f] (a) To promote the ascertainment of truth in trials by requiring timely pretrial discovery. H] (b) To save court time by requiring that discovery be conducted informally between and among the parties before judicial enforcement is requested. HD (c) To save court time in trial and avoid the necessity for frequent interruptions and postponements, [f] (d) To protect victims and witnesses from danger, harassment, and undue delay of the proceedings, [f] (e) To provide that no discovery shall occur in criminal cases as except as provided by this chapter, other express statutory provisions, or as mandated by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The Penal Code statutory scheme requires disclosure by both the prosecution (\u00a7\u00a7 1054.1-1054.7) and the defense (\u00a7 1054.3), imposes a continuing duty to disclose on each (\u00a7 1054.7), specifies certain materials not subject to disclosure (\u00a7 1054.6), provides for protective orders (\u00a7 1054.7), and authorizes sanctions to enforce compliance (\u00a7 1054.5, subd. (c)). The prosecution is not entitled to any form of discovery not available to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number> These are the provisions most important to our analysis:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Article I, section 30, subdivision (c) of the state Constitution states, \u201cIn order to provide for fair and speedy trials, discovery in criminal cases shall be reciprocal in nature, as prescribed by the Legislature or by the [Pjeople through the initiative process.\u201d The measure was implemented in Penal Code, section 1054.3, subdivision (a), which requires the defense to \u201cdisclose to the prosecuting attorney . . . H] [t]he names and addresses of persons, other than the defendant, he or she intends to call as witnesses <em>at trial </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Defendants argue the word \u201ctrial\u201d is ambiguous and should not be construed to apply to the penalty phase of a capital case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cTrial,\u201d we are told, does not include proceedings such as restitution hearings, speedy trial and suppression motions, motions to disclose confidential informants, Penal Code section 1368 sanity hearings, or sentencing hearings. The syllogism is complete with the assertion that the penalty phase is merely a sentencing seance where \u201cthe jury decides between one of two punishments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The district attorney more convincingly responds the penalty hearing is but one of three possible phases, i.e., guilt, sanity, and penalty, of a single trial. Penal Code section 190.1 supports that assertion. It states in part, \u201cA case in which the death penalty may be imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be <em>tried </em>in separate <em>phases. . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.) \u201cTried,\u201d of course, implies \u201ctrial.\u201d And \u201cphase\u201d is a word of common understanding and obviously means, in the present context, \u201can aspect or part (as of a situation or activity) being subjected to consideration.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Diet. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>(3d ed. 1981) p. 1694.) Thus, under the plain language of the statutory scheme in place when Proposition 115 was enacted, the jury\u2019s penalty determination was a part of the trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Moreover, the stated purpose of Proposition 115 is \u201cto restore balance to our criminal justice system.\u201d (Prop. 115, \u00a7 1, subd. (c).) To accomplish that goal to the greatest extent possible in a capital case, the penalty phase would have to be included in the reciprocal discovery provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Our conclusion finds persuasive support in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 134 [266 Cal.Rptr. 309, 785 P2d 857], a decision that appeared a few months before Proposition 115 was adopted. (See also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Breaux </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 281, 311, fn. 10 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 81, 821 P.2d 585].) In order to resolve the meaning of \u201ctrial\u201d in the context of the notice requirement of Penal Code section 190.3 (see fn. 8, <em>post), </em>the justices were faced with a task similar to our own: \u201cAs this court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>[1989] 48 Cal.3d 18, 45-46 [255 Cal.Rptr. 631, 767 P.2d 1109]: \u2018The meaning of \u2018trial\u201d varies depending on the context of its use. (See generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Overstreet </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 891, 896[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] [231 Cal.Rptr. 213, 726 P.2d 1288] [lead opn. of Broussard, J.], 902-903 [dis. opn. of Grodin, J., Lucas and Panelli, JJ., cone.].) . . . Where the question of notice arises in the context of the initial trial <em>in which the guilt and penalty phases occur in immediate sequence and thus are part of a unitary proceeding, we have construed \u2018trial\u2019 as the whole proceeding; </em>hence notice must be given in advance of the guilt phase. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 96-97 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127].) Where, however, as here, the notice issue arises in the context of a second trial\u2014i.e., a \u2018retrial\u2019\u2014[] \u2018trial\u2019 must reasonably be construed to mean the judicial proceeding in which the matter in issue is again examined and resolved. Only this construction serves both the evident purpose of the notice provision\u2014viz., \u2018to advise an accused of the evidence against him so that he may have a reasonable opportunity to prepare a defense at the penalty trial\u2019 <em>(Miranda, supra, </em>at p. 96 [1978 law])\u2014and the overriding purpose of section 190.3 that the jury \u2018be made aware of all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>factors bearing on the penalty decision\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>[(1988)] 46 Cal.3d [963,] 987 [251 Cal.Rptr.278, 760 P.2d 475]). We conclude, therefore, that the \u2018trial\u2019 to which former section 190.3 refers embraces the original trial, as defined above, or the retrial, be it of the entire proceeding or the penalty phase only.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>at pp. 177-178, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We note Supreme Court opinions frequently interchange the terms \u201cpenalty phase\u201d and \u201cpenalty trial.\u201d But <em>Thompson </em>compels a conclusion that the guilt and penalty phases are part of a \u201cunitary proceeding\u201d and the words \u201cat trial\u201d should be construed to mean the entire proceeding, including any retrial of an individual phase. This interpretation follows the broad and express purpose of the discovery statute, i.e., \u201c[t]o promote the ascertainment of truth.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1054, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The defense claim that the \u201cpenalty phase does not address itself to any ultimate truth\u201d is disingenuous. True, guilt has been determined, but the life or death decision in a capital case hinges on a series of additional intermediate truths. The jury must sift through the facts in the penalty phase, just as it does when it decides guilt. The panel must also evaluate the substance and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s criminal record, \u201ccharacter, background, history, mental condition and physical condition.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.3.) A defendant is no more entitled to the opportunity to present false, misleading, or otherwise questionable evidence in the penalty phase without fear of detection than any other part of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We are next told that because <em>some </em>of the rights normally associated with the guilt phase (e.g., trial by jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt) are not constitutionally required in the penalty phase, the latter cannot be considered part of the trial. Not so. Even if it lacks feathers, a waddle, or a quack, it still might be a duck. <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 482, 490 [280 Cal.Rptr. 92, 808 P.2d 235] (cone. opn. of Arabian, J.).) The penalty phase is the \u201cjudicial proceeding in which the matter at issue [i.e., life or death] is [] examined and resolved.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 177-178, internal quotation marks omitted.) It is an integral <em>part </em>of a capital prosecution. Accordingly, we conclude the word \u201ctrial\u201d encompasses both the guilt phase and the penalty phase in a capital case and the reciprocal discovery provisions announced in Penal Code section 1054 apply in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">While we express no opinion concerning whether allowing reciprocal discovery of penalty phase evidence in capital cases will produce either a net cost or benefit to the system, there will be some advantages, certainly. It will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>likely \u201csave court time and avoid the necessity for frequent interruptions and postponements\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1054, subd. (c)) because the prosecution can interview and investigate penalty phase witnesses before they are called. Thus, if the parties cooperate, discovery of penalty phase witnesses should usually expedite the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Nothing in the statutory scheme, however, prohibits the defense from responding to a request for disclosure with a good faith explanation that no decision has yet been made as to which witnesses it will call at the penalty phase (see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1054.3, 1054.5, 1054.7). The trial court, in its sound discretion, can sort through those kinds of problems, just\u2014as we shall explain\u2014as it can and should prevent prosecutorial abuse of the new rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In a related contention, defendants argue Penal Code section 190.3 \u201cprovides a penalty phase discovery procedure separate and apart from normal discovery procedures\u201d and notes, \u201c[a] settled rule of statutory construction precludes prosecution under a general statute when a more specific one describes the conduct involved.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Finn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 268, 271 [202 Cal.Rptr. 732]; see 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Introduction to Crimes, \u00a7 62, p. 80; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 475 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Swann </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 447 [28 Cal.Rptr. 830].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Analogizing to the <em>Swann-Gilbert </em>rule, the defense contends, \u201cBecause Penal Code section 190.3 specifically addresses what shall take place regarding discovery in a penalty phase context, that code section is controlling and applies instead of any of [Penal Code section] 1054\u2019s provisions.\u201d We disagree. Section 1054, subdivision (e) precludes <em>nonstatutory </em>bases of discovery; it does not suggest \u201cother express statutory provisions\u201d preempt or supersede discovery under section 1054 et seq. As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[t]he apparent intent underlying [section 190.3] notice [] is to afford capital defendants <em>notice of the evidence actually to be used at the penalty phase without the necessity of resort to the discovery procedures </em>[used] to establish guilt . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 963, 987 [251 Cal.Rptr. 278, 760 P.2d 475], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Penal Code section 190.3 has nothing to do with prosecutorial discovery. Rather, it \u201cseeks to ensure that [a] defendant will not be surprised at trial by aggravating matters of which he received no advance warning. This purpose is accomplished by requiring the prosecution to reveal any matters it may present, and by <em>excluding </em>any proffered incidents of which the defense was not apprised.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Keenan </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 478, 525 [250 Cal.Rptr. 550, 758 P.2d 1081].) The prosecutor\u2019s rights and responsibilities under these sections are \u201cwholly independent\u201d of one another <em>(Izazaga </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 356, 378 [285 Cal.Rptr. 231, 815 P.2d 304], italics omitted), and in this sense the provisions are not in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The defense also complains, \u201cThe sanction sections of [Penal Code section] 1054.5 and [section] 190.3 are directly in conflict. [Section] 1054.5 creates an affirmative obligation on defendant to make an informal request for penalty phase evidence before the [P]eople\u2019s obligation arises. Without such request, the [P]eople are free to withhold all penalty phase evidence. [Section] 1054.5 [subdivision] (b) would allow [them] t[he] evidence of which they have never given notice. A court would be free to sanction a prosecutor one dollar and then allow introduction of the evidence. If the new discovery chapter governs penalty phase evidence, capital defendants] have unwittingly been stripped of their due process rights embodied in Penal Code section 190.3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We cannot agree. Violation of Penal Code section 190.3 breaches an independent prosecutorial duty and warrants a separate sanction. There is no irreconcilable conflict. The prosecution has no obligation to notify the defense of evidence in rebuttal to mitigation under section 190.3, presumably because it does not know how the defense will use its witnesses or evidence, yet is required under Penal Code section 1054.1 to provide names of witnesses it will call in rebuttal. <em>(Izazaga </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 375.) In neither case is the prosecution obliged to turn over names of \u201cwitnesses it [does not] reasonably anticipate[] it is likely to call.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 376, fn. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Finally, it is urged that the absence of a defense obligation to disclose mitigating evidence in Penal Code section 190.3 is controlling. (See <em>In re Fain </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 540, 550 [193 Cal.Rptr. 483].)  But the interpretative maxim <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius\u201d only applies where there is ambiguity or uncertainty in a single statute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Section 190.3 does not require defense disclosure of mitigating evidence; Penal Code section 1054.3 <em>does. </em>We are, consequently, compelled to conclude Proposition 115 did bring reciprocal discovery to the penalty phase of capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We now turn to defendants\u2019 constitutional attack<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>In Izazaga </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 356, our Supreme Court rejected various challenges to the constitutionality of Proposition 115. Specifically, the court found the initiative did no violence to the federal or state privilege against self-incrimination or the rights to due process and counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Defendants, however, assert compelled disclosure of penalty phase evidence violates fundamental principles of due process. Defense evidence, it is urged, \u201cmust be protected in order to ensure that fair [procedures] are utilized in a penalty phase.\u201d The right to present a defense and witnesses on defendants\u2019 behalf is a \u201cfundamental element of due process,\u201d and that right will be violated if state representatives persuade defense witnesses not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">We note the due process clause has relatively \u201clittle to say regarding the amount of discovery which the parties must be afforded . . . .\u201d <em>(Wardius </em>v. <em>Oregon </em>(1973) 412 U.S. 470, 474 [37 L.Ed.2d 82, 87, 93 S.Ct. 2208].) In fact, \u201cnothing in the Due Process Clause precludes States from experimenting with systems of broad discovery designed to achieve these goals. \u2018The adversary system of trial is hardly an end in itself; it is not yet a poker game in which players enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their cards until played. We find ample room in that system, at least as far as \u201cdue process\u201d is concerned, for [a rule] which is designed to enhance the search for truth in the criminal trial by insuring both the defendant and the State ample opportunity to investigate certain facts crucial to the determination of guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 78 [26 L.Ed.2d 446, 90 S.Ct. 1893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Defendants\u2019 claims are, in essence, based on an in terrorem argument, potential prosecutorial misconduct. In support of their position, defendants offer affidavits from counsel in another capital case detailing alleged abuse of the discovery process by one of the district attorney\u2019s investigators.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He allegedly \u201cdestroyed what rapport the defense had cultivated\u201d with a potential witness; ergo, no penalty phase discovery should be allowed in <em>any </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">This contention would support elimination of any prosecution discovery, contrary to Proposition 115 and the modern jurisprudence of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The sky will not fall. Either the district attorney\u2019s office will police any abuse or the courts will do so at the prosecution\u2019s considerable inconvenience, we expect. Nothing could be more outrageous than an attempt to intimidate a witness for either side in a capital case, and trial judges must swiftly and surely rectify abuses. (See also Pen. Code, \u00a7 128.) To summarize, discovery of penalty phase evidence may lead to a violation of due process,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but the procedure itself is not one.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Defendants next contend penalty phase discovery runs afoul of the attorney work product doctrine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Jeanette H. </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 25 [275 Cal.Rptr. 9].) In <em>Jeanette H. </em>our colleagues in the Fifth District held a list of intended witnesses to be called at trial is attorney work product entitled to limited protection: \u201cIn California, courts have identified attorney work product as material which is derivative in character, not ultimate facts but material compiled by the attorney in preparation of his or her case. [Citation.] One appellate court has expressly held a list of intended witnesses is derivative in nature and thus is protected attorney work product during the discovery state of litigation. [][]... <em>City of Long Beach </em>[v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 65] . . . recognizes the exact witnesses an attorney may call at trial depends on what the attorney considers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>be important and relevant facts. The decision to call or not call a witness is made after consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of a case and the legal theory chosen by the attorney. Selection of the witnesses through whom the attorney wishes to present his or her case is an intimate part of the attorney\u2019s mental processes.\" (225 Cal.App.3d at p. 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">But the court also noted the \u201crationale underpinning the work product doctrine <em>does not preclude an ordered exchange of witness lists shortly before trial. </em>The work product rule is intended to encourage thorough preparation for trial and to prevent one attorney from taking advantage of another\u2019s industry and effort.\u201d (225 Cal.App.3d at p. 36, italics added.) We also note, \u201cThere is no privilege for attorney work product in the California Constitution. Because the work product doctrine is not constitutionally founded, there is no basis for a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the new discovery chapter on work product grounds.\u201d <em>(Izazaga </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 381.) Thus, the more specific statutory scheme imposed by Proposition 115 would prevail in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Moreover, new Penal Code section 1054.6 protects the work product privilege: \u201cNeither the defendant nor the prosecuting attorney is required to disclose any materials or information which are work product as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 2018 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or which are privileged pursuant to an express statutory provision, or are privileged as provided by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>Izazaga </em>held Proposition 115\u2019s intent was to recognize the \u201ccore\u201d work product privilege, i.e., \u201c[a]ny writing that reflects an attorney\u2019s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2018, subd. (c); <em>People </em>v. <em>Boehm </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 13, 21-22 [75 Cal.Rptr. 590]) and not the broader qualified work product privilege. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Izazaga, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 382, fn. 19.) We are in no position to disagree. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Defendants also claim penalty phase discovery denies capital defendants equal protection of the laws because their \u201csimilarly situated\u201d noncapital colleagues are not required to make presentencing disclosures. But defendants offer no authority in support of this argument. And by definition, a defendant in a noncapital case is not similarly situated to his capital case counterpart for the obvious reason that the former\u2019s life is not on the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">All capital defendants, as a discrete class, receive the same treatment, frequently obtaining extra protections not afforded other accuseds, such as the right to two defense attorneys (Pen. Code, \u00a7 987, subd., (d)). For purposes of equal protection, no more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Finally, defendants complain that penalty phase discovery compromises the right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Izazaga </em>is dispositive of this issue as well. The opinion notes, \u201cnothing in the new discovery chapter [penalizes] exhaustive investigation [or] chill [s] trial preparation . . . such that criminal defendants would be denied the right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Izazaga </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Defendants insist a \u201chelpful penalty phase witness may be a harmful guilt phase witness\u201d and \u201cpenalty phase evidence embraces impressions, feelings and memories. [] It cannot be analyzed in the same breath as evidence relating to guilt.\u201d This is true, perhaps, but a protective order will provide a sufficient remedy for the first contingency pending the guilt phase determination. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1054.6.) An in camera proceeding may be invoked to resolve such a problem, for example. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1054.7.) In any event, trials frequently present difficult tactical choices. A witness may be helpful on one aspect of the case, but not so good on another. Such dilemmas are routinely faced\u2014and resolved\u2014by trial attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">As to the second point, we note penalty phase discovery is also aimed at testimonial \u201c \u2018half-truths.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Izazaga </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 379.) The memories of witnesses can be more thoroughly tested with full disclosure on both sides. And, to the extent \u201cimpressions and feelings\u201d are relevant in the death determination calculus (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.3, subd. (k)), their genesis should be fair game as well. Division One put it this way: \u201cAn important aim of discovery is to enhance the search for truth while at the same time reduce, if not eliminate, the elements of surprise and gamesmanship from the proceedings.\u201d <em>(Hobbs </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 690.) In sum, the will of the electorate is clear enough and there is no constitutional infirmity in the discovery scheme as applied to the penalty phase of a capital trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue as prayed in GO12303.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The writ petition is denied in GO12309.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Sonenshine, J., and Moore, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">No stays were sought, and the cases went to trial during our consideration of the writ petitions. In an odd coincidence, both involved grisly multiple executions; but each jury deadlocked in the penalty phase. Sturm will face a retrial of the penalty phase (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.4, subd. (b)); Duffy, it appears, will not. Consequently, Duffy\u2019s petition is moot and the district attorney\u2019s nearly so (see fn. 14, <em>post)-, </em>but the issues presented are of considerable public interest and likely to recur in circumstances where, as here, there may be insufficient time to afford full appellate review. Thus, we resolve the questions presented. <em>(Leeb </em>v. <em>DeLong </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 47, 52 [243 Cal.Rptr. 494].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Section 3 purported to add a new provision to the state Constitution, article I, section 24.

We turn first to the language used, giving the words their ordinary and generally accepted meaning. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Knowles </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 175, 182-183 [217 P.2d 1]; see Pen.

Overstreet, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 896; cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 4.) But the new convictions were not for murder, and there was no penalty phase preceding the sentencing hearing left to try in that case.
