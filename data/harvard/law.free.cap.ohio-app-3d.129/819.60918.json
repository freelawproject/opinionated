Crowninshield leased the property to plaintiff Old Town Apartments, Ltd., an Ohio partnership consisting of Crowninshield and defendant Peabody Construction Co., Inc., which undertook the project of converting the buildings into luxury apartments. We refer to Crowninshield and Old Town Apartments collectively as \u201cCrowninshield.\u201d Crowninshield engaged Peabody to be the general contractor, and Peabody, in turn, hired defendant-appellee Campe\u00f3n Roofing &amp; Waterproofing, Inc., as the roofing subcontractor. Crowninshield also hired defendant-appellant Notter, Finegold &amp; Alexander, Inc. (\u201cN.F.A.\u201d), a Massachusetts architectural firm, to prepare construction plans and specifications for the renovation of the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">To recover the damages caused by the faulty roof, Crowninshield originally filed suit in 1987. After the consolidation of two separate cases and numerous amendments of the pleadings, Crowninshield filed a consolidated, unified complaint naming Campe\u00f3n, N.F.A., Peabody, and another company as defendants. These defendants, including N.F.A., filed cross-claims against each other for indemnification and contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Due to settlements between the parties that resulted in the dismissal of various claims, N.F.A. became the sole remaining defendant on the claims asserted by Crowninshield. In March 1993, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of N.F.A. on those claims, holding that they were filed outside the applicable statute of limitations. Crowninshield appealed that judgment to this court. Subsequently, N.F.A. filed an amended cross-claim against Campe\u00f3n, in which it sought indemnification for attorney fees it had incurred, based on language in the subcontract agreement between Peabody and Campe\u00f3n. Campe\u00f3n filed a motion to dismiss the amended cross-claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, and N.F.A. appealed that judgment to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">In a consolidated appeal, this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of N.F.A. on Crowninshield\u2019s claims. But we held that the trial court had converted Campeon\u2019s motion to dismiss N.F.A.\u2019s amended cross-claim into a motion for summary judgment without giving proper notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the parties. Consequently, we reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment granting the motion to dismiss and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings relating to N.F.A.\u2019s cross-claim. On remand, Crowninshield and Campe\u00f3n filed a motion for summary judgment on N.F.A.\u2019s amended cross-claim, and N.F.A. filed its own motion for partial summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Crowninshield and Campe\u00f3n without stating its reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">N.F.A. has filed a timely appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment. Crowninshield and Campe\u00f3n call themselves the appellees in this case. Crowninshield still claims to be a proper party to this appeal even though all claims filed by or against Crowninshield have been resolved. Apparently, as part of a settlement, Crowninshield agreed to provide a defense for Campe\u00f3n. Counsel for Crowninshield is now representing Campeon and all documents filed in the court below and in this court have been filed in both names. But the record does not show that Crowninshield continues to have a present interest in the subject matter of the litigation or that it is a party aggrieved by the final order from which the appeal is taken. Consequently, it has no standing to appeal, and we consider Campeon to be the only appellee in this case. <em>State ex rel. Gabriel v. Youngstown </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 618, 619, 665 N.E.2d 209, 210; <em>Willoughby Hills v. C.C. Bar\u2019s Sahara, Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 24, 26, 591 N.E.2d 1203, 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">N.F.A. presents two assignments of error for review. In its first assignment of error, it states that the trial court erred in granting Campeon\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its amended cross-claim. In its second assignment of error, N.F.A. states that the trial court erred in overruling its motion for partial summary judgment. It argues that, under the plain language of the indemnity provision in the subcontract between Peabody and Campe\u00f3n, Campe\u00f3n must indemnify N.F.A. for its losses subject to a finding that Campe\u00f3n was negligent. We find that this assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">N.F.A. seeks to recover as a third-party beneficiary of a subcontract between Peabody, the general contractor, and Campe\u00f3n, the subcontractor. See <em>Anderson v. Olmsted Util. Equip., Inc. </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 124, 573 N.E.2d 626. We first note that this contract specifically provides that it \u201cshall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d The parties argue extensively over whether Massachusetts or Ohio law should apply. We need not decide that matter, however, because Ohio law and Massachusetts law are substantially the same on the dispositive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The subcontract begins by stating that the subcontractor \u201cagrees to furnish all labor and materials required for the completion of all work\u201d on the \u201cspecifications for roofing and flashing\u201d at the Fourth and Plum Apartments. The indemnity provision specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>\u201cThe Subcontractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Contractor and/or the Owner and Awarding Authority and the Architect and their agents and employees from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses including attorneys\u2019 fees arising out of or resulting from the performance of the work, provided that any such claims, damages, loss or expense (1) is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury to or destruction of tangible property (other than the Work itself) including the loss of use resulting therefrom, and (2) is caused in whole or in part by any negligent act or omission of the Subcontractor, and any sub-Subcontractor, anyone directly or indirectly employed by any of them or anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable, regardless of whether or not it is caused by a party indemnified hereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The interpretation of a written agreement is, in the first instance, a matter of law for the court. If it is clear and unambiguous, the court need not go beyond the plain language of the agreement to determine the rights and obligations of the parties. <em>Aultman Hosp. Assn. v. Community Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 51, 53, 544 N.E.2d 920, 923; <em>Seringetti Constr. Co. v. Cincinnati </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 1, 4-5, 553 N.E.2d 1371, 1375. But if the provisions of a contract are ambiguous and the meaning of a material term is not apparent from the four corners of the contract, an issue of fact exists, making summary judgment inappropriate. <em>Inland Refuse Transfer Co. v. Browning-Ferris Industries of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 321, 322, 15 OBR 448, 448-449, 474 N.E.2d 271, 273-274; <em>Seringetti, supra, </em>at 4-5, 553 N.E.2d at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\"> In the construction of any written agreement, a court\u2019s primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties, which can be found in the language they chose to employ. The court will give common words and phases their ordinary meaning unless the totality of the contract reveals a contrary intent. <em>Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Convention Facilities Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 353, 361, 678 N.E.2d 519, 526. Accord <em>Freelander v. G. &amp; K. Realty Corp. </em>(1970), 357 Mass. 512, 258 N.E.2d 786; <em>Sherman v. Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp., Ltd. </em>(1961), 343 Mass. 354, 178 N.E.2d 864; <em>Nelson v. Hamlin </em>(1927), 258 Mass. 331, 155 N.E. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The indemnification provision here begins by stating that Campeon will indemnify certain entities including \u201cthe Architect\u201d for all claims \u201carising out of or resulting from the performance of the work[.]\u201d The parties argue vociferously over whether N.F.A. was \u201cthe Architect\u201d referred to in the subcontract and whether its furnishing of the construction plans and specifications met the definition of \u201cthe work\u201d provided in the contract. Though we find those terms to be ambiguous, we do not find that conclusion to be dispositive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The indemnity provision goes on to place two conditions on indemnification. The first states that the loss must be \u201cattributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury to or destruction of tangible property (other than the Work itself) including the loss of use therefrom[.]\u201d Campe\u00f3n argues that N.F.A.\u2019s cross-claim is outside the scope of the indemnity clause because N.F.A. seeks indemnification in connection with Crowninshield\u2019s original claims for damages, which involved \u201cthe Work itself.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The subcontract between Campe\u00f3n and Peabody specifically incorporates the provisions of the general contract between the owner, Old Town Apartments, and the general contractor, Peabody. That contract, in turn, incorporates Document A201 of the American Institute of Architects, \u201cGeneral Conditions of the Contract for Construction.\u201d The general conditions state that \u201c[t]he Work comprises the completed construction required by the Contract Documents and includes all labor necessary to produce such construction, and all materials and equipment incorporated or to be incorporated in such construction.\u201d All claims for damages in this suit, out of which N.F.A.\u2019s claim for attorney fees arises, relate to the faulty construction of the roof. These claims fall under the definition of \u201cthe Work\u201d in the contract. See <em>Zurich Gen. Acc. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co. v. Liberman </em>(C.P.1947), 47 Ohio Law Abs. 300, 71 N.E.2d 281. Compare <em>Hillman v. Leland E. Burns, Inc. </em>(1989), 209 Cal.App.3d 860, 257 Cal.Rptr. 535 (contractor\u2019s employee killed in construction accident). Under the plain language of the indemnity provision, claims for damages to tangible property must be for \u201cother than the Work itself.\u201d Consequently, N.F.A.\u2019s claim for indemnification falls outside the scope of the indemnity provision, and it cannot recover on its amended cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">We find no issues of material fact. Construing the evidence most strongly in N. F.A.\u2019s favor, we hold that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion - that N.F.A. is not entitled to indemnity. Campe\u00f3n was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in its favor. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47. Accordingly, we overrule both of N.F.A.\u2019s assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b860-9\">Sundermann, P.J., Doan and Marianna Brown Bettman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
