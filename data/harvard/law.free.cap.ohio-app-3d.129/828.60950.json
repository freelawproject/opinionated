Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">On January 25, 1997, two men wearing masks entered a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant prior to its regular business hours and demanded money from the manager on duty. The men had guns, which they pointed at the manager, Tanisha Poellnitz. Poellnitz turned over all of the money that was available. Another employee, Cedric Wilson, was in the store at the time, but Poellnitz did not see him while the robbery was taking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">A third employee, Zakia Rashid, arrived at the store while the robbery was in progress. She could see the two men from the front door, and she immediately returned to her mother\u2019s car and told her mother what was happening. Rashid and her mother drove to a nearby telephone and called 911. They both saw two men running across the parking lot of the shopping center where the restaurant was located. Rashid reported the robbery, but she did not identify either of the perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">When the robbers saw Rashid, they left the store through the drive-through window. Poellnitz called 911 and reported the robbery. She described the two men but did not state that she recognized either one of them. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and began questioning the witnesses. The police report submitted from the interview with Poellnitz contained Poellnitz\u2019s description of the robbers as well as her stated belief that her coemployee, Wilson, was involved in the robbery in some way. At some point in the interview, she stated that she thought she recognized the voice of one of the robbers as that of defendant-appellant Alfred Julian.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">After the date of the robbery, one of the police officers assigned to the case went to Rashid\u2019s high school and had her summoned from class to meet with him privately. At that meeting, Rashid signed an affidavit in which she declared that she recognized the two men who had robbed the store as Julian and Mitchell Workman.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">Wilson was interrogated several times about the robbery after Poellnitz indicated that she thought that he was involved in the offense. Ultimately, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Wilson gave a taped confession to the police indicating his involvement in the robbery scheme and implicating Julian and Workman. Wilson claimed that he was supposed to unlock the front door for Julian and the other man, but claimed that he did not do so because the door was already unlocked. He denied any other involvement. Based on the statements by Poellnitz, Rashid and Wilson, Julian was arrested and charged with robbing the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">II. Trial Testimony and Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">At trial, Poellnitz and Rashid both stated that they did not recognize either of the two masked men who robbed the restaurant. While each acknowledged that she had told a police officer that Julian was involved, each testified that her identification was based on information told to her by someone else. When Poellnitz and Rashid repudiated their previous identifications, the state was permitted to use their prior statements to show that their trial testimony conflicted with the information they had given to the police. However, each adamantly maintained at trial that she could not identify Julian as one of the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The state also attempted to call Wilson and Workman to testify at Julian\u2019s trial. Both claimed a Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse to testify, which the trial court acknowledged. The state then called to the stand the police officer to whom Wilson had made his confession and had the officer identify the tape on which the confession was recorded. The state requested that the tape be played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Counsel for Julian objected. There ensued repeated, lengthy arguments regarding the admissibility of the taped statements. The state claimed that the statements were admissible under Evid.R. 804(B)(3), since the declarant, Wilson, was unavailable to testify and the taped statements were against Wilson\u2019s penal interest. Counsel for Julian argued that some but not all of the statements by Wilson were against his penal interest, and that the tape should not be played for the jury. The trial court ruled that the statements on the tape were against Wilson\u2019s interest and that adequate indicia of reliability existed to permit admission of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Julian was found guilty *of robbery and aggravated robbery. He appeals from his convictions, raising three related assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">III. First Assignment of Error: The Trial Court Erred by Permitting the Taped Statements of a Co-defendant to be Played to the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Julian claims that the trial court erred when it allowed the state to play the taped statements of Wilson, who refused to testify at trial, because the out-of-court statements were inadmissible hearsay. Julian argues that admission of these statements violated his right to confront the witnesses against him as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>secured by the Ohio and federal Constitutions. The trial court permitted the admission of Wilson\u2019s statements pursuant to Evid.R. 804(B)(3) and <em>State v. Gilliam </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 17, 635 N.E.2d 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Evid.R. 804(B)(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-5\">\u201c(B) Hearsay exceptions. The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-6\">\u201c(3) Statement against interest. A statement that * * * at the time of its making * * * so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, * * * that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability, whether offered to exculpate or inculpate the accused, is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">The admission and use of one co-defendant\u2019s statements against another was directly addressed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State v. Gilliam,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the case upon which the trial court primarily based its decision. The Ohio Supreme Court relied heavily on United States Supreme Court precedent in holding that an out-of-court statement made by a co-defendant was admissible against the other defendant, without violating the Confrontation Clause, when the defendants were accorded separate trials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the court in <em>Gilliam, </em>\u201cthe Confrontation Clause requires a showing that [the declarant] is unavailable and that the statement bears adequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following United States Supreme Court precedent, the <em>Gilliam </em>court held that \u201c[t]he reliability standard can be satisfied without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">In <em>Gilliam, </em>Moore was a co-defendant in a robbery case, and he informed the police that he, Gilliam and another person, Treadwell, drove to a store with the intent to rob it. He also stated that he stayed in the car until Gilliam and Treadwell returned with the money, and then the three of them left. Moore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>refused to testify at Gilliam\u2019s trial, citing his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to provide evidence that tended to incriminate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Moore\u2019s refusal to testify made him \u201cunavailable\u201d for the purposes of the hearsay rule. The court held that his statements, referred to above, fell within the hearsay exception that permits admission of \u201cstatements against interest,\u201d Evid. R. 804(B)(3). Since Moore\u2019s statements regarding his involvement in the robbery tended to subject him to criminal liability, the court held that his confession to the police constituted a \u201cstatement against interest\u201d and was therefore admissible against Gilliam without violation of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">In this case, the court permitted, over defense counsel\u2019s objections, the admission of the entire colloquy between the investigating officer and Wilson. Review of the tape reveals that Wilson\u2019s statements, like Moore\u2019s statements in <em>Gilliam, </em>tended to subject him to criminal liability. The exchange occurred as follows (exactly as the transcript of the tape reads):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">\u201c[Officer]: Ok, why don\u2019t you tell me from the beginning to end what took place and who all was involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-8\">\u201c[Wilson]: Ah right, it started like (pause) ya undastand, we woke up I mean I got up, ya undastand and I met, met up with [Julian], ya unnastan, over a, ya unnastan I met up with [Julian] like he was walking down the street, and ya know I just met him up in the court. An den we drove up da street and [Workman] he was walkin down da street. Ya unnastan, den we went back down ta [Workman\u2019s] house, Ya unnastan, and den, I went to work. Then [Julian]* * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">\u201c[Officer]: flow\u2019d ya get to work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">\u201c[Wilson]: They dropped me off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-11\">\u201c[Officer]: In your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-12\">\u201c[Wilson]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-13\">\u201c[Officer]: Ok, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-14\">\u201c[Wilson]: An then, ya unnastan they left, I mean they left and went back to [Workman\u2019s] house, to get the guns. Then they came back. Then they came in * * * ya unas * * * they came in cause the door was already unlocked. They just came in, bofe of um came over the counter * * * and then [Julian] told him to get down, ya unnastan, cause he was on top of the counter fa too long, ya unnastan, pointin a gun.

An den when they went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>around, when they went around the buildin, ya unnastan Zakia was goin across the lot * * * an ya unnastan they had already took their masks off, ya unnastan. An Zakia know um just as well as * * * as well as I do, so she know um from face description anytime anywhere, so * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">\u201c[Officer]: Ok an who are the other two, Alfred Julian * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-6\">\u201c[Wilson]: Alfred Julian and Mitchell Workman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-7\">\u201c[Officer]: Ok * * * and was it the, when was it was it that you guys had talked about it or when was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-8\">\u201c[Wilson]: Yeah, it was like ya unnastan it just came up * * * out da blue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-9\">\u201c[Officer]: Ok * * * that they were gonna do it Saturday morning that morning * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-10\">\u201c[Wilson]: Naw it wadn\u2019t even like, it was like any time, morning or night, whichever came first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-11\">\u201c[Officer]: Ok * * * but your job was ta unlock the door but you didn\u2019t have ta unlock * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-12\">\u201c[Wilson]: I didn\u2019t * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-13\">\u201c[Officer]: Cause it was already unlocked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-14\">\u201c[Wilson]: It was already cause like when I came into the store, it was like the manager Tanisha, she let me in * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-15\">\u201c[Officer]: Ok.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-16\">\u201c[Wilson]: Ya unnastan, but like * * * she went in front of me and I was behind her and I never turned around ta lock the door so it was like my job was done * * * from, from blank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-17\">\u201c[Officer]: Ok * * * Ok, that\u2019ll conclude the interview.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-18\">Wilson\u2019s statements tended to subject him to criminal liability, despite his attempts to minimize his involvement in the scheme. In his statements to the police, Wilson admitted that he, Workman and Julian concocted a plan to rob the store and that his job was to ensure their easy entrance. Wilson also admitted that he knew that Workman and Julian went to obtain guns for the robbery after they dropped him off at work. The' overall incriminating nature of Wilson\u2019s statements to the police made the statements admissible pursuant to <em>Gilliam. </em>The trial court therefore did not err in admitting the taped statements of Julian\u2019s co-defendant against Julian in his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-19\">We recognize that shortly before the <em>Gilliam </em>case was decided, the United States Supreme Court issued an opinion discussing the admissibility of co-defendants\u2019 statements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Williamson, </em>the court indicated that whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>out-of-court statement offered against the accused was admissible depended upon whether each individual statement came within a hearsay exception, not whether the entire statement or confession was, in general or as a whole, against the declarant\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The co-defendant in <em>Williamson </em>had given a lengthy statement to the police that included not only information incriminating himself but also information inculpating the defendant. Referring to the underlying reasons for the hearsay rules and their exceptions, the court noted that the exception for statements against interest is based on the notion that \u201creasonable people, even reasonable people who are not especially honest, tend not to make self-inculpatory statements unless they believe them to be true.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This makes such statements more reliable than most hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">However, an accused\u2019s statements to the police incriminating <em>others </em>and exculpating himself are not necessarily against the declarant\u2019s interest and therefore might not be reliable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court recognized that an accused may make statements incriminating his cohorts to curry favor with the authorities or to shift the blame from himself to others. Thus, even in the context of a confession that, overall, exposed the declarant to criminal liability, the <em>Williamson </em>court held that only those particular statements that were against the declarant\u2019s interest fell within the hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The only decision by the Supreme Court of Ohio referring to <em>Williamson, </em>as of the date of release of this decision, is <em>State v. </em>Tucker.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Tucker, </em>the court emphasized that the <em>Williamson </em>decision was based on an interpretation of the federal evidentiary rules and did not implicate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. The <em>Tucker </em>court ultimately held that it did not have to reach the applicability of <em>Williamson </em>or the admission of the co-defendant\u2019s statements since the overwhelming weight of the evidence independently supported Tucker\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Because the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Tucker </em>indicated that the rule set forth in <em>Williamson </em>was not of constitutional proportion and declined, although given the opportunity, to adopt <em>Williamson\u2019s, </em>reasoning, we continue to follow the plain language of <em>Gilliam. </em>Based on <em>Gilliam, </em>the statements were properly admitted at the trial and could have been considered by the jury in determining Julian\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>For all of the foregoing reasons, we overrule Julian\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">IV. Second and Third Assignments of Error: Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Julian\u2019s second assignment of error states that the trial court erred in overruling his Crim.R. 29 motion, made at the close of the state\u2019s case, and his third assignment claims that the verdict was not supported by sufficient evidence. Because the standards for reviewing the court\u2019s denial of a Crim.R. 29 motion and for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence against a defendant are substantially the same, we consider these assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">A motion pursuant to Crim.R. 29 should be granted only when reason-. able minds cannot fail to find reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To reverse a conviction for insufficient evidence, a reviewing court must be persuaded, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Ample evidence was presented against Julian which, if believed by the jury, would have warranted a reasonable person in finding that all of the elements of the crimes with which Julian was accused were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Poellnitz provided a clear recitation of the events as they occurred on that day, and her testimony was corroborated by Rashid and Wilson. Although denying at trial that she could identify the robbers, she did admit that she told the police at the time of the robbery that she recognized the voice and teeth of one of the gunmen as those of Julian.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">Rashid\u2019s testimony of the events of the robbery was consistent with Poellnitz\u2019s. Rashid initially provided police with a signed, sworn statement that she had seen the robbers running away from the store and that, when they removed their masks, she recognized them as Julian and Workman. Although she recanted her testimony at trial regarding the identity of the robbers, her prior statement, being a sworn statement, was appropriate substantive testimony for the jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>consider. It was within the jury\u2019s province to credit the statement that Rashid gave shortly after the robbery rather than her repudiation on the stand at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Wilson\u2019s statements provided critical evidence establishing the plan that he, Workman and Julian decided upon for the robbery, and his statements about the implementation of that plan were consistent with the descriptions given by Rashid and Poellnitz about that morning\u2019s events. Poellnitz\u2019s and Rashid\u2019s eyewitness testimony, Rashid\u2019s sworn statement identifying Julian as one of the robbers, and Wilson\u2019s confirmation of the planned robbery and Julian\u2019s role in the plan provided sufficient evidence to warrant a conclusion that Julian\u2019s guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Julian\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">We overrule all of Julian\u2019s assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b873-9\">SuNDERMANN, P.J., COnCUrS.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b873-10\">Painter, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-9\">. <em>State v.
