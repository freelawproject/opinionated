The owner of the vehicle was underinsured. Jessica\u2019s parents are divorced and she resided principally with her mother, appellant Donna Clark, who is administrator of Jessica\u2019s estate. Jessica\u2019s father, Michael Roeser, owned an insurance policy issued by appellee, Grange Mutual Casualty Company, with $100,000/$300,000 limits for uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage. This policy provided coverage against losses caused by an uninsured/underinsured motorist, \u201c * * * for' bodily injury * * *, including death, suffered by any person insured under the policy * * The policy further defined \u201cinsured\u201d as the.policyholder (Roeser) and any \u201cfamily member.\u201d The policy defines a \u201cfamily member\u201d as a person related to the policyholder by blood, marriage or adoption, \u201c * * * and whose principal residence is at the location shown in the Declarations.\u201d The declarations page recited Michael Roeser\u2019s Clyde, Ohio, address.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">When appellee denied appellant\u2019s claim for coverage, appellant brought the suit that underlies this appeal., Following discovery, appellee moved for summary judgment asserting that Michael Roeser\u2019s daughter\u2019s principal residence was not with him. Consequently, appellee argued that she was not an insured within the language of the policy and was, therefore, outside its uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage. On this ground, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion. Appellant now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Pursuant to Loc.App.R. 12(C), we <em>sua sponte </em>transfer this matter to our accelerated docket and, hereby, render our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Citing <em>Holt v. Grange Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 401, 683 N.E.2d 1080, appellant argues that the denial of coverage in this matter violates the spirit of R.C. 2125.02 which deems Michael Roeser as one who is presumed to have suffered damages by reason of his daughter\u2019s wrongful death. While conceding that this is permitted by R.C. 3937.18, appellant nevertheless argues that the statute is unconstitutional as it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution, Section 2, Article I; the constitutional prohibition against limiting tort damages, Section 19(A), Article I, Ohio Constitution; and abrogates the right to remedy found in Section 16, Article I, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\"><em>Holt </em>is distinguishable as that case involved denial of coverage for the wrongful death of an insured. Here, the decedent was not an insured under the policy, but a relative of the insured. With respect to appellant\u2019s constitutional arguments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>we have already considered and rejected these arguments. <em>Estate of Maata v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co. </em>(July 25, 1998), Lucas App. No. L-96-399, unreported, 1997 WL 430841; <em>Waite v. Progressive Ins. Co. </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 344, 714 N.E.2d 981; see, also, <em>Ott v. Borchardt </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 152, 711 N.E.2d 1066; and <em>Beagle v. Walden </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 59, 676 N.E.2d 506, concurring opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Accordingly, both of appellant\u2019s assignments of error are found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The judgment of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">\n<em>Judgment affii\"med.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b882-8\">Handwork, P.J., and Knepper, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
