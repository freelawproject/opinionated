Reese appeals from the judgment rendered in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, affirming an administrative decision rejecting Reese\u2019s proposed zoning changes. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-17\">Reese owns a salvage business located at 1835 Knox Boulevard, Copley Township. He has owned the seven-acre plot on which the business sits since 1977. On September 27, 1995, Reese applied to the Copley Township Zoning Commission for a zoning change covering the parcel he owns. Reese proposed that the zoning classification be changed from O-C (Open Space and Conservation) to C \u2014 4 (Intensive Automotive Oriented Commercial). Reese appeared at three township meetings in support of his application. The Copley Township Zoning Commission (\u201ccommission\u201d) considered the application and recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>that the Copley Board of Trustees (\u201cboard\u201d) deny the application. Following a public hearing, the board denied Reese\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">On December 5, 1996, Reese, filed a complaint for an administrative appeal with the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, seeking a judgment ordering the rezoning of his property from O-C to <em>C-4, </em>or permitting his continued business use at the premises. On August 28, 1997, the Summit County Court of Common Pleas affirmed the board\u2019s decision. Reese appealed to this court, assigning three errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Reese\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">\u201cThe decision of the Copley Township Board of trustees and the lower court is not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and is therefore, unconstitutional, arbitrary, capricious and illegal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">When reviewing an administrative decision, a common pleas court acts in a \u201climited appellate capacity.\u201d <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 343, 587 N.E.2d 835, 838-839; <em>Diversified Benefit Plans Agency, Inc. v. Duryee </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 495, 499, 655 N.E.2d 1353, 1355-1356. R.C. 2506.04 addresses the scope of the common pleas court\u2019s review of an administrative decision and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\"> \u201cThe court may find that the order, adjudication, or decision is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. Consistent with its findings, the court may affirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the order, adjudication, or decision, or remand the cause to the officer or body appealed from[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Decisions of a board of zoning appeals are presumed to be valid. <em>C. Miller Chevrolet, Inc. v. Willoughby Hills </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 298, 67 O.O.2d 358, 313 N.E.2d 400, paragraph two of the syllabus. If there is in the record a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence to support the administrative decision, the common pleas court must affirm. <em>Dudukovich v. Lorain Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 207, 12 O.O.3d 198, 201-202, 389 N.E.2d 1113, 1116-1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">The common pleas court\u2019s finding of whether the agency\u2019s decision is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence is essentially a \u201cquestion of the absence or presence of the requisite quantum of evidence.\u201d <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 67, 407 N.E.2d 1265, 1267, citing <em>Andrews v. Ohio Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 275, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>58 O.O. 51, 131 N.E.2d 390. A common pleas court is required to give \u201cdue deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When reviewing the common pleas court\u2019s decision, an appellate court must determine whether the lower court accorded due deference to the agency in finding that the decision was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. <em>Joudah v. Ohio Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 614, 617, 641 N.E.2d 288, 290, citing R.C. 119.12 and <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 343-344, 587 N.E.2d 835, 838-839. In making this determination, an appellate court should use an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 260-261, 533 N.E.2d 264, 266-268; <em>Bottoms Up v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 726, 728, 596 N.E.2d 475, 476. \u201cAbuse-of-discretion\u201d is more than an error of law or judgment; it implies a decision that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1142. In other words, a common pleas court abuses its discretion when its decision is without reasonable basis or is clearly wrong. <em>Qualls v. Akron Civ. Serv. Comm. </em>(June 18, 1997), Summit App. No. 17977, unreported, at 3-4, 1997 WL 379910, 1997 WL 379910.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Reese argues that the common pleas court\u2019s decision in the case at bar was supported by less than the requisite quantum of evidence. We disagree. Commission members personally studied the property before recommending to the board that it deny Reese\u2019s request to rezone the property to a C-4 \u201cIntensive and Automotive Oriented Commercial District.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Summit County Planning Commission reviewed the property and found that the uses for the land surrounding the property were residential, farming, and vacant land consistent with an OC \u201cOpen Space and Conservation District\u201d zoning designation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The same body\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>finding that the high water table, instability, and seepage make the soil at the property unsuitable for most urban uses, including that of a salvage yard, also supported the board\u2019s refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Reese presented a \u201cWetlands and Soils Assessment\u201d of five acres of his property prepared by ACRT, Inc., a local environmental survey company, which stated that the wetlands area on the property was very small and not a constraint to development or the current use of the property. Reese also presented a petition signed by neighbors, describing the O-C zoning designation as unrealistic in view of existing uses of property in the area. The record also contains letters from other neighbors opposed to Reese\u2019s proposed rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving due deference to the board\u2019s resolution of evidentiary conflicts. Reese\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Reese\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">\u201cThe decision of the Copley Township Trustees and the lower court is tantamount to reverse spot zoning and bears no reasonable relationship to the police power of the township and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary and capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">The zoning regulation Reese sought to change was in place before Reese purchased his property. Reese argues that the township\u2019s refusal to change zoning regulation is unconstitutional. \u201cA zoning regulation is presumed to be constitutional unless determined by a court to be clearly arbitrary and unreasonable and without substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community.\u201d <em>Goldberg Cos., Inc. v. Richmond Hts. City Council </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 207, 690 N.E.2d 510, syllabus. The party challenging the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance bears the burden of proof and must prove unconstitutionality beyond fair debate. <em>Id. </em>at 209, 690 N.E.2d at 511-512. As discussed above, the common pleas court had before it sufficient evidence to show that the board\u2019s decision to retain the existing zoning regulation was not arbitrary. The same evidence shows that Reese could not prove beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>fair debate that the board\u2019s retention of the zoning regulation was clearly arbitrary. Reese\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Reese\u2019s third assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">\u201cThe lower court abused its discretion by upholding the decision of the Copley Township Board of Trustees even though Copley Township never enacted a comprehensive plan nor conducted any studies before enacting such restrictive zoning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">A township\u2019s failure to have a comprehensive zoning plan which is separate and distinct from a zoning ordinance does not render unconstitutional a zoning ordinance. <em>BGC Properties, L.P. v. Bath Twp. </em>(Mar. 21, 1990), Summit App. No. 14252, unreported, at 8, 1990 WL 31789; see, also, <em>Cent. Motors Corp. v. Pepper Pike </em>(1979), 63 Ohio App.2d 34, 65, 13 O.O.3d 347, 367-368, 409 N.E.2d 258, 279. It follows that a township zoning board\u2019s decision to uphold a zoning ordinance cannot be invalidated merely because the township does not have a comprehensive zoning plan. The rest of Reese\u2019s arguments pertaining to this assignment of error assail the alleged lack of relation between the zoning classification and the township\u2019s legitimate interests in the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the township, and were dealt with above. Reese\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-10\">Slaby, P.J., and Reece, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-5\">.
