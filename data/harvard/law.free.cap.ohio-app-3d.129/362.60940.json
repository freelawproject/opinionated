We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Hausch was employed by appellee Alside, Inc. (\u201cEmployer\u201d) as a sales assistant. On May 21, 1985, Hausch sustained an injury to her back while working. She filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim that was granted for \u201cherniated L-5 disc left.\u201d After an appeal by Employer was denied by the Industrial Commission, Employer appealed to the Medina County Court of Common Pleas for trial <em>de novo. </em>In response, Hausch filed a complaint on January 8, 1996, and Employer answered. On May 1, 1997, after discovery, Hausch moved to amend her complaint to allow the trial court to hear evidence of additional injuries to her back that were not the subject of the claim heard by the Industrial Commission. Employer responded in opposition to the motion. On May 13, 1997, the trial court denied Hausch\u2019s motion to amend her complaint. The matter was resolved on the merits on June 27, 1997, in favor of Employer. Hausch now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Hausch asserts one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">\u201cIt was error for the trial court, in this workers\u2019 compensation appeal, to deny the claimant leave to file an amended complaint placing in\u2019 issue new conditions for the same part of the body on the ground that they had never previously been presented to the Industrial Commission for its consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Hausch argues that the trial court erred by denying her motion to amend her complaint. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\"> A trial court\u2019s decision denying leave to amend a pleading will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Wilmington Steel Prods., Inc. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 573 N.E.2d 622, 624-625. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment, but instead demonstrates \u201cperversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency.\u201d <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748, 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">In <em>Blake v. Mihm </em>(Aug. 23, 1995), Summit App. No. 17043, unreported, 1995 WL 499782, a workers\u2019 compensation claim was appealed to the common pleas court by the employer. The claimant sought to present evidence of injury claims not presented to the Industrial Commission, and the trial court refused to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the evidence. We held that the trial court did not err. \u201cAlthough the common pleas court has the authority to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review, the issue decided by the industrial commission was the only issue properly before it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Hausch acknowledges <em>Blake </em>but asks us to revisit the issue and follow the reasoning of the First District Court of Appeals in <em>Grant v. Ohio Dept. of Liquor Control </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 76, 619 N.E.2d 1165. We decline Hausch\u2019s invitation and adhere to our holding in <em>Blake. </em>Because Hausch\u2019s amended complaint sought to introduce issues that were not before the Industrial Commission when it heard Hausch\u2019s claim, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying her leave to amend her complaint. Hausch\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Hausch\u2019s assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the Medina County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b400-8\">Slaby, P.J., and Carr, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
