Because the undisputed facts show that the decedent was removed in both time and space from any rescue attempt, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">On July 25, 1995, appellee Phillip S. Poinsatte was driving a delivery van owned by appellee Poinsatte Motors when he ran a stop sign and collided with another van at the intersection of U.S. 20 and Ohio Route 49 in Williams County. The collision sheared off an electrical pole and left Phillip Poinsatte\u2019s vehicle on its side and the other van upside down.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">A few minutes later, Timothy Minser came upon the scene, as Minser had agreed to meet his former wife, nurse Cindy Abate, at the intersection to exchange the couple\u2019s child following visitation. Phillip Poinsatte testified at deposition that when Minser arrived he helped Poinsatte and the driver of the other van extricate a passenger trapped in the upside-down van. At some point, Cindy Abate also arrived and began to provide medical attention to the. men from the overturned van. Poinsatte testified that shortly thereafter a police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>arrived and warned Poinsatte, in Minser\u2019s presence, to avoid the power wires downed during the accident. A few minutes later, Poinsatte reported hearing a loud pop followed by screams. When he looked, Poinsatte observed Minser, his left hand raised, grabbing a downed live power wire. Minser was some twenty-five feet from the overturned van when he was electrocuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Cindy Abate\u2019s account varied from Poinsatte\u2019s in some respects. Abate, in her affidavit, recalled arriving at the scene before Minser. She immediately began to aid the two occupants of the van who had already been removed from the overturned vehicle. Later, Minser arrived to offer help and, at Abate\u2019s request, obtained a flannel shirt to place under the head of one of the injured. According to Abate, no police were on the scene and emergency medical technicians were only just arriving when Minser came into contact with the live wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Following Timothy Minser\u2019s death, appellant, Janet L. Minser, brought a wrongful death and survivorship action against appellees on behalf of Minser\u2019s estate. In the trial court, appellees moved for summary judgment. Appellees argued that a tortfeasor\u2019s duty to a third party, arriving after the results of the primary negligent act are complete, exists only to the extent that the third party attempts to become a rescuer to someone in peril as a result of the original negligence. See Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5 Ed.1984) 307-308. Appellees contend that when Minser was electrocuted, he was no longer involved in any rescue attempt and, in any event, his own negligence in failing to avoid the downed power line was an intervening and superseding cause of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Appellant responded to appellees\u2019 motion by submitting Cindy Abate\u2019s affidavit, arguing that summary judgment was inappropriate because questions of fact existed as to whether a police officer was at the scene prior to Minser\u2019s electrocution and whether the police warned Minser of the danger from the downed power line.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The trial court granted summary judgment, concluding that Timothy Minser did not fall within the \u201crescue doctrine.\u201d Additionally, the trial court ruled that Minser\u2019s own act of picking up a \u201chot\u201d wire was an intervening and superseding cause which severed the chain of causation between appellee Phillip Poinsatte\u2019s negligence and Minser\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Appellant now appeals, setting forth the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">\u201c1. The Trial Court erred in granting defendants-appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on the rescue doctrine as genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Timothy Minser (\u2018Minser\u2019) reasonably believed that the occupants of the van were still in peril because of the downed power lines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201c2. The Trial Court erred in granting defendants-appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment since genuine issues of material fact exists as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Minser\u2019s conduct in attempting to move the power lines was an intervening, superseding cause of his death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">On review, appellate courts employ the same standard for summary judgment as trial courts. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198, 199-200. The motion may be granted only when it is demonstrated \u201c(1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made,' who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47; Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">When seeking summary judgment, a party must specifically delineate the basis upon which the motion is brought, <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 526 N.E.2d 798, syllabus, and identify those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264, 273-274. When a properly supported motion for summary judgment is made, an adverse party may not rest on mere allegations or denials in the pleading, but must respond with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact. Civ.R. 56(E); <em>Riley v. Montgomery </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 75, 79, 11 OBR 319, 322-323, 463 N.E.2d 1246, 1249-1250. A \u201cmaterial\u201d fact is one that would affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable substantive law. <em>Needham v. Provident Bank </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 817, 826, 675 N.E.2d 514, 519-520, citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, 211-212.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">While the facts of this case are indeed tragic, our task is solely to determine whether appellees are legally liable for Timothy Minser\u2019s death. In a negligence action, a plaintiff must show (1) the existence of a duty, (2) which the defendant breached, (3) proximately causing, (4) injury to the plaintiff. <em>Mussivand v. David </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 314, 318, 544 N.E.2d 265, 269-270. To withstand a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must present evidence that at least creates a triable issue on each of these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Specifically at issue here is the question of appellees\u2019 duty to Timothy Minser. Under ordinary circumstances, even one who is negligent with respect to one party owes no duty to passersby injured by unforeseen circumstances. See Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>at 280 <em>et seq. </em>However, it has been held that when one who by his negligence places himself or others in peril, it is foreseeable that someone will attempt to rescue. In such a circumstance, the tortfeasor has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>duty to the rescuer and may be held liable if he or she is harmed. See Annotation (1989), 73 A.L.R.4th 737-769. This \u201crescue doctrine\u201d is part of Ohio\u2019s common law. <em>Marks v. Wagner </em>(1977), 52 Ohio App.2d 320, 322, 6 O.O.3d 360, 361-362, 370 N.E.2d 480, 482-483, citing <em>Pennsylvania Co. v. Langendorf </em>(1891), 48 Ohio St. 316, 28 N.E. 172, and <em>Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Lynch </em>(1903), 69 Ohio St. 123, 68 N.E. 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Nevertheless, one\u2019s status as a rescuer has limits in time and space. One may be a rescuer only as long as he or she has a reasonable belief that a victim is in peril. <em>Marks, supra, </em>at 324, 6 O.O.3d at 363, 370 N.E.2d at 484. \u201c[A] reasonable belief of continued peril could not exist in a case where the negligent act causing the victim\u2019s injuries had run its course and the victim\u2019s life was no longer in peril * * * .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In this case, both Poinsatte\u2019s deposition and Nurse Abate\u2019s affidavit concur that both occupants of the overturned van were out of the van and under Nurse Abate\u2019s care before Timothy Minser came in contact with the live wire. Additionally, the Abate affidavit does not refute Poinsatte\u2019s assertion that Minser and the live wire were at least twenty-five feet from the overturned van. From this uncontested evidence, we conclude that Phillip Poinsatte\u2019s negligent act that caused injuries to the van passengers had run its course and no immediate peril existed for either victim. At this point, Minser lost his status as a rescuer and appellees\u2019 duty to him ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The question of whether there was or was not a policeman at the scene who did or did not warn Minser of the live wire is not material. As a matter of law, by the time Minser grabbed or came into contact with the electrical wire, appellees owed him no duty. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken. We, therefore, need not reach appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, which we determine to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The judgment of the Williams County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-10\">Melvin L. Resnick and Glasser, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
