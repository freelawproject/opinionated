From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-8\" pgmap=\"610(212) 611(123)\">The deceased, a man eighty years of age, a few days before his death called in some of his friends and by deed and bill of sale made various dispositions of, his property, reserving to himself a life estate in a part thereof. Some certificates of deposit owned by him were at his direction brought from the bank in which he kept them and by his direction one of his friends began writing on the back assignments to Reuben Bruce, and be began signing his name to those assignments. He was in bed, and when a paper was ready for him to sign he was propped up in bed with a book placed on his knees, upon which he did the signing. He became tired and only partly wrote his signature on the fifth certificate, of which certificates there were twenty-five in all. An attendant suggested that he leave the signing of the rest until another day, and he handed to Bruce the five which he had assigned and told him with them to pay his funeral expenses and his debts and the rest should be his, and told the amount he wished paid on one debt, which he did not wish paid in full as he considered that the amount charged him was not just. He handed the remaining twenty certificates to Bruce without assigning them and told him they were his, and Bruce took and carried away all of the certificates. He advised persons there present, to whom he had deeded some of his property, to have their deeds recorded immediately. A few days later, Bruce and several others were at. deceased\u2019s house, and the twenty certificates were produced, and assignments on the back of each to Reuben Bruce were written. Deceased appeared not strong enough to write his name. One of the parties present wrote deceased\u2019s name to each assignment, and deceased affixed his mark to each. Shortly thereafter Bruce cashed these certificates. Deceased died eight days later.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-8\" pgmap=\"611\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b611-9\" pgmap=\"611\">1.
