Bowes, Jr., et al., complainants,\u201e to restrain Eugene S. Pike, one of the defendants, from entering judgment upon a note for $1,250, dated February 1, 1908, due six months after date, with interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum from date. By stipulation, defendant Pike was permitted to file a cross-bill in said cause,' wherein he prayed that a decree be rendered in his favor for the amount due him on the note in question.\u2019 Allegretti, the other defendant, was dismissed from the suit by consent of the parties. Upon a hearing of the cause thus consolidated, the chancellor found the issues for the cross-complainant, and entered a decree in his favor for the sum of $1,776, being the amount then due on said note, and dismissed complainants\u2019 bill for want of equity. From this decree, complainants appeal.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b74-8\" pgmap=\"74\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b74-9\" pgmap=\"74\">1.
