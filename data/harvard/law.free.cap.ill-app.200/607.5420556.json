The evidence for the People showed conclusively that the defendants, who had been in the saloon business before the town became dry territory, continued to run their dramshop in the City of Decatur within said town openly for a long period of time thereafter. The defendants did not testify themselves, nor offer any evidence, and made no defense whatever. The court imposed the minimum fine and the miulmum jail sentence under each count against each defendant, and it was urged that the aggregate punishment was excessive.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-9\" pgmap=\"629(60) 630(118)\">In entering judgment the court ordered and adjudged, in substance, that the defendant Otho Jennings make his fine unto the People of the State of Illinois, in the sum of twenty dollars on each of the first seventy counts, and that he make his fine unto the People of the State of Illinois in the sum of fifty dollars on the last, or seventy-first count, of the said indictment; that he be confined in the common jail of Macon county for a period of 10 days on each of the first seventy counts of said indictment; that he he confined in the common jail of Macon county for a period of 20 days on the last, or seventy-first count, of the said indictment; that the jail sentences imposed herein run consecutively, making a total of 720 days in jail; that he stand committed until said fine and costs are fully paid, or until he shall be otherwise discharged according to law.
