From an order dissolving a temporary injunction, complainant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-9\" pgmap=\"551\">There was a prior hearing on a motion to dissolve this same injunction, in which the motion was allowed and appeal to this court by the water company. The order overruling the motion to dissolve was reversed and the court remanded the cause for another hearing on that motion.. The opinion was reported (not in full) in 191 Ill. App. 269.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-10\" pgmap=\"551\">On reinstatement of the case, other affidavits were read covering the suggestions found in the opinion, and indicating a sharp controversy as to many material facts.

Injunction, \u00a7 273<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when temporary injunction dissolved. Whether a temporary injunction should he dissolved or remain in force depends upon the evidence produced at the hearing of a motion to dissolve such injunction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b552-6\" pgmap=\"552\">2. Injunction, \u00a7 269*\u2014what is nature of hearing of motion to dissolve temporary injunction. A hearing of a motion to dissolve a temporary injunction is not a hearing on the \"merits.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b552-7\" pgmap=\"552\">3. Injunction, \u00a7 154*\u2014lohen status quo preserved. ; Whether the status quo should he preserved by the continuance of a temporary injunction depends not only upon the probability of the case made on a hearing to dissolve such injunction, but also upon the relative injury that might be sustained by the parties, by the action of the chancellor in granting or refusing the motion contrary to what might be found on a final hearing to be the merits of the case.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b552-8\" pgmap=\"552\">4. Injunction, \u00a7 154*\u2014when preliminary injunction not dissolved. A preliminary injunction against the interference with the water supply of a customer of a water supply company because of the failure to pay bills will not be dissolved where a hearing on the merits is necessary under the bill, answer and affidavits in support and denial of the motion, as the continuance of the injunction would simply preserve the status quo, and the loss which the water company would sustain if the injunction was continued, would be small compared with that of the consumer if his water supply was cut off pending the hearing on the merits.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b552-9\" pgmap=\"552\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
