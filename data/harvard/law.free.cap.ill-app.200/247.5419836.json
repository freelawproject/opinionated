The jury made a special finding to the effect that the total amount of damages suffered was $8,000, and they deducted $800 therefrom for contributory negligence of which they found the deceased guilty. Judgment was rendered on the verdict and, upon appeal, it was attacked principally on the ground that the cause of the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate was a part of the risk and danger assumed by him, by his contract of employment; that the damages were excessive, and that the jury, who found that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was guilty of contributory negligence, did not deduct a sufficiently large proportion from the whole amount of damages found, on account of such contributory negligence.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-6\" pgmap=\"270\">Jackson, Hurst &amp; Stafford, for appellant; M.
