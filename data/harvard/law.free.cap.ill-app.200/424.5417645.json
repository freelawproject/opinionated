Prom a judgment for plaintiff, defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-8\" pgmap=\"446\">The plaintiff, a street car motorman, on a stormy night, drove his car onto the tracks of the defendant at a street crossing instead of stopping in accordance with his employer\u2019s rules before reaching the track and waiting for the conductor to go ahead and signal a clear track, and was struck by the defendant\u2019s train, admitted to have been running at a speed in excess of that permitted by an ordinance. A reversal was sought solely on the ground that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, and both parties requested either an affirmance of the judgment or reversal without remanding.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-9\" pgmap=\"446(90) 447(41)\">The plaintiff had worked for the Peoria Bailway Company as motorman for about three weeks, and had no previous street car experience. His theory of the case was that he was intending to stop his car at the time in question, but that it was dark and snowing and he was relying on an electric light that the defendant maintained over the crossing to guide him as to the place to stop; that at the time the light was not burning and he, misled thereby, drove onto the crossing without knowing where he was. The evidence was conflicting on the question whether it was snowing, and it tended to show that there were other means from which the plaintiff might have known that he was approaching the track.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b447-8\" pgmap=\"447\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b447-9\" pgmap=\"447\">1.
