Dr. F. B. Lang-don, husband of Carrie Langdon, died at Louisville, Kentucky, early in February, 1913. Benjamin' and Mrs. Clark went there to the funeral. Mrs. Langdon was suffering from an incurable disease and after the funeral her brother and sister brought'her to the home of Mrs. Clark in Kankakee, Illinois. Mrs. Langdon had money in a bank in Louisville, and before they left there Mrs. Clark was in possession of the amount Mrs. Langdon had in the bank in the shape of a draft or check which she brought with them to Kankakee. Shortly after they reached Kankakee, probably the next day, and on Febmary 13, 1913, Mrs. Clark opened a checking account in a bank in Kankakee in the name of \u201cMrs. P. B. Langdon or Nellie Clark,\u201d and deposited on that day to said account said draft or check in the sum of $3,179.90, and received a deposit book in the same name. On June 5, 1913, Mrs. Clark drew out that sum of money and closed the account. On June 8, 1913, Mrs. Langdon died. Thereafter plaintiff became afdministrator of Mrs. Langdon\u2019s estate and brought this suit to recover the amount of said deposit. Mrs. Clark, in defense, proved by various witnesses declarations by Mrs. Langdon. Some to the effect that she had given this draft or this money or all her money to Mrs. Clark, and others that she wanted or intended to give this money or her property to Mrs. Clark. A few days before Mrs. Langdon died, Mrs. Latimer, a daughter of Mrs. Langdon by a former marriage, and her husband, came from their home in Springfield, Ohio, to Kankakee, upon a telegram from Mrs. Clark, and remained there until after the funeral of Mrs. Langdon. They had a conversation with Mrs. Clark after the funeral concerning this money deposited in the Kankakee bank. They testified that Mrs. Clark at first denied that there was any money in the Kankakee bank belonging to Mrs.- Langdon, and that when Latimer told her that they had been to the bank and ascertained that Mrs. Langdon had money on deposit there, Mrs. Clark then admitted to them that their mother had about $3,200 on deposit in the bank. In rebuttal, Mrs. Clark was called as a witness in her own behalf as to said conversation, and she placed the conversation at a different hour of the day from what the Latimer s did, and gave a somewhat different version of it, but stated that she in that conversation said to them: \u2018 \u2018 She (meaning Mrs. Langdon) gave all the money she had to me to pay her bills.\u201d No effort was made by the defendant to prove what bills were incurred nor what sums she paid upon any bills for Mrs. Langdon. Dr. Brown, a witness for defendant, attended Mrs. Langdon during the entire four months. He was not asked the amount of his proper charges for his services to her, nor whether he had been paid, nor by whom.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-4\" pgmap=\"300\">T.
