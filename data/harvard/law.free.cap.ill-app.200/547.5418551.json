The statutory notice of personal injuries filed with the city attorney and city clerk is sufficient, although it does not contain the address of the attending physician, where such physician also holds the position of city physician and there is no other physician of the same name in the city, as it must be assumed that the residence of such physician is known to the city officers and that by the exercise of reasonable diligence they could ascertain any fact for which resort to the attending physician was necessary.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\" pgmap=\"569\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Kankakee county; the Hon..

Evidence, \u00a7 444*\u2014when medical witness may testify as to subjective symptoms.
