Friedberg, complainant, to restrain Clarence E. DePew, trading as the \u201cPractical Advertising Company,\u201d and John R. Henderson, as sheriff of Kendall county, Illinois, defendants, from enforcement of an execution issued upon a judgment entered by confession against the complainant. From an order sustaining a demurrer to the bill and a decree dismissing it for want of equity, the complainant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-9\" pgmap=\"417\">The bill alleged that DePew entered into a contract with complainant through complainant\u2019s agent whereby DePew, by the name of \u201cPractical Advertising Company,\u201d agreed to furnish to complainant certain articles of merchandise, and perform certain acts to benefit complainant\u2019s business, the complainant being a merchant, and that DePew guarantied thereby to increase complainant\u2019s business. A copy of the contract referred to was attached to the bill as an exhibit, but it appeared from the bill that such exhibit was presumably only a part of the entire contract and was the part signed by the complainant, but that evidently at the same time complainant signed another paper, which was not attached to the bill.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-10\" pgmap=\"417(24) 418(129)\">It further alleged, in substance, that DePew procured to be entered a pretended judgment against him without .the personal knowledge of complainant, and that later, a pretended execution was issued upon said pretended judgment and placed in the hands of the sheriff for service, who served the same upon complainant and then levied it upon certain property of complainant; that the service of the execution on complainant was the first notice \u201cactual, constructive or otherwise,\u201d which complainant had of the existence of the judgment, no summons or other process having\u2019 been served upon him previous to the entering of the judgment, and that the court had adjourned for the term at which judgment had been taken before the time mentioned, and that it was only from the alleged pretended execution that he learned that the judgment had been so recovered against him by DePew in an action of \u201cassumpsit-confession.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-4\" pgmap=\"418\">The bill also stated that complainant never, to his knowledge, executed or signed any judgment note authorizing the judgment, and that in case such judgment note ever existed containing his signature, such signature was a forgery; or, if genuine, it was obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, false pretenses and circumvention; that the only paper presented to him for approval or execution at the time the contract was negotiated was represented by Depew\u2019s agent to be a simple contract, and that if such alleged pretended judgment was taken against complainant and indicated by the alleged pretended execution, the same was and is fraudulent, and should be set aside as null and void.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\" pgmap=\"418\">The bill then prayed that the alleged pretended execution and levy be set aside, and that the sheriff and DePew be restrained by order of court from advertising or selling the premises, or authorizing or causing the same to be done, or otherwise attempting to enforce said alleged pretended judgment, etc.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ASf\" pgmap=\"418\">Benjamin F.

Contracts, \u00a7 190<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when separate papers considered as one instrument.

Judgment, \u00a7 343*\u2014when Mil to restrain enforcement of execution on judgment by confession defective. In a suit to restrain the enforcement of an execution on a judgment alleged to have been entered by confession upon a pretended power of attorney, purporting to have been signed by the complainant, a bill alleging that the complainant did not, to his knowledge, execute such a power, or, if he did, its execution was procured by fraud, and having attached to it as an exhibit a paper alleged to evidence a contract entered into between the complainant and defendant, but which appeared to be only a part of an instrument evidencing the entire contract as entered into, held defective, inasmuch as the other part of the instrument might contain the power of attorney upon which such judgment was entered.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-9\" pgmap=\"419\">3. Judgment, \u00a7 343*\u2014when bill to restrain enforcement of execution on judgment by confession on power of attorney insufficient. In a bill to restrain the enforcement of an execution alleged to have been issued upon a pretended judgment entered upon a paper pretended to contain a power of attorney to confess judgment against the complainant, allegations that if the paper contained the complainant\u2019s signature it was a forgery, but if the signature was genuine it was obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, false pretenses and circumvention, held to be inconsistent, and neither a positive allegation that the signature was a forgery nor that it was genuine, but was obtained by fraud and misrepresentation, and insufficient in not stating facts upon which the claim of fraud and misrepresentation was based.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-10\" pgmap=\"419(41) 420(20)\">4. Judgment, \u00a7 343*\u2014what bill to restrain enforcement of judg-. ment on ground of fraud must contain. While equity takes concurrent jurisdiction with law courts in matters of fraud, accident or mistake, the facts constituting such fraud, accident or mistake, as a defense to the enforcement of a judgment, must be set out in a bill to restrain its enforcement.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-3\" pgmap=\"419\">C.

To entitle one to an injunction to restrain the enforcement of an execution on the ground of fraud, a'ceident or mistake, it must be evident not only that the complainant had a defense upon the merits to the action in which such judgment was entered, but that such defense has been lost to him without the loss being attributable to his own omission, negligence or default.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b420-5\" pgmap=\"420\">6.
