Appeal and error\u2014when question of abatement of action raised too late. The objection that an action involving the possession of premises should have been abated during the pendency of a writ of error in a similar proceeding for the possession of the same premises, brought by another plaintiff against the defendant, is raised too late when first raised on appeal.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b71-6\" pgmap=\"71\">2. Abatement and revival, \u00a7 39<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when pendency of writ of error not available to abate similar action. The pendency of a writ of error cannot be invoked to abate another similar action unless the former operates as \u00e1 supersedeas.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b71-7\" pgmap=\"71\">3. Partees, \u00a7 31*\u2014when substitution does not constitute new cause of action. Where a wife is made a joint defendant to an action of forcible entry and detainer originally brought against a husband, and thereafter the action is dismissed as to the husband and the case proceeds against the wife alone, such substitution of parties does not constitute a new cause of action.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
