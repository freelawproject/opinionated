Mills, plaintiff, against Village of Oquawka, defendant, to recover damages .for personal injuries due to falling through a defective wooden portion of a brick sidewalk into a cellar. From a judgment for plaintiff for $2,000, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-12\" pgmap=\"141(109) 142(89)\">On May 16,1914, the husband of June E. Mills occupied a part of the Graham building in the Village of Oquawka, in Henderson county, as a bakery. There was a brick sidewalk, ten or twelve feet wide, in front of this building, and at one time there had evidently been a stairway leading from this sidewalk down to a cellar underneath, but its use for such a purpose had been abandoned many years before the date named, the stairs had been removed, and the opening in the sidewalk leading to the stairs had been covered with the wooden door. On the evening of the day in question a wheelbarrow was standing on this wooden door, having been left there by Mills, as he intended to use it during the night for the purpose of transferring bread to the depot for shipment on an early morning train. Between seven and eight o\u2019clock that evening several persons were sitting on that wheelbarrow, when the wooden door gave way and they were all precipitated into the cellar. The evidence shows that June E. Mills, who was one of those thrown into the cellar, was quite seriously injured.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqC\" pgmap=\"142\">At least two years before this accident, a member of the village board put the .end of his cane through a rotten hole in one of the planks composing this wooden cover, and in spite of his knowledge of the condition of this part of the public sidewalk, he testified that to his knowledge the place had never been repaired while he was on the board nor up to the time of the accident. Other witnesses testified to an entire lack of repairs on this place for nineteen years or longer. Certain pieces of timber were admitted in evidence and identified by at least one witness as being' part of the supports of this wooden cover. These timbers were rotten. Other evidence was introduced to show that this wooden portion of the walk was in an unsafe condition for public travel. The evidence further showed that the city had been notified of the condition of this walk by complaint to the mayor or president of the village board with a request from plaintiff that the walk or that portion of it be condemned and removed. This complaint was ignored, apparently without any investigation on the part of the village officials.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\" pgmap=\"142\">There seemed to be no question but that plaintiff was injured by her fall. She complained of an injury to her arm and neck and she suffered a miscarriage shortly after the accident. She was under the care of two physicians for a considerable time after the accident.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-6\" pgmap=\"142\">James W.
