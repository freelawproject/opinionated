Defendant by its affidavit of defense denied the making of the contract as alleged by plaintiff, alleged the making of another contract covering the same subject-matter, in which plaintiff was in default and consequently indebted to defendant, for which it claimed a set-off for the amount of $190.10. Upon trial by the court, the issues were found for the defendant as to plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim and for the plaintiff as to defendant\u2019s set-off. To reverse the judgment, plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error and defendant files cross-errors as to its claim of set-off.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-16\" pgmap=\"39(8) 40(344) 41(116)\">The evidence showed that plaintiff was engaged in the lithographing business at Norwood, Ohio, and that the defendant was located in Chicago. In the fall of 1913, Mr. F. L. Wilke, a Chicago salesman for the plaintiff, called several times upon the defendant and solicited ah order for a quantity of lithograph displays, known to the trade as \u201ccutouts.\u201d After negotiations defendant placed with Mr. Wilke an order written on one of the printed forms of the defendant. This order was not accepted by plaintiff, which made out an order on one of its own printed blanks, and through its salesman, Mr. Wilke, this latter order was presented to defendant and signed by it. This order, which contained a number of specifications and details, was for 2,000 cutouts at a price of 65 cents each, totaling $1,300. At the bottom of the order, which was printed in part and partly typewritten, was the clause: \u201cSubject to acceptance in City of Norwood, Ohio, by the United States Printing &amp; Lithographing Company, sole sales agent.\u201d In reply to this order plaintiff sent to defendant a purported acceptance which in several particulars was not in accord with the terms of the order. Immediately upon receipt of this, defendant wrote to plaintiff noting the variances and asking plaintiff to acknowledge receipt of the latter, \u201cas the order is somewhat at variance with your acknowledgment.\u201d To this plaintiff replied, saying: \u201cWe did not reply to yours of January 3rd, having referred same to our Chicago office to take up with you. \u201d Subsequently Mr. Wilke, of the Chicago office of the plaintiff, called upon defendant to settle the matters raised in the above correspondence. At this and a subsequent interview the defendant, acting through its president, Mr. G-rosse, and Mr. Wilke, representing the plaintiff, entered into an oral contract as follows: The defendant agreed to purchase from plaintiff 1,000 cutouts, defendant to pay plaintiff $900 therefor, the whole 1,000 cutouts to be billed and paid for immediately, the cutouts to be kept in storage by the plaintiff and shipped to the defendant in lots of about 250 at such times as the defendant should call' for them. Subsequently 511 of these cutouts were shipped to and accepted by the defendant, and a bill for 1,000 cutouts was rendered the defendant in March, 1914, for $650, which was paid. Under the oral contract for 1,000 cutouts, 489 more were due to the defendant. Plaintiff did not ship this number but shipped 1,600 cutouts in a single shipment, and insisted upon the defendant accepting the same. No opportunity was given defendant to accept the balance due on its contract for 1,000 cutouts, that is, 489. The defendant refused to accept this shipment from the railroad company.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b41-8\" pgmap=\"41\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b41-9\" pgmap=\"41\">1.
