From a decree in favor of defendant, complainant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-9\" pgmap=\"421\">There was no evidence in the record to sustain the charges made in the bill, of fraud or undue influence, but there was evidence tending to show that the deceased, at the time of making the change of beneficiary, was mentally incompetent. A number of witnesses testified that the deceased, about the time he made the change, was incapacitated for the transaction of ordinary business, but the evidence was conflicting on that point.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-10\" pgmap=\"421\">Albert H.
