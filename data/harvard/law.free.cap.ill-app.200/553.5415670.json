Lewis, as administratrix of the estate of Thomas B. Lewis, deceased, plaintiff, against New Amsterdam Casualty Company, defendant, to recover on a policy of health and life insurance. For a judgment for defendant upon a directed verdict, plaintiff appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-8\" pgmap=\"575\">A health and life insurance policy was issued by defendant to Thomas B. Lewis on June 29, 1914. Lewis was taken ill in August, 1914, and died on March 16, 1915. The policy provided for sick benefits of $25 per week. No sick benefits were paid. There was an appropriate declaration upon the policy. Certain pleas were filed, to which a demurrer was sustained, and certain other pleas were then filed upon which issue was joined. The pleas were each in bar, except as to $19.73 tender made before suit. The first plea was the qualified general issue. The remaining pleas were that the application was made a part of the policy, and that the policy was issued upon the consideration of the premium and the statements in the application, and various statements in the application as to the good health of Lewis were denied. Special replications were filed to the special pleas, and issues were joined upon said replications.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-9\" pgmap=\"575(28) 576(347) 577(52)\">The parties lived in Peoria. George Reagan was agent of defendant at Peoria, and this policy was issued from his office upon an application brought to him by C. K. Gerdes, who was also a life insurance agent. Lewis applied to Gerdes for health and life insurance, and Gerdes applied to Eeagan. Apparently Gerdes prepared a first draft of an application and this application, which was granted, was in fact written, so far as the typewritten parts were concerned (which were the ones that it was claimed were untrue), in Eeagan\u2019s office and by his stenographer, by Eeagan\u2019s direction, and delivered to Gerdes. It was claimed that this application was fraudulent. Gerdes signed Lewis \u2019 name to the application. Lewis never saw it. Gerdes testified that he considered himself authorized to sign Lewis\u2019 name to it. Gerdes testified that he took the statements as to the condition of health of Lewis from applications which Lewis had made to him some years before. Gerdes denied any knowledge of the facts concerning Lewis\u2019 condition of health which tended to make this application untrue. The application was untrue. When plaintiff sought to show that Gerdes was in fact acting for defendant and had frequently acted for defendant before, the court sustained objections to the questions by which it was sought to prove the connection between Gerdes and defendant. He was allowed to state that he had acted for defendant before, but that answer was then excluded. The proof showed that Gerdes did not receive any pay from Lewis for obtaining this insurance, but that Eeagan was entitled to a certain commission as between him and defendant, and that Eeagan paid a part of that commission to Gerdes as his compensation for the work. Defendant introduced in evidence a letter from the superintendent of defendant to Lewis, dated February 1, 1915, notifying him that the company had canceled this policy, and that they inclosed therewith their check for $62.13, in full of the premium which Lewis had paid and interest to that date, and also a registered return receipt admitting the receipt of this letter of February 1st, which was signed \u201cThomas B. Lewis per G. C. Lewis,\u201d Objection was made to the competency of this evidence, and that objection was overruled. There was no proof who G-. C. Lewis was, nor that he or she had any authority to sign the name of Thomas B. Lewis to that receipt nor that Thomas B. Lewis ever did receive that letter.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-7\" pgmap=\"577\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-8\" pgmap=\"577\">1.
