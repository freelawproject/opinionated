From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-10\" pgmap=\"325\">Plaintiff was at the time of the injury a man about seventy years old. He had lived in Ottawa a great many years and had been, for a number of years, a member of the city council, his last term of office expiring about eight months before the accident, a part of the time serving as chairman of the street and alley committee, and a part of the time as a member of the sidewalk committee.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-11\" pgmap=\"325(139) 326(55)\">At the northwest corner of Columbus and Joliet streets there was a hole, or excavation, near the angle made by the sidewalks where years before a catch-basin for the sewer had been put in there and the hole left open. There was no guard protecting the hole. There would .be little danger from it in the daytime. A pedestrian would not fall into it if he kept on the sidewalk as he turned the right angle to cross the street. The accident happened at. about eleven o\u2019clock1 of a dark night. The street was dark at that place. Plaintiff was walking north on Columbus street and intending to turn at a right angle and go east and walk on Joliet street. He mistook the place, and turned just before reaching the walk, falling into the hole and thereby receiving the injury complained of. The ground was hard and level at the place where he turned, and he thought he was still on the walk. He had theretofore been accustomed to walk to his home in this direction on Columbus and Joliet streets, but had habitually used the other side of the street.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-7\" pgmap=\"326\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b326-8\" pgmap=\"326\">1.
