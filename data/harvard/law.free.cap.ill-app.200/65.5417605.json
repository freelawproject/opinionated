With its declaration, plaintiff filed its affidavit of claim, showing $1,419.93 due. The defendant filed with its plea of the general issue thereto, an affidavit of merits alleging that said lumber was not up to grade, nor according to contract; that defendant had not accepted same and that plaintiff was indebted to defendant for freight and demur-rage charges paid by defendant on said lumber in the sum of $238.92. There was a trial by jury resulting in a verdict in favor of plaintiff in the sum of $1,399.52. From such verdict the plaintiff consented to a remittitur of $38.95, and, thereupon, motion for a new trial was overruled and judgment entered against defendant in the sum of $1,360.57. From such judgment, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\" pgmap=\"87(69) 88(181)\">It appeared that defendant, in Chicago, ordered from plaintiff two carloads of quarter oak lumber, \u201cflooded stock, but very well washed and cleaned.\u201d Said lumber was shortly thereafter shipped by plaintiff from Heth, Arkansas, to defendant\u2019s order, Chicago. There was a conflict of evidence as to the condition of the lumber in question upon its arrival in Chicago. It was sold subject to the rules of inspection of the National Hardwood Association. These rules did not appear in evidence. Upon its inspection by defendant, the latter refused to accept the lumber, and, subsequently, declined to permit a mutual inspection thereof, on the ground that a portion of said lumber was covered with mud, that it was not possible, therefore, to determine how badly it had been damaged by water, asked plaintiff to pay the freight and demur-rage charges thereon and take it away. Defendant\u2019s secretary, A. H. Schoen, testified that he telephoned plaintiff, before defendant removed the lumber from the cars, that it was not up to grade and not what defendant ordered; that plaintiff\u2019s representative upon the following day requested defendant to unload the lumber from the cars so as to save demurrage, which defendant did. No part of the lumber in question had been used by defendant and remained in its possession, subject to plaintiff\u2019s order. There was evidence introduced by defendant tending to show that the value of said lumber, when received, was $330 to $340 less than the contract price.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b88-7\" pgmap=\"88\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b88-8\" pgmap=\"88\">1.

In an action to recover the contract price of goods sold, evidence that the buyer after inspecting the goods and rejecting them refused the request of the seller to have an inspection of the goods made by a third person, but continued to retain possession at the latter\u2019s request, is not sufficient to show such acceptance as would waive an implied warranty as to quality of the goods.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b89-5\" pgmap=\"89\">5.
