Adulteby, \u00a7 4<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when information not repugnant. An information for adultery and fornication is not open to the objection of repugnancy by reason of charging that the offense was committed by defendant with one \u201cMary Doe whose name to this affiant is unknown.\u201d</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b82-7\" pgmap=\"82\">2. Criminal law\u2014when objection to form of verification too late on appeal. The objection to the verification of an information that the words \u201csworn to\u201d are used instead of the words \u201caffirmed to,\u201d relates to a matter of form only and comes too late when first raised on appeal.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A4M\" pgmap=\"82\">3. Adulteby, \u00a7 4*\u2014when status of companion in adultery need not be shown. In a prosecution on an information charging defendant and another with living together in an open state of adultery and fornication, where there is competent evidence to show that defendant was at the time of the alleged offense a married man and that his wife was then living and had not been divorced from him, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove the status of the woman with whom the offense is charged to have been committed.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-10\" pgmap=\"82\">4. Criminal law, \u00a7 227*\u2014when reopening of ease to admit evidence not ground for reversal. Where on a prosecution for adultery and fornication defendant\u2019s wife is called as a witness for the prosecution and over defendant\u2019s objection is permitted to testify to the fact that he is her husband, it is not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to reopen the case on motion of the prosecution after the case has been closed to permit the introduction of testimony of the brother of defendant\u2019s wife that he was present when the marriage took place.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-11\" pgmap=\"82\">5. - Criminal law, \u00a7 538*\u2014when admission of evidence not ground for reversal. Even though the evidence of defendant\u2019s wife was ' incompetent in a prosecution against him, yet where the case was tried without a jury and there is sufficient competent evidence in the record to prove the matter testified to by her, error in admitting her testimony is not ground for reversal.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-12\" pgmap=\"82\">6. Adulteby, \u00a7 5*\u2014when evidence sufficient to support judgment.
