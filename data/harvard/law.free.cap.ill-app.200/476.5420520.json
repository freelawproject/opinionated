Siegert, plaintiff, against Public Service Company of Northern Illinois, a corpora\u00f1on, and the City of Ottawa, defendants, to recover for personal injuries. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aequ\" pgmap=\"499\">The Illinois River bridge is 942 feet long, with a driveway 24 feet wide, and was on July 8,1914, the day in question, the only means of crossing the Illinois River in the City of Ottawa. There was a large amount of travel across the bridge, including interurban and street car traffic. There was laid along the east side of the wagon road of the bridge extending into the driveway, about 18 inches from the side of the bridge, an 8 inch gas pipe used by defendant Public Service Company, laid in sections joined by a flange or expansion joint projecting 2 inches, so that the diameter of the pipe and flange was about 12 inches. This pipe was elevated a few inches above the level of the floor of the bridge on a cement foundation, but extended beyond the base on which it rested. It was not covered or guarded in any way, and the flange or expansion joint was so constructed that a wheel scraping along the side of the pipe would catch on the flanges. Plaintiff was a gardener, acquainted with and accustomed to the use of this bridge. He drove onto it with a horse that was somewhat afraid of cars and met a street car. His horse shied to the east as the car passed him, and just then another car came up. The horse, becoming more frightened, veered to the east and started to run. The left wheel of the wagon struck against the gas pipe a few feet from a flange. The wheel slid along until it hit the projection of the flange. The wagon was thrown into the air by the force of the impact, and plaintiff thrown out and injured.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\" pgmap=\"499(65) 500(95)\">The court instructed the jury, at the instance of defendants except as modified by the insertion of the clause in parentheses, as follows: \u2018 \u2018 That while it is the duty of a city to use reasonable care to keep its streets i\u00fc. a reasonably safe condition to drive upon, it has the right to devote the sides of the street to other useful public purposes. It may construct sidewalks of a higher grade and gutters of a lower grade than the driveway, place curbing on the line of the gutters, erect hydrants and authorize the erection of hitching posts, telephone, telegraph and electric light poles and the laying of water and gas pipes (provided that in so doing the streets remain in a reasonably safe condition for public use). It may thus to a reasonable extent and for a useful public purpose narrow the driveway and exclude teams and horses altogether from the sides of the streets.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-8\" pgmap=\"500\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-9\" pgmap=\"500\">1.
