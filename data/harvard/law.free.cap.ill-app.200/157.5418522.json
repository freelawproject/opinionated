Injunction, \u00a7 169<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when order for issuance of temporary injunction valid. The fact that a prayer for a temporary injunction is in a paragraph preceding the prayer for a summons instead of in such latter paragraph does not render an order for the issue of a temporary injunction invalid.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-14\" pgmap=\"179\">2. Injunction, \u00a7 385*\u2014when order requiring injunction bond with security approved ~by cleric harmless error. The fact that an order for a temporary injunction provides for an injunction bond with security to be approved by the clerk of the court instead of ' by the court, as is required by statute, does not constitute reversible error, as the obligors cannot escape liability on such ground.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-15\" pgmap=\"179(38) 180(67)\">3.

On a bill for a temporary injunction to restrain defendant from engaging in the same business as complainant in violation of an employment contract, held that an injunction was properly granted after answer filed, where a copy of the contract was attached to the hill and defendant did not deny that it was a true copy, and admitted the making of the contract, that it was terminated, and that he had gone into the same business and sought to trade with customers of the company, all of which was in violation of the contract.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\" pgmap=\"179\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Peoria county; the Hon.

Contracts, \u00a7 285<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what does not constitute abandonment of contract not to engage in same business. Where a contract of employment with a grocery company selling direct to consumers by wagons provides that the servant is employed not only to take orders for and deliver teas, etc., but also \u201cto perform such other duties as the party of the first part may from time to time specify and require of him,\u201d the fact that the duties of the servant are changed during the term of employment from that of wagon man and route agent to office duties in a-branch office does not constitute an abandonment of other terms of the contract not to engage in the same business for a certain period.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b180-5\" pgmap=\"180\">5. Injunction, \u00a7 159*\u2014when bill to enjoin defendant from engaging in same business in violation of contract does not allege rescission of contract. On a bill for a temporary injunction to restrain defendant from engaging in the same business as complainant in violation of a written contract of employment, allegations in the bill that on a certain date, in consideration of a certain sum paid by complainant to defendant and accepted by him as payment for one week\u2019s salary in advance, the contract of employment was then terminated by mutual agreement, when construed with other allegations in the bill, held to mean that defendant\u2019s employment was mutually terminated and that the written contract was not abrogated.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b180-6\" pgmap=\"180\">6. Estoppel, \u00a7 47*\u2014when employer not estopped to assert equitable rights by injunction against employee engaging in same business in violation of contract. An employer is not precluded from asserting equitable rights by injunction under a written contract of employment, whereby the employee agrees not to engage in the same business during or upon termination of the employment, by neglecting to pay to the employee an additional month\u2019s pay upon discharge as provided by the contract, where the employee did not ask for such additional pay.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b180-7\" pgmap=\"180\">7. Injunction, \u00a7 80*\u2014when temporary injunction proper to prevent violation of contract not to engage in same business. A temporary injunction lies to prevent a former employee of a grocery company from engaging in the same business in violation of the terms of his contract of employment, where the damages which such violation will inflict upon the company are practically impossible of ascertainment.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
