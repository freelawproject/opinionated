H. Bilter and others, defendants. From a decree setting aside a conveyance by defendant and subjecting the property to the lien and payment of the judgment and execution, defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-17\" pgmap=\"197(77) 198(179)\">On May 23,1913, H. H. Bilter, his wife and two sons, Raymond R. Bilter and H. C. Bilter, the four defendants, were living as one family in a residence owned by H. H. Bilter in Elmhurst, DuPage county, Illinois. He also owned a farm of about 293 acres in the same county, and was indebted to parties other than complainant in amounts aggregating $24,550. On that date summons was served upon him in a common-law suit by the plaintiff, American Steel &amp; Copper Plate Company. Four days thereafter for an expressed consideration of $1 he conveyed, his wife joining with him, all said real estate to said two sons by deed that was duly recorded. The common-law suit brought by complainant terminated October 18, 1913, in a judgment against him of $442.31. Execution issued therein, and he filed a schedule of his personal property showing a valuation of less than his exemptions of $400. The execution was levied on all the real estate so conveyed and complainant filed its bill in equity in this case in aid of the execution. Issues were joined, the cause referred to the master in chancery who reported the evidence with his conclusion that the prayer of the bill be granted. Objections and exceptions to the master\u2019s report were filed and overruled, and a decree entered setting aside the conveyance and subjecting the property to the lien and payment of the judgment and execution, from which decree this appeal was prosecuted.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\" pgmap=\"198(184) 199(31)\">The evidence showed that the real consideration for the conveyance was an agreement in writing by the grantees to assume and pay the before mentioned indebtedness of their father to parties other than plaintiff ; and that the grantees understood that the transfer covered all the real estate and personal property of their father. Evidence was introduced by plaintiff as to the market value of the real estate, from which the master found that at the time of the transfer the fair cash value of the residence in Elmhurst was $6,000 and of the farm $45,415, making an aggregate of $51,415. No evidence to the contrary was introduced except that it was shown, subject to objection, that the assessed valuation of the property for purposes of general taxation was less than the amount agreed by the grantees to be paid for it, and the grantees testified that at the time of the transfer they arrived at the value of the property by a computation as to its net revenue, and the result was about the amount they agreed to pay for it. The property had a market value. The master concluded that the amount agreed to be paid by the grantees was about forty-five per cent, of the value of the property.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b199-8\" pgmap=\"199\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b199-9\" pgmap=\"199\">1.

Fbaudtjlent conveyances, \u00a7 271*\u2014when evidence sufficient to sustain finding that grantees had knowledge of grantor\u2019s indebtedness to creditor. On a bill in aid of execution to subject real estate which was conveyed by a father to his children for an inadequate consideration, consisting of the assumption of all the debts of the grantor except that owed to one creditor, evidence held sufficient to sustain a finding that grantees had notice of the indebtedness of the grantor to such other creditor.</headnotes><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\" pgmap=\"199\">The grantees testified they did not, at the time of the transfer, know of their father\u2019s indebtedness to plaintiff, and there was no direct evidence that they did then know of it. The parties continued to live together under an arrangement, they said, that the father should work for the grantees for his board.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-5\" pgmap=\"199\">Fred A.

Fraudulent conveyances, \u00a7 80<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what constitutes voluntary gift of property invalid in equity. The conveyance by a debtor of all his property to his children for a consideration, consisting of the assumption of all the debts of the grantor except one, which consideration is only about one-half the value of such property, constitutes a voluntary gift over to the assignees, and will be set aside in equity at the instance of such other creditor regardless of whether or not the grantees have knowledge of such other debt.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b200-5\" pgmap=\"200\">6.
