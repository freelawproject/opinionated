He was sentenced to dismissal, a reprimand, a $2,500.00 fine, and contingent confinement for ninety days if the fine was not paid. The record indicates timely payment of the fine. Prior to taking action, the convening authority ordered a post-trial session under Article 39(a), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839(a) (2000), to consider matters pertinent to the present appeal. A military judge who did not preside at trial conducted the post-trial Article 39(a) session.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Following the post-trial Article 39(a) session, the convening authority approved the results of trial. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>No. ARMY 20000208 (A.Ct.Crim.App. Apr. 12, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">On Appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">I. WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED WHEN HE CONSIDERED APPELLANT\u2019S BATTALION COMMANDER\u2019S IMPROPER SENTENCING TESTIMONY, \u201cIF I WAS SITTING IN THAT PANEL OVER THERE AS A JUROR WOULD I ALLOW HIM [APPELLANT] TO REMAIN IN THE ARMY? NO \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">II. WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE AND THE ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT MILITARY RULE OF EVIDENCE 606(b) PRECLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE MILITARY JUDGE\u2019S POST-TRIAL STATEMENT, \u201cI WAS CONSIDERING KEEPING [APPELLANT] UNTIL HIS COMMANDER SAID HE DID NOT WANT HIM BACK.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">A. CONSIDERATION OF REHABILITATIVE POTENTIAL DURING SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">During a sentencing proceeding, it is appropriate to consider the rehabilitative potential of an accused. <em>See United States v. Griggs, </em>61 M.J. 402, 407 (C.A.A.F.2005). Under Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1001(b)(5), the prosecution may present opinion testimony during sentencing as to potential of an accused to be \u201crestored ... to a useful and constructive place in society,\u201d with certain restrictions. Such testimony \u201cis limited to whether the accused has rehabilitative potential and to the magnitude or quality of any such potential.\u201d R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D). The prosecution\u2019s witness \u201cmay not offer an opinion regarding the appropriateness of a punitive discharge or whether the accused should be returned to the accused\u2019s unit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">The defense, which has broad latitude to present evidence in e5denuation and mitigation under R.C.M. 1001(c), is not subject to the limitations of R.C.M. 1001(b)(5). <em>See Griggs, </em>61 M.J. at 410. If the defense, however, elicits evidence that could not be introduced by the prosecution under R.C.M. 1001(b)(5), the door may be opened for the prosecution to present such evidence in rebuttal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">B. EVIDENCE PRESENTED DURING SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">Appellant, a thirty-nine-year-old physician\u2019s assistant, committed various impro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>prieties of a sexual nature during his examination of seven young enlisted females during their sick call visits to the medical clinic. During sentencing, the defense called several witnesses who testified to Appellant\u2019s rehabilitative potential, including Appellant\u2019s battalion commander. In addition to asking the battalion commander general questions about rehabilitative potential, defense counsel directly raised the question of whether the battalion commander thought Appellant should be returned to the unit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">Q. Sir, there\u2019s been testimony in this case by people in the medical community, professionals, that believe that Lieutenant Hill can be rehabilitated due to the fact that he came in here, pled guilty, was forthcoming and contrite---- Based on the Lieutenant Hill that you know, that you\u2019ve described to us, do you agree that he could be rehabilitated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">A. I know that the testimony of those experts is important, but even without that, I would have thought that he certainly is rehabilitatable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">Q. Do you think he can be a productive member of society?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">A. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">Q. Now, sir, the Judge has to make several decisions today. One of them is whether or not [Appellant] should remain in the Army, and I\u2019m not going to ask you whether you think he should remain [in] the Army, but if the decision is made for him to remain in the Army, do you believe he could be a -would you take him back into the battalion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">A. I\u2019d have no qualms with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">Q. What do you base that answer on, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">A. Based on the potential that he\u2019s shown me. Let me caveat that and say I would not want him back as a clinician, but as an officer, a platoon leader, I feel that he would succeed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">During cross-examination, trial counsel probed the battalion commander\u2019s stated willingness to \u201ctake [Appellant] back into [his] battalion as a platoon leader\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-17\">Q. If you had a platoon leader who sexually assaulted one of his subordinates, would you expect that person to stay in your battalion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-18\">A. The question was, if the Judge\u2019s decision was to retain him in the Army, and he chose my battalion, would I accept that, and I said yes. If I was sitting in that panel over there as a juror, would I allow him to remain in the Army, no\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-19\">The trial judge, on his own motion, promptly interrupted the witness in mid-sentence, noting: \u201cThe response was not responsive to the question. It was also one that a witness is not allowed to make.\u201d Trial counsel then resumed his cross-examination of the battalion commander:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-20\">Q. The question, sir, was whether you would take a platoon leader back into your unit, who has done one of these sexual assaults, not whether you would kick Lieutenant Hill out of the Army.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-21\">A. I think you need to clarify your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-22\">Q. You\u2019ve got a platoon leader, he has one soldier under his care, and he fondles her breasts. Would you take that lieutenant back into your battalion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-23\">A. I would prefer charges on that lieutenant and let the justice take its course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-24\">Q. What kind of message do you think it would send to your female soldiers if you let someone who\u2019s done this type of action to junior enlisted soldiers back into the battalion\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-25\">DC. Objection, Your Honor. He\u2019s also getting into ...[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-26\">.MJ. Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-27\">ATC. No further questions, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-28\">C. POST-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b393-29\">After the court-martial was completed, the trial judge conducted an informal, mentoring discussion with counsel for both parties, commonly known as a \u201cBridge the Gap\u201d session. According to a stipulation of fact subsequently entered into by the parties, the trial judge made the following comment at that time: \u201cI was thinking of keeping him in until his commander said he didn\u2019t want him back,\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>words to that effect. Defense counsel subsequently referred to the trial judge\u2019s Bridge the Gap statement in his post-trial submission to the convening authority. Based on this submission, the convening authority, upon advice of the staff judge advocate, ordered a post-trial session held under Article 39(a), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">At the Article 39(a) session, the post-trial judge considered whether the trial judge had relied upon inadmissible testimony when imposing the adjudged sentence and, if so,, what curative action should follow. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 1102(a), (b)(2). The post-trial judge accepted the stipulation of fact regarding the Bridge the Gap statement. The remainder of the Article 39(a) session included consideration of whether it was permissible under Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 606 to impeach the sentence by considering the trial judge\u2019s informal Bridge the Gap remarks; what the trial judge had meant by the stipulated remark; and whether the stipulated remark indicated that the trial judge had considered improper testimony in adjudging a dismissal as part of the sentence. Defense counsel contended that the remark on its face showed that the trial judge had considered improper testimony \u2014 the battalion commander\u2019s remark that he would not have retained Appellant if he had been on the court-martial panel. Trial counsel disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Although the parties briefly discussed whether the trial judge should be called to testify in the post-trial Article 39(a) session, he was not called as a witness or otherwise asked to explain his Bridge the Gap remark. Subsequently, the post-trial judge issued written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The post-trial judge concluded that the trial judge\u2019s informal Bridge the Gap remark constituted incompetent evidence that could not be used to impeach the sentence under M.R.E. 606(b). In the alternative, the post-trial judge concluded that even if the trial judge\u2019s comments could be considered, there was no evidence that the battalion commander who testified at trial \u201cever opined, either directly or euphemistically, that the accused should be discharged.\u201d In that regard, the post-trial judge made the following findings of fact concerning the context of the Bridge the Gap remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">[The] remarks [during the informal Bridge the Gap discussion] are not evidence that he considered extraneous information. [The trial judge\u2019s] comment that the commander said he didn\u2019t want him back is consistent with [the commander\u2019s] admitted testimony that he didn\u2019t want him back as a <em>clinician. </em>Most importantly, [the commander] <em>never </em>testified the accused should be discharged. He was not permitted to complete his answer to the question the defense identifies as resulting in the impermissible opinion. A fair reading of the record supports the conclusion that [the trial judge] cut off [the commander\u2019s] answer once it became clear that [the commander] was giving his opinion as a juror not as the accused\u2019s commander. [The trial judge, during the sentencing proceeding,] appropriately cut off the answer since the witness was improperly invading the province of the sentencing authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The post-trial judge added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">In the context of his entire testimony as a defense witness, [the commander] clearly indicated his support for the accused\u2019s continued service in the Army.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">D. CONSIDERATION OF POST-TRIAL, NON-RECORD STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Both the post-trial judge and the Court of Criminal Appeals cited M.R.E. 606(b) as a basis for not considering the Bridge the Gap remarks by the trial judge. M.R.E. 606(b) applies expressly to limit testimony by a \u201cmember of a court-martial.\u201d Subsequent to Appellant\u2019s trial and the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals, we held in <em>United States v. McNutt, </em>62 M.J. 16 (C.A.A.F.2005), that M.R.E. 606(b) does not apply to military judges. We also held that an extra-judicial statement by a military judge may be given appropriate consideration on appeal, subject to qualifications not applicable in the present case. <em>Id. </em>at 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">In the present case, citation of M.R.E. 606(b) by the post-trial judge and the Court of Criminal Appeals was not prejudicial. Neither the post-trial judge nor the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>below relied exclusively on M.R.E. 606(b). Both proceeded on the alternative theory that the Bridge the Gap statement was admissible in the post-trial session. Accordingly, the following discussion shall proceed on the basis that it was appropriate for the post-trial judge to consider the Bridge the Gap statement as reflected in the stipulation of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">At the outset, we note that Appellant does not challenge the admissibility of evidence or the rulings of the trial judge during the sentencing proceeding. Defense counsel sought and obtained the battalion commander\u2019s opinion as to Appellant\u2019s rehabilitative potential. Under the latitude permitted to the defense under R.C.M. 1001(c), defense counsel asked the battalion commander whether he would accept Appellant back into his battalion if a decision was made to retain Appellant in the Army, and the witness gave an affirmative response. The witness responded that although he would not take him back as a clinician, he would take him back as a platoon leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Once the defense opened the door to the issue of whether the battalion commander would want Appellant back in the unit, the prosecution appropriately sought to explore the witness\u2019s response on cross-examination by addressing the desirability of retaining in the unit a person who had committed the offenses of which Appellant had been convicted. When the witness extended his answer to suggest what he might have done as a panel member, the trial judge promptly cut him off and said that the witness was not allowed to make such a comment. The prompt and decisive action by the trial judge reflected his awareness that the defense had not opened the door to unlimited remarks about retention of Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The question raised by the granted issues is whether Appellant has established that the trial judge \u2014 having expressly stated that the battalion commander could not testify as to whether Appellant should be discharged\u2014 nonetheless proceeded to rely upon inadmissible testimony. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>44 M.J. 13 (C.A.A.F.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">During the post-trial Article 39(a) session, Appellant had the opportunity to provide a complete account of the trial judge\u2019s remarks during the Bridge the Gap discussion so as to establish both the content and the context. Appellant chose not to do so, but instead relied on a short stipulation of fact which contained the following brief quotation from the trial judge: \u201cI was thinking of keeping him in until his commander said he didn\u2019t want him back.\u201d Appellant contends that the trial judge was referring to the battalion commander\u2019s testimony that if he was on the panel, he would not vote to retain Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">We do not evaluate the informal Bridge the Gap comments of the trial judge in isolation. We view the trial judge\u2019s remark in the context of his actions during trial and in light of the entire record. The record does not establish definitively whether the trial judge, in the Bridge the Gap session, was referring to: (1) the testimony of the battalion commander that he would not want Appellant back in his unit as a clinician, or (2) the battalion commander\u2019s remarks about not retaining Appellant in the Army if he was on the panel. Under these circumstances, the defense bears the burden of discounting the first alternative explanation and demonstrating that the trial judge relied upon the inadmissible testimony on non-retention, as reflected in the second alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">With respect to the first alternative, we note that at trial, the defense counsel opened the door to the basis for the battalion commander\u2019s views as to retention of Appellant in the unit. In that context, the trial judge could properly consider the battalion commander\u2019s testimony that he would not want Appellant back in the unit as a clinician, and could give that testimony such weight as the trial judge deemed appropriate in the sentencing proceeding, including how it might bear on the question of a punitive discharge. With respect to the second alternative, we note that the trial judge expressly stated that the battalion commander\u2019s remarks were \u201cnot responsive\u201d and consisted of testimony \u201cthat a witness is not allowed to make.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>As a general matter, we presume that a military judge knows the rules of evidence and considers testimony only for permissible purposes. <em>See United States v. Prevatte, </em>40 M.J. 396 (C.M.A.1994). In the present case, that presumption is strengthened by the prompt action of the trial judge, which expressly cut off and rejected questionable testimony. Just as we presume that the members follow the instructions of the military judge, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Holt, </em>33 M.J. 400, 408 (C.M.A.1991), we also presume that a military judge adheres to his own evidentiary rulings. <em>See Davis, </em>44 M.J. at 17 (\u201cWhen a judge indicates he will not consider inadmissible evidence, ... we presume that he will do as he says.\u201d). In light of that presumption, and under the circumstances of this case, Appellant has not demonstrated that the trial judge relied upon inadmissible testimony in the course of adjudging the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">III. CONCLUSION The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\"> For purposes of this opinion, we shall refer to the military judge who presided during the trial as the \"trial judge.\u201d We shall refer to the military judge who presided at the post-trial Article 39(a) session as the \"post-trial judge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
