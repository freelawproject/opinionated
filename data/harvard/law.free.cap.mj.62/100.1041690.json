The principal issue is whether the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause barred the admission of statements Appellant\u2019s wife made in discussions with a co-worker that incriminated Appellant. Because these statements were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u201ctestimonial,\u201d as that term is used in <em>Crawford v. Washington,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the portions of these discussions that bore adequate indicia of reliability were admissible under the Sixth Amendment. We also reject Appellant\u2019s argument that the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals misused evidence that the military judge admitted for a limited purpose. But our resolution of the two remaining issues entitles Appellant to relief. We must set aside the finding of guilty to one specification due to the evidence\u2019s legal insufficiency and another because the military judge\u2019s announcement of the finding was fatally ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Appellant and his wife, both Air Force enlisted members, committed numerous drug offenses while assigned to Yokota Air Base in Japan. As the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals explained, Appellant \u201cand his wife used a variety of drugs on almost a daily basis, both together and separately. Sometimes they used drugs alone as a couple.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sometimes Appellant and his wife used drugs with other individuals, including an American high school student, NK. Appellant and his wife also purchased drugs and supplied them to others, including the high school student, \u201calthough they did this more as social facilitators than as dealers.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Government\u2019s case included the testimony of Senior Airman (SrA) Sherry Sullivan, who was assigned to the same duty station as Airman (Amn) Anne Scheurer, Appellant\u2019s wife. \u201cOver a period of about eight months beginning in January 2000, while working at her duty station, the appellant\u2019s wife told [SrA Sullivan] about the drug use, including the participation of the minor,\u201d NK.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> SrA Sullivan \u201chad an amiable on-the-job relationship with the appellant\u2019s wife,\u201d but \u201cwas not a close friend.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Typically, Appellant\u2019s wife \u201cinitiated the conversations about drug activity.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She usually described drug use she committed with her husband. But in a few instances, she described \u201cincidents where either she or her husband acted alone while using drugs.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s wife told SrA Sullivan \u201chow she and her husband would use body cleansing soaps and shampoos to purge their systems of drugs.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s wife also revealed her belief that \u201cthe Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) was \u201cwatching them\u2019 and looking to \u2018get\u2019 both\u201d Amn Scheurer and Appellant \u201cfor distributing drugs to a minor.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">SrA Sullivan \u201ceventually contacted the AFOSI and agreed to wear a \u2018wire\u2019 to facilitate recording of the wife\u2019s statements. Two of the conversations between Appellant\u2019s wife and the co-worker in August 2000 were preserved in this manner. The conversations ceased shortly thereafter.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">The defense moved in limine to exclude from evidence all of Appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s statements to SrA Sullivan. During a motions hearing, the Government called Amn Scheurer as a witness, but she invoked the spousal incapacity rule and refused to testify against her husband. SrA Sullivan testified and described her conversations with Amn Scheurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">The military judge denied the defense motion to exclude the statements, making \u201cdetailed findings of fact\u201d and \u201cextensive conclusions of law.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>His conclusions included the following relevant rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">(1) The appellant\u2019s wife, as the declarant, was unavailable as a witness; (2) Admissibility under Mil. R. Evid. 804(b)(3) requires that the statement tends to subject the declarant to criminal liability to the extent that a reasonable person in the position of the declarant would not have made the statement unless she believed it to be true; (3) The statements were against her interest in that the wife was well aware of her criminal liability when making the statements; (4) Under a line-by-line analysis, each implication of the appellant by the wife carried with it an attendant description of her own involvement and there was no attempt to shift blame away fi\u2019om the declarant toward the appellant \u2014 thus the statements were truly self-inculpatory; (5) There was no animosity toward the appellant on the part of the wife; and (6) The presumption of unreliability that attaches to statements like the wife\u2019s was overcome by the particular facts of the case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The military judge also considered the statements\u2019 admissibility under Military Rules of Evidence (M.R.E.) 401 and 403. He ruled that evidence of Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements to SrA Sullivan was relevant. He also ruled that the statements passed the M.R.E. 403 balancing test, relying in part on the following curative instruction that he planned to deliver:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">[Y]ou may consider evidence that Airman Anne Seheurer alone was involved in drug activity for the limited purpose of its tendency, if any, to first demonstrate the accused had the opportunity to engage in similar activity; demonstrate that the accused had access to the various drugs described by his wife; demonstrate Anne Seheurer\u2019s familiarity with the specifics of drug activity; and consider such background in assessing the credibility of her descriptions of the accused\u2019s alleged activity. You may not consider this evidence [for] any other purpose and you may not conclude from this evidence that the accused is a bad person or has general criminal tendencies and that he therefore committed the offenses charged, simply because of his association with his wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">The military judge also denied a later defense request that he reconsider his ruling on the admissibility of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">At his court-martial, Appellant was charged with three specifications of violating Article 112a, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> by distributing controlled substances (ecstasy, methamphetamine, and LSD) on divers occasions, five specifications of violating Article 112a by wrongfully using controlled substances (ecstasy, two specifications of methamphetamine, LSD, and cocaine), one specification of violating Article 112a by introducing methamphetamine onto Yokota Air Base, one specification of violating Article 111, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 911,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by physically controlling a passenger car while impaired by controlled substances on divers occasions, and one specification of violating Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> by wrongfully soliciting another individual to use methamphetamine. Appellant pleaded guilty to the two specifications alleging use of methamphetamine but not guilty to the other offenses. The military judge found Appellant not guilty of the cocaine use and LSD distribution offenses, but guilty of all other charges and specifications. In his findings, the military judge excepted some language from four of the specifications, three of which we will address below.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">The military judge sentenced Appellant to confinement for three years, a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the lowest enlisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>grade. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged. In an unpublished opinion, the Air Force Court affirmed the findings and sentence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We then granted Appellant\u2019s petition to review his case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\n<em>Confrontation and Statements to a Co-Worker</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We first consider whether the military judge violated the Confrontation Clause by admitting evidence of the statements Appellant\u2019s wife made in conversations with her coworker, SrA Sullivan. To answer this question, we examine the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Confrontation Clause decision of <em>Crawford v. Washington.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Like this case, <em>Crawford </em>involved the admissibility of incriminating statements made by the defendant\u2019s wife. Also like in this case, Crawford\u2019s wife did not testify based on a spousal privilege.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This presented the issue of whether the Confrontation Clause permitted the court to consider the wife\u2019s pretrial statements implicating her husband. Where this case differs markedly from <em>Crawford </em>is the context within which the pretrial statements were made. In <em>Crawford, </em>the statements at issue consisted of a tape recording of police officers questioning the defendant\u2019s wife. In this case, the statements at issue consisted of conversations between Appellant\u2019s wife and a coworker during which Appellant\u2019s wife implicated both her husband and herself in ongoing drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\"><em>Crawford </em>held that the Confrontation Clause forbids the \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As the Third Circuit has explained, \u201cThe lynchpin of the <em>Crawford </em>decision ... is its distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay; simply put, the rule announced in <em>Crawford </em>applies only to the former category of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>statements.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> So \u201cunless a particular hearsay statement qualifies as \u2018testimonial,\u2019 <em>Crawford </em>is inapplicable____\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The Third Circuit also observed that despite \u201cthe centrality of the term to its decision, the <em>Crawford </em>Court expressly declined to provide a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial statements.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Referring to statements \u201cmade to private individuals not associated with the government with no expectation of being conveyed to the police, the prosecution, or other officials,\u201d one commentator observed that \u201cstatements made to family, friends, and acquaintances without an intention for use at trial have consistently been held not to be testimonial, even if highly incriminating to another.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We agree that in this case the \u201cdeclarant\u2019s statements to a confidential informant, whose true status is unknown to the declarant, do not constitute testimony within the meaning of <em>Crawford.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The Third Circuit offered the following rationale for its view that statements unwittingly made to government informants are nontestimonial. First, such statements \u201cneither fall within nor are analogous to any of the specific examples of testimonial statements mentioned by\u201d <em>Crawford.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Second, such conversations \u201cdo not qualify as \u2018testimonial\u2019 under any\u201d of the definitions suggested by <em>Crawford. </em>\u201cThey are not \u2018ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent,\u2019 nor are they \u2018extrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized ... materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Finally, \u201c[ejach of the examples referred to by <em>[Crawford] </em>or the definitions it considered entails a formality to the statement absent from\u201d statements made in conversation with an informant.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Statements \u201ccannot be deemed testimonial\u201d if the declarants \u201cdid not make the statements thinking that they would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">In reaching a similar conclusion, the Second Circuit reasoned that <em>Crawford </em>offers the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Bourjaily v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cwhich involved a co-defendant\u2019s unwitting statements to an FBI informant, as an example of a case in which nontestimonial statements were correctly admitted against the defendant without a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court stated, \u201cInvolvement of government officers in the production of testimony with an eye toward trial presents unique potential for prosecutorial abuse \u2014 a fact borne out time and again throughout a history with which the Framers were keenly familiar.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Crawford </em>explains that an \u201caccuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>remark to an acquaintance does not.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The communications at issue in this ease fall within the latter category. The casual remarks in the present case stands in stark contrast to the \u201crecorded statement, knowingly given in response to [the] structured police questioning\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> at issue in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Our conclusion that the casual remarks at issue in the present case were not testimonial leaves open the question, not necessary for the decision in this case, as to whether Government involvement in the formulation of the inquiries made on behalf of the Government can establish the testimonial nature of the conversation<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> For purposes of the Confrontation Clause, there may be a substantial difference \u2014 with regard to cross-examining of a hearsay declarant \u2014 between a hearsay declarant\u2019s casual remarks and the declarant\u2019s response to questions structured by the Government. In the present case, the distinction is not applicable because the military judge found that the Government\u2019s role in obtaining the statements amounted only to facilitation, not direction or suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>Crawford\u2019s </em>requirement to exclude testimonial hearsay offered without an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant does not apply to Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements to SrA Sullivan. So what confrontation test does apply? We agree with the conclusion of every published appellate court decision that has considered this issue since <em>Crawford: </em>the <em>Ohio v. </em>Roberts<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> requirement for particularized guarantees of trustworthiness continues to govern confrontation analysis for nontestimonial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">The Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis of this question is typical of <em>post-Crawford </em>appellate decisions. That court concluded that for non-testimonial statements, <em>\u201cCrawford </em>leaves in place the <em>Roberts </em>approach\u201d for determining the statement\u2019s admissibility under the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that <em>Crawford </em>raises the possibility that nontestimonial statements are \u201cexempted ... from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> But because the Supreme Court declined to overrule <em>White v. Illinios</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which rejected the proposition that the Confrontation Clause placed no restrictions on the admissibility of nontestimonial statements, <em>\u201cRoberts </em>remains controlling for purposes of nontestimonial statements.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Wisconsin Supreme Court recently noted that its research revealed \u201conly one reported case, a [New York state] trial court decision,\u201d that had \u201cconstrued <em>Crawford </em>as exempting nontestimonial hearsay from Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>frontation Clause analysis altogether.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> And that decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court observed, \u201cseemed to rest on a misquotation of <em>Crawford.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We will evaluate Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements to SrA Sullivan under the <em>Roberts </em>test. <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>provides that where the declarant is unavailable to be cross-examined, the Confrontation Clause permits the admission of a hearsay statement in a criminal trial only if: (1) the statement \u201cfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\u201d or (2) it bears other \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In <em>Lilly v. </em>Virginia,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> a four-Justiee plurality indicated that \u201caccomplices\u2019 confessions that inculpate a criminal defendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule as that concept has been defined in our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Rather, such statements are \u201cpresumptively unreliable.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will scrutinize such statements to determine whether they bear sufficient particularized guarantees of trustworthiness to overcome this presumption of unreliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements to SrA Sullivan can be divided into three groups: (1) three statements that incriminated herself only; (2) approximately thirteen statements that incriminated both herself and her husband; and (3) four statements that incriminated her husband only. The lower court held, and we agree, that the statements in the third category were not relevant to any of the offenses of which Appellant was convicted.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> So we need not determine whether they were properly admitted into evidence. Rather, our focus is on the statements in which Amn Scheurer incriminated both her husband and herself. If those statements survive Confrontation Clause scrutiny \u2014 as we conclude they do \u2014 then a fortiori Amn Scheurer\u2019s three purely self-incriminatory statements that the military judge admitted for a limited purpose did not offend the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">In determining whether hearsay statements by unavailable declarants bear adequate indicia of reliability, the <em>Lilly </em>plurality emphasized that appellate courts \u201cshould independently review whether the government\u2019s proffered guarantees of trustworthiness satisfy the demands of the [Confrontation] Clause.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Our independent assessment of the evidence in this ease leads to the same conclusion as the military judge\u2019s: Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements to SrA Sullivan that jointly implicated her husband and herself bore sufficient particularized guarantees of trustworthiness to overcome the presumption of unreliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">We agree with the military judge that Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements were truly self-incriminatory and that a reasonable declarant in her position would not have made the statements unless she believed them to be true. As the military judge observed, she made her statements \u201cto a fellow military member on an almost daily basis, over an eight-month period,\u201d revealing \u201ca spectrum of drug activity deep in both frequency and breadth.\u201d Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements revealed \u201c[cjhronic use and frequent distribution.\u201d They also demonstrated her consciousness of the possibility of prosecution \u201cas fear of OSI [Office of Special Investigations] investigation crept into the conversations.\u201d Additionally, we note that the statements\u2019 potential to subject Amn Scheurer to criminal penalties was far from hypothetical. Four days after Appellant\u2019s court-martial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>concluded, his wife was tried and convicted of multiple drug offenses and received a sentence that included thirty months of confinement and a bad-conduct discharge.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The danger created by Appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s statements was further demonstrated by SrA Sullivan\u2019s decision to reveal her admissions to law enforcement authorities and to wear a hidden microphone to record their conversations. No one in Amn Seheurer\u2019s position would likely make such admissions unless they were actually true. As the Supreme Court has observed, \u201creasonable people, even reasonable people who are not especially honest, tend not to make self-inculpatory statements unless they believe them to be true.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The military judge also noted that \u201cthere was no government involvement in securing the statements until the wire device was used by OSI in August. Thus, there was no government activity afoot for the first seven months.\u201d Additionally, \u201cit appears the conversations were initiated by the declarant rather than Sullivan. Thus, even when the wires were used, this amounted to facilitation only on the part of the government, rather than direction or suggestion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The military judge also found that there was \u201cno evidence of animosity toward the accused on the part of the declarant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Finally, and critically, Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements were not made in an attempt to shift blame from herself to her husband or in an effort to seek leniency or favorable treatment from law enforcement officials. Rather, as the military judge found, her statements were \u201ctruly self-inculpatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Accordingly, on the basis of our independent review of the evidence, we conclude that Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements to SrA Sullivan bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness that warrant their admissibility despite the general presumption of unreliability that attaches to a declarant\u2019s statement implicating an accomplice. The military judge did not err when he admitted them into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">\n<em>The Air Force Court\u2019s Use of Evidence Admitted for a Limited Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">Appellant also argues that the Air Force Court misused Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements to SrA Sullivan that the military judge admitted for a limited purpose. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">In <em>United States v. Holt,</em><footnotemark><em>53</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the military judge admitted certain sentencing exhibits into evidence and ruled that the members could not consider them for the truth of the matter they asserted. Nevertheless, in reviewing the case, the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals considered the exhibits as substantive evidence. We held that a court of criminal appeals \u201cmay not resurrect excluded evidence\u201d or consider evidence in a manner inconsistent with the limited purpose for which the military judge admitted it.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> In this case, Appellant argues that the Air Force Court violated this rule in its use of Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements. That contention, however, is based on a misreading of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Appellant\u2019s argument assumes that the military judge\u2019s limitation on the use of Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> applied to <em>all </em>of the statements that she made. But that is not true. The limiting instruction that the military judge planned to give if this had been a members trial (which clearly served as his announcement of the limited purpose for which he admitted the evidence) applied only to the three statements in which Amn Scheurer incriminated herself and not her husband. The limitation clearly did not apply to the approximately thirteen statements that incriminated both of them or the four statements that incriminated her husband only. The instruction began by referring to \u201cevidence that Airman Anne Scheurer alone was involved in drug activity.\u201d The ruling\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>distinction between the three statements in which she implicated only herself and those statements that also implicated her husband came into even sharper focus when the limiting instruction stated that her statements could be considered \u201cin assessing the credibility of her descriptions of the accused\u2019s alleged activity.\u201d This makes clear that the limiting instruction did not apply to Amn Scheurer\u2019s statements that described Appellant\u2019s alleged drug use. Rather, the military judge admitted those statements into evidence without limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Air Force Court\u2019s opinion in this case contains no hint that the court used the evidence of Amn Scheurer\u2019s three statements impheating only herself inconsistently with the limiting instruction. \u201c[T]he mature and experienced judges who serve on the Courts of Criminal Appeals are presumed to know and apply the law correctly____\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In the absence of any indication to the contrary, we will presume that the Air Force Court considered Amn Scheurer\u2019s three statements that were solely self-incriminating only for the purposes permitted by the limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\n<em>Physically Controlling a Vehicle While Impaired</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">We also granted review to consider whether the evidence is legally sufficient to uphold Appellant\u2019s conviction for controlling a vehicle under the influence of LSD. \u201cOur standard of review on a question of legal sufficiency of the evidence is whether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, a reasonable factfinder could find each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> In this case, the evidence would not permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant controlled a car while he was under the influence of LSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">Drunk driving has long been a military offense.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> In 1986, Congress expanded Article 111 to prohibit operation of a vehicle while impaired by a controlled substance.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In 1992, Congress \u201csubstantially revised\u201d Article 111.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Most significantly for the purposes of this case, Congress expanded Article 111 \u201cto prohibit physically controlling, as well as operating, a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The 1992 \u201camendments to Article 111 were designed to bring the military\u2019s criminal justice system more closely in line with civilian criminal law.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">Courts have defined \u201cphysical control\u201d of a vehicle broadly. As the Army Court has observed, courts have held that this element is satisfied where the accused was: (1) sitting behind and leaning against the steering wheel; (2) sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked car with hands on the steering wheel and the key in the ignition, but without the engine running; and (3) sitting behind the wheel with the key in the ignition.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The Army Court explains that the \u201cstatutes are designed to deter individuals who are intoxicated from getting into vehicles except as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>passengers.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> So the revised Article 111 \u201cis a preventive measure designed to deter unsafe drivers from taking the first step, that is, sitting behind the wheel of an instrument which, in their hands, can cause great injury and death.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The Army Court\u2019s analysis makes clear that sitting in a passenger seat of a ear while someone else drives does not result in \u201cphysical control\u201d of the vehicle. On the contrary, the very purpose of the legislation is to remove impaired people from the driver\u2019s seat. So unless the Government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was in the driver\u2019s seat, rather than the front passenger\u2019s seat, the Government has not established an Article 111 offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In this case, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that a reasonable factfinder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was in the driver\u2019s seat of the car while he was under the effects of LSD. The evidence concerning this specification comes entirely from NK\u2019s testimony at the Article 32 investigation, a redacted version of which became part of the Government\u2019s case on the merits. NK testified that Appellant and his wife \u201csaid that they were going to go down to Roppongi and they asked me if I wanted to go with them. So we got into the car and left.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe went to Roppongi. I was in the back seat and Matt and Anne were in the front. That was normal.\u201d That is the only information in the record concerning the three individuals\u2019 location in the car. Even when considered in the light most favorable to the Government, this cannot support concluding <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that Appellant was driving the car. On the contrary, the testimony \u2014 which the military judge read rather than hearing in person \u2014 is equally consistent with Appellant\u2019s wife driving as with Appellant driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In arguing to the contrary, the Government miseharacterizes the evidence. The Government acknowledges that the evidence on this charge is limited to the transcript of NK\u2019s testimony at the Article 32 investigation. But the Government incorrectly argues that NK testified that during the car ride after Appellant ingested LSD, Appellant and his wife \u201cwere in their \u2018normal\u2019 places in the car.\u201d The Government then argues that it is \u201capparent the normal places were with Appellant driving, Amn Anne Scheurer in the passenger seat, and [NK] in the back.\u201d But NK did not testify that Appellant and his wife were in their \u201c \u2018normal\u2019 places.\u201d Rather, he stated only that Appellant and his wife \u201cwere in the front\u201d of the car and \u201c[t]hat was normal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Without the additional characterization that the Government incorrectly attributes to NK, it is apparent that the evidence does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was in physical control of the car the night he ingested LSD. Accordingly, we must set aside the finding of guilty to the Additional Charge and its specification and dismiss them with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">\n<em>Excepting \u201cDivers Occasions\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">When the military judge announced his findings, he excepted the words \u201cdivers occasions\u201d from three of the specifications that resulted in findings of guilty. One of those specifications was the driving under the influence allegation that we discussed above and set aside on legal insufficiency grounds. The other two specifications alleged drug use. Specification 3 of the original Charge alleged that Appellant used ecstasy \u201cat or near Yokota Air Base, Japan, and Tokyo, Japan, on divers occasions between on or about 1 June 1999 and on or about 31 July 2000.\u201d Specification 5 of the original Charge alleged that Appellant used LSD \u201cat or near Tokyo, Japan, and Mt Fuji, Japan, on divers occasions between on or about 1 April 2000 and on or about 31 July 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">The military judge found Appellant guilty of specification 3 \u201cexcepting the words \u2018and Tokyo, Japan on divers occasions.\u2019\u201d He found Appellant guilty of specification 5 \u201cexcepting the words \u2018and Mt. Fuji[,] Japan on divers occasions.\u2019 \u201d He found Appellant not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>guilty of the excepted words and substituted nothing in their place.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">As we recently explained, when an accused is charged with committing \u201cillegal conduct \u2018on divers occasions\u2019 and the [court-martial] find[s] the accused guilty of charged conduct but strikes out the \u2018on divers occasions\u2019 language, the effect of the findings is that the accused has been found guilty of misconduct on a single occasion and not guilty of the remaining occasions.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> When this occurs, if \u201cthe findings do not disclose the single occasion on which the conviction is based, the Court of Criminal Appeals cannot conduct a factual sufficiency review or affirm the findings because it cannot determine which occasion the servicemember was convicted of and which occasion the servicemember was acquitted of.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The key issue when applying this precedent is whether the findings establish which of the charged divers occasions provided the basis for the conviction. In this case, the findings provide such certainty as to one of the specifications (specification 5), but not the other (specification 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Specification 3 of the original Charge alleged that Appellant \u201cdid, at or near Yoko-ta Air Base, Japan, and Tokyo, Japan, on divers occasions between on or about 1 June 1999 and on or about 31 July 2000 wrongfully use 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (Ecstasy), a Schedule I controlled substance.\u201d The Government called SrA Andrew Wuthrieh as a witness. He testified that he had heard Appellant say he was \u201crolling,\u201d which he understood to mean that Appellant was under the effects of ecstasy. SrA Wuthrich\u2019s testimony did not indicate either when or where Appellant made that comment. SrA Wuthrieh also testified that he saw Appellant under the apparent effects of ecstasy in a Tokyo nightclub and that he saw an ecstasy pill at Appellant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">Airman Basic Tracy Svendsen testified about an occasion around March 2000 when Appellant appeared to be under the effects of ecstasy at a club in Tokyo. But he also testified that he never actually saw Appellant ingest ecstasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">SrA Sullivan testified about her conversations with Appellant\u2019s wife concerning drug use. SrA Sullivan testified that Appellant\u2019s wife told her that Appellant used \u201cthe pills.\u201d She also testified that Appellant\u2019s wife told her that Appellant used a \u201cBuddha\u201d pill at a party on Mount Fuji.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">NK testified that he saw Appellant use ecstasy on two occasions. He testified<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> about an incident when he and Appellant both took ecstasy in a parking lot in Shinjuku. Additionally, NK testified that he once saw Appellant apparently under the effects of ecstasy at Appellant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">The military judge ultimately found Appellant guilty of this specification \u201cexcepting the words \u2018and Tokyo, Japan on divers occasions.\u2019 \u201d So the military judge found Appellant guilty of a single use of ecstasy between June 1, 1999 and July 31, 2000, at or near Yokota Air Base. Based on the record, we are unable to discern which use was the single incident that formed the basis for this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">But we come to a different conclusion regarding the other specification where the military judge excepted the \u201cdivers occasions\u201d language. Specification 5 of the original Charge alleged that Appellant \u201cdid, at or near Tokyo, Japan, and Mt. Fuji, Japan, on divers occasions between on or about 1 April 2000 and on or about 31 July 2000 wrongfully use lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-18\">The evidence concerning Appellant\u2019s use of LSD is limited to two occasions. SrA Sullivan testified that Appellant\u2019s wife told her that Appellant used a \u201cpill named Buddha and acid\u201d during a party at Mount Fuji. NK testified about an incident when Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>said he was feeling the effects of LSD. While NK and the Scheurers were driving from Yokota Air Base to Roppongi, Appellant\u2019s wife gave half of an LSD tab to NK, who took it and experienced \u201c[m]ild hallucinations.\u201d Because the record contains evidence of only two LSD uses, when the military judge excepted the language, \u201cand Mt Fuji, Japan, on divers occasions\u201d from specification 5, he was necessarily finding Appellant guilty of the only other use, about which NK testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Our uncertainty concerning the basis for the finding of guilty to specification 3 requires that we set aside that finding. As we explained in <em>Walters, </em>where the conversion of a \u201cdivers occasions\u201d specification to a single occasion specification prevents the Court of Criminal Appeals from determining the factual basis for the conviction, the \u201cambiguous verdict\u201d prevents the \u201cproper exercise of [the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019] appellate review authority under Article 66(c).\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> This conclusion flows from the prohibition against a Court of Criminal Appeals \u201cfind[ing] as fact any allegation in a specification for which the fact-finder below has found the accused not guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> That limitation \u201cprecludes any proper appellate review of this type of ambiguous verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> To affirm a finding of guilty, the Court of Criminal Appeals must itself weigh the evidence and be \u201cconvinced beyond a reasonable doubt of Appellant\u2019s guilt of engaging in wrongful use on the same \u2018one occasion\u2019 that served as the basis for the [court-martial\u2019s] guilty finding.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> But \u201c[without knowing which incident that Appellant had been found guilty of and which incidents he was found not guilty of, that task is impossible.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Of course, this problem is easily avoided. As we noted in <em>Walters, </em>where a \u201cdivers occasions\u201d specification is converted to a \u201cone occasion\u201d specification, the finder of fact should substitute language into the specification to \u201cclearly put the accused and the reviewing courts on notice of what conduct served as the basis for the findings.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> But in this case, which was tried almost two years before <em>Walters </em>was announced, the military judge did not accompany the exception of \u201cdivers occasions\u201d with any substitution to specify the one occasion of use that formed the basis for the finding of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">Because double jeopardy principles would bar any rehearing on incidents of which Appellant was found not guilty, and because ambiguous findings preclude distinguishing incidents that resulted in acquittal from the single incident that resulted in a conviction, the remedy for a <em>Walters </em>violation is to set aside the finding of guilty to the affected specification and dismiss it with prejudice.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Accordingly, we set aside the finding of guilty to specification 3 of the original Charge and dismiss that specification with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">The findings of guilty to specification 3 of the original Charge and to Additional Charge 1 and its specification are set aside. Those specifications and that charge are dismissed with prejudice. The remaining findings of guilty as affirmed by the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals are affirmed. The sentence is set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force for remand to the Court of Criminal Appeals for reassessment of the sentence or remand for a sentence rehearing if the court concludes that it cannot appropriately reassess the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-14\">.

The spousal privilege rules at issue in <em>Crawford </em>and this case are different.

See my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>dissent in <em>United States v. Walters, </em>58 M.J. 391, 397 (C.A.A.P.2003) (Crawford, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">As to Issue II, I concur in the result. At the outset, I note that this case was tried before the decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Thus, the initial question raised by this appeal is whether <em>Crawford </em>applies retroactively. Federal courts that have considered the question of <em>Crawford </em>retroactivity have done so in the context of a habeas petition. <em>Cf. Bockting v. Bayer, </em>399 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Evans v. Luebbers, </em>371 F.3d 438 (8th Cir.2004); <em>Hiracheta v. Attorney Gen. of California, </em>105 Fed.Appx. 937 (9th Cir.2004). For purposes of this opinion I would assume retroactivity, without deciding, and hold that <em>Crawford </em>is not applicable because there was no active police involvement to obtain evidence for trial. I would also rely upon the language of the <em>Crawford </em>opinion itself in conducting the legal analysis to support this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">For more than two decades, prior to <em>Crawford, </em>the Court held that a declarant\u2019s out of court statement could be admitted under a hearsay exception if (1) the declarant was unavailable at trial and (2) the prosecution could demonstrate indicia of reliability or that the statement was \u201cfirmly rooted.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). However, in <em>Crawford, </em>the Court held that \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay statements may not be admitted unless the witness is available to testify and the defendant has the opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>Crawford </em>does not do away with the foundational requirements under the Military Rules of Evidence and does not change the hearsay rules. <em>Crawford </em>is \u201cfundamentally about the hearsay rules\u201d and not about offering statements other than for the truth of the matter stated or asserted. <em>Id. </em>at 59 n. 9,124 S.Ct. 1354. The one thing we can say is that <em>Crawford </em>will not apply where the declarant is available and there is an opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">What is testimonial? In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court noted that \u201c[v]arious formulations of this core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements exist.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The Court expressly stated \u201c[w]e leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. In determining what is testimonial the Court identified three \u201cformulations of [the] core class of testimonial statements\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">[(1)] <em>Ex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent \u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially; [(2)] extrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions; [(3)] statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">We need not decide which of these categories, if any, apply. Certainly statements made by Appellant\u2019s spouse in this case are not the type of \u201cinterrogations by law enforcement officers\u201d that would constitute \u201ctestimonial\u201d evidence within the meaning of <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
