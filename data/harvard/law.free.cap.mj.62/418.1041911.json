Wolford entered a plea of not guilty to sending, receiving, reproducing and possessing child pornography in violation of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A (2000), charged under clause 3 of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (2000). Wolford was convicted by a special court-martial comprised of members and was sentenced to be discharged from the Army with a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority approved the sentence and the findings and sentence were affirmed by the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. Wolford, </em>No. ARMY 20001042 (A.Ct.Crim.App. Apr. 27, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">A military judge is obligated to \u201cassure that the accused receives a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Graves, </em>1 M.J. 50, 53 (C.M.A. 1975). This obligation includes the duty to \u201cprovide appropriate legal guidelines to assist the jury in its deliberations____\u201d <em>United States v. McGee, </em>1 M.J. 193, 195 (C.M.A. 1975) (citation omitted). Failure to provide correct and complete instructions to the panel before deliberations begin may amount to a denial of due process. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>6 M.J. 116, 117 (C.M.A.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-19\">We granted review in this case to determine whether the panel was provided with appropriate and constitutionally correct instructions concerning the definition of the term \u201cchild pornography.\u201d We also considered whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support Wolford\u2019s conviction on child pornography charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find that the military judge\u2019s instructions did not deprive Wolford of due process and a fair trial. We also find that images alone can constitute legally sufficient evidence as to whether an actual child was used to produce child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-20\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-21\">From August 1999 to May 2000, Wolford used a Microsoft Hotmail account to exchange child pornography with individuals he met through the Internet. One of his emails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>was discovered by a woman who contacted the Harris County Sheriffs Office. The police, believing that there might be a federal offense involved, then contacted the U.S. Customs Service, which shares jurisdiction over CPPA investigations with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Postal Service. The Customs Service identified Wolford with the help of Microsoft and Wolford\u2019s Internet service provider. Customs then turned the case over to the Army's Criminal Investigation Division (CID).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">CID interviewed Wolford, and he admitted to receiving, viewing, sending and saving approximately 100 images of child pornography. Wolford later argued that his confession was coerced and his case went to trial on his plea of not guilty. At trial, various witnesses testified about how Wolford was identified, where the images were found on his computer and how old the girls in the pictures appeared to be based on their sexual maturity-</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Defense counsel did not object to the military judge\u2019s instructions at the time of trial. Even so, \u201c[tjhis [cjourt has determined that waiver must be established by <em>\u2018affirmative </em>action of the accused\u2019s counsel,\u2019 and not by \u2018a mere failure to object to erroneous instructions ----\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, 50 </em>M.J. 451, 455-56 (C.A.A.F.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Mundy, </em>2 C.M.A. 500, 502, 9 C.M.R. 130, 132 (1953)) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, we review Wolford\u2019s instructional claims de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 455. If instructional error is found, because there are constitutional dimensions at play, Wolford\u2019s claims \u201cmust be tested for prejudice under the standard of harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Kreutzer, </em>61 M.J. 293, 298 (C.A.A.F.2005). \u201cThe inquiry for determining whether constitutional error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is \u201cwhether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Kaiser, </em>58 M.J. 146, 149 (C.A.A.F.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">With respect to Wolford\u2019s legal sufficiency claim, our test is \u201cwhether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfinder could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, 25 </em>M.J. 324, 324 (C.M.A.1987) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">II. <em>Military Judge\u2019s Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Article 51(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(c) (2000), and Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 920 require the military judge to instruct the members of the court prior to any deliberations on findings. The military judge\u2019s instructions are considered a \u201cvital stage\u201d of any court-martial. <em>United States v. Groce, </em>3 M.J. 369, 370 (C.M.A.1977). As we stated above, \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s obligation to provide appropriate legal guidelines to assist the jury in its deliberations [is] an essential ingredient of a fair trial.\u201d <em>McGee, </em>1 M.J. at 195; <em>Graves, </em>1 M.J. at 53. The military judge\u2019s instructions are intended to aid the members in the understanding of terms of art, to instruct the members on the elements of each offense and to explain any available defenses. <em>Graves, </em>1 M.J. at 53; <em>see also Groce, </em>3 M.J. at 370-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">Wolford has made three arguments concerning the military judge\u2019s instructions. He argued in his brief that the military judge erred by: (1) using the following introductory language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8) in the instructions \u2014 \u201cany visual depiction, including ... [a] computer generated image\u201d; and (2) using the \u201cconveys the impression\u201d language of \u00a7 2256(8)(D) in the affirmative defense instruction. At oral argument, Wolford made no reference to the introductory language argument and conceded that the affirmative defense instruction was not problematic in the defense\u2019s eyes. He focused instead on the new argument that even though the military judge omitted the \u201cconveys the impression\u201d phase from the \u00a7 2256(8)(D) definition, the remaining language in the subsection is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The military judge gave the following instruction defining \u201cchild pornography\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">Child pornography means any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture or computer generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical or other means of sexually explicit conduct where[:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">[(A)] the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajl\">[(B)] such visual depiction is of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayv\">[(C)] such visual depiction has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">[(D)] such visual depiction is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. The words child or minor mean any person under the age of 18 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">At the time of this trial in 2000, the term \u201cchild pornography\u201d was defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8) (amended 2003) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB0\">any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">(B) such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a <em>minor </em>engaging in sexually explicit conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\">(C) such visual depiction has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-13\">(D) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">In <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>we noted that the Supreme Court in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 256, 258, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002), \u201cdetermined that certain portions of the 2256(8) definition are unconstitutional, specifically the \u2018or appears to be\u2019 language of 2256(8)(B), and the entirety of 2256(8)(D).\u201d 58 M.J. 450, 452 (C.A.A.F.2003). We will address each of Wolford\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">A. <em>Introductory Language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">Wolford\u2019s first argument is that the military judge\u2019s use of the introductory language \u201cany visual depiction, including ... [a] computer generated image,\u201d from \u00a7 2256(8) was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court did not address this introductory language in <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>and instead focused on the language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8)(B) and (D). 535 U.S. at 241-42, 122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-19\">In <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>we noted that the language from \u00a7 2256(8) that was not considered by the Supreme Court \u201cremains subject to criminal sanction.\u201d 58 M.J. at 452 n. 2. Wolford complains that the reference to \u201ccomputer generated image\u201d is unconstitutional based on the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of \u00a7 2256(8)(B) and (D). However the Supreme Court left intact \u00a7 2256(8)(C) which prohibits computer morphing and therefore some types of \u201ccomputer generated images\u201d are not constitutionally protected. Thus, it was not error for the military judge to use the introductory language of \u00a7 2256(8) in his instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-20\">B. <em>Affirmative Defense Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-21\">Wolford next argues that the military judge erred by using unconstitutional language in his affirmative defense instructions. During a session pursuant to Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839(a) (2000), the military judge consulted with defense counsel before instructing the members and specifically asked about the need for affirmative defense instructions. Defense counsel told the military judge that the defense did not see the need for any affirmative defense instructions. Despite this response from defense counsel, the military judge included an affirmative defense instruction based on 18</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the sending, receiving and reproducing specifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">You are advised that the evidence has raised the issue of a defense in relation to this offense. One of the elements to this offense is that the accused\u2019s act was wrongful, meaning without legal justification or excuse. The accused\u2019s act is not wrongful, and the accused cannot be found guilty of this offense if the alleged child pornography was produced using an actual person or persons engaging in sexually explicit conduct; <em>that each such person was an adult at the time that the material was produced; </em>and that the accused did not advertise, promote, present, describe or distribute the material in such a manner as to convey the impression it was, or contained, a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">The prosecution\u2019s burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused not only applies to the elements of the offense, but also to the issue of the defense; therefore, in order to find the accused guilty, you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense does not exist.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"APPR\">Emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">This affirmative defense instruction contains the language found in \u00a7 2256(8)(D) including the phrase \u201cconveys the impression\u201d which was found to be unconstitutional. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>this language is erroneous. We must decide, however, whether the error caused material prejudice to any of Wolford\u2019s substantial rights or whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Kreutzer, </em>61 M.J. at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We have held that a military judge is \u201cmore than a mere referee.\u201d <em>Graves, </em>1 M.J. at 53. He is charged with deciding whether any defense is reasonably raised by the evidence. <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>39 M.J. 230, 232-33 (C.M.A.1994). If there is \u201csome evidenee\u201d of a possible defense \u2014 it does not have to be compelling or convincing beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 the military judge is duty bound to give an instruction even if the instruction was not requested by the parties. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>12 M.J. 163, 166-67 (C.M.A.1981) (citations omitted). \u201cThis [cjourt reviews a military judge\u2019s decision to give an instruction ... de novo.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>50 M.J. at 455 (citing <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>45 M.J. 406, 424-25 (C.A.A.F.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">The instruction in question provided a defense to Wolford only if the images in question were created using adult models who were made to look like children. At trial, a pediatrician, Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Moore, M.D., testified for the prosecution. Dr. Moore testified that fifty-five of the eighty-six images found on Wolford\u2019s computer were of children under the age of eighteen. Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Moore was focused entirely on whether Dr. Moore had seen any of the pictures he reviewed in Wolford\u2019s case in any previous case. Defense counsel did not ask any questions that raised the possibility that any of the images relied upon by the Government depicted an adult rather than a child. No such evidence or argument was introduced at any other time. Thus, there was no evidence in the record of a possible affirmative defense, and there is simply no danger that the members might have used this unnecessary, but erroneous, instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">The lack of any evidentiary basis combined with defense counsel\u2019s assurance that no instruction was needed renders the military judge\u2019s error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cf. United States v. Sikorski, </em>21 C.M.A. 345, 351, 45 C.M.R. 119, 125 (1972) (effect of erroneous instruction need not be considered where instruction challenged by accused was specifically requested by him at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>C. <em>Constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8) (D) Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Wolford\u2019s third argument is that the military judge\u2019s use of the language of \u00a7 2256(8) (D) in the instructions is unconstitutional even though he deleted the \u201cconveys the impression\u201d phrase. As noted earlier in this opinion, in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>we stated that the Supreme Court in <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>had found \u201cthe \u2018or appears to be\u2019 language of \u00a7 2256(8)(B), and the entirety of \u00a7 <em>2256(8)(D)\u201d to be </em>unconstitutional. 58 M.J. at 452. Based upon that language, Wolford argues that the mere deletion of the phrase \u201cconveys the impression\u201d from \u00a7 2256(8)(D) does not remedy the constitutional infirmity. However, upon a close reading of <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>it is clear that the Supreme Court\u2019s concern with \u00a7 2256(8)(D) centered on the \u201cconveys the impression\u201d language. Their discussion focused on the impact of this language and how it addressed how speech was presented, not on what was actually depicted. 535 U.S. at 257-59,122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Since the issuance of <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>we have adopted this narrower interpretation of the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of \u00a7 2256(8)(D). In both <em>United States v. Cook, </em>60 M.J. 130 (C.A.A.F.2004) (summary disposition) and <em>United States v. Lowrance, </em>60 M.J. 129 (C.A.A.F.2004) (summary disposition), this court affirmed guilty plea convictions under the CPPA where the military judge omitted the phrase \u201cconveys the impression\u201d from the language of \u00a7 2256(8)(D), but used the remaining language from the definition. Here the military judge\u2019s instruction did not use \u201cconveys the impression\u201d language that was the focus of the Supreme Court\u2019s finding of unconstitutionally. Accordingly, the military judge\u2019s instruction on the definition of \u201cchild pornography\u201d was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">III. <em>Legal Sufficiency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Wolford argues the evidence that the images were created using actual children was not legally sufficient. The Government takes the position that a factfinder has the prerogative to decide without expert testimony whether images of child pornography are actual or virtual.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">We recently addressed this issue in <em>United States v. Cendejas, </em>62 M.J. 334 (C.A.A.F. 2006). In <em>Cendejas, </em>we held that the finder of fact can make a determination that an actual child was used to produce the images in question based upon a review of the images alone. <em>Id. </em>at 338. The images introduced by the prosecution in Wolford\u2019s case were sufficient to enable a reasonable factfinder to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Turner, </em>25 M.J. at 324. Accordingly, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the members\u2019 verdict that Wolford was guilty of sending, receiving, reproducing and possessing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-13\">. We granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-14\">WHETHER THE ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED IN SUMMARILY AFFIRMING APPELLANT\u2019S CONVICTION UNDER THE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY [PREVENTION] ACT (CPPA) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251 et seq.

O\u2019Connor, </em>58 M.J. 450, 452 (C.A.A.F.2003), this Court now takes the view that \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s concern with \u00a7 2256(8)(D) centered on the \u2018conveys the impression\u2019 language.\u201d <em>United States v. Wolford, </em>62 M.J. at 423 (C.A.A.F.2006). As a result, this Court concludes that the military judge\u2019s instruction using the other elements of \u00a7 2256(8)(D) \u201cwas not erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">According to the Supreme Court in <em>Ashcroft v.

Materials falling within the proscription are tainted and unlawful in the hands of all who receive it, though they bear no responsibility for how it was marketed, sold, or described. The statute, furthermore, does not require that the context be part of an effort at \u201ccommercial exploitation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As a consequence, the CPPA does more than prohibit pandering. It prohibits possession of material described, or pandered, as child por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>nography by someone earlier in the distribution chain. The provision prohibits a sexually explicit film containing no youthful actors, just because it is placed in a box suggesting a prohibited movie. Possession is a crime even when the possessor knows the movie was mislabeled. The First Amendment requires a more precise restriction. For this reason, \u00a7 2256(8)(D) is substantially overbroad and in violation of the First Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Although the Supreme Court\u2019s focus in <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>was indeed on the \u201cconveys the impression\u201d language, the Court\u2019s constitutional concern extended beyond this language. Otherwise, the Court would not have held the entirety of \u00a7 2256(8)(D) \u201csubstantially overbroad and in violation of the First Amendment,\u201d nor expressed concern with the section\u2019s language on pandering. Whatever this Court\u2019s prior views as expressed in <em>United States v. James, </em>55 M.J. 297 (C.A.A.F.2001), as a subordinate court we do not have the luxury of choosing or delimiting the Supreme Court\u2019s constitutional conclusion that \u00a7 2256(8)(D), as a whole, is over-broad and unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Irving, </em>432 F.3d 401, 411 (2d Cir.2005) (assuming both sections found unconstitutional); <em>United States v. Bach, </em>400 F.3d 622, 630 (8th Cir.2005) (commenting that Supreme Court held both sections in their entirety unconstitutional); <em>United States v. Wyatt, </em>64 Fed. Appx. 350, 351 (4th Cir.2003) (commenting that Supreme Court invalidated both sections); <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>314 F.3d 908, 910 (7th Cir.2003) (commenting that Supreme Court struck down \u201cthe provisions of the CPPA that expanded the definition of child pornography to include virtual images\u201d); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>312 F.3d 1250, 1259 (11th Cir.2002) (commenting that Supreme Court \u201cstruck down as unconstitutional the words \u2018or appears to be\u2019 from the definition of child pornography contained in \u00a7 2256(8)(B) and the entire definition of child pornography in \u00a7 2256(8)(D)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Nonetheless, I would affirm Appellant\u2019s conviction on the ground that any instructional error on the potential defense was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>United States v. Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. 52 (C.A.A.F.2005), albeit in the context of a guilty plea, we expressly left open the possibility of such a situation. In upholding Martinelli\u2019s plea we noted \u201cthe absence of any focus on the \u2018actual\u2019 versus \u2018virtual\u2019 nature of the images, the use of the unconstitutional definition of \u2018child pornography,\u2019 and the absence of anything in the record that would demonstrate that Martinelli pled guilty to a constitutionally defined violation of federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Applying this same reasoning to this contested case, I am confident that the use of the erroneous instruction on the potential defense incorporating some but not all of the language in \u00a7 2256(8)(D) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The Government did not argue that Appellant had advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed the pictures in question \u201cin such a manner that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8)(D) (amended 2003). There was no evidence presented that Appellant was being charged for possessing material based on the manner in which someone earlier in the pornography food chain described it. Finally, Appellant did not defend on either basis. Apparently the defense theory was that the images were of actual children and the defense focused on challenging Appellant\u2019s knowledge that he possessed the images. Thus, the record is clear that Appellant was charged, and convicted, for possessing pictures of actual minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
