Gonzalez pled not guilty to wrongful use of ecstasy and carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Articles 112a and 134 of the UCMJ, respectively. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 912a, 934 (2000). He was convicted on all of the charges and sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, 148 days of confinement, forfeiture of all pay and allowances and a reduction in grade to E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence and the findings and sentence were affirmed by the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>No. ACM 34691, 2003 CCA LEXIS 57, 2003 WL 827254 (A.F.Ct. Crim.App. Feb. 28, 2003). On appeal, this court set aside the Air Force court\u2019s decision and remanded for reconsideration of a specified issue. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>59 M.J. 159 (C.A.A.F.2003). Following the Air Force court\u2019s ruling on remand, <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>No. ACM 34691, 2004 CCA LEXIS 198, 2004 WL 1944723 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. Aug. 17, 2004), this court again granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">Where the Government fails to disclose discoverable material pursuant to a specific request, \u201cthe appellant will be entitled to relief unless the Government can show that nondisclosure was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>59 M.J. 323, 327 (C.A.A.F.2004). We have previously held that the Government\u2019s failure to turn over a Brooks Laboratory Discrepancy Report was error under Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 701(a)(2)(B). <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>59 M.J. 330, 335 (C.A.A.F.2004). We have also held that the Government\u2019s failure to turn over the Discrepancy Report is to be treated as prejudicial error where the other available evidence does not constitute \u201cindependent evidence of illegal drug use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where there is sufficient independent evidence of illegal drug use, the Government\u2019s error may be treated as harmless. We granted review in this case to determine if there was sufficient independent evidence that Gonzalez had wrongfully used ecstasy. We also considered whether defense counsel was ineffective in failing to discover that that the Discrepancy Report was not provided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>We find that the Government\u2019s failure to turn over the report was erroneous, but that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We also find that Gonzalez was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Agents from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) called Gonzalez into their office for questioning after a pacifier believed to belong to Gonzalez was found at the Central Quarters (CQ) desk in Gonzalez\u2019s dormitory. The Military Training Leader who found the pacifier knew that Gonzalez had no children and that pacifiers are considered drug paraphernalia associated with ecstasy use. During the OSI interview Gonzalez admitted to sucking on the pacifier found at the CQ desk and attending at least one \u201crave\u201d party. He claimed that he innocently ingested ecstasy at that rave and he expressed familiarity with the effects of ecstasy. Gonzalez consented to a search of his dormitory room, his car and a rental car. The search uncovered two more pacifiers and more than a dozen fliers advertising raves.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Gonzalez also consented to a urinalysis, which was positive for ecstasy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the observer from his drug test testified that Gonzalez behaved oddly during the test, stating that he was \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201ctalkative\u201d and that \u201chis eyes were a little glassy.\u201d Several months later, Gonzalez\u2019s car was searched as he tried to enter Sheppard Air Force Base because Security Forces had reason to believe that Gonzalez had stolen a gun. The search turned up a weapon, as well as a baggie of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Gonzalez\u2019s urine sample was tested by the Air Force Drug Testing Laboratory at Brooks Air Force Base in early September 2000. Aware that the Government would rely heavily on the results of his drug test, Gonzalez made several discovery requests for background information relevant to the drug-testing program at the Brooks Lab. He asked for reports created at or written about the Brooks Lab, particularly those concerning inspections, \u201cfalse positives\u201d and \u201cfalse negatives\u201d, contamination, misplacement and mishandling of samples, and any testing, processing or administrative errors. He also asked for reports written in the month Gonzalez\u2019s sample was tested as well as several preceding and following months.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">In response the Government produced quality assurance monthly inspection reports for June through October 2000. The Government also produced five months of quality control monthly reports, including a report dated August 10, 2000, which included the annotations \u201cBQC Unacceptable \u2014 1,\u201d and \u201cTechnician Error \u2014 1\u201d. The Government also produced fourteen discrepancy reports, including five from August 2000 and one from September 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">The Government did not, however, produce an August 2, 2000 Discrepancy Report, which explained that on July 31, 2000 the lab had improperly identified a negative \u201cblind quality control\u201d specimen as positive for cocaine metabolites. That report also explained that no conclusion could be drawn about what caused the false positive result and that all lab personnel were encouraged to \u201cpay closer attention\u201d to their tasks. The false positive quality control sample was processed by the lab one month before Gonzalez\u2019s sample was tested and at least one of the employees who handled the misidentified quality control sample also handled Gonzalez\u2019s sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">It is of some significance that the Discrepancy Report which was not produced was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>only one that described a false positive result. The others produced by the Government concerned ten incidents where the intralaboratory chain of custody was broken\u2014 including several instances of employees forgetting to properly sign or annotate the chain of custody sheet, one where a chemist failed to perform an \u201cin-run prime\u201d when restarting the equipment after a mechanical failure, one instance of unacceptable chromatography, and two incidents of improperly performed extractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">At trial, Lieutenant Colonel Dale Haak, an Army Drug Testing Program Manager and expert in forensic toxicology and biochemistry, testified concerning the results of Gonzalez\u2019s drug test, as well as the Brooks Lab quality control procedures. He testified about the difference between internal and external, and open and blind quality controls. He testified that Brooks Lab has never misanalyzed an external quality control sample and that there was no error with regard to the controls run in the same batch as Gonzalez\u2019s sample. On cross-examination, however, Haak testified that internal blind quality control samples come back with incorrect results approximately two percent of the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">I. <em>Failure to Produce August 2 Discrepancy Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Rule for Courts-Martial 701(a)(2)(B) requires the Government, upon request, to turn over \u201cresults or reports ... of scientific tests or experiments\u201d that are \u201cmaterial to the preparation of the defense.\u201d When a defendant makes a specific request for discoverable information, it is error if the Government does not provide the requested information, and \u201cthe appellant will be entitled to relief unless the Government can show that nondisclosure was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>59 M.J. at 327. Harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is a high standard, but it is not an impossible standard for the Government to meet. <em>See Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (\u201cTo set a barrier so high that it could never be surmounted would justify the very criticism that spawned the harmless-error doctrine in the first place: \u2018Reversal for error, regardless of its effect on the judgment, encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it.\u2019\u201d) (quoting R. Traynor, <em>The Riddle of Harmless Error </em>50 (1970)); <em>United States v. Vazquez-Rivera, </em>407 F.3d 476, 489-90 (1st Cir.2005) (describing harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as \u201can extremely difficult, but not impossible, standard to meet\u201d). We have previously held that the Government\u2019s failure to turn over the August 2 Discrepancy Report should be treated as prejudicial error where the other available evidence does not constitute \u201cindependent evidence of illegal drug use.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>59 M.J. at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">There is no dispute in this case that Gonzalez made a specific request for documents concerning the operations and accuracy of the Brooks Lab. It is equally clear that the Government did not produce the August 2 Discrepancy Report. The Government\u2019s failure to provide the Discrepancy Report violated Gonzalez\u2019s right to discovery under R.C.M. 701(a)(2)(B). <em>Jackson, </em>59 M.J. at 335. Thus, there was error and the burden is on the Government to show that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">With respect to prejudice, this case differs from our prior cases due to the level and character of the independent evidence of illegal drug use. <em>See Jackson, </em>59 M.J. at 335; see <em>also United States v. Israel, </em>60 M.J. 485, 486 (C.A.A.F.2005). In addition to the positive drug test, the prosecution introduced independent evidence of drug use including evidence that Gonzalez had drug paraphernalia associated with ecstasy both in his car and at his work station, and that he had sucked on at least one of the pacifiers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gonzalez also admitted that he attended at least one rave party and had fliers for thirteen rave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>parties in his car. Although drug use is not a necessary element of a rave, the two are often linked.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Gonzalez also admitted to prior drug use and to possession. He told investigators that he innocently ingested ecstasy at a rave he attended and testified that he was familiar -with its effects. The observer at Gonzalez\u2019s drug test testified that he behaved oddly during the test and that he was \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201ctalkative\u201d and that \u201chis eyes were a little glassy.\u201d Additionally, Gonzalez pled guilty to possessing marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We have taken into account the available independent evidence that Gonzalez used ecstasy and weighed that evidence against the claimed error. Although the missing Discrepancy Report may have raised some questions about the accuracy of the testing process at the Brooks Lab, we also considered that Gonzalez\u2019s urine sample was subjected to four different tests, each of which showed positive for ecstasy use. When the missing report is balanced with the evidence arrayed against Gonzalez, the scales tip strongly in favor of Gonzalez\u2019s conviction. Thus, we conclude that the Government\u2019s error in failing to produce the Discrepancy Report was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Our finding of harmlessness is further supported by testimony elicited at trial concerning internal blind quality control error rates at the Brooks Lab. Although the August 2 Discrepancy Report was not produced, defense counsel had sufficient information to attack the reliability of the laboratory testing process. During the cross-examination of Haak, defense counsel elicited testimony that approximately two percent of internal blind aliquots are reported as false positives or with other incorrect results. Thus, while the Government\u2019s failure to produce the Discrepancy Report remains error, the evidence the defense would have introduced if it had the Discrepancy Report would have been to some degree cumulative of the overall false positive rate already in evidence. In addition, Gonzalez was tried by a military judge sitting alone. The expert testimony provided by Haak was of a type that is regularly considered by military judges. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the missing Discrepancy Report would have had a substantial impact on the military judge\u2019s ruling in light of the four different positive test results that were also in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">II. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">Servicemembers are guaranteed the right to effective assistance of counsel at trials by court-martial. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>60 M.J. 469, 473 (C.A.A.F.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Knight, </em>53 M.J. 340, 342 (C.A.A.F.2000)). Gonzalez alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to determine, based on the documents produced by the Government, that the August 2 Discrepancy Report existed and had not been produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), Gonzalez must show both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficiencies were so serious as to deprive him of a fair trial. An appellant \u201cwho seeks to relitigate a trial by claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must surmount a very high hurdle.\u201d <em>United States v. Saintaude, </em>61 M.J. 175, 179 (C.A.A.F.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Moulton, </em>47 M.J. 227, 229 (C.A.A.F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>1997) (quotation marks omitted)). There is a presumption that counsel provided adequate professional service. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>59 M.J. 447, 450 (C.A.A.F.2004). This presumption is rebutted only by \u201ca showing of specific errors made by defense counsel that were unreasonable under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>60 M.J. at 473 (citing <em>United States v. McConnell, </em>55 M.J. 479, 482 (C.A.A.F.2001)). In addition, even where counsel made an error, the error must have been so prejudicial \u201cas to indicate a denial of a fair trial or a trial whose result is unreliable.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>60 M.J. at 473 (citing <em>United States v. Dewrell, </em>55 M.J. 131, 133 (C.A.A.F. 2001)). As we have previously explained, this court applies a three-prong test to determine if the presumption of competence has been overcome:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">(1) Are the allegations true; if so, \u201cis there a reasonable explanation for counsel\u2019s actions?\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">(2) If the allegations are true, did defense counsel\u2019s level of advocacy fall \u201cmeasurably below the performance ... [ordinarily expected] of fallible lawyers?\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">(3) If defense counsel was ineffective, is there a \u201creasonable probability that, absent the errors,\u201d there would have been a different result?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\"><em>Garcia, </em>59 M.J. at 450 (citing <em>United States v. Grigoruk, </em>56 M.J. 304, 307 (C.A.A.F.2002)). Where the case can be resolved by addressing the third prong \u2014 the question of prejudice \u2014 first, the court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>United States v. Quick, </em>59 M.J. 383, 386 (C.A.A.F.2004) (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Applying the <em>Grigoruk </em>three-prong test, we find that Gonzalez did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because there is no reasonable probability that the missing Discrepancy Report would have produced a different result. As we noted above, there was enough independent evidence that Gonzalez used ecstasy that the Government\u2019s failure to turn over the report was harmless error. For the same reasons, we cannot say that if defense counsel had read all of the materials that were produced, drawn all reasonable inferences and conclusions from the materials and made further inquiry into the meaning of the notations \u201cBQC Unacceptable 1\u201d and \u201cTechnician Error 1,\u201d any additional documents that might have been produced by the Government would have changed the outcome of this case, especially in light of the fact that it was a bench trial. As Gonzalez has not established that his counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced the outcome of his case, he has not established that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals for the United States Air Force is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\">.
