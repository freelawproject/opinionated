He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for six months, forfeiture of $500.00 pay per month for six months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority approved these results, and the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and the sentence. <em>United States v. Cary, </em>2005 CCA LEXIS 73, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>2005 WL 486140 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. Feb. 8, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">On Appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">I. WHETHER PRESENTING EVIDENCE TO THE MILITARY JUDGE THAT APPELLANT HAD PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT UNDER ARTICLE 15, UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE, WAS PLAIN ERROR WHEN APPELLANT HAD NOT IN FACT EVER RECEIVED NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT UNDER ARTICLE 15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">II. WHETHER THE TRIAL DEFENSE COUNSEL PROVIDED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL IN SENTENCING AND POST-TRIAL PROCESSING BY FAILING TO OBJECT TO THE REFERENCE TO NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT ON THE PERSONAL DATA SHEET.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Appellant was convicted of offenses pertaining to sexual activity with minor female dependents. Two of the offenses involved violating a base regulation against having under age dependents in his dormitory room; one offense pertained to sexual intercourse with one of the dependents, who was under the age of sixteen; and the third offense concerned obstruction of justice by asking one of the dependents to lie to investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">During the sentencing proceeding in this judge-alone trial, trial counsel provided the defense with a document that the prosecution intended to introduce, a personal data sheet summarizing Appellant\u2019s service. The document was admitted without objection. In the midst of data summarizing Appellant\u2019s personal records, the document contained the following entry: \u201cNO. OF PREVIOUS ARTICLE 15 ACTIONS: 1.\u201d <em>See </em>Article 15, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815 (2000) (nonjudieial punishment). The entry did not describe the basis for or result of any nonjudieial punishment proceeding. Trial counsel specifically introduced two administrative records reflecting negatively on Appellant, but did not introduce any record of a nonjudieial punishment proceeding, nor did trial counsel refer to nonjudieial punishment in his sentencing argument or otherwise. The military judge made no mention of nonjudieial punishment. The reference to Article 15 on the personal data sheet appears to have been a clerical error, as neither party contends that Appellant ever received nonjudieial punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Following the trial, the convening authority, upon recommendation of the staff judge advocate, approved the sentence as adjudged. <em>See </em>Article 60, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 860 (2000). Although the staff judge advocate\u2019s recommendation referred to the attached personal data sheet, the recommendation described Appellant\u2019s prior service as \u201csatisfactory\u201d and did not mention nonjudicial punishment. Prior to consideration by the convening authority, the staff judge advocate\u2019s recommendation was served on defense counsel, who offered no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">In the absence of objection in the circumstances of this case, we proceed under the \u201cplain error\u201d standard set forth in <em>United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460, 463, 465 (C.A.A.F.1998). We must determine whether there was error, whether it was plain, and whether it materially prejudiced a substantial right of the accused. <em>See United States v. Finster, </em>51 M.J. 185, 187 (C.A.A.F.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">To place this matter in context, we note that a commander has considerable discretion in deciding whether an offense is a minor offense subject to punishment under Article 15. <em>See Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>pt. V, para, l.e (2005 ed.). Nonjudieial punishment can be used to cover a wide variety of offenses, ranging from an incidental infraction during initial training to a significant dereliction by a member of a command\u2019s permanent party. <em>See generally id. </em>para. l.d. A data entry listing the numeral \u201c1\u201d after \u201cArticle 15\u201d \u2014 without any reference to the nature of the offense or the type of punishment \u2014 is not particularly informative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Military judges, staff judge advocates, and convening authorities know this, and it is highly unlikely that an official responsible for adjudicating or approving a sentence would focus on the term \u201cArticle 15\u201d without seeking further information about the significance of the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In that regard, it is noteworthy that trial counsel made no mention of the nonjudicial punishment, even though he specifically introduced records of less serious administrative actions. The staff judge advocate, who likewise did not refer to nonjudicial punishment, instead described Appellant\u2019s service as satisfactory. In that context, although the error of introducing the personnel data sheet that contained the numeral \u201c1\u201d after \u201cArticle 15\u201d may have been \u201cplain,\u201d Appellant has not demonstrated that the military judge or the convening authority considered this entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In the present case, Appellant was charged with offenses for which he could have received the jurisdictional maximum at his special court-martial of one year of confinement. The adjudged and approved confinement was considerably less \u2014 180 days. In that context, the absence of any reliance on the erroneous information by the prosecution or the staff judge advocate underscores the absence of any prejudice under the plain error test. <em>See </em>Article 59(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">With respect to Appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an even higher standard of prejudice applies. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>24 M.J. 186, 188 (C.M.A. 1987). In this guilty plea case, where the primary concern of the client would be on the sentence, defense counsel should have given careful attention to the evidence that would be introduced during sentencing. Assuming counsel was ineffective in not objecting to the data sheet with the incorrect entry, the defense must show that absent such error, there is a reasonable probability of a different result. <em>United States v. Polk, </em>32 M.J. 150, 153 (C.M.A.1991). In view of our conclusion on the issue of prejudice under the plain error analysis, any deficiency here does not establish prejudice with respect to the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b399-12\">CRAWFORD, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AOT\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">The plain error issue is not unique to military practice. The Rules for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) are modeled after the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and accordingly, we should follow the guidance provided by our superior court in applying or interpreting our rules. Specifically, we should apply Supreme Court precedent in determining whether we should correct an error not raised at trial. While I initially agreed with the \u201cplain error\u201d standard set forth in <em>United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460 (C.A.A.F.1998), upon reflection, I have recognized my mistake and have since followed Supreme Court precedent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kho, </em>54 M.J. 63, 65-66 (C.A.A.F.2000)(Crawford, C.J., concurring in the result). In <em>Kho, </em>I stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-15\">I see no difference between an error that \u201cmaterially prejudices ... substantial rights\u201d under Article 59(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a), or an error that \u201caffects substantial rights\u201d under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). As the Court in <em>Johnson [v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)] indicated, an appellate court may \u201cnotice a forfeited error.\u201d A finding or sentence \u201cmay not be held incorrect\u201d \u201cunless the error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.\u201d Thus, both prong four of <em>Johnson </em>and Article 59(a) instruct appellate courts as to when they may set aside the findings and sentence. The appellate court then analyzes whether the error was harmless. That is, it is possible to have an error that \u201cmaterially prejudices ... substantial rights,\u201d such as a constitutional violation, i.e., a confession obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment, but still affirm the conviction. I view the application of these four prongs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>to be the same, whether employed by a court of discretionary appeal or a court with mandatory review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Absent articulation of a legitimate military necessity or distinction, or a legislative or executive mandate to the contrary, this Court has a duty to follow Supreme Court precedent. Sadly, this is not an isolated incident where this Court has departed from the settled law of the Supreme Court when examining a constitutional right,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or when interpreting the same or a similar statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As I recently pointed out in <em>United States v. Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. 52 (C.A.A.F.2005), the \u201cspecialized society\u201d that we serve \u201cis populated not only by the uniformed men and women who bravely serve our Nation, but by their spouses and children, all of whom have every right to expect a measured and rational application of law by trial and appellate courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86-87 (Crawford, J., dissenting). Failure to follow Supreme Court precedent not only places the jurisprudence of this Court outside the judicial mainstream, but also undermines that specialized society\u2019s respect for, and confidence in, the military justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">This case should be affirmed because Appellant failed to establish that there was a plain error that affected his substantial rights. Furthermore, Appellant has failed to establish the error \u201cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of [the] judicial proceedings\u201d in his case. <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">. <em>See, e.g., United States v.
