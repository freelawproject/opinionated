The adjudged and approved sentence included a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for one year, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. Bean, </em>No. ACM 35422, 2004 CCA LEXIS 223, 2004 WL 2191259 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. Sept. 15, 2004). We granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED IN REFUSING TO INSTRUCT THE MEMBERS THAT SIMPLE ASSAULT WAS A LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WITH A DANGEROUS WEAPON.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">On April 23,2002, Appellant went to a local bar with a group of friends that included Staff Sergeant (SSgt) Warner, SSgt Archer and Senior Airman Hovancik. Witnesses testified that Appellant had a number of drinks and, at some point, his speech became incoherent and he began stumbling and running into people on the dance floor. After several hours, the group left the bar around 2:00 a.m. In the parking lot, Appellant\u2019s friends became concerned that he was drunk and offered to drive him home. As the attempt to persuade Appellant not to drive continued, Appellant and Warner exchanged angry words. Appellant then produced a knife, opened the blade and held it down along his side. At that point, Archer and Hovancik intervened, and the three wrestled Appellant to the ground and took control of the knife and Appellant\u2019s keys. When it appeared that Appellant had calmed down, the three released him and allowed him to stand. Appellant immediately opened his car door, retrieved a .45 caliber handgun and assumed the \u2018Weaver Stance.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He first pointed the weapon at Hovancik, then Warner, and then at Archer. Hovancik testified that Appellant said, \u201c[g]et out of my face or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d While the weapon was pointed at Archer, Archer grabbed it with his left hand and struck Appellant in the face with his right hand. As the two fell to the ground, Archer wrested the weapon from Appellant. Archer later testified that at the time he took the weapon, the hammer was \u201call the way back\u201d and the safety was off. He further testified that when he placed the weapon in Warner\u2019s trunk, he pulled the weapon\u2019s slide to the rear to clear it and noticed there was one round in the chamber and several in the magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">At trial, Appellant admitted that the weapon was loaded but insisted that the safety was engaged. He also stated he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>remember some of the events because \u201c[he] was more intoxicated that night than [he had] ever been in [his] life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Based upon Appellant\u2019s testimony regarding the safety, defense counsel requested an instruction on the lesser included offense of simple assault. Counsel argued that if the members found that the safety was engaged, they might also find that the weapon could not fire. The military judge denied the request as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">MJ: It being an offer, I don\u2019t think it matters. It\u2019s an offer, not an attempt. The firearm could have been totally nonfunctional, in fact. With an offer, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a scintilla of evidence for a simple \u2014 if there was any evidence whatsoever I\u2019d give an instruction. But, I don\u2019t see any evidence whatsoever in Specs 1 through 3 concerning a simple assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Appellant renews his argument before this Court that the evidence reasonably raised a question as to whether or not the safety was engaged when he pointed his firearm. As a result, Appellant argues, he was entitled to an instruction on the lesser included offense of simple assault, because a reasonable panel could have found, as a matter of law, that pointing a loaded, operable firearm at another with the safety engaged is not using the firearm \u201cin a manner likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant seeks support from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Davis, </em>47 M.J. 484 (C.A.A.F.1998). In that case, we held that \u201can unloaded pistol is not a dangerous weapon under the President\u2019s interpretation of Article 128.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">We review allegations of error involving mandatory instructions de novo. <em>United States v. Forbes, </em>61 M.J. 354, 357 (C.A.A.F.2005); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>50 M.J. 451, 455 (1999). \u201c \u2018[T]he military judge has a duty to instruct sua sponte on all lesser-included offenses reasonably raised by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>50 M.J. 480, 481 (C.A.A.F.1999)(quoting <em>United States v. Rodwell, </em>20 M.J. 264, 265 (C.M.A. 1985)). An accused is entitled to have a court-martial consider all reasonable alternatives to guilt. <em>Smith, </em>50 M.J. at 455 (citing <em>United States v. Clark, </em>22 C.M.A. 570, 580, 48 C.M.R. 77 (1973)). Toward this end, as long as an accused can show \u201csome evidence\u201d that \u201creasonably raises\u201d the applicability of a lesser included offense, the military judge must instruct the panel on that lesser included offense. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 M.J. 202, 205 (C.A.A.F.2000). Evidence \u201creasonably raises\u201d a lesser included offense if it could cause members to \u201cattach credit\u201d or rely upon it if they so choose. <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201cany doubt whether the evidence is sufficient to raise the need to instruct on a lesser-included offense must be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Rodwell, </em>20 M.J. at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">Appellant is correct that whether he used a loaded firearm in a manner likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm was a question for the members to determine. Similarly, Appellant is correct in stating that his conviction cannot stand if no rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that he used the firearm in such a manner. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324 (C.M.A. 1987). He is also correct in stating that if a firearm were not functional a conviction for aggravated assault could not stand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>er, it does not necessarily follow that as a result he was entitled to an instruction on the lesser included offense of simple assault. That depends on whether some evidence reasonably raised the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The evidence indicates the following. Appellant was drunk and claimed he could not remember all the events in question. He threatened his associates with a knife when they sought to dissuade, and then prevent, him from driving. Appellant obtained a .45 caliber weapon from his vehicle, assumed a \u201cWeaver Stance\u201d and aimed the weapon at three servicemen. Appellant conceded that the weapon was loaded, but testified that the safety was on during the altercation. One witness testified that when the weapon was seized from Appellant, the safety was off and a round was chambered.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Appellant has cited no authority, nor have we identified authority, supporting the view that engaging the safety of a loaded, operable firearm while pointing it at another, as a matter of law, removes or might remove its character as a dangerous weapon. Moreover, the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2005 <em>ed,)(MCM), </em>supports a counter conclusion. <em>MCM </em>pt. IV, para. 54.e.(l) sets out the maximum punishment for simple assault and contains two parts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Generally for simple assault, subsection (A) sets the maximum punishment at confinement for three months and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for three months. Subsection (B), which is specific to a simple assault committed with an unloaded firearm, sets a maximum punishment of confinement for three years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. The analysis for this provision states: \u201cThreatening a person with an unloaded firearm places the victim of the assault in fear of losing his or her life. Such a traumatic experience is a far greater injury to the victim than that sustained in the course of a typical simple assault.\u201d <em>MCM, </em>Analysis of Punitive Articles, app. 23 at A23-16. Common sense supports the same conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Based on the law and the facts of this case, Appellant was not entitled to an instruction on simple assault. In sum, where the evidence shows that an intoxicated accused pointed a loaded firearm at others, having first threatened the others verbally and with a knife, and having assumed a firing position, the lesser included offense of simple assault is not reasonably raised, whether the firearm\u2019s safety is engaged or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">. In relevant part, these specifications read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">In that SENIOR AIRMAN MICHAEL R.

At the time of trial, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.10, assimilated into federal law by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 (2000), read in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">790.10.

In this regard, the military judge\u2019s statement that \"the firearm could have been totally nonfunctional\u201d is an incorrect statement of the law.

Appellant did not contest that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>weapon was functional and there is no evidence in the record suggesting that it was, or might have been, nonfunctional.
