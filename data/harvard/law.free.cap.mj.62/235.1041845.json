INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"Ace\">There are two issues before this Court now: (1) whether we have jurisdiction to entertain Petitioner\u2019s assertions of error as to the legality of his death sentence; and (2) if so, whether his two petitions seeking a writ of coram nobis properly present these challenges here. More precisely, the first critical question is whether this Court has jurisdiction over this military death penalty case in the period after \u201cthere is a final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d under Article 71(c)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but before the case is \u201cfinal\u201d under Article 76.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second critical question is whether our collateral review of this case during this period extends to a writ of coram nobis or is limited to a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">As to the first issue, we hold this Court has jurisdiction to entertain Petitioner\u2019s challenges because this Court has collateral review jurisdiction over this case during this period. The Supreme Court has recognized that this Court has collateral review jurisdiction, and we find no authority inconsistent with our present exercise of this collateral review jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">As to the second issue, we hold that the present petitions do not present legal challenges properly here because coram nobis is not available. At this point in the case, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is the only pleading available to raise the substantive issues before this Court. So for the reasons stated below, we dismiss both petitions without prejudice to Petitioner to refile a writ of habeas corpus with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">Although we do not address the merits of these petitions now, the circumstance of this being a capital case is constantly before us. But some principles related to the resolution of these issues apply to all military justice cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">\u201cDeath is different\u201d is a fundamental principle of Eighth Amendment law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This legal maxim reflects the unique severity and irrevocable nature of capital punishment, infuses the legal process with special protections to insure a fair and reliable verdict and capital sentence, and mandates a plenary and meaningful judicial review before the execution of a citizen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All three branches of government are involved in a dynamic and developing process of addressing issues related to capital punishment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Both changes in capital punishment law and greater understanding in the application of established legal principles result in new issues being identified and presented almost as quickly as other issues are resolved. The impact of this constantly evolving body of capital punishment law is compounded as legal precedent from Article III federal courts relating to capital punishment is applied to military justice jurisprudence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">This case illustrates these observations. In two separate petitions for extraordinary relief in the nature of writs of error coram nobis, Petitioner requests this Court to apply to his military justice capital case the authority of two recent Supreme Court cases\u2014 <em>Ring v. Arizona</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Wiggins v. Smith.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">This Court\u2019s consideration of these eases raises both threshold legal issues as well as delicate issues on the merits. The threshold issues relate to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider these petitions, the appropriateness of the writ of error eoram nobis at this Court, and the applicability \u2014 including the retroactive application \u2014 of this recent legal precedent to the present proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">On the other hand, the issues relating to the merits of these two writs question the authority of the President to promulgate aggravating factors, the reliability of the capital sentencing weighing process, and the effectiveness of counsel in making decisions relating to investigating the background of Petitioner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>We acknowledge the tension that arises from the extended time involved in the appellate litigation of this capital case and the precise application of legal principles that operate to insure a fair and reliable adjudication of a capital sentence. But the commitment to justice in this capital case requires a patient and solemn resolve to proceed prudently, because \u201cdeath is different.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">II. APPELLATE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">This is a capital case that this Court affirmed on direct appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Afterwards, this Court granted a petition for reconsideration in part by deleting an inaccurate factual statement from our opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Later the Supreme Court granted certiorari and affirmed this Court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">After the Supreme Court decision, Petitioner filed a petition for extraordinary relief in the nature of mandamus at the Court of Criminal Appeals, asserting that felony murder under Article 118(4)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is constitutionally infirm because it permits a death sentence but does not require an intent to kill. The lower court denied the petition. Petitioner filed a writ appeal petition, and this Court affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That opinion documents the prior appellate history of this ease.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">While the writ appeal petition was pending, Petitioner filed another petition for reconsideration with this Court, asserting an instructional error by the military judge. This Court denied the petition for reconsideration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">Petitioner later filed a third petition for reconsideration, asserting that this Court applied an incorrect legal test in its evaluation of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This Court denied the petition for reconsideration.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The case has been forwarded to the President for action under Article 71(a),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but he has not yet acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">III. BACKGROUND OF TWO PETITIONS FOR EXTRAORDINARY RELIEF IN THE NATURE OF A WRIT OF ERROR CORAM NOBIS</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">A. The <em>Ring </em>Writ</p>\n<p id=\"b358-18\">On April 15, 2003, this Court received a petition for extraordinary relief in the nature of a writ of error eoram nobis<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u2014 the <em>Ring</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Writ. This Court issued a show cause order, the Government responded, and Petitioner filed a reply brief. On July 21, 2003, Petitioner requested oral argument. This Court granted the request and heard oral argument on this writ on January 14, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>B. The <em>Wiggins </em>Writ</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">On February 17, 2004, another petition for extraordinary relief in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis was filed in this Court<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>\u2014 the Wiggins<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Writ. This Court again issued a show cause order, the Government responded, and on May 10, 2004, Petitioner filed a reply brief and requested oral argument. This Court again granted this request and heard oral argument on December 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">IV. DISCUSSION OF THE THRESHOLD ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">A. Does this Court have jurisdiction to consider Petitioner\u2019s two writs?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">We approach this issue knowing that \u201cevery federal appellate court has a special obligation to \u2018satisfy itself ... of its own jurisdiction____\u201d\u2019<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The primacy of the issue of subject matter jurisdiction here is reaffirmed by the position of the Government that this Court has no jurisdiction to address Petitioner\u2019s attack on his conviction and sentence because they became final after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on review of his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">First, the Government asserts that \u201c[a]l-though this Honorable Court once had jurisdiction to review this ease, there is simply no basis for continuing jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Second, following this Court\u2019s prior decision denying a writ appeal petition in <em>Loving v. Hart</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Government asserted in its opposition to Petitioner\u2019s certiorari petition to the Supreme Court that this Court \u201cerred in exercising jurisdiction over the claim [writ appeal petition] under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a)[2000] [the All Writs Act].\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In this pleading the Government reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-18\">Petitioner\u2019s current challenge is a collateral attack on his conviction and sentence, which became final upon this Court\u2019s decision on review of his direct appeal---The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ... does not have jurisdiction to grant [habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 or] the equivalent relief in this case under the All Writs Act____ Therefore that court had no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) to grant a petition for extraordinary relief \u201cin aid of [its] jurisdiction[ ].\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqL\">Our evaluation of the Government argument that this Court has no jurisdiction must begin with the Constitution. Acting under Article I, Congress established this Court.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> As an Article I court, this is a Court of limited jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-21\">In <em>Clinton v. Goldsmith,</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed that our \u201cindependent statutory jurisdiction is narrowly circumscribed.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> This statement reflects the longstanding rule that, \u201cArticle I courts are courts of special jurisdiction created by Congress that cannot be given the plenary powers of Article III courts. The authority of the Article I court is not only circumscribed by the [Constitution, but limited as well by the powers given to it by Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>we may not act unless Congress has given us the authority to do so, we must examine the statute that gives this Court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Article 67(a),<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> states in part: \u201cThe Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces shall review the record in \u2014 (1) all cases in which the sentence, as affirmed by a Court of Criminal Appeals, extends to death[.]\u201d This statute expressly and unequivocally establishes the subject matter jurisdiction of this Court over death penalty cases on direct appeal. The narrower issue is whether this Court\u2019s jurisdiction continues after completion of the direct review by the Supreme Court and during the period in which the case is pending presidential action under Article 71(a). This issue invites the Court to consider two questions of first impression: (1) when a capital case becomes final in the military justice system and (2) what impact finality has on this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Before explaining our reasoning, we think it prudent to answer these questions. A capital case is final with the meaning of Article 76 only after the President, acting under Article 71(a), approves it. As finality under Article 76 is the terminal point for proceedings within the court-martial and military justice system, this Court\u2019s jurisdiction continues until a case is final. We proceed to our analysis appreciating the distinction between \u201cfinality\u201d under Article 76 as the terminal point in the proceedings and \u201ca final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d under Article 71(e)(1) that establishes the point of completion of the direct legal review. As will be presented below, these are the foundational concepts that reflect the primary responsibility of this Court for the supervision of the military justice system through appellate review. These concepts also invite a continuation of discretionary, but certainly not mandatory, judicial deference to this Court by Article III courts, as seen in judicial doctrines of abstention and exhaustion, and reaffirm this Court\u2019s jurisdiction thereby supporting this Court\u2019s exercise of powers under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">1. When a capital case becomes final</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">In deciding the issue of finality, this Court must initially consider Article 76, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">\u00a7 876. Art. 76. Finality of proceedings, findings, and sentences</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">The appellate review of records of trial provided by this chapter, the proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed as required by this chapter, and all dismissals and discharges carried into execution under sentences by courts-martial following approval, review, or affirmation as required by this chapter, are final and conclusive. Orders publishing the proceedings of courts-martial and all action taken pursuant to those proceedings are binding upon all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of the United States, subject only to action upon a petition for a new trial as provided in section 873 of this title (article 73) and to action by the Secretary concerned as provided in section 874 of this title (article 74), and the authority of the President.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">For our purposes, we focus on the plain words of this statute, which states that only \u201cthe proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed as required by this chapter ... are final and conclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>76 expressly requires that sentences be \u201capproved ... as required by this chapter\u201d before they are final.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>It is a fundamental tenet of statutory construction to construe a statute in accordance with its plain meaning.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> On its face, Article</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>We next consider Article 71(a), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">If the sentence of the court-martial extends to death, that part of the sentence providing for death may not be executed until approved by the President. In such a case, the President may commute, remit, or suspend the sentence, or any part thereof, as he sees fit. That part of the sentence providing for death may not be suspended.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">From the plain language of this statute, it is clear and undisputed that the President must \u201capprove\u201d a sentence of death before it is executed. It is equally clear from the plain words of Articles 71(a) and 76 that the President must \u201capprove\u201d a sentence of death before a capital case is final within the meaning of Article 76. Furthermore, this reading of the plain text is supported by the legislative history of Article 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">At the time of enactment of the UCMJ, both Armed Services Committees said of Article 76: \u201cThis article is derived from AW [Article of War] 50(h) and is modified to conform to terminology used in this code. Subject only to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal court, it provides for the finality of court-martial proceedings and judgments.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We, therefore, examine Article of War (AW) 50(h)<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> to better understand the operation of Article 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">AW 50(h) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">h. FINALITY OF COURT-MARTIAL JUDGMENTS. \u2014 The appellate review of records of trial provided by this article, the confirming action taken pursuant to articles 48 or 49, the proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as heretofore or hereafter approved, reviewed, or confirmed as required by the Articles of War and all dismissals and discharges heretofore or hereafter carried into execution pursuant to sentences by courts-martial following approval, review, or confirmation as required by the Articles of War, shall be final and conclusive, and orders publishing the proceedings of courts-martial and all action taken pursuant to such proceedings shall be binding upon, all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of the United States, subject only to action upon application for a new trial as provided in article 53.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">As to AW 50(h), we again focus on the plain words of this statute that only \u201cfindings, and sentences of courts-martial as heretofore or hereafter approved, reviewed, or confirmed as required by the Articles of War ... shall be binding____\u201d This statute expressly requires sentences be \u201cconfirmed as required by the Articles of War----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-18\">The requirement that a death sentence be \u201cconfirmed\u201d is addressed in AW 48 that states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-19\">Art. 48. CONFIRMATION. \u2014 In addition to the approval required by article 47, confirmation is required as follows before the sentence of a court-martial may be carried into execution, namely:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-20\">a. By the President, with respect to any sentence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-21\">(1) of death, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-22\">(2) involving a general officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-23\">Provided, That when the President has already acted as approving authority, no additional confirmation by him is necessary[.]<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-24\">So it is clear that under AW 48 and 50(h), a death sentence was not final until the President had \u201cconfirmed\u201d it. As the legislative history of Article 76 states that the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>change between it and AW 50(h) was \u201cterminology,\u201d it is apparent that the word \u201cconfirmed\u201d was deleted from Article 76 because it is unnecessary in light of the Article 71(a) requirement that the President \u201capprove\u201d a death sentence. Article 76 read in conjunction with this insight into and understanding of the legislative history of Article 76 reaffirms the correctness of our reliance of plain words of Article 76 to require \u201capproval\u201d by the President before a death sentence is final under the UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">We observe that neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has addressed the issue as to whether presidential action under Article 71(a) is a prerequisite for a case being final in the context of addressing the jurisdiction of this Court over a capital ease. Petitioner cited two Supreme Court cases to support the position that Presidential action under Article 71(a) is a prerequisite for finality in the context of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Dynes v. </em>Hoover,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> recites that a court-martial sentence \u201chad it extended to a loss of life\u201d becomes \u201cfinal\u201d after it is \u201cconfirmed\u201d by the President. But we note that <em>Dynes </em>was a non-capital case, and the statement related to the then-existing rules under the Articles for the Governing of the Navy with no established connection to Article 76. Also in <em>Schick v. Reed,</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there are two statements relating to finality: the capital case was \u201cforwarded [to the President] for final review as required by Art. 71(a)\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and \u201cthe death sentence was ... valid ... subject only to final action by the President.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But the issue in <em>Schick </em>was the validity of the President\u2019s conditional commutation of a death sentence under Article II, \u00a7 2, clause 1, of the Constitution, and the decision did not address the issue of finality. We find language in both these cases consistent with our construction of \u201cfinality\u201d for a capital ease under the UCMJ, but of little assistance in resolving this issue. So we decline to rely on either <em>Dynes </em>or <em>Schick </em>to support our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">2. Distinction between \u201cfinality\u201d and \u201ca final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">The Supreme Court has made clear that finality under Article 76 \u201conly defines the point at which military court judgments become final and requires that they be given res judicata effect.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> In <em>Gusik v. Schilder,</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court addressed the effect of AW 53,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> an immediate statutory predecessor of the present Article 76, and stated similarly, \u201cWe read the finality clause of Article 53 as doing no more than describing the terminal point for proceedings within the court-martial system.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">Understanding the distinction between \u201cfinality\u201d as to the terminal point in the proceedings and \u201ca final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d in the unique military justice system is important. Article 76 addresses the former, and Article 71(c)(1) addresses the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">Article 71(c)(1) provides: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>and if the right of the accused to appellate review is not waived, and an appeal is not withdrawn, under section 861 of this title (article 61), that part of the sentence extending to death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge may not be executed until there is a final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings (and with respect to death or dismissal, approval under subsection (a) or (b), as appropriate). A judgment as to legality of the proceedings is final in such eases when review is completed by a Court of Criminal Appeals and\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>If a sentence extends to death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>(A) the time for the accused to file a petition for review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has expired and the accused has not filed a timely petition for such review and the case is not otherwise under review by that Court;</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">(B) such a petition is rejected by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; or</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">(C) review is completed in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">(i) a petition for a writ of certiorari is not filed within the time limits prescribed by the Supreme Court;</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">(ii) such a petition is rejected by the Supreme Court; or</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">(iii) review is otherwise completed in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">The focus of Article 71 is on the execution of certain sentences \u2014 those relating to death, dismissal, or punitive discharges. Only certain civilian leaders can execute these sentences: the President alone can execute a death sentence and a service Secretary or designated Under Secretary or Assistant Secretary can execute a dismissal or punitive discharge. None of these persons may execute these particular sentences prior to a certain identified event occurring \u2014 \u201ca final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">Only after there is \u201ca final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d is a sentence ripe for execution \u2014 that is ripe for \u201capproval\u201d under either Article 71(a)(as to a death sentence) or Article 71(b)(as to dismissal or punitive discharge).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Moreover, as we stated earlier in this opinion, as to a death sentence, only after the President \u201capproves\u201d a death sentence is it final. From this statutory scheme of Article 71, it is obvious that these specified sentences of a court-martial, including a death sentence, even when affirmed in direct appellate review, are not self-executing.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-18\">In defining a \u201cfinal judgment as to the legality of the proceedings,\u201d Article 71(c) states that such a judgment occurs only when the case is complete on direct review \u2014 including review by a Court of Criminal Appeals and this Court, as well as possible review by the Supreme Court. We need not address here the impact a \u201cfinal judgment as to the legality of the proceedings,\u201d may have upon the legal authority that pertains to any further legal proceedings challenging the conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> But, from the plain language of Articles 71 and 76 and the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of Ajrticle 76, we conclude this important point: a \u201cfinal judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d under Article 71(e) does not result in a case being final for the purposes of Article 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\">Having established this point, we are compelled to comment on Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1209. This provision is an apparent attempt to blend both Articles 71(c) and 76. To define when \u201c[a] court-martial is final,\u201d R.C.M. 1209(a) uses language nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>identical to that in Article 71(c) defining \u201ca final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings.\u201d But R.C.M. 1209(b) adds the requirement that only a so-defined final court-martial that is \u201capproved, reviewed, or affirmed as required by the code,\u201d has the effects of finality under Article 76. R.C.M. 1209(a) and (b) read together, reflecting the authority of both Articles 71 and 76, declare the binding effect of a court-martial findings and sentence only after it is \u201capproved\u201d as required by these two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In summary, we proceed appreciating that there is an important distinction between two fundamental concepts in the UCMJ. Article 71(c) requires \u201ca final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d to render a death sentence ripe for approval by the President. Article 76 requires that the President approve a death sentence before the sentence is final, thereby describing the terminal point for proceedings within the court-martial system. We next consider what impact these two concepts have on the jurisdiction of this Court.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">3. The impact of finality on this Court\u2019s jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Article 67(a) vests this Court with subject matter jurisdiction over this capital case. But this case is not final under Article 76 because the President has not ordered the sentence executed. So we conclude that this Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction continues even after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision affirming Petitioner\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">This conclusion is supported by two important points: first, the plain language and legislative history of Article 67(a)(1) and Article 76, and second, the rich history of this Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction after completion of direct review. The previous discussion focuses on the first point relating to statutory interpretation. But as that authority is just one part of the support for this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, it is appropriate now to focus on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Acting under Article I of the Constitution, Congress has established military law as \u201ca jurisprudence which exists separate and apart from the law which governs in our federal judicial establishment.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> A cornerstone principle of military law was to vest the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, with jurisdiction \u201cto assure direct civilian review over military justice.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has recognized that it was in this Court that \u201cCongress has confided primary responsibility for the supervision of military justice in this country and abroad.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Our exercise of this responsibility through our judicial review of cases invites a continuation of discretionary, but certainly not mandatory, judicial deference to our judgments.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Considering the Court\u2019s mandatory jurisdiction over a capital case in Article 67(a)(1) and this Court\u2019s pivotal role in the military justice system, it is consistent with congressional intent that this Court retains jurisdiction at least until a case is \u201capproved\u201d and \u201cfinal\u201d under Article 76.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>We consider helpful, but not dispositive, the history of this Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction after completion of direct review.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In Frischholz, this Court, before addressing a petition for a post-conviction writ in a case that was final, stated: \u201c[Article 76] does not insulate a conviction from subsequent attack in an appropriate forum. At best it provides finality only as to interpretations of military law by this Court.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> We note that the Supreme Court stated its approval of this Court\u2019s construction of Article 76 in Frischholz.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Arguably the Supreme Court\u2019s reaffirmation of the holding in <em>Frischholz </em>supports the position that this Court\u2019s jurisdiction is not terminated once the case has completed direct review. This Court reaffirmed this important point in <em>Del Prado, </em>stating: \u201cNor is the possibility for relief terminated by the exhaustion of all appellate rights and procedures established by the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">But we observe that all these cases predate Goldsmith<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and most predate the congressional attention to finality in the 1983 legislative amendments to Article 71. Also neither <em>Frischholz </em>nor earlier Supreme Court cases that discuss Article 76, such as <em>Schlesinger, </em>address the terminal point of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. So we must examine the impact of both <em>Clinton v. </em>Goldsmith<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and the Congressional attention to finality in the 1983 legislative amendments to Article 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Goldsmith</em><footnotemark><em>67</em></footnotemark><em> </em>helped define the limits of our jurisdiction. In <em>Goldsmith, </em>the Supreme Court held that this Court exceeded its jurisdiction by enjoining executive action to administratively drop an Air Force officer from the rolls of the Air Force. The Supreme Court stated that Congress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-13\">confined th[is] court\u2019s jurisdiction to review of specified sentences imposed by courts-martial: the CAAF has the power to act \u201conly with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the [court-martial\u2019s] convening authority and as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 867(c).<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">The Supreme Court explicitly rejected this Court\u2019s reliance on the All Writs Act,<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> as a basis for the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to address the Air Force\u2019s action to drop an officer from the rolls.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The Supreme Court explained that \u201c[w]hile the All Writs Act authorizes employment of extraordinary writs, it confines the authority to the issuance of process \u2018in aid of the issuing court\u2019s jurisdiction---[T]he Act does not enlarge that jurisdiction[.]\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> As the executive action at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>was not a \u201cfinding\u201d or \u201csentence\u201d under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 867(c), \u201cthe elimination of Goldsmith from the rolls appears straightforwardly to have been beyond the CAAF\u2019s jurisdiction to review and hence beyond the \u2018aid\u2019 of the All Writs Act in reviewing it.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Unlike <em>Goldsmith, </em>the present capital ease arises from and relates to both a \u201cfinding\u201d and \u201csentence\u201d that was imposed in a court-martial proceeding. As we have stated, pursuant to the authorization of Congress, this Court is the only federal civilian court with the jurisdiction to accomplish mandatory review of this capital ease.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> So the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in <em>Goldsmith </em>are not in play in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">This jurisdiction of this Court is compatible with the final limitation in <em>Goldsmith </em>that the Supreme Court identified when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqpM\">[Tjhe CAAF is not given authority, by the All Writs Act or otherwise, to oversee all matters arguably related to military justice, or to act as a plenary administrator even of criminal judgments it has affirmed. Simply stated, there is no source of continuing jurisdiction for the CAAF over all actions administering sentences that the CAAF at one time had the power to review.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Consistent with this precedent, in the present case this Court does not address any issues relating to the \u201cactions administering sentences that [this Court] at one time had the power to review.\u201d On the contrary, the present issues implicate the validity and integrity of this Court\u2019s prior judgment in this capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Because this capital case is not yet final under Article 76, we conclude that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction to address Petitioner\u2019s two writs.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> So we turn from the power of this Court to act to the question of whether it should entertain either of Petitioner\u2019s present writs.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">B. Is Petitioner\u2019s Writ of Coram Nobis an Appropriate Pleading to Request this Court to Consider the Issues Presented in These Two Petitions?</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">1. This Court has power to issue extraordinary writs \u201cin aid of\u2019 its jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b366-16\">The All Writs Act authorizes \u201call courts established by Act of Congress [to] issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> It is well established that \u201cthe All Writs Act authorizes employment of extraordinary writs, [and] it confines the authority to the issuances of process \u2018in aid of the issuing court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has recognized this Court\u2019s power to issue extraordinary writs under the All Writs Act.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> So having established this Court\u2019s statutory subject matter jurisdiction in this capital case, this Court may invoke the All Writs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">The Supreme Court has also made clear that our power under the All Writs Act is \u201cessentially equitable and, as such, not generally available to provide alternatives to oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>er adequate remedies at law.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The Supreme Court also has stated that \u201ca writ may not be used ... when another method of review will suffice.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> This statement reaffirmed the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier statement in <em>Carlisle v. United </em>States<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> that: \u201cThe All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute. Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act that is controlling.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">So our considering these two writs pursuant to the authority of the All Writs Act must be consistent with these limitations \u2014 that it is \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d to address the unique issues relating to the capital sentence in this case and that the authority to issue the requested writs is not otherwise covered by another statute. These fundamental principles relating to our power under the All Writs Act require us to consider several issues: first, whether the Article 71(a) requirement for presidential action prior to execution of the death sentence constitutes an adequate remedy under law thereby rendering present review unnecessary and inappropriate; second, whether possible review by an Article III court constitutes an adequate remedy under law, thereby rendering present review unnecessary and inappropriate; and third, whether there are other adequate remedies at law available before this Court\u2014 specifically whether a writ of habeas corpus is available for Petitioner here and now.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">2. Later presidential action does not render this Court\u2019s present review either unnecessary or inappropriate</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We conclude that presidential action is not an adequate remedy at law. Presidential action is akin to a state governor\u2019s action, and as such, is not part of the direct judicial review of the case. Article 71 requires, prior to an action by the President regarding a death sentence, that this Court complete judicial review and that the Supreme Court resolve any petition for a writ of certiorari filed with it. This construction is supported by the legislative history of the 1983 amendments of Article 71 that suggests that they were intended to separate the executive clemency powers of the President from the judicial review of the proceedings. The Senate Report on Article 71 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-14\">This legislation continues the present requirement that death sentences receive Presidential approval and that dismissal of an officer be approved by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned before such sentences are executed under Article 71. Such reviews are conducted after all legal reviews are completed, and do not involve a review of the legality of the proceedings; rather, they are conducted as a matter of clemency.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">Indeed, as the President\u2019s action takes place within the framework of the findings and sentence approved during the judicial review, it is both \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d for this Court to resolve any post-conviction and legal issues before the President acts under Article 71(a). Our construction of the executive clemency powers of the President contained in the UCMJ, as separate from the judicial review of the proceedings by this Court, also makes clear that later Presidential action does not provide a substitute for our judicial review.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>3. Possible review by an Article III court does not render this Court\u2019s present review either unnecessary or inappropriate</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Neither do we find that possible or eventual review by Article III Courts is an adequate remedy at law. We reach this conclusion only after carefully examining the question of whether an Article III court can exercise collateral review after there is \u201ca final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d pursuant to Article 71(c) but before there is executive action taken on the findings and sentence under Article 71(a) and the case becomes final under Article 76. In addressing this issue, we find solid guidance and persuasive reasoning in <em>Blair-Bey v. </em>Quick<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In <em>Blair-Bey, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit addressed the jurisdiction of the federal courts to entertain a habeas petition challenging the procedures by which the petitioner was denied parole in the District of Columbia. The district court had dismissed the petition after finding that the federal courts were precluded by a provision of the D.C.Code, \u00a7 16-1901, from entertaining petitions filed by D.C. prisoners. But the appellate court held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the petition and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">In deciding whether Congress intended to restrict the availability of federal habeas corpus when it enacted the present section 16-1901, we tread carefully. As reviewed above, there is a \u201clong tradition of ready access of prisoners to federal habeas corpus,\u201d <em>Anderson [v. Singletary], </em>111 F.3d [801, 805 (11th Cir.1997)], and we are most reluctant to find that Congress has deprived an entire category of prisoners of access to an Article III habeas remedy without very clear evidence of congressional intent.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Applying this same reasoning in the present case, we also are reluctant to, and do not, conclude that Congress deprived service-members of the right to seek Article III habeas review after there is \u201ca final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d pursuant to Article 71(c) but before there is executive action taken on the findings and sentence under Article 71(a) and the case becomes final under Article 76. We find no statute expressing clear congressional intent to establish exclusivity of judicial power in either this Court or any other federal courts in this situation. Also it does not appear that there is a published Article III court ease addressing this issue.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">But our concluding that Article III courts have the power to entertain a writ of habeas corpus or other petitions does not necessarily mean that this eventual review is an adequate remedy at law. The mere possibility of eventual habeas corpus review in federal civil courts prior to presidential action re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>garding the death sentence under Article 71(a), is unlikely because of other federal courts\u2019 application of the doctrines of exhaustion<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> or abstention.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Earlier in this opinion we rejected the Government assertion that this Court does not have jurisdiction over these two petitions for extraordinary relief.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Similarly we have recognized the power of Article III courts to entertain a writ of habeas corpus or other petitions. At this point we simply explain why Article III intervention presently is unlikely (in light of the application of doctrines of exhaustion or abstention) thereby rendering our continued involvement in this case as \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d under the All Writs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Before a case is final under Article 76, Article III federal courts normally will not be available to consider Petitioner\u2019s challenge to his death sentence.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cfederal courts typically will not entertain habeas petitions by military prisoners unless all available military remedies have been exhausted.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In Noyd,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> the Supreme Court addressed the purposes of requiring exhaustion of military remedies prior to Article III collateral review. The Court quoted Justice Douglas, speaking for a unanimous Court in <em>Gusik, </em>to explain some of the important reasons which require civilian courts to respect the integrity of the military system that Congress has established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">\u201cAn analogy is a petition for habeas corpus in the federal court challenging the jurisdiction of a state court. If the state procedure provides a remedy, which though available has not been exhausted, the federal courts will not interfere---- The policy underlying that rule is as pertinent to the collateral attack of military judgments as it is to collateral attack of judgments rendered in state courts. If an available procedure has not been employed to rectify the alleged error which the federal court is asked to correct, any interference by the federal court may be wholly needless. The procedure established to police the errors of the tribunal whose judgment is challenged may be adequate for the occasion. If it is, any friction between the federal court and the military or state tribunal is saved____ Such a principle of judicial administration is in no sense a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. It is merely a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>deferment of resort to the writ until other corrective procedures are shown to be f\u00fatale.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The <em>Noyd </em>Court noted the need for \u201ca substantial degree of civilian deference to the military tribunals\u201d and specifically referenced our Court\u2019s \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d for the supervision of military justice.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> The Supreme Court stated that this deference to our Court was rooted in both judicial economy (avoiding needless civilian judicial intervention) and respect for our Court\u2019s expertise in interpreting the technical provisions of the UCMJ.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Application of either the exhaustion or abstention doctrine by Article III courts is most appropriate in this capital case. Because there has not yet been presidential approval of the death sentence, an Article III court would likely view as premature any habeas corpus petition challenging a military death sentence.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Until the President acts, there is the possibility that the issue could be mooted, so that Article III courts should not become involved. This probable absence of an alternate forum to present his claim, before action by the President, invites this Court to be available to address issues that relate to the lawfulness of the capital sentence.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">In addition there are four other important practical factors that support the application of the doctrine of exhaustion in the present situation. First, Congress gave this Court the authority to conduct a mandatory review of death penalty cases.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Under this authority, this Court remains the primary judicial body with jurisdiction over Petitioner\u2019s case, and this Court has authority to reexamine its prior decision in this case.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> The factual history of this case, including the decision by the Supreme Court in June of 1996 and no presidential action as to the death sentence, reveals that this ease could otherwise remain in a legal vacuum for years. We do not think this is what the Congress intended when it directed this Court to conduct a mandatory review of capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Second, we note that the scope of federal habeas review is not certain, thereby raising questions as to the capability of federal habeas proceedings to safeguard servicemembers\u2019 constitutional rights.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> In light of these circumstances, it is our view that the mere possibility of eventual habeas corpus review of uncertain scope in federal civil courts, after the President\u2019s action, is an inadequate substitute for this Court\u2019s timely consideration of issues challenging the lawfulness of a capital sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Third, Congress has given this Court a mandate to provide direct civilian review over military justice and guidance to other military courts considering capital cases and federal courts with respect to the impact of the recent opinions in <em>Ring, Apprendi, </em>and <em>Wiggins </em>on the military\u2019s death penalty scheme.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> This guidance is of some urgency as there are presently four death penalty cases under direct review at the Military Courts of Criminal Appeals, and other pending or potential capital cases in the offing.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Finally, prior to the President acting on a sentence of death, pursuant to Article 71(a), the military justice system must present to the President a case where the findings and sentence are lawful and there is confidence in the reliability of the determination of a death sentence. If legal issues arise between the conclusion of legal review and final executive action, it is best that the legal foundation for the President\u2019s action be established by this Court with its expertise in military justice.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> This probable absence of an alternate forum for a servicemember to present his claim, before action by the President, invites this Court to be available to address issues that relate to the lawfulness of the capital sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In summary, these additional four points support our conclusion that present review by an Article III court is unlikely. Accordingly, our review is necessary and proper because there is no viable alternate judicial forum available for Petitioner to present his legal challenges as to the lawfulness of a capital sentence prior to the President acting pursuant to Article 71(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">4. Consideration of other legal remedies that relate to the appropriateness of this Court\u2019s present review of Petitioner\u2019s claims</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">In light of these conclusions, this Court must determine whether there are other adequate remedies at law available before this or any other Court. This requires us to address both the propriety of filing a writ of coram nobis and other statutory authority that addresses the right of an incarcerated person to seek habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">To support his claim for extraordinary relief, Petitioner presents constitutional challenges to the legality of his capital sentence; the <em>Ring </em>Writ relates to the authority of the President to promulgate R.C.M. 1004 and the voting procedures for adjudging his capital sentence, and the <em>Wiggins </em>Writ makes a claim of ineffective assistance of Petitioner\u2019s trial defense counsel. Procedurally, Petitioner filed two petitions for extraordinary relief in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis. In both of these writs, Petitioner seeks the relief of setting aside his death sentence, and in neither of these writs does Petitioner challenge his continued confinement nor seek to be released from confinement.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> In addressing the propriety of the two petitions, we are obliged to address both the writ of coram nobis and the writ of habeas corpus, because the former is available only when the later is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">\u201cThe \u2018writ of error coram nobis,\u2019 also referred to simply as a \u2018writ of coram nobis,\u2019 evolved in 16th century English common law as a procedural means to remedy judicial wrongs for which there was no other established remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> The writ of coram nobis (the Latin phrase literally translates \u201clet the record remain before us\u201d) is submitted to the court that imposed the original judgment.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>A writ petition submitted to a superior court is a writ of error coram vobis (\u201cbefore you\u201d).<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> But incorrectly describing the writ is not fatal to a petition, because courts look at the substance of the writ rather than the form.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u201cHistorically, the writ of error coram nobis was distinct from the writ of habeas corpus in that the former dealt with factual errors and the latter with legal errors.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> This distinction no longer pertains, as coram nobis has been expanded to encompass constitutional and other fundamental errors.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Reflecting its original purpose, a writ of error coram nobis remains appropriate when no other remedy is available.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> A distinctive feature of this writ is that it alleges no error by the original court or its findings, but invites the original court\u2019s attention to new facts or law that were not known to the court at the time and that may change the result.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> It \u201cpermits a court to remedy errors not perceived or not fully assessed when the case was first before it.\u201d<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> \u201cIt may not be used to seek a reevaluation of the evidence or a reconsideration of alleged errors.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> The writ encompasses the impact of new law on a decision.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">Courts have imposed \u201ca requirement that the movant show that he or she had exercised reasonable diligence in seeking a remedy ... a requirement that the defendant, exercising reasonable diligence could not have discovered the evidence prior to the original judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> \u201cBoth at common law and in modern practice, the relief afforded [by the writ] is without limitation of time for facts affecting the validity and regularity of the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> A writ of coram nobis differs from a writ of habeas corpus in that it is available to petitioners who are not in custody.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">The Supreme Court has had very little to say on coram nobis in the last fifty years. But we do find helpful the substantive discussion of eoram nobis in <em>United States v. Morgan.</em><footnotemark><em>119</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Morgan, </em>the Court established the prevailing rule today \u2014 \u201cContinuation of litigation after final judgment and exhaustion or waiver of any statutory right of review should be allowed through this extraordinary remedy only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice.\u201d<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Coram <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>nobis should only be used to remedy \u201cerrors \u2018of the most fundamental character.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>121</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In a more recent case, <em>Carlisle v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>122</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court underscored the difficulty of successfully petitioning for a writ of coram nobis where a specific rule of criminal procedure provided the applicable law relating to an issue. The Court stated, \u201cAs we noted a few years after the enactment of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \u2018it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [a writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> But we find this guidance less than satisfying in the present case, for \u201c[u]n-like the practice in the United States Circuit Courts of Appeal and District Courts, neither the UCMJ nor the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984, provides procedures for collateral, post-conviction attacks on guilty verdicts.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> So absent a specific rule or statute in the military justice system that pertains to this present situation, we next consider other statutory authority that might be available for Petitioner to obtain the relief that he now requests from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">In federal criminal practice, a motion to vacate the judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 has, for the most part, replaced the writ of coram nobis. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 did not abolish the common law writ of error coram nobis, and it is still available under the All Writs Act.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that coram nobis is analogous to a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and \u201cthe processes developed for treating Section 2255 motions apply as well to coram nobis applications.\u201d<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> Similarly, we view the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>review for coram nobis as equivalent to that for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> Although this scope is not altogether clear, it is important to note that eoram nobis \u201cusually does not include claims raised on direct appeal or habeas if the issues were decided on the merits there.\u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Morgan, </em>the question remains as to whether coram nobis relief is available if the petitioner is \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255. This is important because if relief is available under \u00a7 2255, thereby making the statutory remedies of that section available to this Petitioner, coram nobis is not available. The circuit courts are in complete agreement that if the petitioner is \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255, coram nobis relief is unavailable as a matter of law.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> This is true whether or not habeas relief is a realistic possibility. In other words, even if the coram nobis petitioner will be barred from habeas relief due to time limits, the rules on successive petitions, or other limitations of \u00a7 2255, coram nobis is still not available.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Interestingly, military courts have not fully addressed or decided the \u201cin custody\u201d issue.<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> This Court\u2019s coram nobis decisions have involved petitioners both in and out of custody but it does not appear that there is any case where the \u201cin custody issue\u201d was treated as dispositive.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">But we need not resolve whether coram nobis relief is available if the petitioner is \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255, for there is another basis for our concluding that the statutory remedies of that section are not available to this Petitioner. The plain language of \u00a7 2255 does not speak to the power of this Court to address Petitioner\u2019s challenges to his court-martial.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">This statute states in part that \u201cA prisoner ... may <em>move the court which imposed the sentence </em>to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> In the military justice system there are no standing courts, so the court that imposed Petitioner\u2019s death sentence is no longer in existence.<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> Also because this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Court was not the sentencing court, it similarly is not a \u201ccourt which imposed the sentence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255. Any attempt of a servicemember to avail himself of \u00a7 2255 in this Court is obviously futile because the statute permits the sentencing court to \u201cmake findings of fact\u201d and this Court has no factfinding power.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> We decline any invitation to fit a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 square peg into an Article 67 round hole. We find that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is not pertinent. Because Petitioner cannot presently obtain habeas review under this statute, we cannot rely on it to render his petition for a writ of coram nobis unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Next we address whether Petitioner can seek habeas under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. This statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">Writs of habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district courts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions. The order of a circuit judge shall be entered in the records of the district court of the district wherein the restraint complained of is had.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We conclude that the plain words of this statute also do not speak to the power of this Court to address Petitioner\u2019s challenges to his court-martial. By the plain words of this statute, neither this Court nor any judge of this Court is empowered to act.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> This Article I court is not mentioned by name, and the judges of this Article I court are not circuit judges.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">Finally, any action by this Court or a judge of this Court directing any habeas petition to an Article III court pursuant to this statute would most likely not accomplish the purpose of the statute of obtaining habeas review because the district court would decline to proceed on exhaustion or abstention grounds pending the case becoming final within the military justice system. Thus, we conclude that a petition before this Court for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is not a viable remedy thereby rendering relief under coram nobis unavailable.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">5. This Court may issue a writ of habeas corpus under the All Writs Act in this death penalty case; therefore a coram nobis writ is not appropriate</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">Eliminating possible alternative relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2255 does not mean that the eoram nobis pleading is proper. Deciding that these two statutes are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>pertinent to the power of this Court to issue writs, therefore, permits this Court to look to the All Writs Act \u2014 our \u201cresidual source of authority to issue writs.\u201d<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> We conclude that there is a proper basis to permit Petitioner to file a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">As stated earlier, there is no question that this Court is empowered under the All Writs Act to grant extraordinary relief where appropriate. The writ of habeas corpus is available to the military accused and may be filed in this Court under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), because the Supreme Court has expressly addressed this issue and blessed our issuing the \u201cGreat Writ.\u201d<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> The Supreme Court stated, \u201c[W]e do not believe that there can be any doubt as to the power of the Court of Military Appeals to issue an emergency writ of habeas corpus in cases, like the present one, which may ultimately be reviewed by the court.\u201d<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> This statement of the Supreme Court reaffirms the conclusion that a writ of habeas corpus is unavailable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2255, because had either of these statutes authorized habeas relief, the Supreme Court would not have relied on the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651(a) to support this Court\u2019s exercise of judicial power under <em>Noyd. </em>With this clear precedent before us that this Court may grant a writ of habeas corpus to address the issues raised in the two extraordinary writs filed in the present case, we conclude that coram nobis is not appropriate. Regarding the writ of habeas corpus, the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">[T]he scope and flexibility of the writ [of habeas corpus] \u2014 its capacity to reach all manner of illegal detention \u2014 its ability to cut through barriers of form and procedural mazes \u2014 have always been emphasized and jealously guarded by courts and lawmakers. The very nature of the writ demands that it be administered with the initiative and flexibility essential to insure that miscarriages of justice within its reach are surfaced and corrected.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Because of the present availability of \u201cthe Great Writ\u201d<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> under 28 U.S.C. 1651(a), Petitioner cannot properly file a writ coram nobis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">6. Petitioner has shown \u201cgood cause\u201d for filing the present pleadings at this Court</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Although we have established that our issuing a writ of coram nobis presently is not appropriate, we must acknowledge that in Garrett,<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> this Court recognized its power to entertain a writ of error coram nobis to address \u201cconstitutional and other fundamental errors.\u201d<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> But this Court did not discuss the relationship between habeas corpus and coram nobis. Because of this omission, we decline to follow <em>Garrett </em>and perpetuate the life of a writ of coram nobis where the petitioner is \u201cin custody\u201d and a writ of habeas corpus is available to Petitioner to present issues to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">Also in light of the authority in <em>Garrett </em>and this Court\u2019s long history of entertaining the distinctive coram nobis writ,<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> we are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>inclined to find any defect in Petitioner\u2019s pleadings because Petitioner relied on our past practice and these pleadings to assert both constitutional and fundamental errors. Instead we must address whether Petitioner\u2019s filing of these two additional writs at this Court was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The Government\u2019s response to the <em>Ring </em>Writ asks this Court to exercise its discretion and dismiss the petition without a decision on its merits, because it was not first filed at the court below.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> The Government is correct that the decision of this Court to entertain these writs is a matter within our discretion. Rules of Practice and Procedure, United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (C.A.A.F. R.) 4(b)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">The Court may, in its discretion, entertain original petitions for extraordinary relief including, but not limited to, writs of mandamus, writs of prohibition, writs of habeas corpus, and writs of error coram nobis. <em>See </em>28 USC \u00a7 1651(a) and Rules 18(b), 27(a) and 28. Absent good cause, no such petition shall be filed unless relief has first been sought in the appropriate Court of Criminal Appeals. Original writs are rarely granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">C.A.A.F. R. 18(b) repeats the first sentence of C.A.A.F. R. 4(b)(1). C.A.A.F. R. 33 permits this Court to suspend any of the other rules for good cause shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">In the present case, we find Petitioner has shown \u201cgood cause\u201d for filing the two original petitions at this Court. The issues raised by Petitioner go to the lawfulness of this Court\u2019s prior judgment, raise important constitutional claims, and relate to this Court\u2019s statutory duty to review a death sentence. Also we have considered the futility of any filing at the lower court, as it would remain bound by the previous decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> Nonetheless we also have found that the writ of coram nobis is an inappropriate procedural vehicle for petitioner to challenge the legality of his death sentence because a writ of habeas corpus is the proper pleading. Because the writ of habeas corpus is available to Petitioner to address his challenges to his death sentence, we proceed to address the final threshold issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">C. Are the latest petitions an abuse of the writ?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">\u201cThe doctrine of abuse of the writ defines the circumstances in which federal courts decline to entertain a claim presented for the first time in a second or subsequent petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> At common law, successive petitions raising the same issues were permitted. Res judicata did not attach to a court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> By judicial decision<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> and statutory enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ment,<footnotemark>154</footnotemark> limits on successive petitions have now been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">This Court is not precluded from considering the present petitions under the abuse of the writ doctrine because the Government has not carried its burden of pleading abuse of the writ.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> In neither of the answers to the two petitions has the Government raised this issue. Therefore, we will not apply it in this case.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">But this conclusion does not terminate our consideration of the application of this doctrine. We also must consider whether our present consideration of these petitions may result in a later application of the abuse of the writ doctrine by an Article III court.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), codified at 28 U.S.C. 2244(b) (2000), is a \u201cmodified res judicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas corpus practice \u2018abuse of the writ.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> AEDPA provides that \u201c[a] claim in a second or successive habeas corpus application under Section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.\u201d<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> It also provides that \u201c[a] claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed\u201d except in two circumstances.<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 applies to a \u201cperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\u201d the same general principles apply to applicants under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 who are federal prisoners.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">But it is uncertain whether the same general principles relating to abuse of the writ apply to applications under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 to this Article I court. We note that there is authority that establishes that the \u201cthe gatekeeping provisions of AEDPA, as set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, do not apply to all habeas petitions, nor are all multiple collateral attacks second or successive.\u201d<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> The ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>plication of these legal principles of abuse of the writ to military justice capital jurisprudence is an issue of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Absent controlling legal authority on this issue, it is not clear whether our entertaining a petition for a writ of habeas corpus would trigger the AEDPA \u201csecond or successive writ\u201d language and thereby preclude an Article III court collateral review under the doctrine of abuse of the writ. Petitioner had no clear notice by controlling legal authority that the principles of abuse of the writ applied to his earlier filing of any writ petition at this Court or that his filing a writ petition at this Court could be considered the predicate for the Government later asserting abuse of the writ if Petitioner eventually seeks habeas review in an Article III court. In light of this uncertainty, we are reluctant presently to entertain the present petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">This Court has the option to treat Petitioner\u2019s erroneously filed coram nobis petitions simply as petitions for habeas corpus. This would afford us the opportunity to consider the essence of his complaints of error without controlling reference to the label or title of his pleadings. But we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">First, we find the rationale of the Tenth Circuit persuasive because it concluded that it is error to treat an erroneously filed coram nobis petition as a petition for habeas corpus.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> In <em>Carpenter, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">[T]his Court, like many of our sister circuits, has held that a district court may only recharacterize a prisoner\u2019s non \u00a7 2255 motion as a \u00a7 2255 petition if (1) the prisoner, \u201cwith knowledge of the potential adverse consequences of such re-characterization, agrees to have the motion so recharacterized,\u201d or (2) the district court, having concluded that [a habeas petition] is the appropriate mechanism for asserting the claim, gives the prisoner \u201cthe opportunity to withdraw the motion rather than have it so recharacterized.\u201d<footnotemark>163</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">In the capital case presently before our Court, we will follow the prudent approach presented in <em>Carpenter. </em>Presently there is no evidence in the record indicating that Petitioner was informed of the potential adverse consequences associated with recharacterizing his coram nobis petitions as habeas petitions nor has this Court previously offered Petitioner an opportunity to withdraw his petitions and present them as petitions for a writ of habeas corpus. Our present decision and opinion serves both these purposes by simply following the guidance presented in <em>Carpenter </em>of denying the petition and advising Petitioner that he may file a habeas petition.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">Second, our reluctance to recharacterize Petitioner\u2019s pleadings acknowledges and respects Petitioner\u2019s right to address with his counsel the option to file a habeas corpus petition at this Court and its potential consequences. In this regard we consider this wise and prudent advice relevant to that discussion: \u201cThe careful and effective litigator, on either side of postconviction litigation, measures the success of any maneuver at least in part by it tendency to hold open, rather than to close, the door to further arguments at later stages of the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>165</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>We are mindful that a habeas petition filed before this Court could affect Petitioner\u2019s right and strategy to raise both the issues currently presented and later identified issues that either were not or could not have been included in an earlier application.<footnotemark>166</footnotemark> Our declining to recharacterize Petitioner\u2019s coram nobis petitions as a habeas petition thereby avoids any of these problematic concerns that could have an effect upon a habeas petition if eventually filed in an Article III court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Accordingly, this Court dismisses both petitions for a writ coram nobis without prejudice for Petitioner to refile a writ of habeas corpus with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">CRAWFORD, Judge (concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">I agree that the writ of eoram nobis should be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">.

Moreover, assuming that the provisions of Article 71(c) relating to \"a final judgment as to the legality of the proceedings\u201d operates to render this death sentence \"final,\" we also conclude that this Court retains subject matter jurisdiction over this capital case. Simply stated, whether this case is \u201cfinal\u201d under Article 71(c) or not, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction under Article 67(a)(1), over this capital case. On this point, we state that there is nothing in the legislative history of Article 71(c) that indicates the congressional purpose to terminate this Court's jurisdiction over a capital case. Also it is important to note that Congress made no changes to Article 76 when it amended Article 71(c).

The Supreme Court held that a state prisoner sentenced as a second offender because of a prior federal conviction could challenge his earlier conviction in the federal case through a writ of coram nobis. At the outset, the Court defined the issue before it as \"whether a United States District Court has power to vacate its judgment of conviction and sentence after the expiration of the full term of service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503, 74 S.Ct. 247. The Court concluded that federal courts have the power under the All Writs Act to issue writs of coram nobis in criminal cases and that the power extends to district courts. Having found the writ to be within the district court's powers, the Supreme Court set out to limit the situations in which the writ should be granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"120\">\n<p id=\"b372-22\">. <em>Id. </em>at 511, 74 S.Ct. 247.

Otherwise a wrong may stand uncorrected which the available remedy would right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAq\"><em>Id. </em>at 512, 74 S.Ct. 247. Giving some additional context to its holding, the Court added the following short paragraph to the end of the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeA\">Although the term has been served, the results of the conviction may persist. Subsequent convictions may carry heavier penalties, civil rights may be affected. As the power to remedy an invalid sentence exists, we think, respondent is entitled to an opportunity to attempt to show that this conviction was invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8u\"><em>Id. </em>at 512-13, 74 S.Ct. 247. With this paragraph and the previous discussion of the writ coram nobis, we believe the Court is defining the more specific parameters that may permit the filing of a petition for coram nobis relief. The Court\u2019s opinion can reasonably be read to say that coram nobis is safely available only: (1) after the term has been served, (2) there is an error of the most fundamental character, (3) the consequences or results of the erroneous conviction persist, (4) no other remedy is available to address the error, and (5) a writ of coram nobis could remedy those consequences or results. We note that <em>Morgan </em>addressed the availability of a writ of error co-ram nobis to vacate a conviction after the sentence had been served.
