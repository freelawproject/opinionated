The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for four months, forfeiture of two-thirds pay for four months, and reduction to Private El.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">This case is before us for review under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866. The parties agree that the military judge failed to express the forfeitures in a whole dollar amount and that the convening authority improperly approved the erroneous punishment. Although not noted by appellant, our review of the record also reveals an unresolved inconsistency in the plea inquiry as it relates to the insubordination offense. These errors warrant relief for appellant. We will correct the errors and reassess the sentence in our decretal paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-22\">Forfeitures</p>\n<p id=\"b618-23\">\u201c[A] sentence to forfeiture shall state the exact amount in whole dollars to be forfeited each month and the number of months the forfeiture will last.\u201d Rule for Courts-Martial [hereinafter R.C.M.] 1003(b)(2); <em>see United States v. Garman, </em>59 M.J. 677, 683 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2003). In this case, the sentence omits \u201cthe exact amount in whole dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>lars to be forfeited\u201d and the words \u201cper month\u201d after the forfeiture amount. The staff judge advocate repeated these errors in his post-trial recommendation to the convening authority. Omitting the words \u201cper month\u201d when announcing the sentence is a \u201clegal sentence of forfeiture of the sum stated for one month only.\u201d <em>United States v. Guerrero, </em>25 M.J. 829, 831 (A.C.M.R.1988) (citations omitted), <em>aff'd and modified on other grounds; </em>28 M.J. 223 (C.M.A.1989); <em>see United States v. Gebhart, </em>32 M.J. 634, 635 (A.C.M.R.1991). We will correct the sentence in our decretal paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Plea Inquiry</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Appellant pleaded guilty, <em>inter alia, </em>to insubordinate conduct toward Sergeant (SGT) Evaristo Garza. Specifically, appellant admitted to willfully refusing \u201cto remove his headgear while being inspected\u201d in response to SGT Garza\u2019s order to do so. Appellant also stipulated that he knew SGT Garza was a noncommissioned officer and that the order in question was lawful. However, during the plea inquiry, appellant related the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">It started, roughly around 0600 when Sergeant Garza came up to my room. I was told to get a haircut the night before and I had arranged with someone in the barracks to cut my hair and the person that was supposed to cut it was not answering his door all night or wasn\u2019t there. So, the next morning when I woke up, I borrowed a set of clippers, hair clippers from someone in the barracks and was starting to remove the hair from my head ... shave it, and the clippers that I borrowed were not functioning properly and Sergeant Garza came upstairs, seen that I was having difficulty with the clippers. My hair was just patches missing from the clippers. He didn\u2019t let me try to remain upstairs to try and finish correcting it. He had me go downstairs immediately. We had formation. And, then the formation was handed down to the section and he tried to put me in front of the section and have me remove my headgear knowing that my hair was messed up like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">When the military judge asked appellant why SGT Garza wanted appellant to remove his headgear, appellant responded, \u201cI believe he wanted to humiliate me, sir, knowing that it was already messed up with patches missing, patches of hair missing, sir.\u201d The military judge then explained to appellant what constitutes a lawful order and told appellant that if the purpose of SGT Garza\u2019s order was to humiliate appellant the order was not lawful. He asked appellant to explain how SGT Garza\u2019s order was lawful. Because appellant could not answer the military judge\u2019s inquiry satisfactorily, the military judge asked government counsel to explain the lawfulness of SGT Garza\u2019s order. Trial counsel requested a brief recess to allow the government time to speak to SGT Garza about the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">After the recess, the military judge again elicited the facts surrounding appellant\u2019s purportedly insubordinate conduct. Appellant told the military judge that SGT Garza asked him to take a position in front of the section formation and then asked him twice to remove his headgear. Appellant said that on both occasions he told SGT Garza \u201cno\u201d and stated that SGT Garza had already seen his haircut when they were upstairs in his barracks room. Sergeant Garza did not explain to appellant why it was necessary to have appellant remove his headgear in front of the formation, nor did SGT Garza inspect any other soldiers during the formation. The military judge proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">MJ: Did [SGT Garza] carefully look at your haircut when he went to your room prior to this formation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">ACC: No, sir. He did see that it was\u2014 patches were missing though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">MJ: Why do you say he did see that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-14\">ACC: It was fairly obvious to tell, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-15\">MJ: Well, did he make any comments, like what happened to your hair, Rokey or are you just making the assumption he saw that your haircut had not turned out the way you had hoped?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-16\">ACC: I believe he did make a comment towards it, sir, what he said I don\u2019t remember though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-17\">MJ: Well, he didn\u2019t carefully inspect your haircut in your room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-18\">ACC: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>MJ: And, what I heard you say, Private Rokey is Sergeant Garza didn\u2019t make any statements that would indicate to you why he was calling you up to the front of the formation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">ACC: Correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">MJ: And, as far as you know, he was doing that to inspect your haircut to ensure you complied with his order the previous night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">ACC: Correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">MJ: You just don\u2019t know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">ACC: Correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">s|; $ ij: jJ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">MJ: Would you agree that his order to you to remove your headgear was a lawful order as I defined that term for you? ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">\u201cUnlike the civilian criminal justice system, Article 45(a) requires that, in a guilty-plea case, inconsistencies and apparent defenses must be resolved by the military judge or the guilty pleas must be rejected.\u201d <em>United States v. Outhier, </em>45 M.J. 326, 331 (C.A.A.F.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Jemmings, </em>1 M.J. 414, 418 (C.M.A.1976); <em>United States v. Dunbar, </em>20 U.S.C.M.A. 478, 43 C.M.R. 318, 1971 WL 12785 (1971)). \u201cMere conclusions of law recited by an accused are insufficient to provide a factual basis for a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Outhier, </em>45 M.J. at 331 (citing <em>United States v. Terry, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 442, 45 C.M.R. 216, 1972 WL 14158 (1972)). If the military judge fails to resolve such inconsistencies or apparent defenses, we may set aside the affected findings on appeal if \u201cthere is a substantial basis in law and fact for questioning the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>60 M.J. 145, 152 (C.A.A.F.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Appellant initially asserted during the plea inquiry that SGT Garza ordered him to remove his headgear to humiliate him in front of the section formation. An order that is not reasonably necessary \u201cto accomplish a military mission, or safeguard or promote the morale, discipline, and usefulness of members of a command\u201d is unlawful, and disobedience of such an order is not punishable under Article 91, UCMJ. <em>See Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) [hereinafter <em>MCM], </em>Part IV, para. 14e(2) (discussing lawfulness of orders); <em>cf. </em>UCMJ art. 93, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 893 (prohibiting abuse of authority). As such, an order given for the sole purpose of humiliating appellant would be unlawful under the circumstances, and appellant\u2019s assertion would be inconsistent with his guilty plea. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 45(a), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845. The military judge recognized the issue and attempted to resolve this inconsistency at trial by eliciting appellant\u2019s agreement to a series of leading questions concerning SGT Garza\u2019s opportunity to observe appellant\u2019s haircut while SGT Garza was in appellant\u2019s barracks room. Appellant agreed that SGT Garza did not carefully inspect his haircut before the formation and that the public inspection was therefore lawful. The military judge apparently concluded that this agreement was sufficient to establish the necessity of SGT Garza\u2019s attempt to inspect appellant\u2019s haircut in front of the formation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">As a general matter, the \u201cresolution\u201d of a matter inconsistent with a guilty plea involves more than simply eliciting additional inculpatory statements from an accused. \u201cResolution\u201d is \u201cthe act or process of reducing to a simpler form,\u201d i.e., one without conflict or inconsistency. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged, 1933 (1971 ed.). To resolve a matter inconsistent with a guilty plea, the military judge must, therefore, identify the particular inconsistency at issue and explain its legal significance to the accused, who must then either retract, disclaim, or explain the inconsistent matter. <em>Cf. </em>R.C.M. 910(e) discussion (recommending a similar process when a potential defense is raised during guilty-plea proceeding). The military judge need not \u201cdrag appellant across the providence finish line,\u201d <em>see United States v. Le, </em>59 M.J. 859, 864 (Army Ct.Crim.App. 2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Pecard, </em>ARMY 9701940, slip op. at 8 (Army Ct.Crim.App. 7 Dec. 2000) (unpub.)), and the guilty plea must be rejected unless the inconsistent matter is resolved. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 45(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">Under the facts of this case, the military judge did not have appellant revisit the inconsistent matter (i.e., \u201cI believe he wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>to humiliate me, sir, knowing that it was already messed up with patches missing, patches of hair missing, sir.\u201d). Instead, the military judge used leading questions as if on cross-examination in an effort to elicit appellant\u2019s agreement that SGT Garza did not look \u201ccarefully\u201d at appellant\u2019s haircut in the barracks room. In a contested trial, such an admission would tend to establish the necessity of SGT Garza\u2019s public haircut inspection. In a guilty-plea setting, such an indirect approach may leave the inconsistent matter that prompted the questioning on the record and unresolved.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We conclude that the military judge failed to resolve the inconsistency raised by appellant concerning the lawfulness of SGT Garza\u2019s order, and, as such, there is a substantial basis in law and fact for questioning appellant\u2019s guilty plea to insubordinate conduct. We will take appropriate action in the decretal paragraph below.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The remaining issues raised by appellant are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The findings of guilty of Specification 2 of Charge III and Charge III are set aside. The remaining findings of guilty are affirmed. Reassessing the sentence on the basis of the errors noted, the entire record, and the principles in <em>United States v. Sales, </em>22 M.J. 305 (C.M.A.1986), we affirm only so much of the sentence as provides for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 105 days, forfeiture of $737.00 pay per month for one month, and reduction to Private E1. All rights, privileges, and property of which appellant has been deprived by virtue of that portion of his sentence set aside by this decision are ordered restored as mandated by Article 75(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Judge MAHER and Judge HOLDEN concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\"> There may have been a valid military purpose for SGT Garza's order. Even with the potential consequence of some personal humiliation for appellant, a valid military purpose for the order might justify its legal enforceability. <em>See MCM, </em>Part IV, para. 14c(2)(iii). In such cases, defense counsel must recognize the possibility of inconsistency before trial and explore with the accused whether there is a lawful basis for the order. Defense counsel must also determine whether the accused can articulate an adequate factual predicate for a guilty plea. The prosecutor, if invited by the trial judge, may certainly suggest the theory of legal culpability upon which the offense was referred. But it is ultimately the accused who must admit to the military judge the necessary factual predicate for guilt. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 910(e) discussion (\u201c[Tlhe accused must be convinced of, and able to describe all the facts necessary to establish guilt.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
