Reeves was convicted of violating certain provisions of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> charged as a \u201ccrime or offense not capital\u201d under the third clause of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (2000). This is the same statute we addressed in <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>58 M.J. 450 (C.A.A.F.2003), and more recently <em>United States v. Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. 52 (C.A.A.F.2005). As in <em>Martinelli, </em>the conduct underlying Reeves\u2019 convictions occurred in Germany. We granted review of this ease to examine the extraterritorial application of the CPPA and the effect of that issue on the underlying charges in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\">In <em>Martinelli </em>we considered whether the CPPA had extraterritorial application and concluded that it did not. Consistent with <em>Martinelli, </em>we hold that the three sections of the CPPA under which Reeves was charged do not extend to his conduct in Germany. We further hold that none of Reeves\u2019 conduct in Germany continued into the United States. Thus, none of Reeves\u2019 conduct falls within the domestic application of the CPPA. We also hold that Reeves\u2019 guilty pleas to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>CPPA-based Article 134, clause 3 specifications cannot be deemed provident as to lesser included offenses under either Article 134, clauses 1 or 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\n<em>PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Reeves entered guilty pleas and was convicted by a general court-martial in April and May of 2001 of violating a lawful general regulation in violation of Article 92, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 892 (2000), and possessing child pornography, receiving child pornography, and using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct in violation of the CPPA as a \u201ccrime or offense not capital\u201d under clause 3 of Article 134, UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Reeves was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for fifty-six months, forfeiture of $250.00 pay per month for twelve months, reduction to pay grade E-l, and a reprimand. Pursuant to a pretrial agreement, the convening authority reduced the confinement to thirty-six months and approved the balance of the sentence. The United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings but deleted a portion of the reprimand<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and affirmed the remaining sentence. We granted review to determine whether Reeves\u2019 conviction of possessing, receiving, and producing child pornography, charged under clause 3 of Article 134, could be upheld in light of <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 </em>U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We specified five additional issues addressing whether the CPPA had extraterritorial application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">A. <em>Specifications 1 and 2: Receiving and Possessing Child Pornography</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">Sergeant Reeves was assigned to the 502d Engineer Company of the 565th Engineer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Batt\u00e1lion located at Pioneer Kaserne, a United States Army installation, in Hanau, Germany. He resided with his family at New Argonner Kaserne, another U.S. Army installation in Hanau. On a number of occasions from March to December 2000, Reeves went to the public library at Pioneer Kaserne and used the library computers to sign on to the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Once on the Internet, Reeves would enter \u201cteen\u201d chat rooms where he would communicate with individuals who indicated they were twelve to fifteen years old. Reeves received e-mail that contained digital images, including images of minors \u201cin a state of nudity involving a lewd exhibition or graphic focus on a minor\u2019s genitals.\u201d Reeves also belonged to \u201ce-mail distribution groups\u201d from which he automatically received child pornography. Reeves would download and view these images on the library computers and print them out on the library printers. After his conduct was discovered and reported to law enforcement, various printed images containing child pornography were found in Reeves\u2019 vehicle and in his quarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Based upon these facts, Reeves was charged with the following violations of the CPPA under clause 3 of Article 134:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">Specification 1: ... at or near Hanau, Germany, on land used by and under the control of the United States Government, to wit: New Argonner Kaserne, between on or about 01 March 2000 and 05 December 2000, knowingly and wrongfully possessed] about 46 computer printouts containing child pornography in violation of Title 18 U.S.Code \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">Specification 2: ... at or near Hanau, Germany, between on or about 01 March 2000 and 05 December 2000, knowingly and wrongfully receive[d] child pornography that had been transported in interstate commerce or foreign commerce by means of a computer to wit: downloading electronic files containing child pornography from the internet and copying said files onto the hard drive of a computer located at the Pioneer Library in Hanau, Germany in violation of 18 U.S. [Code] \u00a7 2252A(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">B. <em>Specification 3: Producing a visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">The facts underlying this offense occurred in the summer of 2000 when Reeves used a camcorder to videotape \u201ctwo little German girls\u201d near the Main River in Hanau, Germany. (PE 1). From a distance of about 200 feet, Reeves filmed the girls, focusing in on their \u201cgenital areas\u201d, and focusing in particular on one of the girls \u201cin a way to see into the little girl\u2019s shorts\u201d and intending \u201cto satisfy [his] lust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">Based upon these facts, Reeves was charged with the following violation of the CPPA under clause 3 of Article 134:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdZ\">Specification 3: at or near Hanau, Germany, on or about between May 2000 and August 2000, use[d] a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct using material that had been mailed, shipped or transported in interstate commerce or foreign commerce in violation of 18 U.S. [Code] \u00a7 2251(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">This case involves a guilty plea. For this court to reject a guilty plea on appellate review, the record of trial must show a substantial basis in law and fact for questioning the plea. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>57 M.J. 236, 238 (C.A.A.F.2002)(citing <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991)). Whether Congress intended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(a) and 2252A(a)(2) and (a)(5)(A) to have extraterritorial application is a question of statutory interpretation. Interpretation of a statute and its legislative history are questions of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Falk, </em>50 M.J. 385, 390 (C.A.A.F. 1999); <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">B. <em>The Nature of the Charge under Article 131</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">Reeves\u2019 possession, receipt and production of child pornography were charged as violations of Article 134, UCMJ \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201cGeneral Article.\u201d Conduct is punishable under Article 134 if it prejudices \u201cgood order and discipline in the armed forces\u201d (clause 1), if it is \u201cof a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\u201d (clause 2), or if it is \u201ca crime or offense not capital\u201d (clause 3). <em>O\u2019Connor, 58 </em>M.J. at 452; <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 56. As was the case in both <em>O\u2019Connor </em>and <em>Martinelli, </em>Reeves\u2019 offenses under Article 134 were specifically charged as \u201cclause 3\u201d offenses, with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(a) and 2252A(a)(2) and (a)(5)(A) serving as the \u201ccrimes or offenses not capital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">As in <em>Martinelli, </em>the principal issue that we specified for review is whether the CPPA applies to Reeves\u2019 conduct in Germany. If we find that the CPPA is not applicable to Reeves\u2019 conduct in Germany, we must then consider whether, due to the nature of his usage of the Internet, his conduct fell within the domestic application of the CPPA. Finally, if we find that Reeves\u2019 pleas were improvident under clause 3 of Article 134, we must determine whether they would be provident to a lesser included offense under clause 1 or 2 Article 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">C. <em>The Extraterritorial Application of the CPPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">(1) <em>Extraterritorial Application of \u00a7 2252A</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In <em>Martinelli </em>this court determined that \u00a7 2252A did not apply extraterritorially to Martinelli\u2019s conduct in Germany. Under the rationale of <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>260 U.S. 94, 43 S.Ct. 39, 67 L.Ed. 149 (1922) and <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Arabian American Oil Co. </em>(Ar<em>amco), </em>499 U.S. 244, 248, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991), we concluded that the CPPA is subject to a presumption against extraterritoriality and that there was nothing in the language of the statute or the legislative history to overcome this presumption. <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 62-63. As a result there was a substantial basis on which to question the providence of Martinelli\u2019s guilty plea to the CPPA-based clause 3 offenses resulting from conduct occurring in Germany.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">Reeves\u2019 receipt and possession of child pornography \u2014 charged under \u00a7 2252A \u2014 also occurred in Germany and in that respect this ease is indistinguishable from <em>Martinelli. </em>Therefore, consistent with our holding in <em>Martinelli, </em>we find that \u00a7 2252A does not have extraterritorial application and is inapplicable to Reeves\u2019 conduct in Germany.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">(2) <em>Extraterritorial Application of \u00a7 2251(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Unlike Martinelli, Reeves was also charged with producing a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct by a minor in violation of \u00a7 2251(a). We have not previously considered the question of the extraterritorial application of \u00a7 2251(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">As with \u00a7 2252A, we begin with a presumption against extraterritoriality. The Supreme Court has recognized as a longstanding principle of American law \u201cthat legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d <em>Aramco, </em>499 U.S. at 248, 111 S.Ct. 1227 (quoting <em>Foley Bros. v. Filardo, </em>336 U.S. 281, 285, 69 S.Ct. 575, 93 L.Ed. 680 (1949)). As we stated in <em>Martinelli, </em>we must assume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of this presumption. <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 56-57. Moreover, offenses created by the CPPA do not fall within the <em>Bowman </em>exception to the presumption against extraterritoriality. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58 (citing <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>260 U.S. at 97-98, 43 S.Ct. 39, for the proposition that certain \u201ccriminal statutes which are, as a class, ... enacted because of the right of the government to defend itself against obstruction, or fraud wherever perpetrated\u201d are not accorded a presumption of extraterritoriality). We look next \u201cto see whether \u2018language in the [relevant statute] gives any indication of a congressional purpose to extend its coverage beyond places over which the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>has sovereignty or some measure of legislative control.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aramco, </em>499 U.S. at 248, 111 S.Ct. 1227 (quoting <em>Foley Bros., </em>336 U.S. at 285, 69 S.Ct. 575); <em>see also Small v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 385, 125 S.Ct. 1752, 161 L.Ed.2d 651 (2005). To answer this question we look at the text of the statute, its structure and its legislative history. <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M. J. at 58-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">(a) <em>Text and Structure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">As in <em>Martinelli, </em>the statutory section in question includes references to \u201cinterstate and foreign commerce.\u201d This language is \u201cnot, in and of [itself], a \u2018clear expression\u2019 of any congressional intention that the acts proscribed by the statute constitute a federal crime no matter where in the world they occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60. As in <em>Martinelli, </em>we decline to find congressional intent for extraterritorial application based solely on the use of the words \u201cinterstate and foreign commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">In addition, Congress\u2019 intent to limit the reach of \u00a7 2251(a) is made more clear by reference to \u00a7 2260. In 1994, Congress adopted \u00a7 2260, which specifically targets \u201c[a] person who, <em>outside the United States, </em>employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in ... any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct____\u201d Emphasis supplied. In other words, there is another statutory section that addresses all of the same acts when such acts are committed outside of the United States with the intent that the materials be sent into the United States. If Congress intended \u00a7 2251(a) to apply extraterritorially, there would have been no need for \u00a7 2260 because such behavior would already have been criminalized regardless of whether the accused intended to import the visual depictions into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">(b) <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">Having concluded that the text and structure of \u00a7 2251(a) do not express any clear intent by Congress that the statute apply extraterritorially, we turn to its legislative history. We conclude that it too gives no indication that Congress intended \u00a7 2251(a) to apply extraterritorially. The clear focus of that legislative history is on the patent evils of child pornography and the concern that \u201cchild pornography and child prostitution have become highly organized multimillion dollar industries that operate on a nationwide scale.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-438, at 5 (1977). Although the history of \u00a7 2251(a) contains extensive discussion of the nationwide problem of child pornography, it does not discuss issues of extraterritoriality, much less include any clear expression of congressional intent in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">D. <em>The Domestic Application of the CPPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">In <em>Martinelli, </em>we also considered whether any of Martinellfis conduct could be characterized as domestic conduct as he had stipulated that all of the e-mails that he sent or received were routed through servers in the United States. 62 M.J. at 62-63. We concluded in that case that the act of \u201csending\u201d e-mails containing child pornography was a \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d because Martinelli's conduct continued as the e-mail traveled through the Internet to its destination. <em>Id. </em>at 63-64. Because the e-mails in <em>Martinelli </em>traveled through the United States en route to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>destination, we found that the sending offense occurred in both Germany and the United States and therefore the CPPA applied domestically to that specification. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">We went on to conclude that other specifications, which charged Martinelli with \u201creceiving child pornography\u201d and \u201creproducing child pornography for distribution\u201d, were not \u201ccontinuing offenses\u201d as they did not involve any conduct that started in Germany and continued into the United States. Therefore, there was no domestic application of the CPPA available for those offenses. Here, as in <em>Martinelli, </em>each specification alleges different conduct and each must be examined individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Specification 1 (possession): </em>This specification charged Reeves with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(A) by possessing child pornography on land used by and under the control of the United States Government. This specification is a \u201csitus\u201d based possession charge and does not allege movement of child pornography through the Internet. The principle of \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d is therefore inapplicable to this specification and there is no basis for finding a domestic application of the CPPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\"><em>Specification 2 (receiving): </em>This specification charged Reeves with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) by receiving child pornography that had been transported through the Internet. Reeves admitted during his providence inquiry that the images were \u201csent from the U.S. through the Internet to me.\u201d Had Reeves been charged with \u201csending\u201d e-mails containing child pornography through the Internet, the principle of a \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d may have established domestic U.S. application of the CPPA. However, Reeves was charged with \u201creceiving\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> e-mails containing child pornography. Here, Reeves did not knowingly receive the images until he accessed the pictures in Germany and the act of opening the images did not trigger a chain of events that continued into the United States. His conduct therefore can not be subject to a domestic U.S. application of the CPPA. <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 64.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\"><em>Specification 3 (production): </em>This specification charged Reeves with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) by using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct. Although Reeves admitted that the camcorder he used to videotape the German girls had been manufactured in Japan, purchased in the United States and transported by him to Germany, in videotaping the girls he did not begin any conduct that continued into the United States. His conduct occurred entirely in Germany and there can be no domestic application of the CPPA. <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 63-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">In summary, none of acts identified in the specifications in Charge II constitute a \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d and therefore there can be no domestic application of the CPPA in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">E. <em>The Possibility of Lesser Included Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">The conclusion that Reeves\u2019 guilty pleas are not provident under clause 3 of Article 134 does not end our inquiry. We have recognized in the past that an improvident plea to a CPPA-based clause 3 offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>may, under certain circumstances, be upheld as a provident plea to a lesser included offense under clause 2 of Article 134. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Augustine, </em>53 M.J. 95 (C.A.A.F.2000); <em>United States v. Sapp, </em>53 M.J. 90, 92 (C.A.A.F.2000); <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>58 M.J. at 454-55; <em>United States v. Mason, </em>60 M.J. 15, 20 (C.A.A.F.2004); <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 66. The question is whether those circumstances are present in Reeves\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><em>Augustine </em>and <em>Sapp </em>were two <em>pre-Free Speech </em>Coalition<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> cases where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">the guilty pleas ... were entered to a violation of Article 134, clause 3, based on possession of child pornography in violation of the CPPA. As in this case, the guilty pleas were found to be improvident as to the clause 3 offense in light of certain requirements under the CPPA that were not established in the record. In those cases, however, we concluded that the guilty pleas were provident as to the lesser-included offense of engaging in \u201cconduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\u201d under clause 2 and upheld the convictions under Article 134. <em>Augustine, </em>53 M.J. at 96; <em>Sapp, </em>53 M.J. at 92.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\"><em>O\u2019Connor, </em>58 M.J. at 454. <em>Sapp </em>and <em>Augustine </em>dealt with the possibility of a lesser included offense under clause 2 of Article 134 where a guilty plea to a CPPA-based clause 3 Article 134 charge was found improvident. In those cases, where no constitutional considerations were involved, we found the pleas provident to a violation of clause 2 of Article 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">After the <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>decision, we explained in <em>O\u2019Connor, Mason </em>and <em>Martinelli </em>that where the constitutional rights of a servieemember could come into play, we will apply closer scrutiny to the providence inquiry before upholding a plea as provident to a lesser included offense under clause 1 or 2 of Article 134. <em>See O\u2019Connor, </em>58 M.J. at 454-55; Mason, 60 M.J. at 19; <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 66-67. The difference between our review of a providence inquiry under the <em>O\u2019Connor/Mason/Martinelli </em>standard and our review under the less strict <em>Augustine! Sapp </em>standard is a qualitative difference. \u201cAlthough the understanding required of the servieemember remains the same, we require a clearer more precise articulation of the servicemember\u2019s understanding under <em>O\u2019Connor </em>than we require in eases where the accused\u2019s First Amendment rights are not implicated.\u201d <em>Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">During Reeves\u2019 providence inquiry the military judge defined the term \u201cchild pornography\u201d for purposes of Specifications 1 and 2 without utilizing the language determined to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in <em>Free Speech </em>Coalition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specification 3 charged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) which does not contain the term \u201cchild pornography\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With no constitutional dimension at play in the providence inquiry, our analysis into the possibility of a lesser included offense is governed by the principles embodied in <em>Augustine </em>and <em>Sapp </em>rather than <em>O\u2019Connor, Mason, </em>or <em>Martinelli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">Nevertheless, the providence inquiry must reflect that the accused \u201cclearly understood the nature of the prohibited conduct.\u201d <em>Sapp, </em>53 M.J. at 92. In both <em>Augustine </em>and <em>Sapp </em>the accused admitted the service discrediting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>character of his conduct during the plea inquiry and we characterized those discussions as demonstrating that the accused \u201cclearly understood the nature of the prohibited conduct.\u201d <em>Augustine, </em>53 M.J. at 96; <em>Sapp, </em>53 M.J. at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In this case, however, there is an absence of any inquiry or discussion of service discrediting conduct or conduct that is prejudicial to good order and discipline. The military judge did not list service discrediting conduct or conduct that is prejudicial to good order and discipline as an element of any of the child pornography offenses. The plea inquiry focused entirely on the elements of the clause 3 offenses. Thus, the providence inquiry simply does not provide a sufficient basis for determining that Reeves\u2019 pleas are provident to the lesser included offenses of conduct that is service discrediting or prejudicial to good order and discipline under clause 1 or 2 of Article 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals as to Charge II and its specifications and the sentence is reversed, but is affirmed in all other respects.

Our discussion of Congress\u2019 intent is also informed by an analysis of the \"Territory or Possession of the United States\" language in \u00a7 2251. Although this phrase refers to physical locations outside of the fifty United States, it is not a broad or all encompassing phrase. The \"territories\u201d of the United States are generally defined as including Guam, the United States Virgin Islands and American Samoa, as well as the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. <em>See </em>Daniel H. MacMeekin, <em>The Overseas Territories and Commonwealths of the United States of America </em>(2000), available at <em>http://www.macmeeldn.com/Library/terr+ commonw2.htm. </em>The United States also asserts sovereignty over, and administers, a number of small islands which do not have permanent populations. These islands are often referred to as \"possessions\u201d. These include Howland, Baker, and Jarvis Islands; Kingman Reef; and Johnson, Palmyra, Wake, and Midway Atolls, all in the Pacific; and Navassa Island in the Caribbean. <em>Id. </em>Congress\u2019 decision to use the phrase \"Territories and Possessions of the United States\u201d suggests that Congress wished to limit the statute's application rather than to broaden it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">.

Therefore, I concur in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">But with respect to the three Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) offenses all in Charge II, I disagree with the majority as to either its reasoning (Charge II, specifications 1 and 2) or to both its reasoning and result (Charge II, specification 3). So I also respectfully dissent in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">The result that I reach is not so different from the majority, but the judicial path to resolve this case is both different and important. As we agree to the disposition as to Charge I, I focus only on the three specifications under Charge II.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">In <em>United States v. </em>Martinelli,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>I concluded that the CPPA has extraterritorial application. I disagree with the conclusion that the Congress that enacted the CPPA did not intend it to apply extraterritorially to reach the actions of a servieemember when he possesses, receives, and produces child pornography<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> merely because he is outside the territorial boundaries of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-17\">Also as I stated in <em>Martinelli, </em>I do not read the language in Bowman<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as narrowly as does the majority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I believe that to do so, the majority incorrectly interprets the underlying rationale of the exception to the presumption against extraterritoriality and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>also misevaluates the nature and impact of the offenses in this case. Given the limitless boundaries of cyberspace, child pornography over the Internet is just the type of offense to which the exception to the presumption against extraterritoriality should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">And, as I fully discussed in Martinelli,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> interpreting the plain language of the statute, its legislative history, and the comprehensiveness of the scheme of the entire statute, I believe Congress clearly meant the CPPA to reach the acts of a United States servicemember who possesses and receives child pornography on a U.S. military base in Germany. For the same reasons, I believe Congress intended the statute to reach Appellant\u2019s offense of involving young German girls in the production of child pornography that occurred off-base in Germany.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Additionally, \u00a7 2260 clearly pertains to the production of child pornography with the intent to import that pornography into the United States. Under that statute, the Government is required to prove the additional element of intent to import the child pornography into the United States in order to prosecute an accused. Thus, I am not persuaded by the majority\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2260 eliminates the need to decide if \u00a7 2251(a) applies extraterritorially to cover Appellant\u2019s act of producing a visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, I believe that \u00a7 2251(a) reaches Appellant\u2019s CPPA-based offenses in this case precisely because it does have extraterritorial application.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">As I conclude that the three CPPA-based specifications under which Appellant was charged extend to Appellant\u2019s criminal conduct in Germany, I respectfully dissent in part. Having established this point, Appellant\u2019s guilty plea to all three CPPA-based offenses under Charge II initially appears provident. But, unlike the majority, I view Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas to the possessing and receiving pornography (Charge II, specifications 1 and 2) to be improvident in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition.'</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This conclusion results in my agreeing with the majority\u2019s decision to remand the specifications, but for the different reason I have stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">As to specification 3 of Charge II, I disagree with the majority that Appellant\u2019s guilty plea is provident only to the lesser included offense. I view Appellant\u2019s plea to the charged offense provident because the constitutionally-objectionable \u201cchild pornography\u201d language is not included in that specification. Therefore, I would affirm Appellant\u2019s guilty plea to this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">In summary, I concur with the disposition of Charge I and the majority\u2019s result in addressing Charge II, specifications 1 and 2.

Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. 52, 77-87 (C.AA.F.2005) (Crawford, J., dissenting), I respectfully dissent and offer a few additional comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">Like Specialist Martinelli, Appellant was stationed at a United States military installation in Germany, subscribed to a web-based e-mail account, and used a public computer to commit violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A, as well as Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 892 (2000). Unlike Martinelli, who used an off-post Internet caf\u00e9, Appellant used U.S. Government-owned computers in the post library to effect receipt of, as well as to view and print, pornographic images of actual children. In addition, Appellant, while among the German civilian populace near Hanau, used actual German children to produce a sexually explicit videotape in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">DOMESTIC ASPECT OF APPELLANT\u2019S CRIMES</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">Prosecution Exhibit 1, Appellant\u2019s stipulation of fact (including the documents com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>prising TAB B) and his responses during the <em>Care </em>inquiry,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> establish that Appellant had a web-based e-mail account at Exeite.com which afforded him electronic \u201cspace\u201d on Excite.com\u2019s servers in the United States. Using a web browser on the library\u2019s computers, Appellant gained access to his e-mail account which he then used as an address at which to receive pornographic images, view them, store them, and download them to the hard drives of the library computers for printing. He admitted that these images had been \u201ctransported in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d because \u201cthey were sent from the U.S. through the Internet to me.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s receipt of child pornography occurred in the United States, just as it did on a U.S. military post in Germany.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">APPLICATION OF \u00a7 2252A TO OVERSEAS MILITARY INSTALLATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">After printing images of child pornography, using the library\u2019s printers, Appellant stored numerous images of child pornography at his family quarters, in his automobile, and his quarters storage area, all on a U.S. Army Kaserne near Hanau, Germany. All of the theories I voiced in <em>Martinelli </em>pertain <em>a fortiori </em>to Appellant\u2019s possession of child pornography on a U.S. military installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">APPLICATION OF \u00a7 2251(a) TO OVERSEAS CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">While the jurisdictional theories I advanced in <em>Martinelli </em>also apply to Appellant\u2019s prosecution under this statute, I must reject the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish the jurisdictional language in this statute from that in \u00a7 2260. The majority contends that territorial application of \u00a7 2251(a) was not intended by Congress because \u00a7 2260, with express extraterritorial application \u201caddresses all of the same acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>62 M.J. 88, 93 (C.A.A.F.2005). Not quite. First, \u00a7 2260 carries with it no requirement that any of the criminal acts be connected to interstate or foreign commerce, giving \u00a7 2260 far greater breadth. Second, it is clear to my reading that \u00a7 2260 was enacted not only to expand the scope of existing prohibitions, but to serve as an emphatic statement of congressional intent to exercise jurisdiction over non-U.S. citizens who may produce child pornography in their own countries for importation into the territory or waters of the United States. Even if there is overlap between these statutes, I believe they have related but different purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">Appellant has waived this issue, both as to \u00a7 2252A and \u00a7 2251(a). <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>147 F.3d 529, 533 (7th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the stipulation of fact, Appellant stipulated that \u201cthere are no impediments to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">JURISDICTION UNDER \u00a7 2252A BASED ON COMMERCE</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">Appellant also stipulated that these images were sent from or through a site in the United States and that he knowingly received and transported the pictures \u201cin interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d When questioned by the military judge, he said the images \u201cwere sent from the United States through the Internet to me.\u201d When the military judge asked Appellant whether he was satisfied that this amounted to interstate or foreign commerce, he agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">PROVIDENCE TO CLAUSES (1) AND (2) OFFENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b218-17\">Appellant, a sergeant with a high school diploma, over five years of active duty, and then serving at his fourth permanent duty station, pleaded guilty to violating a lawful general regulation by viewing child pornography. He admitted to understanding that the regulation prohibiting viewing of child pornography was lawful because it was \u201creason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ably necessary to safeguard and protect the morale, discipline, and usefulness of the members of the command and is directly connected to the maintenance of good order and discipline.\u201d He admitted that his conduct in viewing child pornography was wrongful and that he had no legal justification or excuse. He stipulated to leaving images of child pornography on the printer at the installation library where soldiers, civilians, and dependents could find it, and to taking his very young daughter with him to the library where he would view and print images of child pornography. He stipulated to standing on one side of the Main River and, for between twenty and thirty minutes, training his video camera on the genital area of two young German girls, while accompanied by his own young daughter. All of these images and films he secreted in his vehicle, quarters, and quarters storage area.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Even if these were the only facts we had to go on, I would find it impossible to conclude that Sergeant Reeves did not understand \u201cthe nature of the prohibited conduct.\u201d Said another way, how could Sergeant Reeves admit that the Commander of U.S. Army, Europe, could lawfully prohibit the viewing of child pornography so as to \u201cpromote the morale, discipline, and usefulness of the members of the command\u201d and that such prohibition was \u201cdirectly connected to the maintenance of good order and discipline\u201d <em>without </em>knowing that using the post library\u2019s computers and printers to receive, download, and print child pornography in front of his two and one-half-year-old daughter and leaving child pornography on the printer for all to see was prejudicial to good order and discipline? He could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">And it is only the smallest of steps to conclude that, on this record, Appellant also knew that openly focusing his video camera, for twenty to thirty minutes on the pubic area of seven-year-old German national children as they played by a public river, was equally prejudicial and service discrediting as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">This record overwhelmingly supports affirmation of a lesser included offense under either or both clauses (1) and (2) of Article 134, UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">There is no substantial basis in law or fact to question the providence of Appellant\u2019s pleas. Even if the record were insufficient to uphold Appellant\u2019s pleas to violations of \u00a7\u00a7 2252A and 2251(a), however, the record strongly supports conviction for disorders on the same facts. For all these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">. <em>United. States v.
