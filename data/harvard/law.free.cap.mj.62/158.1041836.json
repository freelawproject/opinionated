BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">While investigating suspected child pornography offenses, an agent of the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division (CID) searched the e-mail accounts of a soldier stationed in Korea. In the course of the search, one of the accounts received an online message from a person identified as \u201cP[ ]13.\u201d The agent entered into an online conversation with \u201cP[ ]13.\u201d During the online conversation, \u201cP[ ]13\u201d expressed an interest in sexually explicit pictures of girls between the ages of four and eight. As the search of the initial suspect\u2019s e-mail accounts continued, \u201cP[]13\u201d sent two more e-mails with attachments containing sexually explicit photographs of children and adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Based on information in the e-mails, CID identified Appellant, who was stationed in Germany, as \u201cP[]13.\u201d CID then searched Appellant\u2019s e-mail accounts and U.S. Government-owned computers in the library on Vilseck Air Base in Germany. CID also collected discs located in Appellant\u2019s household goods. The information obtained from these searches provided the primary evidence for the charges at issue in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">II. SOLICITATION TO COMMIT CARNAL KNOWLEDGE (ISSUES I AND II)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Appellant was prosecuted under Article 134, UCMJ, for soliciting JD to rape a nine-year-old child. The offense has three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">(1) That the accused solicited or advised a certain person or persons to commit a certain offense under the code other than one of the four offenses named in Article 82;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">(2) That the accused did so with the intent that the offense actually be committed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-14\">(3) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-15\"><em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) <em>(MCM), </em>pt. IV, U 105.b.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-16\">At trial, the prosecution introduced e-mails that were sent and received by Appellant discussing the exchange of child pornography and pictures. Some of the e-mails included pictures of children and adults exposed and engaged in sexually explicit behavior. The charge of solicitation to commit rape was based primarily on an e-mail message in which Appellant wrote the following to JD, a person apparently known to Appellant only over the internet:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-17\">I was hoping that you would send me some more good pix before I left____ I hope that everything is working out with your 9 yo. Have you f***** her yet? If so, [d]o you have pix? ... Man you are not going to believe it when I adopt that little girl and send you pix of me and her as I promised. I am going to do everything to her that you can imagine. And you will be the first to see, I promise you that much. I hope that you can find it in your heart to send me more pix as you have in the past week or so. If you send me more pix, I will be eternally grateful, and reward you greatly. Please send me more!!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">The court below concluded that this statement did not establish Appellant\u2019s intent that JD commit rape by force, but that it was factually sufficient to prove the lesser included offense of soliciting JD to commit the offense of carnal knowledge. In Issues I and II, Appellant raises four challenges to the solicitation conviction, as modified by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>court below: (1) whether the court employed an improper definition of solicitation; (2) whether the evidence was legally sufficient; (3) whether uncharged misconduct was improperly admitted into evidence; and (4) whether the testimony of a Government expert witness was improperly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">A. LEGAL DEFINITION OF SOLICITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">After discussing the elements of solicitation, the court below stated: \u201cSolicitation includes \u2018any use of words or other device by which a person is requested, urged, advised, counseled, tempted, commanded or otherwise enticed or incited to commit a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hays, </em>slip. op. at 11 (citing Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>647 (3d ed.1982), and <em>United States v. Hubbs, </em>20 M.J. 909, 910 (A.C.M.R.1985)). Appellant argues that this statement includes conduct that would not otherwise have been criminal under the <em>MCM. </em>The interpretation of \u201csolicitation\u201d under Article 134 is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tardif, </em>57 M.J. 219, 223 (C.A.A.F. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">According to the <em>MCM, </em>\u201cAny act or conduct which reasonably may be construed as a serious request or advice to commit [a crime under the Code] may constitute solicitation.\u201d Pt. IV, 116.C.2. This Court has further described solicitation under Article 134 as \u201can express or implicit invitation to join in a criminal plan.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, 52 </em>M.J. 218, 220 (C.A.A.F.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The word \u201crequest\u201d means \u201cto ask for\u201d and \u201cinvite\u201d means \u201cto offer an incentive or inducement to: entice ... to request formally.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged </em>1929, 1190 (3d ed.1981). These words are synonymous with the words in the treatise cited by the Army court. The court supplemented the quotation from the criminal law treatise by quoting the \u201cserious request\u201d language from the <em>MCM. Hays, </em>slip, op. at 11 (\u201cAny writing that may be reasonably construed as a \u2018serious request or advice\u2019 to commit rape may constitute solicitation. <em>MCM, </em>1998, Part IV, para. 6c(2).\u201d). In that context, we do not interpret the language in the Army court\u2019s opinion as broadening the definition of solicitation to include conduct that would not otherwise be criminal. By quoting the synonymous terms from the criminal law treatise, the Army court merely offered additional explanation as to what constitutes a \u201cserious request\u201d in accordance with the established definition of solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">B. LEGAL SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Legal sufficiency is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>58 M.J. 305, 311 (C.A.A.F.2003). The test is whether \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">The elements of solicitation require proof that Appellant \u201csolicited or advised a certain person or persons to commit\u201d the offense of carnal knowledge \u2014 sexual intercourse with non-spouse under the age of sixteen \u2014 and that Appellant \u201cdid so with the intent that the offense actually be committed.\u201d <em>MCM, </em>pt. IV, H 105.b (solicitation); <em>id. </em>pt. IV, 1145.-b.2 (carnal knowledge). Appellant contends that the query in his e-mail was not a serious request because it was simply a question that \u201cdid not seek any action on [JD\u2019s] part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">The evidence demonstrates that Appellant\u2019s inquiry into whether JD had engaged in sexual intercourse with the nine-year-old girl was followed immediately by a request for pictures of such an encounter. In the same e-mail, Appellant offered JD a quid pro quo. He described his intention to adopt a little girl and promised to send JD pictures of engaging the girl in every sexual activity \u201cthat [JD] can imagine.\u201d He then said that if JD sent pictures, Appellant would be \u201ceternally grateful, and [would] reward [JD] greatly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">In order to fulfill Appellant\u2019s request, it would have been necessary for JD to engage in an act of sexual intercourse with a nine-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>year-old girl. Considering the context of the e-mail \u2014 particularly the repeated urging for JD to send pictures of him engaging in sexual intercourse with the young girl, as well as the quid pro quo contained in the same email \u2014 and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, a reasonable factfinder could have found that the inquiry constituted a serious request for JD to commit carnal knowledge with the girl. Under these circumstances, a reasonable factfinder could infer from the tone and language of the e-mail that Appellant solicited JD to commit carnal knowledge with the intent that the offense actually be committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Appellant further contends that even if his words constituted a serious request to commit carnal knowledge, JD was predisposed and would have committed the offense in the absence of Appellant\u2019s request. In Appellant\u2019s view, JD\u2019s predisposition absolved Appellant of legal responsibility for what otherwise might have been a criminal solicitation. As support for this argument, Appellant relies upon a decision by the Army Court of Criminal Appeals describing solicitation as \u201cseeking to induce conduct by another that that person was not already predisposed to do____\u201d <em>United States v. Dean, </em>44 M.J. 683, 685 (A.Ct.Crim.App.1996). Appellant acknowledges that the Army court in the present case appears to have abandoned the predisposition limitation. Neither the UCMJ nor the <em>MCM </em>precludes a conviction for solicitation simply because the object of the solicitation may be predisposed towards committing the crime. Because there may be cases in which a solicitation transforms predisposition into action, we reject Appellant\u2019s invitation to adopt the predisposition limitation set forth in <em>Dean.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">C. UNCHARGED MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"AY9\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Appellant contends that the solicitation conviction was tainted by the improper introduction of uncharged misconduct evidence. <em>See </em>Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 404(b). The evidence at issue includes an email from Appellant containing images of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct; pictures of adults engaging in bestiality; requests from Appellant for pictures and video of children engaging in sexual activity with adults, including additional discussions with JD about the nine-year-old girl; responses to such requests; and an e-mail to multiple recipients stating that if they did not send \u201cpreteen hardcore pix,\u201d he would remove them from his trading list.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">Defense counsel objected that each of the items was irrelevant, and that specific items were \u00abunduly prejudicial or contained inadmissible character evidence. <em>See </em>M.R.E. 401-04. The prosecution responded that the e-mails and pictures constituted relevant evidence of Appellant\u2019s intent at the time of the solicitation. <em>See </em>M.R.E. 404(b). The military judge overruled the objections and admitted the exhibits into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">In the present appeal, Appellant challenges the admissibility of each of these exhibits under the limitations on the use of uncharged misconduct in M.R.E. 404. Appellant contends that the prosecution improperly used these exhibits \u201cin an effort to show that appellant was a bad man with an unnatural sexual attraction to children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">We review a military judge\u2019s ruling to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Grant, </em>56 M.J. 410, 413 (C.A.A.F.2002). Under M.R.E. 404(b), \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Such evidence may be admissible for other purposes, such as \u201cproof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d M.R.E. 404(b). The admissibility of uncharged misconduct evidence is analyzed under the three-pronged test of <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>29 M.J. 105, 109 (C.M.A.1989): (1) Does the evidence reasonably support a finding by the court members that Appellant committed the prior crimes, wrongs, or acts?; (2) What fact of consequence is made more or less probable by the existence of the evidence?; and (3) Is the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>dice? The evidence is inadmissible if it fails any one of these three tests. <em>United States v. Humpherys, </em>57 M.J. 83, 91 (C.A.A.F.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The Government, noting that the defense objected to most of the exhibits on relevance grounds rather than under M.R.E. 404, contends that we should review for plain error because defense counsel\u2019s objections did not preserve the uncharged misconduct issue. We note, however, that under the <em>Reynolds </em>three-prong test for analyzing uncharged misconduct under M.R.E. 404, two of the three prongs involve relevance and undue prejudice under M.R.E. 401 and M.R.E. 403. For purposes of the present appeal, we shall assume without deciding that defense counsel\u2019s objections sufficiently preserved the issue of uncharged misconduct on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">2. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The first prong of the <em>Reynolds </em>test asks whether the factfinder could reasonably find by a preponderance of the evidence that the misconduct occurred \u2014 sending and receiving e-mails discussing the exchange of child pornography and pictures containing sexually explicit images of children and adults. The exhibits at issue were sent and received by \u201cP[]13,\u201d and evidence introduced at trial showed that Appellant was \u201cP[ ]13.\u201d This is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Appellant sent and received the e-mails and pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Under the second <em>Reynolds </em>prong, the evidence must make some fact of consequence more or less probable. It is not sufficient, however, to introduce the evidence as evidence of Appellant\u2019s character to prove that he acted in conformity therewith. M.R.E. 404(a); <em>United States v. Robles-Ramos, </em>47 M.J. 474 (C.A.A.F.1998). The Government contends that the exhibits were relevant to show Appellant\u2019s intent to solicit JD to commit camal knowledge. <em>See </em>M.R.E. 404(b). Appellant responds that the exhibits do not prove or disprove Appellant\u2019s intent to commit camal knowledge. According to Appellant, the exhibits only establish that Appellant enjoyed viewing child pornography, which was not a fact in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">When considering whether uncharged misconduct constitutes admissible evidence of intent under M.R.E. 404(b), we consider \u201cwhether Appellant\u2019s state of mind in the commission of both the charged and uncharged acts was sufficiently similar to make the evidence of the prior acts relevant on the intent element of the charged offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>59 M.J. 426, 430 (C.A.A.F.2004). \u201cExtrinsic acts evidence may be critical to the establishment of the truth as to a disputed issue, especially when that issue involves the actor\u2019s state of mind and the only means of ascertaining that mental state is by drawing inferences from conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Tanksley, </em>54 M.J. 169, 176 (C.A.A.F.2000) (quoting <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 685, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The critical issue with respect to the solicitation charge in the present case was whether Appellant intended to ask JD to engage in carnal knowledge with a child so that Appellant could receive pictures of the activity. In that context, evidence of Appellant\u2019s intent is reflected in the exhibits describing his desire to engage in sexual activities with young girls, as well as through the exhibits showing that Appellant pressured a woman identified as \u201c[PD]\u201d to send him a videotape of her boyfriend\u2019s sexual activities with her minor daughter, and that Appellant communicated with JD about the nine-year-old girl on other occasions. In addition, the exhibits were relevant as reflecting Appellant\u2019s motive for making the request of JD. <em>See </em>2 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence </em>404.22[3] (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The third <em>Reynolds </em>prong, employs the balancing test under the M.R.E. 403: whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Although the pictures and language in the e-mails were offensive, that is the nature of much of the evidence in cases involving child pornography. <em>See United States v. Garot, </em>801 F.2d 1241, 1247 (10th Cir.1986) (noting that defendants in child pornography cases unavoidably risk the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>troduction of evidence that would offend an average juror). In light of the nature of the offense and the other evidence admitted, the prejudicial impact of these exhibits did not substantially outweigh their probative value in demonstrating Appellant\u2019s intent and motive to solicit JD. <em>See United States v. Acton, </em>38 M.J. 330, 334 (C.M.A.1993) (explaining that any prejudicial impact due to the \u201cshocking nature\u201d of a pornographic video depicting incest was diminished because the same conduct was already before the court members).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Furthermore, this trial was before a military judge sitting alone, and the record reflects that the military judge engaged in a balancing analysis under M.R.E. 403. In that context, if evidence is admitted for a limited purpose, we presume a military judge will consider it only for that purpose. <em>See United States v. Stinson, </em>34 M.J. 233, 239 (C.M.A.1992); <em>United States v. Ray, </em>26 M.J. 468, 471 (C.M.A.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">D. EXPERT TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In support of the solicitation charge, the prosecution relied on the testimony of Kenneth Lanning, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and assigned to the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. Mr. Lanning testified as an expert in the behavioral aspects of sexual victimization of children. Appellant challenges Mr. Lanning\u2019s testimony on two grounds: first, that it consisted of conclusions on the ultimate issue; and second, that it constituted inadmissible profile evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">1. <em>Testimony on the ultimate issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Mr. Lanning explained the significance of the exhibit that contained the alleged solicitation by stating that the e-mail was \u201cattempting to entice the individual, encourage the individual to do that, by indicating that he will do a similar thing with a child and possibly send that individual pictures of that.\u201d Defense counsel objected that the testimony \u201cgoes to the ultimate issue of intent. I don\u2019t think the expert can give his opinion that this is actually a solicitation.\u201d The military judge disagreed, stating: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what he did. He\u2019s giving his opinion on what the language of that particular e-mail suggests and I think he can \u2014 that\u2019s his interpretation. I think that\u2019s legitimate and I think that\u2019s within the scope of his expertise as an expert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">We review a military judge\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Billings, </em>61 M.J. 163, 166 (C.A.A.F.2005). M.R.E. 702 provides that a witness qualified as an <em>expert </em>may testify as to scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge if it will assist the factfinder in understanding the evidence or determining a fact at issue. M.R.E. 704 adds, \u201cTestimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d This rule, however, does not permit the expert to express an opinion on the \u201cultimate issue\u201d of a case. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>51 M.J. 145, 151 (C.A.A.F.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">An expert opinion interpreting a document does not necessarily constitute an ultimate opinion on the intent of the document\u2019s author. Although Mr. Lanning used words associated with the concept of solicitation, such as \u201centice\u201d and \u201cencourage,\u201d he did not provide an opinion on the ultimate issue in this ease \u2014 whether Appellant\u2019s actions amounted to solicitation as a matter of law. His testimony, for example, left it for the factfinder to determine whether the language in the e-mail amounted to a serious request.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">A military judge, who is presumed to know and understand the law, is capable of distinguishing between the evidentiary value of such an opinion and the military judge\u2019s responsibility, as factfinder, to determine the ultimate issue of intent. <em>See Ray, </em>26 M.J. at 471. In this case, the military judge stated that she viewed Mr. Lanning\u2019s testimony as simply providing his opinion on the language of the e-mail, an area within his expertise. In the context of a judge-alone trial, admission of this expert testimony was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>60 M.J. 4 (C.A.A.F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>2004), where we held that, under M.R.E. 701, the military judge erred by allowing the appellant\u2019s wife, a lay witness, to testify as to her opinion of the appellant\u2019s meaning in various passages of letters he wrote to her. In contrast to the wife of the appellant in <em>Byrd, </em>Mr. Lanning, who was accepted by the court as an expert, had a basis of knowledge for his testimony opining on the meaning of Appellant\u2019s e-mail correspondence. Appellant did not allege at trial, and has not contended on appeal, that Mr. Lanning\u2019s testimony was outside the scope of his expertise. As an expert with specialized knowledge in the field of the behavioral aspects of the sexual victimization of children, Mr. Lanning was qualified to speak to the strategies employed by sexual predators to encourage other individuals to commit sexual offenses against children and to offer his opinion as to whether this e-mail could be viewed as part of such a strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">2. <em>Profile Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u201cProfile evidence is evidence that presents a \u2018characteristic profile\u2019 of an offender, such as a pedophile or child abuser, and then places the accused\u2019s personal characteristics within that profile as proof of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Traum, </em>60 M.J. 226, 234 (C.A.A.F.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Rynning, </em>47 M.J. 420, 422 (C.A.A.F.1998)). As we noted in <em>United States v. Banks, </em>36 M.J. 150, 161 (C.M.A.1992): \u201cGenerally, use of any characteristic \u2018profile\u2019 as evidence of guilt or innocence in criminal trials is improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">At trial, defense counsel did not object to any of Mr. Lanning\u2019s expert testimony as constituting improper profile evidence. On appeal, however, Appellant asserts that his testimony amounted to profile evidence. Appellant interprets Mr. Lanning\u2019s testimony as beginning with a description of the typical behavior and fantasies of a generalized group \u2014 those who use computers to view child pornography. According to Appellant, Mr. Lanning then applied these general characteristics to Appellant to reach the conclusion that Appellant \u201cwanted this rape of the 9 year old girl.\u201d Appellant summarizes Mr. Lanning\u2019s testimony as stating that Appellant fit the typical behavior patterns of a group, and because members of that group typically desire to view pictures with a \u201cfirst person account,\u201d Appellant therefore intended that JD rape the girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">In the absence of objection at trial, we apply the plain error test of <em>United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460, 463-65 (C.A.A.F.1998). Appellant has the burden of demonstrating that there was an error, that the error was plain or obvious, and that the error materially prejudiced Appellant\u2019s substantial rights. Under <em>Powell, </em>we need not assess whether there was an error if any error would not have materially prejudiced Appellant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">As we noted in <em>United States v. Robbins:</em></p>\n<p id=\"AO\">When the issue of plain error involves a judge-alone trial, an appellant faces a particularly high hurdle. A military judge is presumed to know the law and apply it correctly, is presumed capable of filtering out inadmissible evidence, and is presumed not to have relied on such evidence on the question of guilt or innocence. As a result, plain error before a military judge sitting alone is rare indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">52 M.J. 455, 457 (C.A.A.F.2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">In this judge-alone trial, the military judge stated that she understood Mr. Lanning\u2019s testimony as simply interpreting the language of the e-mail. In that context, even if the testimony included profile evidence, there was no prejudice to Appellant because the military judge did not treat the testimony as profile evidence or give it any prejudicial weight in that regard. <em>See id. </em>at 458; <em>United States v. Talbert, </em>33 M.J. 244, 247 n. * (C.M.A.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">III. CHILD PORNOGRAPHY (ISSUES III AND IV)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">Appellant pled guilty to the charged offenses of distributing, receiving, possessing, and soliciting others to distribute and receive child pornography in violation of the CPPA, under clause 3 of Article 134, UCMJ. On appeal, Appellant asserts that his pleas were improvident because: (1) the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>under which he was convicted has no extraterritorial application; and (2) the military judge employed a definition of child pornography that subsequently was determined to be unconstitutional. In a challenge to the providence of a plea, the appellant carries the burden of showing that the record of trial demonstrates a substantial basis in law and fact for questioning the plea. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>58 M.J. 450, 453 (C.A.A.F.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">A. EXTRATERRITORIALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Appellant engaged in the conduct underlying the CPPA-based charges in Germany. In <em>United States v. Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. 52, 53-54 (C.A.A.F.2005), we held that the CPPA has no extraterritorial application and found that Martinelli\u2019s guilty pleas to the CCPAbased offenses for conduct occurring in Germany were improvident. We reached a different conclusion in <em>Martinelli </em>with respect to one specification charging that Martinelli used e-mail to send child pornography over the Internet, citing a stipulation accompanying the plea acknowledging that the pertinent e-mails were sent through the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 62-63. In the present ease, Appellant did not enter into such a stipulation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the plea was improvident. Accordingly, we need not address the question of whether the military judge employed an unconstitutional definition during the plea inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">B. LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The determination that Appellant\u2019s pleas to violating the CPPA were improvident does not end this Court\u2019s inquiry. <em>See, e.g., Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 66-68, <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>62 M.J. 88, 94-96 (C.A.A.F. 2005). An improvident plea to an offense of a CPPA violation charged under clause 3 of Article 134 may be upheld on a proper record as a provident plea to a lesser included offense under the first two clauses of Article 134. <em>United States v. Mason, </em>60 M.J. 15, 19-20 (C.A.A.F.2004). As explained in <em>Reeves, </em>\u201c[T]he providence inquiry must reflect that the accused \u2018clearly understood the nature of the prohibited conduct.\u2019 \u201d 62 M.J. at 95 (quoting <em>United States v. Sapp, </em>53 M.J. 90, 92 (C.A.A.F.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Prior to questioning Appellant on the four CPPA-based violations, the military judge focused Appellant\u2019s attention on the specification of Charge III. This specification alleged that Appellant had \u201con divers occasions between on or about 20 September 1999 and on or about 4 March 2000\u201d violated a specific provision of the Joint Ethics Regulation, a Department of Defense lawful general regulation, \u201cby wrongfully receiving, viewing, and distributing child pornography and bestiality via the internet, using government computers.\u201d It is clear from the whole of the providence inquiry that the same conduct underlying this charge also was at the heart of the CPPA-based offenses, and that Appellant was fully aware of this interrelationship. Accordingly, it is appropriate to consider the totality of the inquiry to determine whether Appellant \u201cclearly understood the nature of the prohibited conduct\u201d as being a violation of clause 1 or clause 2 of Article 134. <em>See Reeves, </em>62 M.J. at 95. For purposes of this appeal, we shall assume, without deciding, that the plea inquiry did not implicate Appellant\u2019s First Amendment rights. <em>Compare Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. at 66-67 (requiring a \u201cmore precise articulation of the service-member\u2019s understanding\u201d when the accused\u2019s First Amendment rights are implicated), <em>with Reeves, </em>62 M.J. at 95-96 (applying the standard when the servicemember\u2019s constitutional rights are not at issue). The military judge explained to Appellant, \u201cA general regulation is lawful if it is reasonably necessary to safeguard and protect the morale, discipline, and usefulness of the members of the command and is directly connected with the maintenance of good order in the services.\u201d Appellant acknowledged this advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>and admitted that the elements of the regulation offense, as explained by the military judge, accurately described his conduct. Importantly, for purposes of this appeal, the military judge asked Appellant during the inquiry into the regulation offense, \u201cDo you believe by using these computers to access child pornography that reflected adversely on the Department of Defense?\u201d Appellant responded, \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The military judge also questioned Appellant on each of the four CPPA-based violations (specifications 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Charge IV). With regard to the first three specifications (distribution and receipt of child pornography \u201con divers occasions between on or about 20 September 1999 and on or about 4 March 2000\u201d and possession of child pornography \u201con or about 5 January 2000\u201d), the military judge did not expressly discuss with Appellant whether he believed his conduct was to the \u201cprejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces\u201d or was \u201cof a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\u201d Article 134, UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">During the inquiry regarding the first two CPPA-based specifications, Appellant admitted that he used Government computers at Vilseek Library on the local military installation to distribute and receive child pornography via his e-mail account \u2014 the same activities on the same Government computers that Appellant indicated were involved in his violation of the lawful general regulation. Similarly, he stated that the computer discs of child pornography that he was charged with possessing had been downloaded from these same Government computers. He agreed that his conduct in receiving, distributing, and possessing child pornography was \u201cwrongful.\u201d In connection with the inquiry into Appellant\u2019s guilty plea to the last CPPAbased specification, soliciting others to distribute and receive child pornography, Appellant left no doubt on the record as to his awareness of the impact of his conduct on the image of the armed forces:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">MJ: And you believe in doing that, your conduct was either prejudicial to good order and discipline in the Armed Forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">ACC: I felt it was bringing discredit upon the Armed Forces, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">MJ: Okay. Do you think if people outside the military knew that a soldier was doing this, it might tend to make them think less of soldiers in the military?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">ACC: It may, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">MJ: Well, do you think it would tend to\u2014 well, let me ask you this, do you think that if people knew \u2014 if civilians knew that you were sending out email requesting others to send and receive child pornography, do you think that tends to make them think less of people in the military?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">The plea inquiry, as a whole, includes a critical component that was absent in the inquiries conducted in <em>Reeves. </em>Appellant admitted that his conduct was service-discrediting and why. <em>See United States v. Augustine, </em>53 M.J. 95, 96 (C.A.A.F.2000); <em>Sapp, </em>53 M.J. at 92. The record shows that Appellant was convinced of the facts predicate to a conviction under clause 2 of Article 134, and that there was a sufficient factual basis for guilty pleas to the lesser included offenses under these specifications. <em>See </em>Rule for Courts-Martial 910(e). Under the facts of this case, Appellant admitted that he was using Government computers to carry out his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">In that light, we conclude under <em>Reeves </em>that this record reflects an appropriate discussion of the character of the conduct at issue as service-discrediting and demonstrates that the accused \u201cclearly understood the nature of the prohibited conduct\u201d as being a violation of clause 2, apart from how it may or may not have met the elements of the separate criminal statute underlying the clause 3 charge. 62 M.J. at 95-96. Accordingly, in our decretal paragraph we direct amendment of these specifications to replace the references to the CPPA with references to service-discrediting conduct. Our approval of these does not alter the essential nature of these offenses. As a result, there was no prejudice as to his sentence, so a sentence rehearing is unwarranted. <em>See Augustine, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>53 M.J. at 96; <em>Mason, </em>60 M.J. at 20 (affirming the sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed, except that specifications 1-4 of Charge IV are amended in each instance by deleting the words \u201cin violation of the Child Pornography Prevention Act, 18 U.S.C.\u201d and the respective section designations, and inserting the words \u201cconduct which was service-discrediting.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\">. Because the Government chose to charge these offenses as occurring solely within Germany, we need not address whether Appellant's use of United States-based internet services would amount to domestic conduct for purposes of the CPPA. We also need not determine whether the evidence demonstrates that a relevant portion of Appellant's conduct occurred in the United States for purposes of the CPPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b289-8\">ERDMANN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AAv\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">In <em>United States v. Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. 52 (C.A.A.F.2005), we determined that the Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) has no extraterritorial application. Under the factual circumstances presented in this case, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Hays\u2019 guilty pleas to the four CPPA-based specifications were improvident on that basis. 1 therefore concur with the majority in regard to Issue IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">As noted in <em>Martinelli, </em>an improvident plea to a CPPA-based offense may, under certain circumstances, be upheld as provident to a lesser included offense under clauses 1 or 2 of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (2000). Under this rationale, the majority affirms all four CPPA-based specifications under clause 2 of Article 134. I also concur with the result reached by the majority in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">I dissent, however, to the majority\u2019s resolution of Issues I and II. Hays\u2019 acts were not legally sufficient to constitute solicitation of another to commit carnal knowledge. Further, the military judge abused her discretion by admitting evidence of Hays\u2019 uncharged misconduct and in admitting Agent Lanning\u2019s testimony. I would therefore reverse the Army Court of Criminal Appeals on those issues and would dismiss the specification alleging solicitation of another to commit carnal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">I. <em>Solicitation Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">\n<em>Definition of \u201cSolicitation\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">The majority accepts the Army Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 definition of solicitation as \u201c \u2018any ... words or other device by which a person is requested, urged, advised, counseled, tempted, commanded or otherwise enticed or incited to commit a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hays, </em>slip op. at 11 (A.Ct.Crim.App. Jan. 22, 2004) (citation omitted). This goes well beyond the definition of solicitation found in the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 <em>ed.)(MCM), </em>and the pri- or definition adopted by this court. The President has defined solicitation as a \u201cserious request or advice\u201d to commit a crime. <em>MCM, </em>pt. IV, 116c.2. This court has further explained the term to mean an \u201cexpress or implicit invitation to join a criminal plan.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>52 M.J. 218, 220 (C.A.A.F.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-18\">The Army Court of Criminal Appeals has not felt constrained by these relatively straightforward definitions. In a series of opinions the Army court has adopted a number of terms to expand the definition of \u201csolicitation\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case the Army court adopted a number of these terms, i.e., \u201crequested, urged, advised, counseled, tempted, commanded or otherwise enticed or incited.\u201d <em>Hays, </em>slip. op. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-19\">The majority finds that these terms <em>are </em>synonymous with the term \u201crequest\u201d and since the Army court also referenced the <em>MCM </em>requirement of a \u201cserious request\u201d, the terms merely offered additional explanation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The term \u201cserious request or advice\u201d is not such a unique term that it needs such extensive supplementation. The question for the factfinder is whether the language in question constituted a serious request or ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>vice to commit an offense. The difficulty in using a laundry list of additional terms to further define \u201csolicitation\u201d is that it is likely to give the impression to members that solicitation is broader than defined by the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">I would prefer to stay with the <em>MCM </em>definition that solicitation is a serious request or advice to commit an offense. However, even if I were to accept the majority\u2019s definition, there is not sufficient evidence to affirm Hays\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\n<em>Legal Sufficiency of the Solicitation Charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The test for legal sufficiency is whether \u201cconsidering the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable fact-finder could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Walters, </em>58 M.J. 391, 395 (C.A.A.F.2003). The elements that the Government had to prove in this charge were (1) that Hays made a serious request to Davis, (2) asking Davis to have sexual intercourse with a person under the age of sixteen (other than his spouse), (3) that Hays intended for Davis to agree to his request and to actually commit the crime they were discussing, and (4) that Hays\u2019 conduct was prejudicial to good order and discipline or was of a nature to bring discredit to the armed forces. <em>MCM, </em>pt. IV, H 105.b.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The e-mail that provides the basis for the solicitation charge, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">I hope that everything is working out with your 9 yo. Have you f***** her yet? If so, [d]o you have pix? Does your wife know that you do this type of stuff to little girls? Man you are not going to believe it when I adopt that little girl and send you a pix of me and her as I promised. I am going to do everything to her that you can imagine. And you will be the first to see, I promise you that much. I hope that you can find it in your heart to send me more pix as you have in the past week or so. If you send me more pix, I will be eternally grateful, and reward you greatly. Please send me more!!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The language of the e-mail reveals only that Hays seriously requested sexually explicit photographs of young girls. Although Hays initially appears to have been talking about a particular young girl, who may or may not have existed, the evidence is simply not sufficient to establish that Hays was seriously requesting Davis to commit sexual acts with the girl. As the e-mail does constitute a serious request for images of child pornography, a solicitation charge to that offense would be legally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">There is no question that sexual crimes against minors and the area of child pornography encompass a variety of despicable crimes for which society has justifiably proscribed serious penalties. We should not, however, allow our disgust for Hays\u2019 actions color our judgment in evaluating the legal sufficiency of the charges. To conclude that Hays\u2019 e-mail was a \u201cserious request or advice\u201d for Davis to have sexual intercourse with a specific young girl is a stretch that the evidence simply does not support. Accordingly, I would reverse Hays\u2019 conviction for solicitation of another to commit carnal knowledge because the evidence against him was legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">II. <em>Evidentiary Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">\n<em>Uncharged Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 404(b). As explained by the Supreme Court, the law seeks to prevent a finder of fact from concluding that an accused acted criminally in a specific instance simply because the accused is a bad or evil person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-14\">The State may not show defendants prior trouble with the law, specific criminal acts, or ill name among his neighbors, even though such facts might logically be persuasive that he is by propensity a probable perpetrator of the crime. The inquiry is not rejected because character is irrelevant; on the contrary, it is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>general record and deny Mm a fair opportumty to defend against a particular charge. The overriding policy of excludmg such evidence, despite its admitted probative value, is the practical experience that its disallowance tends to prevent confusion of issues, unfair surprise and undue prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><em>Michelson v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 469, 475-76, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948) (footnotes omitted); <em>see also United States v. Humpherys, </em>57 M.J. 83, 90 (C.A.A.F.2002) (\u201c \u2018[Ejvidence which is offered simply to prove that an accused is a bad person is not admissible\u2019 under Mil.R.Evid. 404(b), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.).\u201d). Character evidence such as information that Hays sent out many e-mails asking for sexually explicit pictures of children, that he received responses to these e-mails, that he kept many of the responses in his inbox and that the images attached to these responses are offensive, is admissible only if it meets the three-prong test set out m <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>29 M.J. 105, 109 (C.M.A. 1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">1. Does the evidence reasonably support a finding that appellant committed pri- or crimes, wrongs or acts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">2. What \u201cfact of consequence\u201d is made more or less probable by the existence of the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">3. Is the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">As the majority properly notes, the first prong of <em>Reynolds </em>is satisfied because there was sufficient evidence from which the fact-finder could conclude that Hays actually sent and received the e-mails m question.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The more difficult question is whether the military judge abused her discretion by concluding that the second and third prongs of <em>Reynolds </em>were also satisfied. The military judge and the majority conclude that the other e-mails and images satisfy M.R.E. 404(b) and the second prong because they were relevant to show Hays\u2019 intent to solicit Davis to commit carnal knowledge. But, as with the \u201csolicitation\u201d e-mail, the oMy fact that is made more or less probable by the existence of the other e-mails in Hays\u2019 account is the fact that Hays requested, collected, and viewed child pornography and that he was mvolved with a group of other individuals who shared the same intei\u2019ests. The existence of other vulgar and sometimes illegal e-mails in Hays\u2019 inbox does not make it more or less likely that Hays mtended to seriously request an individual he knew only by e-mail address to have sexual mtereourse with a particular girl under the age of sixteen. The military judge\u2019s conclusion that Hays\u2019 e-mail activities made it more likely that he mtended to solicit Davis lacks both a factual and legal basis and is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">Similarly, the \u201cother wrongs\u201d evidence in question cannot satisfy the third prong of <em>Reynolds. </em>The language and tone of Hays\u2019 e-mails, as well as the frequency of Ms requests for pornography and the nature of the images he received, wMch mcluded bestiality and violent images, were prejudicial. The prosecution offered into evidence at least twenty-three exhibits consisting of e-mail messages asking for child pornography and multiple pornograpMe images. As discussed above, these e-mails and images have no probative value with respect to Hays\u2019 intent to commit the crime with wMch he is charged. Accordingly, their prejudicial effect outweighs any probative value, and they should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">\n<em>Agent Lanning\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">Hays challenged the admission of Agent Lanning\u2019s testimony as impermissible profile evidence and also as testimony as to the ultimate legal issue, i.e., whether Hays solicited Davis to commit a crime. An expert may testify if his \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence....\u201d M.R.E. 702. An expert may offer opimons, but he may not state legal opinions. <em>United States v. Benedict, </em>27 M.J. 253, 259 (C.M.A 1988); <em>see also MCM, </em>Analysis of the Military Rules of Evidence A22-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">Lannmg testified that Hays wanted to \u201centice the individual, encourage the individual to [rape the child]\u201d and that \u201che [Hays] wanted tMs rape of the 9 year old girl and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>what he, essentially, wanted was photographs of that rape.\u201d According to the definition of solicitation used by the military judge, this testimony went to the ultimate issue in this case. Lanning was not only offering expert testimony as to what the e-mail from Hays to Davis meant, he also offered his opinion on why Hays sent the e-mail \u2014 the very question to be decided by the finder of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">If Lanning was put on the stand merely to interpret the language of the e-mail, as the majority asserts, it is unclear why he was qualified as an expert. The e-mail is written in English, it is not written in code, and it does not discuss any technology or other specialized areas of knowledge for which expert interpretation would be necessary. The e-mail is a document that speaks for itself, and Lanning did not have any specialized skills that were needed to interpret it. <em>See United States v. Houser, </em>36 M.J. 392, 398 (C.M.A.1993) (expert testimony not needed where factfinder is \u201cqualified without such testimony \u2018to determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the particular issue.\u2019\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Billings, </em>61 M.J. 163, 170 (C.A.A.F. 2005) (Erdmann, J., concurring in part and in the \u201eresult) (testimony of jeweler not necessary to educate members about characteristics of watch depicted in advertisement).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Lanning crossed the line between providing permissible expert testimony to testifying on the ultimate issue in the solicitation charge \u2014 that Hays intended to request Davis to rape the minor girl. This is inappropriate expert testimony. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>51 M.J. 145, 151 (C.A.A.F.1999) (recognizing that an expert may not express an opinion on the \u201cultimate issue\u201d). Accordingly, Lanning\u2019s testimony should have been excluded as well and I therefore dissent from the majority\u2019s holding on Issues I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">GIERKE, Chief Judge (concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">I join the majority regarding Issues I and II. Regarding Issue IV, I share the result of the majority but not its analysis. As I explained in <em>Martinelli,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I believe that the Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) applies extraterritorially. Thus, I do not agree with the majority that Appellant\u2019s pleas to the CPPA-based offenses for conduct occurring in Germany were improvident based on an absence of extraterritorial application of the CPPA. Rather, I would conclude that Appellant\u2019s pleas to the CPPA-based specifications were improvident because the military judge used an unconstitutional definition of \u201cchild pornography\u201d during the providence inquiry.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, I agree with the majority\u2019s result that the Army Court\u2019s decision should be affirmed, and that specifications 1 through 4 of Charge IV should be amended by deleting reference to the CPPA and adding the phrase, \u201cconduct which was service discrediting.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-14\">. <em>See United States v.

Martinelli, </em>62 M.J. 52, 77-87 (C.A.A.F.2005) (Crawford, J., dissenting), my dissent in this case is based on the specific factual aspects of Appellant\u2019s case, briefly discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-17\">APPLICATION OF 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A</p>\n<p id=\"b292-18\">Because a domestic application of the Child Pornography Prevention Act has been clearly established by the evidence in this case, the question of extraterritorial application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Prosecution Exhibits 4 and 17 consist of emails to or from Appellant with either attached or embedded photographic images of child pornography. Several of these carry the \u201cbanner\u201d of \u201cYahoo! Mail\u201d or \u201cMSN Hotmail,\u201d both of which are United States corporations whose electronic mail servers are in the United States. <em>Id. See Martinelli, 62 </em>M.J. at 77 (Crawford, J., dissenting); <em>United States v. Kimler, </em>335 F.3d 1132, 1135 n. 2 (10th Cir.2003)( \u201cIn order to send and receive email messages using Hotmail, one must access the Hotmail servers, which are located in Mountain View, California, at www.hotmail.com.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bach, </em>400 F.3d 622, 625 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">By maintaining accounts with \u201cHotmail\u201d and \u201cYahoo! Mail,\u201d Appellant was effectively renting electronic \u201cspace\u201d on servers located in the United States, on which he could store images of child pornography \u2014 images that he could remotely receive, transmit, or reproduce at will, regardless of his own location at the time. On each such occasion, Appellant was \u201creaching into\u201d the United States to commit a crime. <em>See United States v. Moncini, </em>882 F.2d 401 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">APPELLANT\u2019S ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ACTUAL CHILDREN</p>\n<p id=\"b293-21\">The military judge in this case did not include the language struck down by the Supreme Court in <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002), when she explained the applicable elements and definitions to Appellant. Appellant\u2019s plea sufficiently demonstrates his conviction that the images were of \u201cactual\u201d children.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-22\">The record of Appellant\u2019s <em>Care </em>inquiry<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> leaves no doubt whatsoever that Appellant admitted to trafficking in pornographic images of actual children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-23\">MJ: Now, tell me what these pictures were of, that you received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-24\">ACC: They were pictures of children\u2014 pictures of adults and children in sexual acts or children and children in sexual acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">MJ: So it was either children with adults \u2014 children engaging in sexual acts with adults and children engaged in sexual acts with other children, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">MJ: So, basically, two different categories?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">ACC: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">MJ: And when you say \u201csexual acts\u201d do you mean there was oral to genital or genital to genital contact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\">ACC: Oral to genital penetration, anal penetration, genital to genital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-15\">MJ: Okay.
