The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for four months, forfeiture of $737.00 pay per month for four months, and reduction to Private El. This case is before our court for review pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Appellant asserts his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because he had a severe mental disease or defect at the time of his criminal conduct, and his mental disease or defect undermined his trial rendering it fundamentally unfair. Appellant argues that if the military judge inquired about his mental health issues \u2014 -prompted by remarks appellant made during his unsworn statement \u2014 the military judge would have ordered a sanity board. Appellant further claims he did not provide facts sufficient to sustain his plea of guilty to one AWOL specification because appellant did not admit he was absent from his unit, but instead, told the military judge he remained in the barracks during his absence. We find both assignments of error to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">APPELLANT\u2019S MENTAL DISEASE OR DEFECT</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Appellant pleaded guilty to, and was found guilty of, two AWOL specifications in violation of Article 86, UCMJ, and five drug-use specifications in violation of Article 112a, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a, for using marijuana, cocaine, and MDMA on various occasions over a five-month period. Nothing inconsistent with appellant\u2019s guilty plea was raised during the providence inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">In his unsworn statement during presentencing, appellant spoke extensively about his spiritual development which started during the summer of 1996. He explained he had found God, recognized himself as a sinner, and knew God would forgive him. Appellant stated he had been reading the Bible and had become wiser. Appellant further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">In fact, it was August the 6th, 1996; I believe that was the day I got saved. And that day, you know, I found God. I know I found God because you know when you find God. You find it in your heart. You feel it. I\u2019m sure you do. And that day, you know, I knew I was going to sin again, and I knew that God would forgive me for my sins____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">Thereafter, the military judge did not inquire into or explain to appellant the defense of lack of mental responsibility, nor did he ask appellant if he had discussed the defense with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">\n<em>Initial Appeal and First Sanity Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">On 30 April 2003, appellant filed a brief with this court claiming in his only assignment of error that his plea to the second AWOL specification was improvident. On 31 October 2003, while awaiting action on this appeal, appellant requested, pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial [hereinafter R.C.M.] 1203, that our court order an inquiry into both his mental responsibility and mental capacity in accordance with R.C.M. 706.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>10 December 2003, we granted this request and ordered a sanity board to answer specific questions regarding appellant\u2019s mental responsibility at the time of his offenses, and his mental capacity to participate and assist in his defense at trial and during the appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On 23 March 2004, a board consisting of one psychiatrist and two psychologists reported that appellant \u201cappears to be dependent on cannabis at the present time and likely has either a substance induced psychotic disorder or schizoaffective disorder, depressive type.\u201d Notwithstanding this diagnosis, the board determined that, at the time of trial, appellant was able to understand the nature of the proceedings and to cooperate intelligently in his defense. It also determined that at the time of his criminal conduct, appellant was able to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his conduct. The board farther concluded, as a result of his mental condition, appellant was \u201cunable to understand the nature of the appellate proceedings [and] to cooperate intelligently in his pending appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">On 4 October 2004, based on the first sanity board\u2019s conclusion that appellant could not assist in his appeal because of his severe abuse of illegal drugs, this court stayed appellate proceedings and ordered appellant restored to active duty to receive medical treatment. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 1203(c)(5); <em>see also United States v. Korzeniewski, </em>7 U.S.C.M.A. 314, 317, 22 C.M.R. 104, 107, 1956 WL 4745 (1956) (holding that a finding of lack of mental capacity tolls proceedings at any stage of the appellate process). We further directed the government to arrange for a new sanity board to examine appellant after completion of his medical treatment to determine his competency to assist in his appeal. We directed that this second board consist of three members, including at least one psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\n<em>Second Sanity Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">During the months following our October 2004 stay of appellate proceedings, appellant received mental health treatment. He then appeared before a second sanity board which reassessed his condition. On 7 December 2004, the second sanity board, consisting of only one member, a psychiatrist, reported that appellant \u201csuffers from a most serious and severe mental disorder.\u201d The board further found, \u201cthis disorder does not render him incapable of understanding the nature of the proceedings before him.\u201d The board concluded appellant was able to \u201ccooperate appropriately in his appeal\u201d and \u201cunderstand the nature of the appeal process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">We did not ask the second sanity board for an opinion regarding appellant\u2019s competency at the time of trial or responsibility at the time of his offenses; therefore, the board made no express findings on these subjects. But the board made three statements appellant considers relevant to this appeal. First, the board identified \u201chyper-religiosity of thinking\u201d as one of the manifestations of his illness. Second, the board stated, \u201cCurrent Psychosocial and Environmental Problems are determined to be of longstanding duration, i.e., months prior to and including his violations under the UCMJ.\u201d Third, the board reported that \u201chis thought and substance use disorder came to [override] his appreciation of right and wrong.\u201d Although the second sanity board, consisting of only a psychiatrist, did not meet the court-ordered composition requirements, we will still consider its report because the board\u2019s composition did fulfill the R.C.M. 706(c)(1) requirements that a sanity board consist of \u201cone or more persons\u201d and \u201cat least one ... psychiatrist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">\n<em>Third Sanity Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Recognizing the second sanity board\u2019s composition did not meet the requirements of our October 2004 order, the government requested additional time to convene a three-member board to reevaluate appellant. On 6 January 2005, we granted the government\u2019s motion for an extension of time. Thereafter, a third sanity board consisting of the requisite number of members convened and reevaluated appellant in February 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">On 28 February 2005, a third sanity board, composed of three psychiatrists and one psychologist, concluded, as did the second sanity board, that appellant suffers from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>a serious mental disorder, but is competent to assist in his appeal. The third sanity board repeated verbatim the second sanity board\u2019s findings that appellant is currently schizophrenic (manifested by \u201chyper-religiosity of thinking\u201d), suffers from \u201cpolysubstance dependence\u201d (\u201crepeated use of ... cannabis, cocaine and hallucinogens\u201d), and possesses other character traits of \u201crelatively longstanding duration.\u201d The third sanity board also found appellant experienced social and environmental problems \u201cof longstanding duration.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Law and Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Appellant now asserts his guilty plea was improvident, i.e., not knowing and voluntary, because \u201che had a severe mental disease or defect at the time of his criminal conduct that impaired his ability to understand the nature and consequences or wrongfulness of his actions,\u201d possibly affording him the defense of lack of mental responsibility. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 45,10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845; R.C.M. 916(k)(l); <em>United States v. Cortes-Crespo, </em>13 M.J. 420, 421 (C.M.A.1982). Appellant further asserts that, although no one mentioned \u201cappellant\u2019s mental disease\u201d at the time of trial, the military judge \u201chad one clue that appellant had severe paranoid schizophrenia: appellant\u2019s unsworn statement.\u201d Appellate defense counsel cite appellant\u2019s religious statements described above, and state they are \u201cconsistent with\u201d the second and third sanity boards\u2019 conclusions that appellant\u2019s disease is manifested by, among other things, his religiosity. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">\n<em>Whether the Military Judge Erred by Failing to Inquire into Appellant\u2019s Mental Responsibility, Discuss the Possibility of the Affirmative Defense, and Satisfy Himself that the Defense Did Not Apply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8ud\">We review a military judge\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Eberle, </em>44 M.J. 374, 375 (C.A.A.F.1996). We will not overturn a military judge\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea unless the record of trial shows a \u201c \u2018substantial basis\u2019 in law and fact for questioning the guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Erickson, </em>61 M.J. 230, 232 (C.A.A.F.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Milton, </em>46 M.J. 317, 318 (C.A.A.F.1997), and <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991)). A providence inquiry into the accused\u2019s guilt must establish that the accused believes and admits he is guilty of the offense, and that the factual circumstances he admits to objectively support the guilty plea. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>44 M.J. 496, 497-98 (C.A.A.F.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Higgins, </em>40 M.J. 67, 68 (C.M.A. 1994); <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>9 M.J. 364, 367 (C.M.A.1980); R.C.M. 910(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Should an accused set up a matter inconsistent with his plea at any time during the proceeding, \u201cthe military judge must either resolve the apparent inconsistency or reject the guilty plea.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>44 M.J. at 498 (citing UCMJ art. 45(a) and R.C.M. 910(h)(2)). In general, if the accused raises a matter inconsistent with his guilty plea, the military judge should make a further factual inquiry to resolve the matter. <em>See United States v. Jemmings, </em>1 M.J. 414 (C.M.A.1976). Furthermore, when such inconsistent matters \u201creasonably raise[] the question of a defense ... it [is] incumbent upon the military judge to make a more searching inquiry to determine the accused\u2019s position on the apparent inconsistency with his plea of guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmins, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 475, 479, 45 C.M.R. 249, 253, 1972 WL 14168 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">The military justice system presumes that all soldiers are sane and competent and, therefore, responsible for their actions. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 909(a) and (b) (capacity to stand trial); R.C.M. 916(k)(l) and (k)(3)(A) (affirmative defense of lack of mental responsibility at time of offense); R.C.M. 1203(c)(5) (capacity to understand or cooperate intelligently in appellate proceedings). Although an appellant has the burden of proving lack of mental responsibility for his offenses or lack of mental capacity to stand trial, the standard of proof for each differs. First, the defense bears the burden of proving, by <em>clear and convincing evidence, </em>that an accused was unable to appreciate the nature and quality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>or the wrongfulness of his offenses, <em>at the time he committed them, </em>because he suffered from a severe mental disease or defect, i.e., he lacked mental responsibility at the time of his crimes. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 50a(b), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 850a(b); R.C.M. 916(k)(l) and (k)(3)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, the defense bears the burden of proving, by a <em>preponderance of the evidence, </em>that an accused was suffering from a severe mental disease or defect <em>at trial </em>which rendered him unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to cooperate intelligently in the defense of his case, i.e., he lacked the mental capacity to participate in his court-martial. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 909(e)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Third, the defense also bears the burden of proving, by a <em>preponderance of the evidence, </em>that an appellant is suffering from a severe mental disease or defect <em>at the time of his appeal </em>which renders him unable to understand and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the appellate proceedings, i.e., he lacks the mental capacity to appeal his convictions. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 1203(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Our superior court has also recognized certain responsibilities borne by the convening authority, military judge, and the parties. In <em>United States v. Best, </em>61 M.J. 376 (C.A.A.F. 2005), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">We have emphasized the responsibility of the convening authority and the military judge to order a sanity board when required, as well as the duty of all participants in the process to bring to the attention of the convening authority or military judge any condition or behavior that may reasonably call into question the mental responsibility or competence of an accused. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>60 M.J. 261 (C.A.A.F.2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">If a question arises regarding the mental responsibility of an accused, R.C.M. 916(k)(3)(B) requires the military judge to either \u201corder [a R.C.M. 706 inquiry into the mental capacity or mental responsibility of the accused,] or satisfy himself that the defense team has fully evaluated the possibility of the affirmative defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Sims, </em>33 M.J. 684, 686 (A.C.M.R.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Appellate defense counsel now assert that, based upon appellant\u2019s remarks during his unsworn statement, \u201cthe military judge should have inquired of the trial defense counsel whether he had determined if any mental [health] issues existed or if there was a history of mental illness.\u201d Furthermore, they contend that after such an inquiry, \u201ca sanity board would surely have been ordered at the time of trial\u201d by the military judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">We recognize that sometimes remarks made in an unsworn statement should indicate to a military judge that an accused may have a defense of lack of mental responsibility (or insanity) and warrant further inquiry. In <em>Sims, </em>for example, we held that the military judge should not have accepted a guilty plea when the accused \u201cexplained in an unsworn statement that he had a friend named Corporal Myers that no one else could see or hear,\u201d heard voices he did not \u201chave any control over,\u201d and was not aware of what he was doing when he took another soldier\u2019s money. <em>Id. </em>at 685-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">But we must review the military judge\u2019s decision to accept appellant\u2019s guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Eberle, </em>44 M.J. at 375. Appellant did not raise matters in his unsworn statement concerning his mental state that were inconsistent with his pleas of guilty to AWOL and wrongful use of controlled substances. Having examined appellant\u2019s entire unsworn statement, we see noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ing that should have indicated to the military judge that appellant might have had a defense based on lack of mental responsibility. Appellant\u2019s unsworn statement merely expresses a strong religious sentiment, remorse at having done wrong, and gratitude for forgiveness. We do not conclude that the military judge should have suspected mental illness or a mental responsibility defense based upon these comments. Moreover, the military judge cannot be expected to reject a guilty plea \u201con the mere possibility of a defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>56 M.J. 523, 533 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2001) (upholding a guilty plea to attempted murder after concluding appellant\u2019s unsworn statement, \u201cthat he \u2018snapped\u2019 prior to attempting to smother his son[, did] not raise a mental responsibility defense or substantially conflict with the pleas\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>56 M.J. 467 (C.A.A.F.2002) (summary disposition). Therefore, we conclude the military judge did not abuse his discretion by failing to inquire further.</p>\n<p id=\"AfU\">\n<em>Whether this Court Should Conclude Appellant\u2019s Pleas Were Improvident Based on the Sanity Boards\u2019 Reports</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Unlike the military judge, this court has before it three sanity board reports. In deciding whether appellant\u2019s pleas may have been improvident, based on his mental condition either when he committed the offenses or at trial, we may consider these reports even though appellant did not raise the issue of mental responsibility at trial. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>27 M.J. 371, 374 (C.M.A. 1989); <em>see also United States v. Murphy, </em>50 M.J. 4, 15 (C.A.A.F.1998) (\u201c[W]hen not restrained by the 2-year limitation of Article 73, we have given preferential treatment to the question of mental responsibility when raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Furthermore, if appellant\u2019s mental condition constituted a \u201csevere mental disease or defect\u201d at the time of the offense that caused him to be \u201cunable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness\u201d of his acts, appellant may have had an affirmative defense. R.C.M. 916(k)(l); <em>see Thompson v. United States, </em>60 M.J. 880, 884 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">However, as our superior court has directed, \u201cunless the results of the sanity board give reason to believe that at a rehearing the factfinder would be persuaded to accept the accused\u2019s affirmative defense [of a lack of mental responsibility], there is no occasion to order a rehearing.\u201d <em>Massey, </em>27 M.J. at 374. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces \u201chas made plain that to constitute reversible error, the existence or outcome of a sanity board must have had a substantive effect on the trial.\u201d <em>Best, </em>61 M.J. at 382-83. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">to prevail on appeal an accused must convince an appellate court that a \u201cdifferent verdict might reasonably result\u201d if the trier of fact had evidence of a lack of mental responsibility that was not available for consideration at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 383 (quoting <em>United States v. Breese, </em>47 M.J. 5, 6 (C.A.A.F.1997)). We hold this threshold has not been crossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">The first sanity board is the only board that specifically addressed the question of whether, at the time of his criminal conduct, appellant was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his conduct as a result of his mental disease or defect. The first sanity board is also the only board that specifically addressed the question of whether, at the time of his trial, appellant was unable to understand the nature of the proceeding or unable to cooperate intelligently in his defense as a result of his mental disease and defect. Significantly, the first sanity board answered both of these questions in the negative. These conclusions strongly suggest that if we were to remand this case for a rehearing, the factfinder would not accept appellant\u2019s defense of lack of mental responsibility based upon the first sanity board\u2019s clinical psychiatric diagnosis of \u201cCannabis Abuse\u201d at the time of appellant\u2019s offenses. <em>See Thompson, </em>60 M.J. at 884 (similarly concluding that although the accused established he was incompetent at the time of appeal, he failed to demonstrate he lacked mental responsibility at the time of his criminal conduct or mental competency at the time of trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">The second and third sanity board reports do not directly contradict, or report anything inconsistent with, the first board\u2019s assessment. The first board found appellant pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>dominantly suffered from \u201cCannabis Abuse\u201d at the time he committed the charged offenses (December 2001 through May 2002), and with \u201cCannabis Dependence\u201d at the time the board convened in March 2004. The first sanity board found appellant mentally responsible for his offenses and capable of participating in his court-martial that had occurred twenty months earlier. It was not until December 2004, nine months after the first sanity board\u2019s diagnoses and twenty-nine months after appellant\u2019s August 2002 court-martial, that the second sanity board found appellant was currently suffering from \u201cSchizophrenia, Paranoid Type\u201d and \u201cPoly-substance Dependence.\u201d In February 2005, the third sanity board made the same findings. Although the second and third boards concluded appellant was competent to understand the appellate process and participate in the proceedings, they made no conclusions concerning appellant\u2019s mental responsibility at the time of his offenses or his mental capacity at trial, nor did they find appellant\u2019s schizophrenia or polysubstance dependence existed at the time of the offenses or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The third sanity board further found, as did the second, that the only personality disorders appellant exhibited which were \u201cof relatively longstanding duration\u201d were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL-\">mixed personality traits and ego defense mechanisms ... an obsessive style of thinking ... compulsive behavior ... impulsivity ... lack of concern ... [and] behavior [that is] often inflexible [and] perseverative____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Contrary to the defense assertion, we are not persuaded these additional findings equate to a determination that appellant lacked mental responsibility at the time he committed his offenses. Nor are we persuaded that at a rehearing a finder of fact would be convinced these additional findings translate directly into a successful defense of lack of mental responsibility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">In this situation, as appellant argues, these reports <em>may raise the possibility </em>that a subsequent finder of fact might conclude appellant\u2019s mental condition had \u201can impact on, and perhaps was a major contributing factor to, his criminal conduct.\u201d But that is not the standard for ordering a rehearing under <em>Massey. As </em>noted above, the standard is whether these sanity board reports \u201cgive reason to believe that at a rehearing the factfinder would be persuaded to accept the accused\u2019s affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Massey, </em>27 M.J. at 374. In view of the specific findings of the first sanity board, that standard has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Our superior court specifically rejected an alternative lower standard that would allow a rehearing merely \u201cif the sanity inquiry should <em>\u2018cast doubt upon\u2019 </em>the accused\u2019s \u2018mental responsibility when [he] committed] the offenses.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Massey, </em>26 M.J. 671, 673 (A.F.C.M.R.1988)). That is all that has occurred here, and it is not enough. As our superior court\u2019s prescribed standard in <em>Massey </em>clearly reflects, there is a. balance between the policy of giving an accused every possibility to present a defense and the competing policies of efficiency of litigation and finality of judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we find appellant possessed the requisite mental responsibility and capacity when he committed his offenses, at trial, and during the appellate process. Moreover, appellant said nothing inconsistent during the providence inquiry or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>in his unsworn statement to render his pleas improvident.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">IMPROVIDENT PLEA TO AWOL SPECIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Appellant pleaded guilty to, and was found guilty of, unauthorized absence from his unit, to wit: A Company, 51st Signal Battalion (Airborne), Fort Bragg, North Carolina, located at Building H-6308, from on or about Friday, 7 June 2002 until on or about Tuesday, 11 June 2002 (Specification 2 of Charge I), in violation of Article 86, UCMJ. During the providence inquiry, he told the military judge that, during his four-day absence, he slept late in the unit barracks located at Building H-5412, missed several formations, and wandered around post (going to the mess hall and shoppette) without reporting to his unit. The stipulation of fact, agreed to by both parties and admitted into evidence, merely restates the specification without providing any factual description of the offense. Appellant admitted he understood the elements and definitions of the offense as the military judge explained to him, and that, taken together, they accurately described what he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">At trial, the following colloquy ensued between the military judge and appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">MJ: Where were you supposed to be on 7 June?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">ACC: Reporting to formations, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">MJ: And where did you go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">ACC: I didn\u2019t go anywhere, Your Honor.

A providence inquiry into a guilty plea must establish that the accused believes and admits he is guilty of the offense and that the factual circumstances admitted by the accused objectively support the guilty plea. <em>Garcia, </em>44 M.J. at 497-98 (citing <em>Higgins, </em>40 M.J. at 68). However, unsupported \u201cconclusions of law recited by an accused are insufficient to provide a factual basis for a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Outhier, </em>45 M.J. 326, 331 (C.A.A.F.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Terry, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 442, 45 C.M.R. 216, 1972 WL 14158 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">Article 86(3), UCMJ, provides, \u201cAny member of the armed forces who, without authority ... absents himself or remains absent from his unit, organization, or place of duty at which he is required to be at the time prescribed; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\u201d The elements of this offense are: -</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-22\">(a) That the accused absented himself or herself from his or her unit, organization, or place of duty at which he or she was required to be;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-23\">(b) That the absence was without authority from anyone competent to give him or her leave; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-24\">(c) That the absence was for a certain period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-25\"><em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) [hereinafter <em>MCM, </em>2002], Part IV, para. 10b(3). An \u201c[unauthorized absence under Article 86(3) is an instantaneous offense. It is complete at the instant an accused absents himself or herself without authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Part IV, para. 10c(8). The duration of the absence is not an essential element of the offense but constitutes a matter in aggravation for purposes of determining the authorized maximum punishment. <em>See id. </em>at Part IV, paras. 10e(4) and 10c(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-26\">Appellate defense counsel now assert appellant\u2019s guilty plea to AWOL from 7 June 2002 to 11 June 2002 was improvident because appellant did not admit during the plea inquiry that he was \u201cever absent from his unit.\u201d Appellate government counsel agree the plea inquiry does not support the offense of AWOL (in violation of Article 86(3), UCMJ) but urge us to affirm the closely-related offense of failure to go to an appointed place of duty (in violation of Article 86(1), UCMJ). We decline to accept the government concession and find appellant\u2019s plea provident to the offense as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>We base our decision, in part, upon principles found in <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>36 M.J. 645 (A.C.M.R.1992). In <em>Vaughn, </em>Private (PVT) Vaughn pleaded guilty to being AWOL from his unit for approximately twenty days. He told the military judge he was supposed to have been at an accountability formation and did not report in order to avoid going to a field exercise. Instead, PVT Vaughn stayed in his barracks room: Our court found that although PVT Vaughn \u201cremained in his room and in the unit area,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 647, he was AWOL from his unit because his fellow soldiers were \u201cin the field participating in ... an exercise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648. Furthermore, we found PVT Vaughn\u2019s mere casual presence in the barracks was not inconsistent with his plea of guilty to AWOL for the period charged. <em>Id.; cf. United States v. LaCaze, </em>2 C.M.R. 443, 1952 WL 1755 (A.B.R.1952) (affirming desertion conviction for quitting organization with intent to avoid hazardous duty where soldier absented himself from his unit\u2019s forward combat area and remained in his tent near unit rear command post).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Appellate defense counsel argue appellant was not absent from his unit because he remained in the unit barracks.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the essence of appellant\u2019s offense was that he was not present with his fellow soldiers, i.e., his \u201cunit,\u201d performing military duties during the work day. During the providence inquiry, appellant admitted he missed all formations on Friday, 7 June 2002, did not go to work all day, and stayed in his barracks room until he returned to duty on Tuesday, 11 June 2002. Appellant admitted his unit was performing military duties without him, and he understood he was supposed to be working with the unit but was busy \u201cgoofing off\u2019 in the barracks. Although unsure of what his unit was actually doing, appellant stated his unit was working, and he \u201ccould have been doing something constructive at the unit\u201d had he not been absent and in the barracks. When the military judge asked appellant whether he intentionally avoided going to the unit to work, appellant answered affirmatively. Appellant stated he purposely missed formations and did not let anyone in his chain of command know he was in his barracks room available to perform any assigned duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Appellant\u2019s agreement that his barracks building is located \u201cwhere the unit is also\u201d is of no consequence. Appellant was charged with an unauthorized absence from his unit located at building H-6308, and admitted he remained in the barracks at building H-5412, or elsewhere,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from Friday until Tuesday. In all likelihood, these buildings were collocated, and appellant admitted the unit was not in the barracks building. Nevertheless, the building where a unit is normally located may not be the unit\u2019s physical location. For example, if a unit is in formation behind the post theater, or conducting training at a confidence course, or participating in a field exercise at a staging area, the unit location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u2022will be any of these particular places, not its headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">A unit is comprised of soldiers, not buildings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is irrelevant that a soldier\u2019s barracks room happens to be within the \u201ccompany area\u201d or under unit control. Under the defense \u201ccompany area\u201d theory, a soldier required to live in the barracks could remain there, forego engaging in military duties with his fellow soldiers, and yet not be considered absent from his unit. But if the same soldier resided in off-post housing, he would be guilty of an unauthorized absence <em>from </em>his unit by staying at home. We reject this \u201ccompany area\u201d theory and find the military judge properly accepted appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to AWOL for the period charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">We have considered the matters personally asserted by appellant pursuant to <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A. 1982), and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Judge ZOLPER and Judge WALBURN concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\">. The drug 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine is also known as ecstasy, a popular drug of abuse among adolescents and young adults because of its combination of hallucinogenic and stimulant effects. <em>See DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] Briefs &amp; Background, Drugs and Drug Abuse, Drug Descriptions, at </em>http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/ concern/mdma/mdma.html (last visited 20 Oct. 2005).

Rule for Courts-Martial 706 authorizes an inquiry to determ\u00edne: (1) whether a soldier was mentally responsible for his offenses at the time he committed them, and/or (2) whether a soldier has the mental capacity, at trial, to understand the nature of the court-martial proceedings against him and to cooperate intelligently in his own defense. The procedures set forth in R.C.M. 706 apply to inquiries before and during trial, and to inquiries after trial proceedings have ended when a question arises concerning a soldier\u2019s mental capacity to understand and cooperate intelligently in the court-martial appeal process.</p>\n<p id=\"AY6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>See </em>R.C.M. 909(c); R.C.M. 916(k)(l) discussion; R.C.M. 1203(c)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. In its report, the third sanity board noted that \"around mid-December 2004, [appellant] left Fort Knox without authorization to return home, ultimately resulting in his hospitalization ____\u201d We will not consider this statement for any purpose during our review of appellant's case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\">. Generally, once the affirmative defenses listed in R.C.M. 916 are raised by the evidence at trial, the government bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the particular defense is not valid or has not been proven in a particular case. However, for the R.C.M. 916(k) affirmative defense of lack of mental responsibility at the time of the offense, there is no shift in burden and the defense bears the burden of proving each element of this defense by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b651-14\">. Unlike the affirmative defense of lack of mental responsibility at the time of the offense, R.C.M. 909 addresses a soldier's mental capacity to stand trial by court-martial. Lack of mental capacity is a procedural defense which prevents or postpones the trial until the accused recovers from his mental disease or defect and can understand and cooperate in his own defense. The defense also bears the burden of proving this procedural defense, but by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\">. The first sanity board found appellant exhibited general \"Occupational Problems, Problems related to interaction with legal system/crime.\u201d The second and third sanity boards elaborated, and found appellant currently suffered from \"psychosocial and environmental problems ... of a longstanding duration, i.e., months prior to and including his violations under [the] UCMJ.\u201d Appellate defense counsel assert the statement, that appellant's \u201cthought and substance use disorder came to [override] his appreciation of right and wrong\u201d is tantamount to the second and third boards finding appellant lacked mental responsibility at the time of his offenses. We disagree. Reading this clause in context with the larger paragraph from which it was extracted, the third sanity board appears to be commenting on an unauthorized absence. Although the comment refers to appellant \"again departing Fort Bragg,\u201d we do not find the comment refers to appellant\u2019s second charged AWOL offense. Appellant told the military judge during the providence inquiry he never left Fort Bragg during the period 7 June 2002 through 11 June 2002, his second period of absence. The referenced unauthorized absence may relate to conduct for which appellant was not charged and which occurred during an unknown time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b656-5\">. Appellate defense counsel rely upon our sister court's position in <em>United States v. Skoff, </em>1990 CMR LEXIS 1008 (N.M.C.M.R. 2 Oct. 1990) (unpub.). <em>See United States v.

We decline to take our sister court\u2019s position that ownership or control of a barracks building is the determining factor in whether a soldier is absent from his unit while remaining in those barracks. <em>Id. </em>at 586-87 (\"The question is not simply whether an accused, who is charged with absence from his unit, is assigned to a tenant activity or the host installation when he or she remains in the barracks rather than reporting for or remaining on duty.

In some cases, such conduct may constitute a failure to report for duty under Article 86(1), UCMJ. In this case, however, even if we found appellant\u2019s plea improvident under Article 86(3), UCMJ, we would not find appellant guilty of the closely-related offense of failure to go to an appointed place of duty under Article 86(1), UCMJ, because the record lacks sufficient evidence that \"a certain authority appointed a certain time and place of duty\u201d for appellant. <em>MCM, </em>2002, Part IV, para. 10(b)(1); <em>see United States v.
