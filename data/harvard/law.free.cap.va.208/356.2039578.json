The jury found him guilty of the offense and fixed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>punishment at confinement in the State penitentiary for a period of twenty years. On August 18, 1966, judgment was entered in accordance with the verdict. We granted Burnley a writ of error to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In his assignments of error relied upon, defendant contends that the trial court erred (1) \u201cin admitting the confessions, oral and written,\u201d given by him to police officers and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, and (2) in refusing to permit him to question the prosecutrix \u201ceither on cross-examination or when called as his own witness, as to her unchastity prior to the alleged offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The record discloses that the rape occurred about 3 a.m. on the morning of March 19, 1966. The prosecutrix was 20 years old, married, but separated from her husband. She was residing with her parents on Fifth street in Charlottesville at the time. After returning home from work on March 18, the prosecutrix decided to walk \u201cdown town\u201d. She arrived at \u201cCozy Kitchen\u201d about 9:45 p.m. and drank a \u201ccouple of beers\u201d. Robert Walker, whom she had known for ten years, was there and the two went to \u201cMonticello Lunch\u201d and \u201cdrank a beer\u201d. Walker purchased some beer \u201cto go\u201d and at about midnight they proceeded to the playground at McGuffy School. While there Walker drank two beers and the prosecutrix consumed \u201cabout half of one\u201d. Because she would not have sexual relations with him Walker got mad and they parted company.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The prosecutrix then went to the \u201cWaffle Shop\u201d. After eating a hamburger and drinking some coffee, she walked down Fifth street towards home. When the prosecutrix reached a point approximately in front of \u201cBell\u2019s store\u201d, she was \u201cgrabbed\u201d from behind and \u201cdragged\u201d down an alley to the yard in the rear of the store by a then unknown assailant. She subsequently identified him as Burnley, the defendant, age 23, who was about six feet seven inches tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The prosecutrix testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">\u201cWe were wrestling and everything else, and I was still screaming at the time. He kept threatening me. I was on the ground at the time and he was\u2014my clothes, he was trying to take them off and I was still fighting with him. So finally he did get them off and he got on me and\u2014sitting on my legs at first. Every time I\u2019d get up, he\u2019d knock me back down, knock my head against the ground. He tried to get his mouth over mine, and he did, he kept getting his mouth over mine so I couldn\u2019t scream. I was still fighting and trying to get him off of me, laying on the ground. He did get on me. He pulled my pants down, off my left leg.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The prosecutrix further testified that during the struggle she struck defendant on the head with a rock which she had picked up as they entered the yard; and that he was successful in penetrating her but he did not reach a climax.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">After the attack, defendant instructed the victim to put on her clothes, which she did. He then led her out of the alley towards Fifth street. The prosecutrix had lost her eyeglasses during the struggle and she informed defendant of this fact. As they reached the entrance to the alley, a man was heard coming out of a house across the alley. The defendant at first \u201cjumped\u201d, but when he recognized that it was Melvin Flannagan, he told Flannagan that \u201cif he found any glasses to save them for him.\u201d The prosecutrix said that she was \u201cscared\u201d to say anything to Flannagan, because she thought \u201che might come and try the same thing Burnley\u2019d done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Following Flannagan\u2019s departure, the prosecutrix told defendant that she wanted .her glasses. When he went down the alley to look for them she ran home, which was nearby. It was then about 4 a.m. The prosecutrix told her mother that she was late because \u201ca boy was chasing me.\u201d She said that she did not tell her mother or the police of the attack because \u201cI was scared to\u201d, and that she went to bed but was unable to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Around 12:00 noon on the same day, the prosecutrix told her sister-in-law of the attack. Following this disclosure, the prosecutrix\u2019s brother reported the incident to the police department. Police officers interrogated the prosecutrix and accompanied her to the scene of the crime. J. T. Cambios, Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, was informed of the attack because he had requested that he be \u201ccalled in case of a serious felony.\u201d He went to the police station and discussed the matter with the prosecutrix. Late that night, March 19, she was taken to the University of Virginia Hospital, where she was examined by Dr. Arthur Garst, Jr. He observed \u201cseveral abrasions and scratches on her left hip extending down the left leg to the knee\u201d and also small scratches on her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">As a result of this examination and of an investigation by the police, a warrant was issued charging Burnley with attempted rape. He was arrested around 3 a.m. on March 20, and brought to the Charlottesville police station. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney was notified of Burnley\u2019s apprehension and proceeded immediately to the police station. Cambios testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">\u201cWe took him into the detective room which is a little room just as you go into the court room there. I explained to him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>he didn\u2019t have to talk to us and that he had a right to have a lawyer. That he had a right to remain silent and didn\u2019t have to talk to us and that anything that he would say could be used against him. He appeared quite willing to talk. He said that he didn\u2019t have anything at all to hide. He said that he hadn\u2019t done anything. He was perfectly willing to talk with us because he hadn\u2019t done anything and that he didn\u2019t need a lawyer, and didn\u2019t want one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The defendant, who had a knot on his head \u201cabout the size of a small hen egg\u201d, then stated that on the night before the alleged offense he had attended a dance with his mother and several other persons; that he left the dance at three or four o\u2019clock the following morning with the same persons; that he went straight home and to bed, and that he wasn\u2019t on Fifth street and \u201ccould prove it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Cambios and Lieutenant Morris proceeded to the home of defendant\u2019s mother and she corroborated defendant\u2019s statement with the exception \u201cthat they had come right up Fifth Street.\u201d An unsuccessful attempt was made to locate the other companions defendant named as having accompanied him to the dance. However, Melvin Flannagan was located and brought to the police station. In the presence of defendant he stated that he saw defendant with a girl on Fifth street about the time of the alleged rape, and that Burnley had inquired about lost eyeglasses. After Flannagan was \u201cexcused\u201d, Burnley stated to Cambios that Flannagan \u201cwas just lying on him because of bad blood between them\u201d; and that they \u201chad been fighting all last summer.\u201d According to Cambios, Flannagan later denied there was any bad blood between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Cambios told Burnley of the denial and asked him \u201cwhy he didn\u2019t go on and tell the truth.\u201d Burnley insisted that he was not anywhere near the scene of the crime and Cambios left the room. He returned in a few minutes and after a brief conversation, Burnley said: \u201c \u2018Can I call a lawyer?\u2019 I [Cambios] said, \u2018Yes, there is a telephone right there.\u2019 Either he or I\u2014I am not sure which\u2014I think it was he\u2014said, \u2018It is right late in the morning\u2014late at night to get a lawyer down here.\u2019 Words to that effect. If I said it; he agreed with me. If he said it; I agreed with him.\u201d Then, according to Cambios, Burnley remarked: \u201c \u2018Well, I might as well go on and tell you about it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Burnley admitted to Cambios that he did have intercourse with the prosecutrix, but that it was with her consent. Then he said that \u201cshe had not consented completely\u201d, but that on prior occasions he had gone to bed with the prosecutrix at her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Cambios testified that the total period of his interrogation was about an hour, and that there was \u201cabsolutely no doubt in his mind that he [Burnley] did understand everything that was going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">At approximately 11 a.m. on March 20, Assistant Chief of Police C. O. Durham, after learning of the oral confession, informed Burnley of his rights and requested him to give a written statement because \u201c [n] one of our memories are perfect\u201d. His. oral confession to Durham of the rape was reduced to writing by Durham. It was then signed by Burnley in the presence of two witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">On March 29, 1966, counsel was appointed to represent Burnley. A preliminary hearing was had on April 15, and the case was certified to the grand jury, which returned a true bill against defendant for the rape at its May term.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">On May 19, the case was called, the indictment was read by the clerk, and defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. The defendant had previously filed a motion to suppress the confession which was reduced to writing made by him to Officer Durham on the grounds that it was involuntarily made, and that it was obtained in violation of his right to counsel as provided by the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The court proceeded to hear evidence on the motion. After the Commonwealth had presented evidence in support of its contention that both the oral admission made to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and the written confession made to officer Durham were voluntary and admissible, counsel for defendant presented evidence of defendant\u2019s low mentality. The defendant did not testify at any time during his trial. Records and reports were introduced showing that defendant was committed to Petersburg Training School as mentally deficient on February 6, 1959, and that he was discharged on June 21, 1963 as improved. The final diagnosis was: \u201cMental retardation, moderate. Code 82, I.Q. 59\u201d; and that he \u201cfunctions very much like the twelve year old pre-adolescent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">In addition, Alexander L. Scott, principal of Jackson Burley High School, which defendant attended, testified that defendant had a poor scholastic record and stopped school on February 1, 1958; that an I.Q. test given him while a student indicated a score of 66; and that on the language portion he scored 87. He said that a person with an I.Q. of 66 is capable of understanding. However, he didn\u2019t think such a person \u201cwould be capable of a high degree of understanding with abstraction qualities but more with concrete \u2014He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>stated that as defendant grew older his grade would be lower, and that he did not consider the difference between an I.Q. of 59 and 66 of significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In overruling the motion to suppress, the trial court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201cThe case seemed very clear to me. I was very much impressed with the testimony of the principal of the Burley High School, and the score was up and that 89 [87] was not considered to be too low when it comes to language and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\u201cIf this was a case where Mr. Cambios had browbeatened (sic) or in any way violated this defendant\u2019s rights, then, there might be a difference but it seems to me that the evidence is undenied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The case was \u201ccontinued until further order\u201d, and was concluded on August 18, 1966. On that day, defendant renewed his motion to supress the oral and written confessions, relying upon the decision of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.ed. 2d 694, which had been decided since the trial court\u2019s decision of May 19, overruling the motion to suppress. In addition, counsel for defendant, with the concurrence of the Commonwealth, had the defendant examined after the former ruhng by Dr. Marvin D. White, a certified clinical psychologist; and the court was requested to permit him to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Dr. White stated that he \u201cadministered a battery of tests including an intelligence test; a test for any brain damage; two brief personality tests.\u201d He found \u201cno brain damage on the Bender test and no personality disturbance on the D.A.P. test.\u201d Dr. White testified that Burnley\u2019s I.Q. was 57, which \u201cwould fall somwhere within the lowest percentile of the population.\u201d He fixed defendant\u2019s mental age of nine years plus and thought that he was \u201chighly suggestible.\u201d However, he assumed that most persons nine years old knew the difference between right and wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The trial court observed that Burnley\u2019s trial had commenced on May 19, 1966, which was before the <em>Miranda </em>decision, and hence its mandates were not applicable. The court concluded: \u201cI think that the whole question in this confession goes to the weight of it and not the admissibility, therefore, I am going to overrule the motion to suppress the confession. I think that the weight of it is strictly a question for the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Following this ruhng, the clerk read the indictment and defendant pleaded not guilty as was done on May 19, 1966. A jury was impaneled, and at the conclusion of all the evid\u00e9nce, which included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the oral and written confessions, returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">[1] The defendant, in his first assignment of error, claims that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence the confessions, oral and written, given by him to police officers and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney. He argues that the confessions should not have been admitted because he was not warned prior to interrogation of his right to have counsel appointed if he could not afford one, and that he was incapable of knowingly and intelligently waiving such right prior to his confessions. Defendant relies upon <em>Miranda </em>v. Arizona, <em>supra, </em>which holds, <em>inter alia, </em>that evidence obtained from a person in custody as a result of interrogation cannot be used against him unless he was warned prior to interrogation \u201cthat he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d 384 U.S. at p. 479, 86 S.Ct. at p. 1630, 16 L.ed. 2d at p. 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The defendant argues further that the procedural safeguards of <em>Miranda </em>are applicable to his case by virtue of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.ed. 2d 882. This case held that the procedural safeguards set forth in <em>Miranda </em>are applicable \u201conly to persons whose trials had not begun as of June 13, 1966.\u201d 384 U.S. at p. 734, 86 S.Ct. at p. 1781, 16 L.ed. 2d at p. 893. It is defendant\u2019s contention that his trial began on August 18, 1966, and therefore <em>Miranda </em>is applicable. We do not agree. The record shows that on May 19, 1966, the defendant was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty. The court then proceeded to hear evidence and argument on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the confessions. After overruling the motion, the case was continued and the trial proceeded to a conclusion on August 18. It is true that on that date defendant was again arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty. However, it was unnecessary to repeat the arraignment of defendant or the entry of a plea. The arraignment and the plea on May 19 formed an issue to be tried. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>112 Fed. Rep. 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">This brings us to the question of what constitutes the beginning of a trial in a criminal case. In <em>Gilligan\u2019s Case, </em>99 Va. 816, 827, 37 S.E. 962, 965 this court stated: \u201cThe trial of a criminal case begins with the arraignment of the prisoner, and ends with the sentence pronounced upon him by the court.\u201d Thus, when defendant was arraigned on May 19, 1966, his trial began, and <em>Miranda </em>is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>At the time defendant\u2019s trial began, the test for admissibility of a confession was whether or not it was voluntarily made. The trial court ruled under the evidence adduced that the confessions in question were voluntary and we cannot say, as a matter of law, that they were involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">[2] The defendant also contends that the court erred in refusing to permit him to question the prosecutrix, \u201ceither on cross-examination or as his own witness, as to her unchastity prior to the alleged offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The Commonwealth presented no evidence as to the chastity or unchastity of the prosecutrix. On re-cross-examination of the prosecutrix, counsel for defendant attempted to interrogate her as to what sexual activities she had had with men other than her husband. The court sustained the objection of the Commonwealth on the ground that it was not a proper question on cross-examination. Later, defendant called the prosecutrix as his own witness. Counsel for defendant stated to the court, out of the presence of the jury, that he desired to ask her whether prior to March 19, 1966, she had had relations with men other than her husband. The court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The defendant argues that this was proper evidence as consent was his only defense. He points out that Dr. White, his witness, testified that he [defendant] admitted having intercourse with the prosecutrix but that it was with her consent. Defendant cites 1 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 200, p. 683 (3d ed. 1940) and cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that particular acts of unchastity may be resorted to for the purpose of showing the probability of consent. Wigmore states that the better view is to admit such evidence, but \u201c [n] o question of evidence has been more controverted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The record does not show what the prosecutrix\u2019s answer would have been to the excluded question. Counsel did not vouch for the record, nor did he offer any evidence as to the prosecutrix\u2019s general reputation. Where consent is a defense to a charge of rape, the previous unchaste character of the prosecutrix may be shown by proof of general reputation. <em>Fry </em>v. Commonwealth, 163 Va. 1085, 1088, 177 S.E. 860, 862; <em>Powell </em>v. Commonwealth, 179 Va. 703, 709, 20 S.E. 2d 536, 538. General reputation cannot be established by the person himself under inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">In <em>Fry </em>v. Commonwealth, 82 Va. 334, 336, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-10\">\u201cThe fourth exception is as to the refusal of the court to allow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>injured female to be asked if she had not been before a person of unchaste character. This question was properly excluded. The plaintiff [in error] would not have had the right to assault and ravish the said prosecutrix if such had been the case; and if it had been so, the plaintiff in error could have proved, if able to do so, by others, which he attempted to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">If a prosecutrix, in a trial on an indictment for rape may not be cross-examined as to her previous unchaste character, reason and logic dictate that she may not be called as a witness for defendant to testify accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">We hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to permit defendant to question the prosecutrix as to her unchastity prior to the alleged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
