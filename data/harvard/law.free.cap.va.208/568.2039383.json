Hosey, sometimes referred to herein as claimant, was an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of her employment by Reserve Life Insurance Company, herein referred to as defendant, so as to be compensable. Code of Virginia, \u00a7 65-7, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Hearing Commissioner Evans, of the Industrial Commission, found that the evidence failed to disclose an accident arising out of claimant\u2019s employment and dismissed her claim. On review by the full Commission, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65-93, 1966 Cum. Supp., a majority found that the claimant\u2019s injury was by accident arising out of and in the course of her employment, and awarded her weekly payments for periods stated \u201con account of total incapacity for work\u201d. Commissioner Evans dissented. The employer and its insurance carrier have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The pertinent evidence, which was without contradiction, consisted of the testimony of the claimant and the reports of two doctors. The claimant, Mrs. Hosey, forty-three years old, testified, and the Commission found, that on August 5, 1965, in the course of her employment by defendant, Mrs. Hosey was making a door-to-door survey in the town of Woodstock to find out whether the people were interested in hospital insurance. She was going up the steps to one of the homes and when she made the final step, she said, \u201cit was just like my knee had caught and then it just snapped just like a bone had broken in it\u201d and she felt a sharp, severe pain. These were rock steps that she was ascending, on the corner of a street and \u201cthey were just a little bit higher than usual for a step.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">This was around 4 p.m. on a very hot day and she had nothing in her hand except some papers as she went up the steps. She did not know, she said, what caused her knee to twist or turn \u201cbecause it had never happened before.\u201d She had worked at all kinds of jobs, \u201cand I have never had nothing like that happen at any other time.\u201d She reported the matter that evening to defendant\u2019s branch supervisor, who later filled out an accident report.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Mrs. Hosey was first treated by Dr? Jeanette M. Jarman on August 8, 1965, three days after the injury, who put her to bed in a hospital and next day sent her to another hospital in Clifton Forge. Dr. Jar-man reported that claimant had severe pain in her knee, which was swollen, and that she believed the cartilage in the knee was ruptured. In a later report she described claimant\u2019s injury as \u201cTraumatic synovitis of the left knee with possible tear of medial meniscus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">In answer to questions on a written form as to whether the \u201caccident above referred to\u201d was the only cause of claimant\u2019s condition, Dr. Jarman replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and that claimant was not suffering from any other condition \u201cnot due to this accident\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Dr. R. P. Hawkins, Jr., to whom claimant was referred by Dr. Jarman, examined claimant in the Clifton Forge hospital on August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>9, 1965, and reported that claimant\u2019s injury was \u201cTraumatic synovitis of left knee,\u201d and made the same answer as Dr. Jarman that the \u201caccident\u201d was the only cause of claimant\u2019s condition, and that she was not suffering from \u201cany other disabling condition not due to this accident\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">After about a week in the hospital, claimant made several attempts to continue work but eventually had to give it up and an operation was performed on her knee. She was in the hospital for seven weeks on that occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">[1] Defendant contends, first, that claimant\u2019s injury was not an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 65-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In its opinion, by Commissioner Harwood, the Commission stated: \u201cBoth Dr. Jarman and Dr. Hawkins,, in their reports, causally related the disabling condition to the work activity of ascending the steps in the course of the employment.\u201d And, further, \u201cTo ascertain the mechanism or cause of injury we look to the medical evidence, and here we find the uncontradicted opinions that the work activity was the producing cause of injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Defendant contends that the record does not support these statements. While the doctors\u2019 reports do not specifically spell out in so many words that claimant\u2019s work activity was the producing cause of the injury, their responses to the questions asked on the forms made it very plain that such was their opinion. Both doctors stated that \u201cthe accident\u201d was the only cause of claimant\u2019s condition and that they found no other cause. We find nothing to require rejection of the statement in the majority opinion of the Commission that \u201cThe mechanism of injury reported by Dr. Jarman and Dr. Hawkins is medically credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Both doctors, as noted, found that the claimant\u2019s injury consisted of a traumatic synovitis of the left knee. Dr. Hawkins added that \u201cA medial meniscus cannot be excluded.\u201d Dr. Jarman added \u201cwith possible tear of medial meniscus.\u201d These terms indicate that the knee injury was caused by external force.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">Whether an injury is the result of an accident does not depend on whether the same injury might happen to others. We have in a number of cases defined the word \u201caccident\u201d. As long ago as 1927, in <em>Newsoms </em>v. <em>Commercial Casualty Ins., Co., </em>147 Va. 471, 474, 137 S.E. 456, 457, we accepted this definition given by Vance on Insurance: \u201c \u2018The definition of accident generally assented to is an event happening without any human agency, or, if happening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>through human agency, an event which, under the circumstances, is unusual and not expected by the person to whom it happens.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">That definition was approved in <em>Big Jack Overall Co. </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>161 Va. 446, 451-2, 171 S.E. 686, 690, in which a woman apparently in normal health attempted to lift a bundle of clothes from a low truck and injured her back. She said something \u201ctore in two in my back like it snapped in two.\u201d This was held to be an \u201cinjury by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The same definition was approved in <em>Hall\u2019s Bakery </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>176 Va. 346, 349, 11 S.E.2d 582, 583, with this addition: \u201c \u2018Where the effect was not the natural and probable consequence of the means employed, and was not intended or designed, the injury resulting was produced by accidental means.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The same definition with the addition was used in <em>Derby </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>188 Va. 336, 342, 49 S.E.2d 417, 421, in which it was held that a hernia suffered by an employee while lifting a loading table was an injury by accident. It was said: \u201cTo constitute an injury by accident it is not necessary that there must be a \u2018fall, slip or other fortuitous circumstance\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">In <em>Virginia Electric, Etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Quann, </em>197 Va. 9, 12, 87 S.E.2d 624, 626, the Vance definition was again approved and it was said that this meaning of the phrase \u201cinjury by accident\u201d has been approved or cited with approval in eleven Virginia cases, which are listed on page 13 of 197 Va. and page 626 of 87 S.E.2d.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The evidence measured by these rules establishes that the injury suffered by the claimant resulted from an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">[2] Defendant admits that if there was an injury by accident it occurred in the course of claimant\u2019s employment, but it contends, next, that it did not \u201carise out of the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">In <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Bragg, </em>203 Va. 204, 208, 123 S.E.2d 393, 396, we said that the expressions \u201c \u2018arising out of\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018in the course of\u2019 \u201d are used (in Code \u00a7 65-7) conjunctively and are not synonymous; that both conditions must be present before compensation can be awarded, and that the words \u201c \u2018arising out of\u2019 \u201d have been construed by us to refer to the \u201corigin or cause of the injury\u201d. We there again approved the \u201cdefinition and test\u201d stated in <em>In re McNicol, </em>215 Mass. 497, 102 N.E. 697, L.R.A. 1916A 306, that an injury arises out of the employment \u201cwhen there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>In the <em>Conner </em>case, <em>supra, </em>compensation was denied because, as stated in <em>Immer and Company </em>v. <em>Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. 720, 726, 152 S.E.2d 254, 258, \u201cThe employee was injured in a place where he was not reasonably expected to be while engaged in an activity not incidental to his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">And,, as further stated in the latter case, \u201cthe court [in Conner] in no way intended to depart from it unbroken line of holdings that a showing of causal connection is sufficient to establish that an injury arises out of the employment.\u201d 207 Va. at 726, 152 S.E.2d at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">We said in <em>Southern Motor Lines </em>v. <em>Alvis, </em>200 Va. 168, 170, 171, 104 S.E.2d 735, 738: \u201cA risk is incidental to the employment when it belongs to or is connected with what the employee has to do in fulfilling his contract of service.\u201d And, further:</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">\u201cIt is generally held that the phrase \u2018arising out of\u2019 the employment should receive a liberal construction in order to effectuate the humane and beneficent purposes of the Act. <em>* </em>*\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">In the present case the Commission found that Mrs. Hosey was disabled \u201cas the result of a left knee injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d. This finding may not be disturbed if it be sustained by credible evidence. Code 1950, \u00a7 65-94; <em>Island Creek Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>201 Va. 645, 648, 112 S.E.2d 833, 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">The evidence presented was credible, was not in fact contradicted, and was sufficient to sustain the award. The award is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-21\">\u00a7 65-7. Injury defined.\u2014Unless the context otherwise requires, \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury\u201d mean only injury by accident, or occupational disease as hereinafter defined, arising out of and in the course of the employment and do not include a disease in any form, except when it results naturally and unavoidably from either of the foregoing causes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
