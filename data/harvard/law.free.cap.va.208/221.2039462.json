Jennings made a gift of certain assets on which the State of Virginia assessed and collected a gift tax. These assets were included in her estate for death tax purposes because the gift was found to have been made in contemplation of death. Mrs. Jennings\u2019s Administrators c.t.a. claimed a credit against the Virginia death tax in the amount of the gift tax previously paid, which the Department of Taxation denied. Upon the Administrators\u2019 application the trial court held that the estate was entitled <em>to </em>the credit. The Commonwealth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">For an understanding of the controversy we will describe the alternate death taxes imposed by the State of Virginia under Code \u00a7 58-152 (and related sections) and Code \u00a7 58-162. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 58-152, -162 (Repl. vol. 1959). We will also identify the section under which the death tax was assessed against Mrs. Jennings\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Code \u00a7 58-152 imposes death taxes upon the shares passing to beneficiaries under a decedent\u2019s will. Code \u00a7 58-162 imposes an alternate State death tax designed to \u201cpick-up\u201d for the State treasury the maximum federal estate tax credit allowable under the United States Internal Revenue Code for death taxes paid to the State. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 (1964). Code \u00a7 58-162, the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute, fixes the tax levied thereunder at an amount equal to the maximum federal credit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Code \u00a7 58-162 provides that a death tax shall be assessed under Code \u00a7 58-152 if the maximum federal credit is smaller than the death taxes assessable under Code \u00a7 58-152. But where, as was true for Mrs. Jennings\u2019s estate, the death tax assessable under the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute is greater than the death tax assessable under Code \u00a7 58-152, the State assesses a death tax under the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Turning to the facts of this case in more detail, we find that in 1959 Mrs. Jennings transferred certain assets to an <em>inter vivos </em>trust. Following Mrs. Jennings\u2019s death in 1961 her Administrators c.t.a. filed a gift tax return and paid a Virginia gift tax of $24,850 on the transfer of those assets. They also filed a Virginia inheritance tax return, on the basis of which the Department of Taxation assessed a tax of $117,695.44 against her estate under the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">After an audit the Internal Revenue Service determined that Mrs. Jennings made the 1959 transfer in contemplation of death. The Service therefore included the assets transferred in 1959, on which the Virginia gift tax of $24,850 had been paid, in the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes and increased the federal estate tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Because of this adjustment and other adjustments made by the federal authorities, the maximum available federal credit was increased from $117,695.44 to $183,329.12. The Department of Taxation therefore increased the Virginia death tax assessment to $183,329.12. The Administrators voluntarily paid $158,479.12. They contended that such payment, together with a $24,850 gift tax credit which the Administrators claimed to be available under Virginia law, satisfied the total death tax owing. After the Department of Taxation denied the credit, the Administrators paid $24,850 under protest. They then instituted this proceeding seeking a refund of $24,850, which the trial court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Mrs. Jennings\u2019s Administrators claimed the gift tax credit under Code \u00a7 58-158:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">\u201c\u00a7 58-158. Credits.\u2014In case a tax has been imposed under chapter 6 of this title upon any gift and thereafter upon the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the donor the amount thereof is required by any provision of this chapter to be included in the gross estate of the decedent then there shall be credited against and applied in reduction of the inheritance tax which would otherwise be chargeable against the estate of the decedent or the respective shares of the beneficiaries thereof under the provisions of this chapter an amount equal to the tax paid with respect to such gift.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 58-158 (Repl. vol. 1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the gift tax credit provided under Code \u00a7 58-158 is available only when death taxes are assessed under Code \u00a7 58-152, not when the tax is assessed under the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The Commonwealth bases its argument in part on the distinction between an inheritance tax and an estate tax. The Commonwealth points to the language of Code \u00a7 58-158 that allows the gift tax credit \u201cin reduction of the <em>inheritance tax\u201d </em>that would otherwise be assessable. [Emphasis supplied.] The Commonwealth says that a tax assessed under Code \u00a7 58-152 is truly an inheritance tax because it is a succession tax imposed upon the beneficiary\u2019s right to succeed to a share of the estate, while the death tax assessed under the \u201cpickup\u201d statute is truly an estate tax because it is imposed on the decedent\u2019s right to transmit property. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>196 Va. 868, 871, 86 S.E.2d 135, 137 (1955), cited by the Commonwealth for these propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">[1] We agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s distinction between an inheritance tax and an estate tax. And we admit that the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute is truly an estate tax, a tax imposed upon the right to transmit property. But this admission does not lead to the conclusion advocated by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">[2] The Virginia Legislature saw fit to label the tax imposed under the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute an \u201cinheritance\u201d tax. It applied this label in the words of the statute itself: \u201cSuch minimum <em>inheritance tax </em>imposed by this State, which is hereby imposed by this chapter * * * This section shall always be so construed as not to increase the total amount of <em>inheritance taxes, State </em>and federal, payable upon the estates of decedents # # *\u201d (Emphasis supplied; see Code \u00a7 58-162, quoted in part in footnote 1, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The language of a statute should of course be given the meaning intended by the Legislature. So when the Legislature directed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Code \u00a7 58-158 that certain gift taxes previously paid \u201cshall be credited against and applied in reduction of the inheritance tax\u201d otherwise collectible, the Legislature intended to refer not only to the true inheritance tax levied under Code \u00a7 58-152, but also to what it had labeled the \u201cinheritance tax\u201d levied under the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Legislature made its intent even clearer by these words in Code \u00a7 58-158: \u201cin reduction of the inheritance tax which would otherwise be chargeable against the <em>estate of the decedent </em>or the respective shares of the beneficiaries thereof under the provisions of this chapter\u201d. [Emphasis supplied.] These words make it clear that the credit allowed in Code \u00a7 58-158 applies to either of two alternate taxes: The emphasized words refer to the tax imposed under the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute, a tax on the estate; the succeeding words refer to the tax imposed under Code \u00a7 58-152, a tax on the beneficiaries' shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Finally on this point, Code \u00a7 58-158 makes the gift tax credit applicable to any tax chargeable under \u201cthis chapter\u201d. The \u201cpick-up\u201d statute, as well as the other sections we have discussed, appears in \u201cthis chapter\u201d, chapter 5 of Title 58 of the Code (\u00a7\u00a7 58-152 through -217.14) .<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">[3] The Commonwealth contends that the Department of Taxation has consistently interpreted Code \u00a7 58-158 as providing no gift tax credit when death taxes are imposed under the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute. The Commonwealth therefore asks us to interpret Code \u00a7 58-158 consistently with the administrative practice. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the administrative practice was proved in this case, we can give it no effect because we find no ambiguity in Code \u00a7 58-158. To give effect to the claimed administrative practice would permit administrative action to override legislative intent as disclosed by the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>206 Va. 550, 557, 145 S.E.2d 206, 211 (1965); see <em>Huffman Const. Co. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>184 Va. 727, 740, 36 S.E.2d 641, 647 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">What has been said moves us to the conclusion that the gift tax credit provided under Code \u00a7 58-158 is available to estates, like Mrs. Jennings\u2019s estate, that are taxed under the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute. When the assets on which the $24,850 gift tax was paid were included in Mrs. Jennings\u2019s estate for death tax purposes, the $24,850 already paid constituted in effect an advance payment on account of the Virginia death tax. See <em>Smith </em>v. Shaughnessy, 318 U.S. 176, 180, 63 S.Ct. 545, 546-47, 87 L.ed. 690, 692-93 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Some doubt might persist, however,, if under federal law the advance payment of $24,850 does not constitute part of the death tax \u201cactually paid\u201d to the State so as to qualify for the federal estate tax credit under .26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 (1964). If not, the federal credit would be $158,479.12 ($183,329.12 less $24,850) instead of the maximum available credit of $183,329.12. Yet the Virginia \u201cpick-up\u201d statute states its clear intention \u201cto take full advantage [for the State treasury] of the credit allowed by the chapter of the Internal Revenue Code hereinabove mentioned [now 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 (1964)]\u201d. See the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 58-162, quoted in footnote 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Any doubt on this score has been dispelled by a technical advice memorandum, dated July 23, 1965, from the National Office, Internal Revenue Service, to the District Director of Internal Revenue, Richmond, Virginia, concerning the Estate of Page Lewis Jennings. The memorandum recites the Administrators\u2019 position that the total Virginia inheritance tax liability of $183,329.12 should be satisfied by the cash payment of $158,479.12 and a gift tax credit of $24,850. It also recites the Administrators\u2019 desire, if successful in establishing their right to the gift tax credit by litigation, to know the position of the Internal Revenue Service \u201cwith regard to the allowance of $183,329.12 as the credit for state death taxes \u2018actually paid\u2019 \u201d. The memorandum concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">\u201c. . . [I] f the State of Virginia certifies payment of inheritance taxes in the amount of $183,329.12 made on behalf of the above-named estate, and the latter claims credit therefor within four years after the filing of the estate tax return, we hold that the maximum amount of the credit authorized by section 2011 will be allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>In view of our holding that the $24,850 gift tax paid by Mrs. Jennings\u2019s Administrators constituted under Code \u00a7 58-158 an advance payment on account of the Virginia death tax assessed against her estate, we see no reason why the State Tax Commissioner should decline to issue the certificate referred to in the technical advice memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">. \u201c\u00a7 58-162.

The 1934 Act, which established the gift tax credit, made the credit applicable to any inheritance tax chargeable under \u201cchapter nine of the Tax Code of Virginia\u201d instead of to any inheritance tax chargeable under \u201cthis chapter\u201d, as provided in the present Code \u00a7 58-158. Va. Acts of Assembly 1934, ch. 137 at 188-9; Va. Tax Code Ann. \u00a7 120(13) (Supp. 1934). When the 1934 Act was passed the \u201cpick-up\u201d statute, as well as the predecessor to Code \u00a7 58-152, was part of chapter 9 of the Tax Code dealing with inheritance taxes, but the Act made the gift tax credit section part of chapter 9A of the Tax Code dealing with gift taxes. In the 1950 recodification the gift tax credit section (formerly \u00a7 120(13) of the Tax Code, recodified as Code \u00a7 58-158), as well as the \u201cpick-up!\u2019 statute and Code \u00a7 58-152, was made part of chapter 5 of Title 58 dealing with inheritance taxes.
