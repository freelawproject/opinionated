Bruce, Jr., the plaintiff, against Grace M. Madden, the defendant, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff when the automobile in which he was a passenger was struck from behind by a vehicle operated by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The case was tried before a jury, and at the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court, upon motion of the plaintiff and over the defendant\u2019s objection, struck the defendant\u2019s evidence. The only issue remaining to be submitted to the jury, therefore, concerned the amount of damages the plaintiff was entitled to recover for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The plaintiff offered an instruction on damages which would have told the jury that it could consider five separate elements listed therein in ascertaining the amount of damages to be awarded the plaintiff. One of those elements was contained in paragraph 4, which was worded as follows: \u201cThe mental anguish, if any, the plaintiff has endured as a result of his injuries.\u201d The trial court, over the objection of the plaintiff, struck that paragraph from the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $500.00. Final judgment was entered on the verdict, and the plaintiff was granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">The plaintiff assigns error to the action of the trial court in deleting paragraph 4 from the instruction offered by him. The defendant assigns cross-error to the action of the court in striking her evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed that the collision occurred at approximately 6:30 p.m. on July 28, 1965, in the city of Norfolk. The weather was clear, and the road surface was dry. The plaintiff, Bruce, was riding on the right front seat of an automobile being operated by his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">When Mrs. Bruce approached Military Highway on an entrance road, she brought her automobile to a stop, responsive to a yield sign and traffic on the main highway. While in this stopped position, the Bruce vehicle was struck from behind by the automobile operated by the defendant. The impact forced the Bruce car forward. The plaintiff was thrown forward and then backward in the car, and his knees were pushed into the dashboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">The plaintiff was assisted from his vehicle to an ambulance by two police officers. He was taken to a hospital where he remained approximately four hours while being examined and treated by his personal physician, Dr. John S. Thiemeyer, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">Dr. Thiemeyer testified, by way of deposition, that he had treated the plaintiff since 1951 for an injury received in an automobile acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>dent in that year. In the earlier accident, the plaintiff suffered a fracture of the left acetabulum, or hip socket, and as a result had an osteoarthritic hip. The doctor described the arthritic condition of the plaintiff\u2019s hip as \u201ca degenerative change of this hip joint consisting of the degeneration of the joint\u2019s surface and arthritic spurs of the joint.\u201d The treatment of the plaintiff\u2019s condition resulting from the 1951 accident consisted of a monthly injection into the hip joint of Kenalog, a derivative of cortisone.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The doctor further testified that in the 1965 accident, the plaintiff twisted his already-injured hip, causing severe pain and marked loss of motion. X rays of the hip disclosed \u201cno fractures or broken bones about the area.\u201d The doctor also stated that X rays of the plaintiff\u2019s neck showed that he had sustained a \u201csprain of the cervical spine,\u201d causing \u201cspasm of the muscles and a tearing of the ligaments\u201d in the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The plaintiff was treated by Dr. Thiemeyer for his \u201cneck and hip pain\u201d resulting from the 1965 accident. To treat the neck injury, the doctor instructed the plaintiff to have his wife apply hot compresses to his neck and \u201crub it down with Ben-Gay.\u201d The doctor also told the plaintiff to place boards under the mattress of his bed and to sleep without a pillow. By the end of September, 1965, the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s neck had healed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Treatment for the aggravation of the hip injury consisted of more frequent injections of Kenalog. By June 9, 1966, according to Dr. Thiemeyer, the plaintiff was relieved of the \u201cincreased pain\u201d caused by the \u201cflare-up of the difficulty with his hip joint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The plaintiff testified that before the 1965 accident, the pain in his hip was \u201cvery minor\u201d and \u201cwas bearable,\u201d but after the accident, \u201cit got quite a bit worse.\u201d The plaintiff said he had trouble sitting on a chair at home and that he \u201cmore or less had to sit on a hard surface.\u201d He further said that he \u201cwould take far more pain pills\u201d than he \u201chad been used to taking\u201d and that when he had difficulty sleeping, he would, with his wife\u2019s assistance, \u201cget up and just try to walk anyway . . . sometimes it helps to walk it out.\u201d He also stated that the pain \u201cgot to the point I couldn\u2019t drive my car at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">The plaintiff was employed as a checker in the warehouse department of the Texaco Company. He testified that after the accident, he was placed on light duty and, at the time of trial, had not yet reassumed all the duties previously assigned him. He stated that he could not stand for extended periods of time at his work and \u201cwould have to sit down.\u201d He said that he lost two and one-half days from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>work in addition to the time required to visit the doctor\u2019s office for the additional injections of Kenalog.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s wife testified that as a result of the accident, her husband had been \u201crather restless and suffered far more pain than he ever did before.\u201d She stated that the plaintiff had been unable to assist her with household duties to the extent he had before the accident. She further said that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t sleep\u201d and that she \u201chad to get up and get a hot water bottle for him to put on his hips and get the pain capsules for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">[1] This brings us to a consideration of the trial court\u2019s action in striking from the instruction offered by the plaintiff the paragraph relating to mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The defendant objected to the disputed paragraph, and the court struck it from the instruction because \u201cthere was no evidence upon which this instruction could be based.\u201d In her brief, the defendant seeks to sustain her position and the action of the trial court by saying, \u201cThe record shows that there was no direct evidence of mental anguish or suffering at the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The plaintiff, on the other hand, contended in the trial court and contends here that the jury, from the evidence before it, could have inferred that he endured mental anguish as the result of the injuries sustained in the accident of July, 1965. It was error, therefore, the plaintiff says, for the trial court to strike from the instruction offered by him the paragraph which would have permitted the jury to consider mental anguish as an element of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">With the plaintiff we agree. In <em>Norfolk, &amp;c. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Marpole, </em>97 Va. 594, 599, 34 S. E. 462, 464 (1899), we considered an instruction which had been granted by the trial court and which had been objected to because \u201cit allowed the jury, without special proof, in fixing the plaintiff\u2019s damages, to take into consideration his mental suffering.\u201d We held that there was no error in the granting of the instruction and cited with approval the holding in the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>The Hannibal &amp; St. J. R. Co., 99 </em>Mo. 310, 12 S. W. 665 (1889), where it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-10\">\u201c . . . Physical pain and mental anguish usually, and to some extent, necessarily flow from, or attend, bodily injuries. It is not necessary to make specific proof of pain and mental anguish. These elements of damages are sufficiently shown by the evidence which discloses the nature, character and extent of the injuries. From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>such evidence <em>the jury may infer pain and mental </em>anguish.\u201d [Emphasis added.] 99 Mo., at 318-319, 12 S. W., at 656.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In <em>So. Bell, &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>98 Va. 1, 4, 6, 34 S. E. 951, 952 (1900), an instruction had been granted permitting the jury, in estimating the plaintiff\u2019s damages, to take into consideration \u201cboth his physical and mental suffering arising from the injury.\u201d The instruction had been objected to on the ground that there was \u201cno evidence that the plaintiff suffered mentally in any way whatever.\u201d We approved the instruction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">\u201c ... We think that where the proof shows that a man is thrown from a telephone pole to the ground, is injured in his arm, hip and back, and is made sick, and nervous, has to be taken home in an ambulance, and is unable to sit up in bed for three or four days, <em>the jury would be warranted in the inference that his condition was attended by some degree of mental suffering.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.] 98 Va., at 6, 34 S. E., at 952.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In <em>Perlin </em>v. <em>Chappell, </em>198 Va. 861, 96 S. E. 2d 805 (1957), we had before us an instruction permitting the jury to consider the mental suffering of the plaintiff. We disapproved the instruction because its extensive language unduly emphasized the element of mental suffering and made the instruction argumentative and repetitious. We said, however, in the course of the discussion that \u201c[o]f course mental suffering when proved <em>or fairly inferred </em>from injuries sustained is an element of damages.\u201d [Emphasis added.] 198 Va., at 868, 96 S. E. 2d, at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Thus, it is well settled in this jurisdiction that mental anguish may be inferred in. those instances where such would be the natural and probable consequence of bodily injury and that it is error in such a situation to refuse to instruct the jury that it may consider mental anguish as an element of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, it is reasonable to state that he sustained, in the accident in question, an aggravation of his pre-existing hip injury, causing severe pain and marked loss of motion. He became restless, unable to sleep, and hampered in his employment. He was required to undergo additional treatment and to take \u201cpain pills.\u201d The plaintiff also sustained an injury to his neck, causing pain and requiring treatment of an unpleasant nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">From all of this, the jury would have been justified in inferring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>that the plaintiff endured mental anguish as the result of his injuries and would have been warranted in awarding a reasonable amount to cover that element of damages. It was error, therefore, to withhold the element of mental anguish from the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">[2] But, the defendant argues alternatively, if the plaintiff was entitled to any instruction at all on the mental aspect of his injuries, the instruction should have included only the element of mental suffering and not mental anguish. The defendant says that \u201c [t] o infer mental suffering under proper circumstances from a given injury might be correct, but to infer mental anguish from the same injury is something different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">We find the defendant\u2019s argument to be without merit because if there is in the law a distinction between mental anguish and mental suffering, it is, so far as this type of case is concerned, a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">We have examined many cases, including our own and those from other jurisdictions, in an unsuccessful attempt to find some basis for the distinction contended for by the defendant. Contrary to that contention, the phrases \u201cmental anguish\u201d and \u201cmental suffering\u201d appear from the decisions to be used interchangeably and to be taken as synonymous, one with the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">One of our cases is typical of those displaying the interchangeability of the phrases \u201cmental anguish\u201d and \u201cmental suffering.\u201d <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>191 Va. 43, 60 S. E. 2d 10 (1950), involved an action for damages for the negligent handling by the defendant undertaker of the body of the plaintiff\u2019s deceased husband. The question was whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the mental suffering undergone in addition to the pecuniary loss sustained as the result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. We held that the plaintiff was entitled so to recover, and we approved an instruction submitting for the jury\u2019s consideration the element of mental suffering. In discussing that element, the phrases \u201cmental anguish,\u201d \u201cmental pain and suffering,\u201d and \u201cmental pain and anguish\u201d were freely substituted for \u201cmental suffering\u201d throughout the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">In reference works, we find the same situation. 22 Am. Jur. 2d, Damages, \u00a7 195, p. 274, speaks in the same breath of \u201cmental anguish or suffering\u201d as related to physical injury. 25 C. J. S., Damages, \u00a7 63, p. 815, affords equal meaning to the phrases \u201cmental anguish\u201d and \u201cmental suffering\u201d in a section entitled \u201cMental Pain and Suffering\u201d as elements of damages for physical injury. And an annotation in 23 A. L. R. 361 equates \u201cmental anguish\u201d with \u201cmental suffering\u201d in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>discussion of certain instances where damages for mental anguish alone are recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Before leaving the instruction phase of the case, we should comment upon the fact that in the instruction on damages offered by the plaintiff, the elements of physical pain and mental anguish were listed in separate paragraphs, independent of each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Since, in this type of case, physical injury generally is a necessary concomitant of mental anguish, the listing of the element of mental anguish in a separate paragraph might well run into the same objection of undue emphasis as was sustained to the instruction in <em>Perlin </em>v. <em>Chappell, supra, </em>198 Va. 861, 96 S. E. 2d 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">To avoid that possibility, we believe the better practice, where the granting of an instruction on mental anguish may be appropriate, is to link the elements of physical pain and mental anguish in the same paragraph of an instruction, as suggested by Doubles, Emroch, and Merhige in their Virginia Jury Instructions, Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.01, p. 148, or in the same clause in a sentence of an instruction, as suggested by Abbott and Solomon in their Instructions for Virginia and West Virginia, 2d ed., Vol. 2, \u00a7 39-113, p. 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">[3] We turn now to the assignment of cross-error relating to the trial court\u2019s action in striking the defendant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">The defendant testified on her own behalf that she followed the Bruce vehicle, in which the plaintiff was a passenger, along the entrance road to Military Highway. When the other car stopped at the yield sign, she stopped behind it. She saw the Bruce automobile move forward and, while looking to her left for traffic on the main highway, advanced to the yield sign, and again stopped. Still looking to her left, she saw that the right lane of the main road was clear, \u201chit the accelerator,\u201d moved forward, and struck the rear of the Bruce car which, unknown to her, \u201chad pulled up further and stopped.\u201d The defendant finally stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I hit her until I heard the crash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Thus, the defendant, while looking to her left, pulled from a stopped position, advanced to the yield sign, stopped again, moved forward, and struck the Bruce vehicle, without ever looking to the front for possible danger. We agree with the trial court that such action constituted negligence as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">For the error in striking the element of mental anguish from the damage instruction offered by the plaintiff, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed, the verdict of the jury set aside, and the case remanded for a new trial limited to the issue of damages alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
