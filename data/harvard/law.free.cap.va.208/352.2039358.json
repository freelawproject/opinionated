A Norfolk ordinance subjects an owner to a fine if his dog \u201cshall go at large upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>any public street... of the city, unless such dog is accompanied by an attendant or held in leash by a responsible person\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying upon that ordinance, Cathy (by her next friend) brought this action against Laddie\u2019s owners, Robert T. and Edith Butler, to recover damages for her personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The trial court instructed the jury that the defendants\u2019 violation of the Norfolk ordinance constituted negligence, and that the jury should return a verdict for the plaintiff, Cathy, if it believed such negligence proximately caused or contributed to her injuries. The jury returned a $1,500 verdict for the plaintiff, upon which the court entered judgment. The defendants appeal, contending the court erred in instructing the jury that violation of the ordinance constituted negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">[1] Under Virginia law violation of a statute or ordinance constitutes negligence <em>per se. </em>See <em>Gough </em>v. <em>Shaner, </em>Adnir, 197 Va. 572, 576, 90 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1955); <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. Roberts, 130 Va. 532, 107 S.E. 838 (1921). So Virginia has adopted the requirements of a legislative enactment as the standard of conduct of a reasonable man. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Virginia Transit Co., </em>188 Va. 493, 497-98, 50 S.E.2d 268, 271 (1948). See generally <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 286, 288B (1965). But failure to comply with the requirements of a legislative enactment does not constitute actionable negligence unless the injured person is a member of a class for whose benefit the legislation was enacted. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Virginia Transit Co., </em>206 Va. 951, 957, 147 S.E.2d 110, 114-15 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Since the defendants\u2019 violation of the Norfolk ordinance is not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>troverted, the single issue presented on this appeal is whether the ordinance was designed to protect the public from personal injuries inflicted by dogs. If so, the trial court did not err in its instruction to the jury or in entering judgment on the verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">[2] Defendants\u2019 counsel says that the Norfolk ordinance is penal in nature and was designed to aid the city in resolving \u201cthe problems caused by strays, both to motorists and horticulturists\u201d. In our opinion counsel reads the ordinance too narrowly. While we must construe a penal ordinance strictly, we must at the same time avoid an interpretation that would impair the purpose of the ordinance. <em>Gough </em>v. <em>Shaner, Adm'r, </em>197 Va. 572, 575, 90 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The purpose of the ordinance, as we read it, it to protect the public against hazards created by dogs running at large, including the most obvious hazard, dog-bite. Persons such as Cathy Sue Frieden, who might be bitten by dogs running at large, were therefore within the class intended to be protected by the ordinance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">[3] In addition to arguing that the Norfolk ordinance was designed to aid the city, defendants\u2019 counsel argues that the city council did not intend that violation of the ordinance, which does not mention civil liability, should give rise to civil liability. Counsel relies primarily on <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Bell, 202 </em>Va. 274, 117 S.E.2d 85 (1960), which involved a city ordinance requiring abutting landowners to clear public sidewalks of accumulated snow and ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Johnson, who was injured when she slipped and fell on the snow and ice that had accumulated on a public sidewalk, sued the landowner who had violated the ordinance by failing to remove the snow and ice. We held that the ordinance was enacted for the benefit of the city and therefore, Johnson was not within the class for whose benefit or protection the ordinance was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Before the passage of the ordinance involved in the <em>Johnson </em>case, the city, and not the landowner, was responsible for removing snow and ice from its sidewalks and was subject to liability if it breached its duty of exercising ordinary care to keep the sidewalks safe for use by the public. The ordinance shifted to the abutting landowner the responsibility for removing snow and ice, but did not relieve the city from liability for breach of its duty. <em>Id. </em>at 277, 117 S.E.2d at 88. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The purpose of the ordinance, as we interpreted it, was to require the abutting landowner to remove snow and ice, not to impose upon him civil liability for the breach of a duty owed by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In contrast the dog-owner, and not the city, had the common law duty of exercising ordinary care to protect other persons from injuries that might be inflicted by his dog and was subject to civil liability for breach of that duty. The Norfolk ordinance does not, therefore, create a cause of action against the dog-owner. Rather, the ordinance supplies a standard for determining whether the dog owner has exercised his duty of ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Before passage of the Norfolk ordinance, the defendants\u2019 failure to have Laddie attended or leashed would not have constituted a breach of their duty to Cathy because, as conceded by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the defendants had no reason to believe Laddie would inflict injuries if allowed to go at large. See <em>Restatement of Torts </em>\u00a7 518, Comment j (1938). But in view of the standard supplied by the Norfolk ordinance, the defendants breached their duty to Cathy by permitting Laddie to go at large on a public street, unattended and unleashed. See <em>Restatement </em>(Second) <em>of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 286, 288B (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We found in the <em>Johnson </em>ordinance no intention to impose upon landowners civil liability for injuries sustained on public property. Our interpretation of the ordinance in this case is not inconsistent with the <em>Johnson </em>case because we have interpreted this ordinance not as imposing civil liability, but as supplying a new standard for determining whether the defendants performed their common law duty of ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">. \u201cSec. 5-27.
