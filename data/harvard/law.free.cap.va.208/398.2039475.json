M. Hitt petitioned the Board of Supervisors and the Planning Commission of Botetourt County to rezone about 110 acres of his land from Agricultural to Industrial. As required by law the petition was referred to the Planning Commission for its recommendation to the Board. The Commission recommended against the rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The Board of Supervisors held a public hearing on November 15, 1963, at which persons were heard for and against the petition. The Board then adjourned the hearing until November 21, 1963 \u201cto allow Dr. Hitt to file an amended petition\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Dr. Hitt filed an amended petition asking that an 8-acre tract within the 110-acre tract be rezoned to Industrial for use \u201cas a quarry site\u201d and \u201ca stock pile site\u201d. Without referring the amended petition to the Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors again heard persons for and against the rezoning at the reconvened meeting on November 21, 1963, and then adopted an amendment to the County\u2019s zoning ordinance. By the amendment the Board rezoned the 8-acre tract \u201cfrom an Agricultural Zone (A-l) to an Industrial Zone (M-l)\u201d, as requested in Dr. Hitt\u2019s amended petition, and directed that \u201cthe Zoning Maps shall be changed in this respect\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Shortly thereafter Dr. E. D. Morgan and others filed this suit for a declaratory judgment. They contended in the trial court, as they do here, that the zoning amendment adopted by the Board of Supervisors on November 21, 1963 was invalid for two reasons: (1) The Board\u2019s failure to refer Dr. Hitt\u2019s amended petition to the Planning Commission was a fatal procedural defect, and (2) the zoning amendment constituted \u201cspot zoning\u201d and represented an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of authority by the Board, which bore no substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board and Dr. Hitt appeal from the trial court\u2019s decree sustaining the complainants\u2019 position on points (1) and (2) and declaring the zoning amendment \u201cvoid, invalid and illegal\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">[1] We can dispose of point (1) now. Code \u00a7 15.1-493 provides in part that \u201cno zoning ordinance shall be amended . . . unless the governing body [the Board of Supervisors] has referred the proposed amendment ... to the local commission [the Planning Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>mission] for its recommendations\u201d. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 15.1-493 (Repl. vol. 1964). (A requirement that proposed amendments be referred to the Planning Commission is also set forth in Article 12-1-3 of the Botetourt County Zoning Ordinance, adopted in 1960.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Code \u00a7 15.1-493 provides further that the governing body shall hold at least one public hearing, pursuant to public notice as required by Code \u00a7 15.1-431 (Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 15.1-431 (Repl. vol. 1964)), before adopting any amendment to a zoning ordinance. After one public hearing has been duly held, Code \u00a7 15.1-493 empowers \u201cthe governing body ... [to] make appropriate changes or corrections in the . . . proposed amendment; provided, however, that no <em>additional </em>land may be zoned to a different classification than was contained in the public notice without an additional public hearing after notice required by \u00a7 15.1-431\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The complainants-appellees concede that the procedural requirements of the statute were met respecting Dr. Hitt\u2019s original request for the rezoning of the 110-acre tract. They argue, however, that the Board\u2019s failure to re-refer the matter to the Planning Commission, when Dr. Hitt subsequently requested the rezoning of only a part of the 110-acre tract, precluded the passage of the amendatory ordinance rezoning the smaller tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">But Code \u00a7 15.1-493, which expressly empowers the Board of Supervisors to make changes in a proposed amendment to a zoning ordinance, imposes only one qualification: that the Board shall not pass an amendment that rezones more land than that described in the original public notice, without first giving the statutory notice of the proposal to rezone the larger tract and holding an additional public hearing. The statute does not require a second referral to the Planning Commission. We hold, therefore, that the trial court erred in ruling that the amendatory ordinance was invalid because of a procedural defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">[2] We now turn to the question whether the trial court erred in declaring the amendatory ordinance \u201cvoid, invalid and illegal\u201d as arbitrary and capricious legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">As already mentioned, Dr. Hitt requested the rezoning of the 8-acre tract for quarrying operations. The evidence does not disclose the manner in which the proposed quarrying operations would be performed; but it does disclose that Dr. Hitt requested the rezoning after he had contracted to furnish stone over a period of 8 to 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>months for use in the construction of a segment of Interstate 81 in Botetourt County.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The evidence comprised 12 exhibits and the testimony of a planning expert. The only exhibits that are relevant to the question before us are the Botetourt County Zoning Map and the transcript of the second public hearing before the Board of Supervisors. (The proceedings at the first hearing were not transcribed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The map shows that the vast majority of Botetourt County is zoned Agricultural. Two areas are zoned Residential, one of which encircles the town of Fincastle. Complainants\u2019 counsel refers to this residential area as the \u201chistoric ring\u201d; he says \u201c[o]bviously, this ring of restriction around Fincastle was a recognition of the wisdom of preserving an historic resource of incalculable value\u201d. There is an Industrial zone within the \u201chistoric ring\u201d, but the 8-acre tract owned by Dr. Hitt lies 200 to 250 yards outside the perimeter of the \u201chistoric ring\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The transcript of the second hearing includes statements by citizens of the County who oposed the rezoning, arguments of counsel and the announcement of the Board\u2019s decision to rezone the 8-acre tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Because the statements made by all citizens were to the same general effect, we will summarize only the statements made by two of them. One citizen said that the residential area around Fincastle \u201cshould be recognized and respected\u201d. He said further: \u201c[W]e want industry which will do more good for the County than it could possibly do harm and I think this proposition here could be more harmful to the County than good . . . I\u2019m a little bit afraid of the blasting ... If this was an industry which would be of considerable aid to the County . .. I wouldn\u2019t oppose it; I would take my chances on it, but I don\u2019t think it is worth to Botetourt County what it is going to be in the way of liability...\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Another citizen expressed more strongly his belief that the operation of a quarry would be harmful. He said the quarry would produce \u201ca lot of dust\u201d and \u201ca lot of noise\u201d, that each blast of dynamite would cause \u201cevery building in this Town [Fincastle] ... to shake\u201d, and that trucks moving to and from the quarry site would create danger and congestion. But counsel for Dr. Hitt reminded the Board that expert witnesses at the first hearing had \u201ctestified that there would be absolutely no blast damage. There would be a minimal of dust and that the danger from any increased traffic would only be a normal occurrence, which is progress in the County\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">At the conclusion of the hearing the Chairman announced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Board\u2019s decision, by a vote of 2 to 1, to rezone the 8-acre tract from Agricultural to Industrial. In the course of his remarks, the Chairman expressed the opinion that the persons who protested the rezoning would not be unreasonably affected by the proposed quarry. He said that the Board had to consider \u201c [w] hat is best for the County\u201d. He referred to Botetourt County\u2019s reputation for discouraging industry and the advisability of correcting the impression \u201c[t]hat Botetourt County doesn\u2019t want any industry\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">A planning expert, the only witness in this suit, gave his definition of \u201cspot zoning\u201d and expressed the opinion that the rezoning of the 8-acre tract constituted \u201cspot zoning\u201d, as he had defined it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When this expert was asked whether, in his professional opinion, the rezoning \u201cbear [s] a reasonable relation to the safety, morals and general welfare of the owners [sic]\u201d, he answered \u201cIt does not\u201d. When asked to state his reasons for those opinions, the expert replied in essence that instead of rezoning the 8-acre tract, the Board should have amended the zoning ordinance to provide for the issuance of special use permits that would have permitted quarrying for a limited period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Complainants contend that the evidence showed that the Board\u2019s action in amending the zoning ordinance was, as a matter of law, arbitrary and capricious and therefore invalid. We have laid down the following rules for determining whether a Board\u2019s action in passing a zoning ordinance can be upset:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\u201c \u2018The legislative branch of a local government in the exercise of its police power has wide discretion in the enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances. Its action is presumed to be valid so long as it is not unreasonable and arbitrary. The burden of proof is on him who assails it to prove that it is clearly unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and that it bears no reasonable, or substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The court will not substitute its judgment for that of a legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>body, and if the reasonableness of a zoning ordinance is fairly debatable it must be sustained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southern Ry. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>205 Va. 699, 706, 139 S.E.2d 82, 87 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The statements of the citizens at the second hearing did not aid the complainants in carrying their heavy burden of proof. The citizens directed their statements only to the fairly debatable questions whether the quarrying operations that Dr. Hitt proposed to conduct would constitute a nuisance and whether the detriment caused by the proposed operations would exceed the benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Nor can we find any evidence of unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious action from the Chairman\u2019s remarks at the conclusion of the second hearing. He spoke of the advisability of encouraging industry in Botetourt County, which is not an improper motive;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but he did not say he voted for the rezoning only to encourage industry. He said that the Board had to consider \u201c [w]hat is best for the County\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The complainants\u2019 expert expressed the opinion that the rezoning bore no reasonable relation to the safety, morals and general welfare of the \u201cowners\u201d, probably intending to say \u201cCounty\u201d instead of \u201cowners\u201d. He said that he would have adopted an amendatory ordinance providing for special use permits, rather than rezoning the 8-acre tract. So instead of giving a basis for his opinion, the expert in effect substituted his judgment for that of the Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The complainants\u2019 expert also expressed the opinion that the rezoning of the 8-acre tract constituted \u201cspot zoning\u201d, as he had defined it (see n. 2, <em>supra). </em>Spot zoning or illegal spot zoning has been variously defined. See 8 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 25.83 (3d ed. 1965); 1 <em>Yokley, Zoning Law and Practice </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8-2, 8-3 (3d ed. 1965). We now adopt the following test for determining whether a zoning ordinance constitutes illegal spot zoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">If the purpose of a zoning ordinance is solely to serve the private interests of one or more landowners, the ordinance represents an arbitrary and capricious exercise of legislative power, constituting illegal spot zoning; but if the legislative purpose is to further the welfare of the entire county or city as a part of an overall zoning plan, the ordinance does not constitute illegal spot zoning even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>though private interests are simultaneously benefited. <em>Kozesnik </em>v. <em>Township of </em>Montgomery, 24 N.J. 154, 173, 131 A.2d 1, 11 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">As indicated by the language of the test, illegal spot zoning is arbitrary and capricious action of a special kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Faced with the presumption that the Board\u2019s action was valid, the complainants did not bear their burden of proving that the authorizing of quarrying operations on the 8-acre tract bore no reasonable or substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. See <em>Southern Ry. </em>v. <em>City of </em>Richmond, <em>supra. </em>The only evidence that tended to aid the complainants in carrying their burden was the opinion expressed by the planning expert that the rezoning bore \u201cno reasonable relation to the safety, morals and general welfare\u201d; and he could give no basis for this opinion. The complainants having faded to bear their burden, we must presume that the rezoning ordinance bore a reasonable or substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. So the evidence does not show that the Board acted solely to promote Dr. Hitt\u2019s private interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">[3] The complainants contend that the Board rezoned the 8-acre tract without regard to any plan for the development of the County. In 1960 the Board adopted the \u201cBotetourt County Zoning Ordinance\u201d that established an overall zoning plan for the County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This overall plan is reflected by the Zoning Map introduced in evidence, which divides the entire County into Agricultural, Residential, Business and Industrial zones. The fact that the Board rezoned an 8-acre tract for a use different from that of the surrounding land does not mean that the Board abandoned its overall zoning plan. See <em>Kozesnik </em>v. <em>Township of </em>Montgomery, <em>supra </em>at 167, 131 A.2d at 8. Because we have no evidence to the contrary, we must assume that the Board acted in furtherance of its overall zoning plan when it provided for an addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tional Industrial zone in the County; that the Board rezoned the 8-acre tract for industrial use to further the welfare of the entire county as a part of an overall zoning plan. So the rezoning of the 8-acre tract did not constitute illegal spot zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Because the complainants did not bear their burden of proving that . the rezoning ordinance was unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, we reverse the decree of the Circuit Court of Botetourt County and dismiss the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final decree.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\">. The relevant Virginia statute provides in part that the \u201c[z]oning ordinance shall be for the general purpose of promoting the health, safety or general welfare of the public\u201d. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 15.1-489 (Supp. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">. The planning expert defined spot zoning \u201cas that act of a zoning commission or a legislative body which permits a use for or group of uses in any given area of a locality which uses are diametrically opposed on a permanent basis to the uses planned or zoned around it to the detriment of harmonious development, thus not promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the public as outlined in Items I through 6, Section 15.1-489 of the State Code as revised June 30, 1962\u201d. He explained that this definition had been prepared by planning experts, with a particular view to guiding \u201cyoung planners\u201d who are called upon \u201cto help communities draft zoning ordinances\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\">. For cases involving zoning ordinances that were prompted by improper motives, see <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Carper, </em>200 Va. 653, 107 S.E.2d 390 (1959), and <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>200 Va. 316, 106 S.E.2d 152 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\">. Code \u00a7 15.1-446 requires each local planning commission to prepare and recommend \u201ca comprehensive plan for the physical development of the territory within its jurisdiction\u201d. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 15.1-446 (Repl. vol. 1964). Complainants\u2019 counsel says that \u201cBotetourt\u2019s Zoning Ordinance [adopted in 1960] follows a comprehensive plan of land use\u201d, apparently referring to the comprehensive plan provided for under Code \u00a7 15.1-446. He contends that when the Board rezoned the 8-acre tract, it did not follow or even consider \u201cthe Botetourt County plan for development\u201d. But complainants\u2019 counsel did not introduce any plan prepared by the Botetourt County Planning Commission or any evidence that the Board had adopted a plan prepared by the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
