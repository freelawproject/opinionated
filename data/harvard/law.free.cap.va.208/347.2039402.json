(208 Va. 51, 155 S. E. 2d 326.) The Authority states in its petition that it is uncertain whether we intended to hold unconstitutional only the fourth sentence of Code, \u00a7 15.1-1382 or whether we intended, as well, to hold unconstitutional the third sentence of the Code section.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">The third sentence of Code, \u00a7 15.1-1382 provides that a lessee of industrial authority property shall pay, as additional rent, \u201can amount in lieu of and equal to local property taxes and assessments.\u201d The fourth sentence of the Code section permits an authority and the political subdivision in which the facility is located to \u201cagree at any time to a definite sum to be paid as local property taxes and assessments throughout the duration of the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The Authority contends, in its petition for rehearing, that the third sentence of Code, \u00a7 15.1-1382 was not challenged in this proceeding. That contention, however, overlooks the position taken by the respondent in his brief where he stated: \u201cEvans Products Company on the matter of taxation (its leasehold interest) is not entitled to any exemption or deviation and must be taxed <em>upon the same basis as any other holder of a leasehold interest IN the City of </em>Chesapeake,\u201d and where he stated that \u201cSection 15.1-1382 insofar as it provides [quoting the third and fourth sentences] is unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">For reasons set forth in our opinion of June 12, 1967, we held unconstitutional not only the fourth sentence of Code, \u00a7 15.1-1382 but also the third sentence of that Code section, which provides for payments in lieu of taxes. We pointed out that Code, \u00a7 15.1-1382 \u201chas the effect of exempting the lessee of industrial authority property from the payment of a leasehold interest tax imposed pursuant to Code, \u00a7 58-758,\u201d and \u201chas the further effect of permitting taxation by agreement rather than by the levy and collection of taxes under general law as required by \u00a7 168 of the Constitution.\u201d 208 Va., at 61, 155 S. E. 2d, at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The Authority, in its petition for rehearing, expresses concern that a lessee of industrial authority property may be obligated to make payments in lieu of taxes under the third sentence of Code, \u00a7 15.1-1382 and to pay also the leasehold interest tax assessed under Code, \u00a7 58-758. There should be no reason for such concern, however, in view of the holding in our opinion of June 12, 1967, that the provisions of Code, \u00a7 15.1-1382 relating to payments in lieu of taxes are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The petition for rehearing is, therefore, denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>Rehearing denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Rules of Court</p>\n<p id=\"Apr\">Orders Amending</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">VIRGINIA:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In the Supreme Court of Appeals held at the Supreme Court of Appeals Building in the City of Richmond on Wednesday the 29th day of November, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">It is ordered that the Rules adopted and promulgated by this Court on the 13th day of October, 1949, to become effective on the 1st day of February, 1950, be and they are hereby amended, effective the 1st day of February, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Amend Rule 2:2 to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Rule 2:2.
