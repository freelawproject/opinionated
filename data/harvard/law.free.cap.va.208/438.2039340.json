Hatter, its employee, seeking to recover compensatory and punitive damages for \u201cinjuries and illnesses\u201d alleged to have been suffered by him when he was a patient in the hospital. The motion for judgment alleged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b646-17\">That on March 21, 1963, plaintiff was a patient in the hospital, under the care of Dr. John D. Varner, for the purpose of having surgery performed on his back, and on that day he underwent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>necessary preparatory procedures and received medication to enable him to undergo the surgery; that he was taken to the operating room, placed on the operating table and strapped down for a considerable length of time;</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">That when Dr. Varner arrived to perform the operation defendant Hatter, then a hospital employee and apparently in charge of the operating room, \u201cmaliciously, willfully and in a fit of unprovoked anger refused to permit Dr. Varner to proceed with the surgery, and did by her actions wrongfully exclude Dr. Varner and the plaintiff from the use of the said operating room;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">That \u201cthe shock, humiliation and concern\u201d which resulted to the plaintiff from the \u201cwrongful and willful conduct\u201d on the part of defendant Hatter caused him to become ill and to suffer pains and discomforts, \u201cboth mental and physical, together with an aggravation and worsening of the condition for which he was hospitalized and surgery had been scheduled;\u201d and that this conduct constituted an assault on plaintiff which proximately caused his succeeding injuries and illnesses; that as a direct and proximate result of these occurrences, plaintiff was forced to expend considerable sums of money in the treatment of his illnesses, lost earnings from his occupation, and suffered in mind and body, for which he seeks judgment against defendants for $25,000 compensatory damages and $5,000 punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Both defendants filed demurrers on the ground that the \u201cmotion for judgment fails to state a cause of action\u201d. The hospital also filed a special plea alleging that it was a charitable hospital and had violated no duty owed to plaintiff, to which plaintiff filed a reply denying that allegation. We are not presently concerned with that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">At a pretrial conference on October 7, 1965, plaintiff was instructed to file a bill of particulars, which was done on October 25. By order of October 27, the court sustained the motions of the defendants to strike the bill of particulars on the grounds that it attempted to join claims in contract and tort and failed to inform defendants fairly of the true nature of plaintiff\u2019s claim, and plaintiff was permitted to file an amended bill of particulars. Accordingly plaintiff filed an amended bill in which he stated his claim to be that the behavior of the defendant Hatter, for which the hospital was liable, constituted \u201cwillful, wanton, malicious, vindictive and grossly negligent behavior toward the plaintiff, which proximately caused injury to the plaintiff, both mental and physical, *</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Both defendants filed motions to strike the amended bill of particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>lars and the motion for judgment \u201cpursuant to Rule 3:18 (d)\u201d of Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">In accordance with views stated in a written opinion, the court entered the order now appealed from sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrers and motions to strike and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action \u201cwith prejudice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Plaintiff assigned error only to \u201cThe judgment of the court in sustaining the demurrer filed on behalf of the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Defendants argue that the failure to assign error to the sustaining of defendants\u2019 motions to strike the motion for judgment renders this appeal moot. The defendants\u2019 demurrers, however, were on the ground that the motion for judgment \u201cfails to state a cause of action,\u201d and this was the then controlling issue. If the motion for judgment stated a cause of action, the demurrers should have been overruled. The sustaining of the demurrers presented the crucial issue for present consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Rule 3:18 (d) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cEvery pleading shall state the facts on which the party relies in numbered paragraphs, and it shall be sufficient if it clearly informs the opposite party of the true nature of the claim or defense. * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">It also provides for a bill of particulars when the pleading does not comply with the rule, and for an amended bill; and if the latter fails to inform fairly as to the true nature of the claim, the faulty pleading and the bills of particulars may be stricken.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">A motion for judgment \u201cmust set forth the essential facts (not conclusions of law) which constitute the foundation in law, of the judgment to be asked, and * * this must be done with sufficient definiteness to enable the court to find the existence of a legal basis for its judgment. In other words, despite the liberality of presentation which the court will indulge, the motion must state a cause of action.\u201d Burks Pleading and Practice, 4 ed., \u00a7 182, p. 295. 13 Mich. Jur., Motions for Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12, pp. 340-42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the motion for judgment against defendants\u2019 demurrers, the facts alleged are admitted as true. <em>Manassas Park Development Co. </em>v. <em>Offutt, </em>203 Va. 382, 384, 124 S.E. 2d 29, 30. Burks Pleading and Practice, 4 ed., \u00a7 212, p. 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The essential facts alleged in plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment were that he was a patient in the hospital in order to have surgery; that he had been prepared for surgery, including administration of medications, and had been taken to the operating room and strapped on the operating table for a considerable length of time. When the physician who was to perform the operation, Dr. Varner, arrived, defendant Phyllis Hatter, in charge of the operating room \u201cmaliciously, willfully. and in a fit of unprovoked anger\u201d refused to permit Dr. Varner to proceed and excluded the physician and plaintiff from the operating room. From this occurrence plaintiff suffered various physical and mental pains and discomforts and a worsening of the condition for which surgery had been scheduled, causing him to expend sums for his cure, to lose time from work and to suffer in mind and body.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The motion for judgment alleges that Phyllis Hatter\u2019s conduct was willful and malicious and the amended bill of particulars characterized it as \u201cwillful, wanton, malicious, vindictive and grossly negligent behavior toward the plaintiff, which proximately caused injury to the plaintiff, both mental and physical\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We hold that the motion for judgment sufficiently alleged a willful (intentional) tort on the part of defendant Phyllis Hatter, without actual physical contact with plaintiff, causing him physical and mental injuries and illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>May, </em>159 Va. 419, 437, 166 S.E. 550, 556 (1932), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cIt is now a well accepted fact that terror or a severe mental shock may be the direct and proximate cause of wreck to the nervous system, the consequence of which may be a visible physical injury. When such fright is due to a wilful, wanton and vindictive wrong, recovery is generally permitted, notwithstanding the fact that there is no contemporaneous injury from without.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In an Annotation on the subject \u201cTorts\u2014Emotional Disturbances\u201d in 64 A.L.R.2d, beginning at p. 100, cases from many jurisdictions are cited at pp. 120-21 in support of this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">\u201cMost of the courts which have been presented with the question in recent years have recognized an independent right to recover for grave mental distress intentionally or recklessly caused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>So it was said in Restatement (Second), Torts, \u00a7 312 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">\u201cIf the actor intentionally and unreasonably subjects another to emotional distress which he should recognize as likely to result in illness or other bodily harm, he is subject to liability to the other for an illness or other bodily harm of which the distress is a legal cause,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">(a) although the actor has no intention of inflicting such harm, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">(b) irrespective of whether the act is directed against the other or a third person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment sufficiently stated a cause of action against the defendants. The question of whether, if the plaintiff proves his case stated against defendant Hatter, there is liability on the defendant hospital, will be determined from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The judgment appealed from is reversed and the case is remanded to allow the parties to present their evidence on the issues made.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
