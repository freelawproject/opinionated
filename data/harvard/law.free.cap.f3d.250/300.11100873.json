For the reasons assigned we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">This matter initially came before the district court in February 1998 on appeal from the bankruptcy court. The district court then held that Beal Bank had satisfied its burden of proving its claim under La. R.S. 10:3-309(a). Specifically, our learned trial court held that Beal Bank need only prove that its assignor, HUD, had met the requirements detailed in the statute for enforcement of a lost instrument. The district court then remanded the matter to the bankruptcy court for a determination whether indemnification was required for adequate protection of the debtor. The debtor appealed. We rejected that appeal because the district court order was not a \u201cfinal order\u201d for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">Thereafter, the bankruptcy court resolved the indemnity issue. The debtor then appealed to the district court which affirmed the bankruptcy court, incorporating therein its February 1998 ruling. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-17\">During the interim between the initial district court decision and the instant appeal, a decision was rendered in <em>Southeast Investment, Inc. v. Clade.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The facts and issues in that litigation are identical to those presented herein. The district court there held that: \u201cAs the assignee of the Note, Plaintiff stands in the shoes of the FDIC and obtains all the rights, title, and interest that the FDIC had at the time of the assignment. This includes the right of enforceability under section 3-309.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As support for its holding, the court relied, <em>inter alia, </em>on the February 1998 decision by the district court <em>\u00e1 quo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On April 3, 2000 we affirmed that decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on that affirmance, we issued an opinion on February 14, 2001 affirming the judgment in the instant case. In its Petition for Panel Rehearing, the appellant notes that the question of enforceability of the underlying note in <em>Southeast Investments </em>was not an issue therein and, accordingly, our reliance on that affirmance was inappropriate. We granted rehearing to consider that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-18\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b974-19\">Louisiana Revised Statutes 10:3-309(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-20\">A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if (i) the person was in possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occurred; (ii) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure; and (iii) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>person cannot reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APc\">Section 3-309 is a modification of former \u00a7 3-804. As the comments to \u00a7 3-309 reflect, the modified version provides for the rights of \u201ca person entitled to enforce the instrument\u201d at the time of loss, and not of the \u201cowner\u201d of the instrument. Caddo Parish-Villas does not contest the fact that HUD was the \u201cperson\u201d entitled to enforce the instrument when it was lost. Nor does it claim that the loss of possession was a result of a transfer by HUD or unlawful seizure or that the instrument could not be reasonably obtained. Therefore, the sole issue for purposes of this appeal is whether Beal Bank, as an assignee of the note from the HUD, may enforce the note under \u00a7 3-309.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">Section 1-103 of the Louisiana UCC chapter mandates that, in the absence of a specific provision in that chapter, \u201cthe other laws of Louisiana shall apply.\u201d Louisiana law provides that \u201call rights may be assigned, with the exception of those pertaining to obligations that are strictly personal. The assignee is subrogated to the rights of the assignor against the debtor.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, Article 2654 provides that, \u201cThe assignor of a right must deliver to the assignee all documents in his possession that evidence the right. Nevertheless, a failure by the assignor to deliver such documents does not affect the validity of the assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The right to enforce a negotiable instrument is not a strictly personal obligation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It therefore may be assigned. It is undisputed that HUD validly assigned all of its rights under the note to Beal Bank. That assignment included any and all rights of enforcement that HUD had. Accordingly, as the assignee of HUD, Beal Bank may enforce the note against Caddo Parish-Villas upon demonstrating that HUD satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 3-309. The district court found that Beal Bank had presented sufficient evidence to prove that: (1) HUD was in possession of the note when the loss occurred; (2) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer or unlawful seizure; and (3) possession of the note cannot reasonably be obtained because its whereabouts cannot be determined. Finally, the district court also found that Beal Bank had proven the terms of the instrument by submitting a copy of the note and mortgage at the bankruptcy proceeding. The record fully supports these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Beal Bank has satisfied all of the requirements of \u00a7 3-309 and it is therefore entitled to enforce the note. The judgment appealed is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-11\">. 1999 WL 476865 (N.D.Tex., July 7, 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b974-12\">. <em>Id. </em>at *3 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b974-13\">. <em>Beal Bank, S.S.B. v.
