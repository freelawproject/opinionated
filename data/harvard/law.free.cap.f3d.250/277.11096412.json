He argues that the \u201cmailbox\u201d rule applies to appeals by <em>pro se </em>prisoners to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and thus his appeal, which was mailed but not received on the deadline for filing an appeal, should not have been dismissed as untimely. Because the regulations governing appeals to the BIA clearly require receipt of the appeal by the filing deadline, we reject Smith\u2019s argument and affirm the denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b337-27\">Harrison Smith is a citizen of Belize who has lived in the United States since 1985. A decade later, Smith was convicted of distribution of cocaine base, and the conviction became final in 1996. Thereafter, the Immigration and Naturalization Service initiated deportation proceedings against him. On April 16, 1997, an Immigration Judge found Smith deportable and notified Smith that the Board of Immigration Appeals must receive his notice of appeal by May 16, 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>1997, Harrison Smith sent his notice of appeal to the BIA by certified mail. The BIA received the notice on May 19, 1997. The BIA dismissed the appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Smith then filed a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, seeking an order from the district court directing the BIA to accept his appeal as timely filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court ultimately denied the petition, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The BIA deemed Smith\u2019s appeal untimely because it did not receive his notice of appeal until after the 30-day period for filing the appeal had lapsed. Smith contends that under the mailbox rule announced in <em>Houston v. Lack,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s notice of appeal to the BIA should be deemed timely filed when it is delivered to prison officials for mailing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The government counters by citing <em>Guirguis v. INS,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which held that the mailbox rule did not apply to appeals to this court from administrative agency decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">In <em>Houston, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a). Because the rule did not define exactly what it meant to have an appeal \u201cfiled,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Court interpreted the term in light of the circumstances <em>pro se </em>prisoners face.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court noted that <em>pro se </em>prisoners have no way of personally ensuring delivery of a notice to the court or monitoring the progress of a mailing through the postal system. In this context, the Court concluded, \u201cfiled\u201d must mean \u201cdelivered [ ] to the prison authorities for forwarding to the court clerk.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\"><em>Houston </em>interpreted an undefined term in a federal rule of procedure; it did not announce a universal rule for prisoner filings. The Supreme Court has since emphasized that when the language of the governing rule clearly defines the requirements for filing, the text of the rule should be enforced as written.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We focus our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>attention, therefore, on the text of the INS regulations establishing procedures for filing an appeal with the BIA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We shall resort to <em>Houston </em>if the rule does not clearly define filing; otherwise, we will enforce the regulations as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The timeliness of appeals to the BIA is governed by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.38 and 240.15. They require that the notice of appeal be filed within 30 calendar days of the Immigration Judge\u2019s ruling. Section 3.38 states, \u201cThe date of filing of the Notice of Appeal ... shall be the date the Notice is received by the Board [of Immigration Appeals].\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 240.15 contains virtually identical language: \u201cThe filing date is defined as the date of receipt of the Notice of Appeal by the Board of Immigration Appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This language is clear: \u201cfiled\u201d means \u201creceived by the BIA.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In this case, the Immigration Judge rendered his decision 'on April 16, 1996.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For Smith\u2019s appeal to be timely, the BIA had to receive Smith\u2019s notice of appeal by May 16,1996. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the denial of Harrison Smith\u2019s petition for relief is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-18\">. Smith was found to be deportable under sections 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 241(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">. The district court had jurisdiction over this petition. The INS issued an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing to Smith on January 9, 1997; Smith\u2019s appeal to the BIA was dismissed on July 18, 1997. Thus, Smith's petition is governed by the transitional rules of the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, \u00a7 309, Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 625-27. The transitional rules apply to deportation proceedings that commenced before April 1, 1997, and concluded after October 30, 1996. <em>See Requena-Rodriguez v. Pasquarell, </em>190 F.3d 299, 302-03 (5th Cir.1999). Under the transitional rules, federal courts have no jurisdiction to hear direct appeals from deportation orders under sections 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) or 241(a)(2)(B)(i) of the INA, but federal courts retain jurisdiction to entertain petitions of ha-beas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Requena-Rodriguez, </em>190 F.3d at 305-06.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">. 487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">. <em>See id. </em>at 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379.

The government suggests that <em>Guirguis </em>is similar to this case because both involve a challenge to an adverse deportation ruling by the BIA. <em>See id. </em>at 509.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b338-16\">. <em>See Houston, </em>487 U.S. at 272, 108 S.Ct. 2379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b338-17\">. <em>See id. </em>at 275-76, 108 S.Ct. 2379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b338-18\">. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b338-19\">. <em>See Fex v.

Also, ' we note that the holding of <em>Guirguis </em>has been superseded by the 1993 amendments to the Federal Rules, which took effect on December 1, 1993. Both Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 4 and 25 were amended to codify the mailbox rule of <em>Houston. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c), 25(a)(C). Thus, the text of the Federal Rules now explicitly applies the mailbox rule to appeals filed by inmates in both the district court and in the court of appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b339-20\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.38(c) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b339-21\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.15 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b339-22\">.
