Elliott, and admitted prior convictions of grand larceny in 1934, of indecent liberties and assault with intent to commit robbery in 1937, and of burglary in 1945. The building in question was a two-story house located at Hobart Boulevard and 30th Street in Los Angeles, the first floor being occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Elliott. The second floor contained three apartments, one of which was occupied by a Mrs. Hyde. At the rear of the house was a window which opened into the Elliott apartment, and below the window was a wood box, 5 feet 6 inches high. A stairway extended down beside the wood box from the second story.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">On the night in question, July 2, 1952, Mr. and Mrs. Elliott had retired. Both were hard of hearing and knew nothing about the attempted burglary until the next morning. The window was previously unbroken and so stuck with paint that it would not open. Mrs. Hyde arrived at the second-floor apartment about 11:30 p. m. and shortly thereafter heard the doorbell ring twice. This was followed by a crash of glass whereupon Mrs. Hyde called the police. Another crash of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>glass was heard just about the time the police arrived. George Harris, walking along the other side of 30th Street, noticed a person standing on a platform between a stairway and a window at the rear of a house across the street; the sound of breaking glass was heard, and a squad ear containing police officers arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Officers Puller and Chinnis arrived on the scene about 11:30 to 11:50 p. m. in response to a call, and upon reaching the intersection, heard the breaking of glass. Chinnis saw a man on top of the wood box facing the window and ordered the defendant to come down. Defendant said, \u201cGive me a break,\u201d but was handcuffed and put in the police car from which an escape was attempted, defendant falling down across the street and being then returned to the ear. There is testimony that Bletson stated, \u201cIf you guys will let me go I will give you a thousand dollars \u2019 \u2019; that 1 \u2018 I have done a lot of time in the pen. I am going to get out of this if I have to lie out\u201d; and that \u201cif I had had my gun with me I would have killed both of you guys as you came up. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The defendant, who resided in a house diagonally across the intersection from the Elliott home, denied being on the Elliott property, and claimed to be going to a store when arrested. There were no weapons or burglary tools found in defendant\u2019s possession, defendant\u2019s hands were not cut, and it was not known what instrument was used in breaking the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cThe evidence adduced ' at the trial was insufficient to support the verdict,\u201d in that \u201cThe evidence was weak and conflicting with regard to the commission of any offense by the appellant and should be held, therefore, to be insubstantial.\u201d In this connection appellant calls attention to certain conflicts and alleged inconsistencies in the arresting officers\u2019 testimony; that appellant possessed no burglary tools nor were his hands, cut; that no one saw defendant break the window, and that there was no evidence showing that a felonious intent existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The rule is well settled, as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Newland, </em>15 Cal.2d 678, 681 [104 P.2d 778], that an appellate court \u201cwill not attempt to determine the weight of the evidence, but will decide only whether upon the face of the evidence it can be held that sufficient facts could not have been found by the jury to warrant the inference of guilt. \u2019 \u2019  If the circumstances reasonably justify the verdict, \u201cthe opinion of the reviewing court that those circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with the innocence of the defendant will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>warrant interference with the determination of the jury.\u201d  The reviewing court \u201cmust assume in favor of the verdict the existence of every fact which the jury could have reasonably deduced from the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Applying the above stated rules to the present situation, it cannot be doubted that the evidence reflected by the record affords a substantial basis for the conviction. The crash of window glass accompanied by appellant\u2019s observed presence on a box at the broken window, coupled with .the attempted escape and appellant\u2019s various statements to the arresting officers furnished substantial material from which a jury could return a verdict of conviction. Moreover, it is difficult to see what innocent intention could be reasonably inferred under such circumstances. The attempted escape and the offering of a bribe to be released are facts from which a consciousness of guilt may well be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Reversible error is predicated upon the trial court\u2019s failure to give the jury instructions on circumstantial evidence. Various cases are cited in which a failure to give such instructions has been deemed prejudicial error, particularly where there was but slight circumstantial evidence of guilt. However, as pointed out in respondent\u2019s brief, such is not the situation in the instant case. A failure to give such an instruction is not necessarily fatal. Direct evidence placed the appellant in such an incriminating situation at almost the very moment that the window was broken, that there is no reason to believe that a different verdict would have been returned had the requested instruction been given. Corroborating circumstances including the attempted escape and bribery offers necessarily reinforce this conclusion. Whatever may be the situation in other cases, in the present prosecution the failure to give the instruction in question cannot be deemed prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The same may be said in respect to appellant\u2019s assignment that there was reversible error in the court\u2019s failure \u201cto give instructions on lesser and necessarily included offenses.\u201d Appellant insists that an instruction should have been given in respect to Penal Code, section 602, relating to wilful trespass. Appellant admits that the trial court\u2019s attention was not directly called to this matter but contends that the court was put on notice by a request to give, by number only, a CALJIC instruction relating to included offenses but mentioning no specific crime. If error there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>in this connection, it must be deemed harmless in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Finally, it is contended that the trial court erred in refusing to give a cautionary instruction concerning testimony of the police officers, \u201cwhere the testimony of such officers was in conflict with each other as well as in conflict with physical facts.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief then points out certain discrepancies in the officers\u2019 statements as to the exact time and place when the police call was received, the time and place where the crash of glass was heard, and the view which the officers had of the defendant standing in front of the broken window. As respondent\u2019s brief points out, the jury was instructed on such matters as weight of evidence, impeachment, and reasonable doubt, and the inconsistencies mentioned did not concern any vital element of the crime. No miscarriage of justice is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">White, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 25, 1953, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 11, 1953.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
