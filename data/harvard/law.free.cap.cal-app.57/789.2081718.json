The ease is similar to three others in which decisions of this court are being filed at this time. They are number 3590, <em>Delta Land &amp; Water Co. </em>v. <em>Perry et al., ante, </em>p. 314 [207 Pac. 393]; number 3591, <em>Scott et al. </em>v. <em>Delta Land &amp; Water Co. et al., ante, </em>p. 320 [207 Pac. 389], and number 3593, <em>Bradley et al. </em>v. <em>Delta Land &amp; Water Co. et al., ante, </em>p. 790 [207 Pac. 395], This case differs from the others only in that it relates to a different contract and different property. The alleged false and fraudulent representations made by the defendants and their agents and the various eircum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>stances of the transactions are so much alike that a separate statement of the particular facts of this ease is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">On the authority of the decisions above mentioned the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on June 8, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
