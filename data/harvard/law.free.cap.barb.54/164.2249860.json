P. Gillingham, who was the owner thereof. That the defendants sold the same without authority, and received therefor the sum of $19.80, or about that sum, which was the value of said calf. That thereupon a cause of action and demand for the sum of money received by the defendants for said calf, which was the fair price and value thereof, accrued to said Gillingham against the defendants. That on or about the 19th day of April, 1866, the said Gillingham, for a good and sufficient consideration, duly sold, assigned, transferred and delivered said claim and demand, against said defendants to the plaintiffs, who are now the lawful owners and holders thereof, and the sum of $19.80, besides interest, is now justly due and owing on account thereof by defendants to plaintiffs. That the defendants had promised to pay said claim and demand, but have hitherto neglected to pay the same, and said claim is wholly unpaid. That at said times, before referred to in the complaint, the plaintiffs were copartners, in the name of Hawk &amp; Eunyon, and the defendants were copartners, in the name of Thorn &amp; Marclay. That before the commencement of this action the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>plaintiffs demanded from the defendants payment of each of the claims above set forth, and'payment thereof was not made. Wherefore the plaintiffs demanded judgment against said defendants for the sum of $62.39, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">The defendants demurred to the complaint, on the ground that it appears upon the face thereof that several causes of action have been improperly united\u2014one being a money demand on contract, and the second an action of trover sounding in tort, to recover damages for wrongful conversion. And the defendants demurred to the second cause of action set forth in said complaint, and assigned the following as the ground of such demurrer: 1. That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 2. That such a cause of action, being a tort, is not assignable in law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-6\"><em>Robert N. Waite, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKn\">I. The causes of action, being based one in tort and the other in contract, are improperly united in one suit. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 167. <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Raskan, </em>12 <em>How. Pr. </em>30. <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>15 <em>id. </em>223.) It must be conceded that causes of action arising out of different transactions must be of one of the classes enumerated in sec. 167, and that one cause for contract and one for tort, cannot, under such circumstances, be united. <em>(Id. and </em>16 <em>How. Pr. </em>243.) It cannot be, even if a tort and contract could be united where the tort arose out of the contract, that a complaint upon a contract entered into at one time could be united with a tort committed upon another and subsequent occasion. <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>16 <em>How. Pr. 243.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-7\">II. In the case of <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(2 <em>Hilton </em>591 <em>and </em>595) the court says: \u201cFormerly the tort was waived by bringing an action <em>in assumpsit, </em>but, under the present system of pleading, the character of the action, and whether or not the tort is waived, must be determined by the facts stated in the complaint. The prayer for relief may some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>times determine the question, and, I \u2019 think, does in this case. The plaintiff prays judgment for the sum of $640, which is the value of the property detained, with interest. This is precisely what the law of damages would give him in an action to recover for the wrongful detention.\u201d In the present ease the complaint states the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in language usual and necessary in actions of tort. <em>(Sellar </em>v. <em>Sage, </em>12 <em>How. </em>531.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">III. The complaint does not charge that the defendants have received money to or for the use of the plaintiffs. The claim for the unlawful conversion is founded upon a tort; that for goods sold and delivered, upon a contract; they are distinct causes of action, and cannot be joined in the same suit. <em>(Cobb </em>v. <em>Dows and others, </em>9 <em>Barb. </em>230.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">In that case the learned judge, delivering the opinion of the.court, says: \u201cWhere a complaint is framed for the purpose of recovering the value of property, upon the ground of an unlawful conversion, without charging that the defendants have received money to or for the use of the plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot recover the value of the goods as money had and received to their use. <em>(See also </em>10 <em>Barb. </em>445.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">IV. A tort cannot he assigned. \u201cIt never was capable of assignment, either before or after the adoption of the Code.\u201d (3 <em>Kernan, </em>334. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 <em>Comst. </em>293. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>12 <em>Wend. </em>297. <em>People </em>v. <em>Tioga Common Pleas, </em>19 <em>id. </em>76. <em>Thurman </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>18 <em>Barb. </em>500.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-8\">V. To enable a party to maintain an action of traver and conversion, which is the second cause of action in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the plaintiffs, <em>at the time of the conversion, </em>must have property, either general or special, in the thing converted. The complaint shows that the conversion was before the assignment of the cause of action to the plaintiff. (1 <em>Chit. Pl. 3d Am. ed., marg. p. </em>150. 2 <em>Saund. Pl. </em>47. <em>Pyne </em>v. <em>Dor, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>56. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 <em>Comst. </em>293. <em>Thurman </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>18 <em>Barb. </em>500.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>Sidney S. Harris, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFp\">I. The first ground of. demurrer is untenable. The first cause, of action is on contract, as is also the second. The second cause of action alleges that one Gillingham consigned a calf to the plaintiffs. That the defendants took and received, without authority, said calf, and sold the same, and received therefor the sum of $ 19.80, which was the value of the calf. Then, the plaintiffs claim that the moneys so received on the sale of the calf belonged to Gillingham; that said claim of Gillingham was assigned to the plaintiffs, blow, upon this state of facts, Gillingham had a good cause of action against the defendants for the price of the calf. The rule is that when property, has been wrongfully taken from the owner and <em>sold, </em>the owner can sue for a conversion, or waive the tort and sue for the. money received by the wrong doer. <em>(Osborn </em>v. <em>Bell, 5 Denio, </em>370.) The plaintiffs setting forth the matters complained of as being done without rightful authority, does not make the count one for tort. These facts were necessary to be stated to raise a cause of action in assumpsit, as well as a cause of action in tort. <em>(Hobby </em>ads. <em>Bruce, 5 Leg. Obs. </em>18.) When property is wrongfully sold, and the proceeds received by the wrongdoer, this raises, in all cases, an implied assumpsit in favor of the owner, based upon the duty of the wrongdoer, to account to and pay the owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-5\">II. The second cause of action states all the facts necessary\u2014the receipt of the calf by the defendants, the sale of the same without authority, the price- received, the value of the calf, and an assignment of the same to the plaintiffs. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-6\">Cardozo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6J\">The objections raised in' this case are not tenable. When a person has unlawfully taken possession of another\u2019s property, the tort may be waived, and an action brought for its value. Such a cause of action is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>assignable. Both causes of action set forth in the complaint are founded on contract, the first express, and the other implied by law, and are properly joined.</p>\n<court id=\"b171-10\">[New York General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate id=\"ANk\">June 7, 1869.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The order below was right, and should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b171-6\">Geo. G. Barnard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAGK\">The demurrer was properly disposed of. The complaint shows that both causes of- action arose on contract. They could therefore be properly assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Judgment should be given for the plaintiff, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Clerke, P.
