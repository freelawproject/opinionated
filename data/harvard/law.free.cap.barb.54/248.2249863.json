That the said State of Forth Carolina was, at the time of the execution of said deed by the plaintiff, in a state of rebellion to, and at war with the government of the United States, and was one of the seceding states, and <em>de facto </em>one of the Confederate States of America, so-called. That before the preparation of the said deed by his counsel, he, the plaintiff, instructed him to make said deed revocable, and to, insert the name of Henry Hart therein as the trustee thereunder. That said deed was executed by the plaintiff, at the date thereof, in the State of Forth Carolina, of which state the plaintiff had been and was from the year 1861, and was up to about the month of February, 1866, a resident, citizen and freeholder; that on or about the month of February, 1866, this plaintiff came to the city of Few York. That upon.his arrival in said city, he was advised by his counsel that his acknowledgment of said deed, which had been previously made and taken in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>said State of Forth Carolina, was not valid or effectual, whereupon, and on the 28th day of February, 1866, he acknowledged said deed before an officer in the city of Hew York. That at the time of such re-acknowledgment of said deed, the plaintiff did not read or examine the same, nor was said deed in his possession or read to him, nor did he know that Mitchell Hart\u2019s name was inserted therein, as trustee; nor did he know that said deed by its terms was irrevocable, but to the' contrary thereof supposed said deed to be revocable, and that Henry Hart\u2019s name appeared as trustee therein. That the name of Mitchell Hart was inserted therein without the consent, knowledge or authority of the plaintiff. And he, the plaintiff, was not aware, and did not know of said change of trustees until in or about the month of July, 1866, when, upon a subsequent visit to the city of Hew York, said plaintiff was informed thereof by the defendant Mitchell Hart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">The \u25a0 plaintiff further, upon information and belief,' alleged that all and every the pretense, suggestion, inducement and statement, so as aforesaid made to him by said defendant Fanny, her aiders and abettors, were without foundation, force or effect, and were false, fraudulent and untrue, and were so made to induce him to execute said deed for the benefit of said Fanny and the other the said defendants, and to the exclusion of the plaintiff from all interest he had or might derive from said property so conveyed by said deed, and from all and every control thereof. That the entire estate, real and personal or mixed, covered by said deed, and granted, conveyed or transferred thereby, amounted in the aggregate to about the sum of $50,000, of which said defendant Hart as such trustee had become possessed of about $43,000 before the commencement of this action. And the plaintiff further stated that he was informed, advised and believed, and therefore alleged, that the said deed, and each and every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the provisions, accumulations, and trusts, raised and created thereby, is and are without legal validity or . effect, and is and are of no force, validity or effect as against the plaintiff, and as to him that the said deed, the various provisions thereof, the accumulations and trusts, and each and every of them created thereby were absolutely void and of no effect, as being contrary to, and against the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and that the intentions of the plaintiff as expressed in said deed and the various provisions thereof cannot, for that reason, be carried out or enforced. , That by the terms, tenor, effect, true intent and meaning of the said deed, the absolute power of alienation and absolute ownership of the property mentioned and described therein is suspended for a longer period than during the continuance of not more than two lives in being at the creation of the estate therein, that is to say, the date of said deed, against, and contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided; and the trusts and provisions of said deed creating and suspending such power of alienation and absolute ownership of said property contained in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of said deed, are absolutely void and of no effect. That by the terms, tenor, effect, true intent and meaning of the provisions of said deed, and particularly of the second, fourth and fifth paragraphs thereof, an accumulation' of the issues and profits of real property, and the interest of money and the income and profits of personal property, is directed for a longer -period and for the benefit of persons not authorized to receive the benefit of such accumulation contrary to, and against the form of the statute in such case made and provided\u2014such directions, so as aforesaid made, includes amongst the beneficiaries thereunder, an adult, the said defendant- Fanny, as well as one or more minors, and is for that 'cause absolutely void and of no effect as against the plaintiff, and that the beneficiaries thereunder acquire no right or interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>under such direction or the accumulation directed thereby. That the remainder and remainders over, provided for in and by the terms of said deed beyond the persons named as beneficiaries thereunder, are absolutely void and of no effect; that the estate thereby limited, that is to say,' such remainder and remainders are contingent and depend upon, and are not separable from, the trusts and accumulations created and directed by the provisions of said deed, and cannnot for that cause take effect, and fail. And .that the property which purports to be conveyed under and subject to the trusts, accumulations and estates created and directed thereby, did not by the terms of said deed pass out' of the plaintiff, or vest in any or either of the persons named in said deed, either as trustee or beneficiary thereunder. And the said property remains in and is vested in in the plaintiff as the absolute owner thereof, free and clear of the trusts, accumulations and estates created thereby. And that the plaintiff is entitled to the immediate possession thereof. Whereupon the plaintiff demanded judgment against the said defendants, that the said deed, and each and every the trust and trusts, perpetuity and perpetuities, remainder and remainders, estate, limitation, suspension, accumulation and contingency created or attemptde to be created thereby, be ordered and adjudged by this court to be void and of no. effect as against the plaintiff and that he be adjudged to be vested with the,' title to, and to be the owner of all and every the property, real and personal or mixed, described in said deed, and conveyed dr intended to be conveyed thereby, free and absolved from all and every trust, accumulation, limitation, perpetuity, contingency, suspension, claim or estate, interest or charge created therein or .thereupon by reason of. the provisions of said deed. And that the defendant Mitchell Hart, as such trustee, be ordered and adjudged to account to the plaintiff for such of the proceeds and income of said property, and said property so described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>as may have come to his hands, possession, or under his control; and the disposition, if any, by him made thereof, and generally his proceedings in the premises. And that this court would, by an order to be made for that purpose, enjoin and restrain the defendant Tillotson as referee, and the defendant Virginia Bee as administratrix, from paying over, delivering to, assigning, conveying or in any manner transferring to said defendant Mitchell Hart, as such trustee or assignee of the plaintiff, any property real or personal, of what name or description soever, now being and remaining in their or either of their hands as such referee or administratrix, of which the plaintiff at any time became seised, or to which he became entitled as one of the heirs at law and next of kin of Uriah P. Levy, deceased, or the distributive .shares of the plaintiff in the proceeds arising from the sale by said referee of the real estate then lately of the said Uriah P. Levy, deceased, heretofore adjudged by this court to be paid to said defendant Mitchell Hart, as such trustee, until the determination of this action, or the further order of this court. And that said defendant Mitchell Hart might, by an order of this court, be enjoined and restrained from exercising the trust, or any trust or power, or pretended trust or power, created or attempted to be created by the terms and provisions of said deed; or from demanding, collecting or receiving from any person or persons, and from in any manner interfering with, the estate, property, real or personal, distributive share or shares, income, proceeds or other interest attempted to be conveyed and transferred by, or described and included, or intended to be included, in the provisions of said deed, until the determination of this action, or the further order of this court. And that the said deed might be adjudged to be reformed and made revocable at \u25a0the will of the plaintiff, and that said defendant Hart might be adjudged to surrender the trusts, property, estate, interest and rights by him acquired, under and by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>of the provisions of said deed, and. his appointment as such trustee, be adjudged void and of no effect, and revoked.

That at the time of the execution of the said deed, the plaintiff\u2019s said wife and the said children were the beneficiaries provided for by it; the plaintiff was entitled, as one of the heirs at law and next of kin of \"Uriah P.

By the terms of the deed the grantor professed to create a trust in the property conveyed for the benefit of his wife and five minor children. This trust, it is claimed, is void as suspending the power of alienation and the absolute ownership of the real and personal property beyond the period of two lives in being when the deed was delivered. And if such is its character, it necessarily follows, as the plaintiff claims in his complaint, that it is void, and as such conveyed no title or interest whatever to the defendant. Assuming that to be its legal character, it might properly be asked, here, what right that confers upon the plaintiff\" to maintain an action in equity, concerning it. As such it cannot be even a cloud upon his title, because, if void upon its face, it can by no possibility be productive of injury to him or his estate, and for that reason will furnish no ground authorizing a court of equity to remove it, as likely to prejudice the plaintiff or his estate. <em>(Cox </em>v. <em>Clift, </em>2 <em>Comst. </em>118. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Onderdonk, </em>14 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>9. <em>Heyward </em>v. <em>City of Buffalo, Id. </em>534.) And to obtain its construction, merely, the plaintiff as the legal owner of the property has no right to maintain the action. That privilege is confined to the trustee, or those claiming under the trust and requiring its execution, and it is not broad enough to include the .party claiming, as owner, and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>may properly protect himself at law. <em>(Bowers </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>10 <em>Paige, </em>193. <em>Post </em>v. <em>Hover, </em>33 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>593, 602.) Instead, however, of dismissing the complaint on this ground, as could without any equitable impropriety be done, the question already stated, and which was argued with so much zeal and ability at the trial, will be examined and disposed of the same as though no obstacle to the equitable jurisdiction of the court stood in the way. For that may possibly lead to a useful abridgement of the litigation into which the members of the plaintiff\u2019s family have unfortunately become involved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ahm\">The trust which it is declared the plaintiff intended to create by the deed in controversy, requires the defendant Hart to collect and receive the moneys, proceeds and income arising from any disposition that may be made of the premises and property 4 granted and sold, and invest the same in good and safe interest-paying securities, and to collect and receive the interest and income arising therefrom. And also, in his discretion, the principal, and for that purpose to dispose of such securities as he shall think best, whether from interest or principal, again to invest and to reinvest, in his discretionand out of the moneys or income arising from the property granted and sold, or the proceeds thereof, to pay the expenses of executing and carrying out this trust, and a reasonable compensation to him for his services as trustee, and to apply the balance of the said income\" and the principal, so far as in his judgment may be required, to the support and maintenance of the grantor\u2019s wife and. children. And on the arrival of the youngest of said children then living at the age of twenty-one years, or upon the decease of said Mitchell and Amelia, the two youngest children, should they die before that time, to convey to the said children then living, and to the said Fanny, 4 his wife,\u2019 or to such of them as survive, and the descendants of any such of them as may be dead, the said property then remaining in trust, in equal shares and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>proportions, the descendants of the deceased child to take the share their parent, if alive, would have taken.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">These are the only provisions contained in this deed bearing upon the point whether the limitation placed upon the trust can extend its duration beyond two lives in being when the deed was delivered. It is claimed that it has that effect, because its continuance is required by the language of the deed, until the youngest of the children living at that time shall attain the age of twenty-one years; and if this was the fair construction and import of that 'language, such would undoubtedly be its effect; but the grantor in the deed immediately adds a qualification or restriction upon these terms of such a nature as to prevent the continuance of the trustee\u2019s estate beyond the lifetime of his two children, Mitchell and Amelia, then living. For, after declaring that the trustee shall convey the estate when the youngest child living shall arrive at the age of twenty-one, he adds that it shall be done upon the decease of Mitchell and Amelia, if they should die .before that time. This could not have been added for any other purpose than to limit the estate of the trustee in such a manner that it could not extend beyond two lives, namely,' those of Mitchell and Amelia. \u00cdTo other object could have been within the plaintiff\u2019s intention when he made the deed; for this clause in no manner tends to define or explain the language previously used. Indeed that required no definition or explanation whatever, for its import was clear and unmistakable. Its only office was to impose a legal limitation of what, without it, would have rendered the trust unlawful. And as such, it does not permit the trust to be extended or continued beyond the duration of the two lives mentioned. The law will not allow the duration of a trust to be continued until one person, of a class consisting of more than two, attains a certain age or dies, because he may neither attain a certain age nor die until every one of the others may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>died, which would, if valid, have the effect of extending the trust beyond the duration of two lives, and this the statute prohibits. But to declare the continuance of a trust .until one of that class shall attain a certain age, provided he does so before the death of two individuals ascertained and designated, cannot by any possibility have that effect. For it is then impossible to extend the trust beyond the lives of those two persons, and that, very obviously, is all the grantor intended or endeavored to do by this deed. The effect of the language used is, that the trust shall continue until his youngest child then living attains twenty-one years of age, in case that age is reached within the lifetime of Mitchell and Amelia. If it should be, then the trustee must convey to the plaintiff\u2019s wife and children, even if all of them should at that time be living. If that age shall not be attained while Mitchell and Amelia are living, then at their decease he must convey, if every one of the surviving children at that time continue to be minors. There can be no possibility, therefore, of the estate of the trustee extending beyond the duration of the two designated lives, and it is not within the prohibition of the statutes relating to future estates in lands or the suspension of the ownership of personal property. Both those statutes allow the title to be suspended for two lives in being and ascertained when the deed is made, and no greater suspension has been provided for in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">The second clause in the deed makes use of terms from which it might fairly be implied that the trustee was expected to accumulate the income of the property without limiting the accumulation upon the minority of the infants, or providing it for their benefit. But this is by no means made imperative on the trustee. A discretionary power only is given to him, which is very clearly controlled by the following clauses in the deed, showing that no accumulation was expected to arise under it. These clauses direct that out of the moneys or income arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>from the property, or the proceeds of it, the expenses of the trust and a reasonable compensation to the trustee should first be paid; and after defraying those, the trustee is directed to apply the balance of the said income and the principal, so/or as in his judgment may be required, to the support and maintenance of the wife and family of' the grantor. The liberty given to the trustee to resort to the principal of the estate in the event that he may deem the expenditure of a part of that required for the suitable support and maintenance of the family, is a very clear indication that the grantor did not anticipate that any accumulation would be made out of the profits or income. And under that state of the case the deed cannot be said to provide for an unlawful accumulation of the income; but even if it did, the direction only, and not the deed itself, would be void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">The result of this examination of the deed is, that the defendants are entitled to a judgment dismissing the complaint in the action, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">Judgment being entered accordingly, the plaintiff appealed to the general term.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-7\"><em>Samuel J. Crooks, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah4\">The questions involved in this appeal are more immediately connected with the terms of the deed. It is found by the judge who tried this action at special term, that one of the beneficiaries under the deed (Mrs. Levy) was an adult at the time of the execution of the deed, and that neither of the minor children had attained their majority, nor had said minors or either of them attained majority at the time of the commencement of this action. The property covered by the deed, and conveyed thereby, consisted mainly of real estate situated in- the city of Hew York. The avails of the sale of the same in partition-and by the judgment of this court, are mostly in the hands of the trustee; a small balance still remaining in the hands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the referee, the defendant Gl-ouverneur Tillotson, Esq. For the purpose of this action, the question whether the property conveyed was real or personal, can make no material difference in the final determination of the action. All the allegations material to a determination of the appeal, upon the principal questions involved, are conceded by the judge who tried the case. The appeal presents the following questions for review by this court, that is to say : 1. Do the trusts created by the terms of said deed suspend the absolute powers of alienation - and absolute ownership of the property mentioned and described therein, for a longer period than that authorized by statute; that is to say, for a longer period than during the continuance of not more than two lives in being at the date of the deed, <em>i. e., </em>creation of the estate ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\">2. Does the deed, by its terms above cited, direct an accumulation of the issues and profits of real property and the interest of money, and the income and profits of personal property for a longer period, and for the benefit of persons not authorized to receive the same, against the form of the statute in such cas.e made and provided ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-6\">If either of these questions should be answered in the affirmative, then,</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-7\">3. Does the remainder over, contingent upon the trust and- accumulation authorized and directed by the terms of said deed, take effect or fail, and the property revert, or more properly, remain in the grantor, relieved of the estates, trusts and limitations attempted to be created by said deed ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-8\">Before proceeding to state the law governing the case the plaintiff submits, it may be quite proper to presume that the scheme of the deed is this: 1st. That the income of the estate, real and personal, conveyed by the deed, should be invested in good and safe interest-paying securities, and the interest and income arising therefrom, and the principal, (if collected,) was again to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>invested and reinvested, in the discretion of the trustee, (grantee,) after payment of the expenses of executing and carrying out the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-5\">2d. That then the balance of such income, and the principal, so far as in the judgment of said trustee might be required, was to be applied to the support and maintenance of the defendant Fanny Levy, and the support, maintenance and education of the infant children of the said grantor (plaintiff) and the said Fanny, five in number.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-6\">The property was all to be kept together until the arrival of the youngest of said children then living at the age of twenty-one years, or until the decease of the two youngest children, (therein named as Mitchell and Amelia,) should they die before that time; the said property then remaining in trust was to be conveyed by said trustee to such of said children as should then be living, and the said Fanny, or to such of them as survived, and the descendants of any child that might-be dead, in equal shares and proportions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">It will be seen, and is admitted, that the entire property in controversy, (say $50,000,) except about $4000, consisted of real estate, at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed, and so continues for the purposes of this action,, and as to all the parties thereto. (3 Selden, 242.) \u201c A demise of real estate to executor with power to sell, but without directing a sale, does not effect a conversion of the real into personal estate.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-8\">I. The question of the right of the plaintiff (grantor) to maintain this action was first raised in this case by the judge (Daniels) in his opinion. Although the learned judge expresses a doubt as to such right, he does not dismiss this action for that cause, and as there is no finding disposing of this case upon that ground, the question is wholly on this court. If the question were, before this court, it is submitted that the case' is widely different in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>character from those cited by the learned judge in support of his opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">II. \u201c The provisions of the statute controlling the trusts created, and accumulations directed by this deed, and as to real property, are as follows: (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. page </em>16, \u00a7 <em>55, sub. </em>3:) \u201cExpress trusts may be created for any or either of the following purposes: To receive the rents and profits of lands and to apply them to the use of any person during the life of such person, or for any shorter term, subject to the rules prescribed in the first article of this title.\u201d \u201cAn accumulation of rents and profits of real estate for the benefit of one or more persons, may be directed by any will or deed sufficient! to pass real estate, as follows : If such accumulation be directed to commence on the creation of the estate out of which the rents and profits are to arise, it must be made for the benefit of one or more minors then in being and terminate with their minority.\u201d * * (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. p. </em>13, \u00a7 37, <em>sub. </em>1.) The same statute by part of section 38, provides that \u201call directions for the accumulation of rents and profits of real estate, except such as are herein allowed, shall be void.\u201d And by section 15, (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. p. </em>11,) \u201c The absolute power of alienation shall riot be suspended by any limitation or condition whatever, for a longer period than during the continuance of not more than two lives in being at the creation of the estate:\u201d * * And as to personal property, the provisions are as follows: (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. p. </em>75, \u00a7 3, <em>sub. </em>1,) \u201cAn accumulation of the interest of money, the produce of stock, or other increase or profits arising from personal property, may be directed by any instrument sufficient in law to pass such personal property, as follows: If the accumulation be directed to commence from the date of the instrument, or from the death of the person executing the same, such accumulation must be directed to be made for the benefit of one or more minors then in being, or in being at such death, and to terminate at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>expiration of their minority.\u201d * * By section 1 (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. p. </em>75) it is provided, that \u201c The absolute ownership of personal property shall not be suspended by any limitation or condition whatever, for a longer period than during the continuance and until the termination of not more than two lives in being at the date of the instrument containing such limitation or condition.\u201d * * It is believed to be well settled that there is no limitation upon the creation of a trust estate, in and as to personal property, either as to persons or the continuance thereof, except as to the duration of such estate as provided in section 1 (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. p. </em>75) above cited. In any view of the provisions of this deed, whetlfer the property conveyed be real or personal, can make no difference in the result to be arrived at, if the views entertained by the plaintiff are correct;</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">III. The trusts created by the terms of the deed as herein recited are absolutely void.' If of real estate, as suspending the power of alienation for a longer period than the continuance of not more than two lives in being at the date of the deed. If of personal property, as suspending the absolute ownership of such property for a like period. \u201c The power of alienation cannot be suspended for a longer period than during the continuance of not more than <em>two lives </em>in being at the creation of the estate; and every limitation by which the power of alienation <em>may </em>be suspended for a longer period is void in its creation. The lives must be <em>designated,, </em>either by naming two persons in'particular, or by limiting the estate, on the <em>first two lives which shall fall </em>in a class of several individuals. If the last two lives are taken, it is obvious that the suspense will continne for as many lives as there are persons in the class.\u201d <em>(Hawley </em>v. <em>James, </em>16 <em>Wend. </em>172, <em>Bronson, J.) </em>\u201cLife must in some form enter into the limitation, so that the power of alienation can <em>in no event </em>be suspended beyond two designated lives. Ho absolute term, however short, can be maintained.\u201d <em>(Per Bronson, J., in Hawley </em>v. <em>James, </em>16 <em>Wend. </em>64; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>and see decree entered in above ease at p. </em>274.) The ruling of Bronson, J., as above, has received the approval and been followed by the courts since. <em>(See opinion of Gridley, J., in Jennings </em>v. <em>Jennings, 7 N. Y. Rep. </em>547; <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Gott, </em>7 <em>Paige, </em>521; <em>S. C., </em>24 <em>Wend. </em>641; <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>53; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Masterton, </em>4 <em>Sandf. </em>442.) By this rule it will be seen that the power of alienation was suspended in the case at bar, or which is the same thing, might be suspended, during <em>six lives. </em>Suppose the three eldest of the five children living at the date of the deed should die, and the remaining children should arrive at the age of twenty-one years. It is clear that by the terms of the deed the estate must be kept together, and the power of alienation must be suspended during five lives, and for six if the wife Fanny *be included. It is apparent that the conveyancer in drafting this deed had in view the rules as adopted in the foregoing cases, so far as the same required the lives to be <em>designated </em>by name, but overlooked the important fact that <em>\u201cin a class of severed individuals\u201d </em>the rule required that such designation should be of the <em>\u201cfirst two lives that fall.\u201d </em>In the case at bar, the lives designated are those of the two youngest children in a class of several. If these children live, the estate as to all continues until the youngest of the two attains majority; but if the three eldest children die, the estate does not cease; although the statute has been more than satisfied in the lives of <em>three. </em>The fault is that this deed designates the two lives least likely to fall, and in doing so falls into the error which the statute was designed to remedy. The mere designation of two persons by name, upon whose lives the estate depends or during which it is to continue, is not necessarily a compliance with the statute. The lives thus designated by name, if selected from a number of individuals, (constituting a class,) beneficiaries under the same deed, may be selected in such a .manner as to continue the estate for any number of lives preceding those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>selected. Such is the case in the present instance. The rule as to designating the lives clearly means (where there is a class \u00f3f persons named as beneficiaries), that the continuance of the estate shall be made to depend upon the <em>first two lives that fall. \u201c </em>The rule is the same whatever may be the description of the property to which it is applied. It is a settled law that to render a limitation void, which if sustained would create a perpetuity, it is sufficient that the event upon which it depends <em>may happen; </em>and here the event is not only probable, but almost certain to happen.\u201d <em>(See opinion of </em>Duer, <em>J., in Andrews </em>v. <em>N. Y. Bible and Prayer Book </em>Society, 4 <em>Sandf. </em>56.) In another view, the limitation if sustained would create a perpetuity. The estate is virtually limited upon minorities. The children may all live and all attain majority. If so, the estate continues during five lives at least, by the terms of the deed. The limitation is in the disjunctive, and is until the youngest of the children attains twenty-one years, or the two youngest die, if they shall die before the youngest of the two attain majority. Clearly the event upon which the limitation depends may happen in the case as last stated. If so, the limitation is void. A limitation upon minorities is virtually a limitation upon lives. (10 <em>Barb. </em>300.) It will be noticed that the limitation upon or time during which the trust is to continue, is until <em>\u201c </em>the arrival of the youngest of said children then living at the age of twenty-one years, or until the decease of the said Mitchell and Amelia, the two youngest children, should they die before that time.\u201d This limitation does not in any sense confine or bound the continuance of the trust estate by life; on the contrary, the <em>utmost limit </em>for the continuance of the estate is fixed for the period when the youngest child arrives at the age of twenty-one years. That this event <em>may happen </em>is clear; if so the estate is limited upon an <em>absolute or certain </em>term, and. cannot be supported. The <em>utmost limit </em>for the continuance of the estate must be bounded by life, or the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>estate will be void in its creation. <em>(Hawley </em>v. <em>James, </em>before <em>cited. Boynton </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>58.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">IV. The direction in the deed for the accumulation of the trust estate, whether of real or personal property, for the benefit of an <em>adult </em>as well as minors, is void. (16 <em>Wend. </em>61. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>7 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>242; <em>and see statutes above cited.) </em>A void trust for the accumulation of the income of property invalidates the conveyance of the principal, when the direction for such accumulation involves an illegal suspension of the alienation of real and absolute ownership of personal property. (15 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>322. <em>See </em>7 <em>id. above cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\"><em>Y. </em>The remainder over is limited upon an uncertain event, and is therefore contingent, and falls with the trust term. <em>\u201c </em>Future estates are contingent while the person to whom, or the event upon which, they are limited to take effect remain uncertain.\u201d (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. p. </em>11, \u00a7 13.) The limitation in favor of the defendant Fanny the wife, and such of the children as survive and the descendants of those who do not, is a contingent remainder which from the terms of its creation cannot take effect, if at all, until the expiration of the trust term'. By the terms of the deed, the trustee is directed to convey to such persons as last aforesaid; the said property* then remaining \u201c in trust, in equal shares and proportions, the descendants of any child to take the share their parent, if alive, would have taken.\u201d Such conveyance to be made upon the happening of the contingency, or in the event \u201c of the arrival of the youngest of said children then living at the age of twenty-one years, or the death of Mitchell and Amelia, the two youngest children, should they die before that time.\u201d Clearly the event and the person to whom the remainder in this case is limited are uncertain. <em>(See </em>4 <em>Sandf. </em>442.) The doctrine as to what constitutes an illegal limitation rendering the estate void as suspending the power of alienation and absolute ownership of property, will be found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>thoroughly discussed in the cases of <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>(9 Barb. 346, 347, <em>by Wright, </em>J.;) <em>Levy </em>v. Levy, (33 N. Y. <em>Rep. </em>128, (&amp;c.;) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Rose, (Court of Appeals, Sept. </em>1864;) <em>Dodye </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>(23 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>69;) <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>(18 <em>id. </em>96;) <em>Bascom </em>v. <em>Albertson, </em>(34 id. 608, <em>&amp;c., by Porter, J.;) </em>and also in the ease of <em>Beekman </em>v. <em>Bonsor, </em>(23 id. 314, &amp;c.) The decisions in all these cases lead to the same conclusion as that arrived at by Mr. J ustice Bronson in the case of <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>James; </em>and although the courts have at times insisted upon a perversion of the plain'letter of the statute, to enforce some peculiar crochet, yet it is submitted that in no case have the court departed from the letter of the statutes, when a satisfactory arrangement of the estate could be safely left in .the hands of the ultimate owner, as in this case. The court will not bend the statute for the purpose of depriving a grantor and father, as in this case, of the ultimate disposition of his property, or the making a suitable settlement for his family. The law has clothed the head of a family with this right, of which courts, have not attempted to deprive him or her. .</p>\n<court data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b272-8\">[New York General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsL\">June 7, 1869.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-5\"><em>Clarkson N.
