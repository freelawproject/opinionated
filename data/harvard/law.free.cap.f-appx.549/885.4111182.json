Stubbs originally filed suit in Georgia state court, requesting declaratory relief and damages as a result of CitiMortgage, Inc.\u2019s attempt to foreclose on his residence. Ci-tiMortgage removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. On appeal, Stubbs raises three issues. First, he argues that the district court erred in failing to remand the case to state court for lack of jurisdiction. Second, he argues that the district court erred in dismissing the case without first giving him an opportunity to appeal the denial of his motion to remand. Finally, he argues that the district court erred in granting Citi-Mortgage\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">We review questions of federal subject matter jurisdiction and a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to remand de novo. <em>Pacheco de Perez v. AT &amp; T Co., </em>139 F.3d 1368, 1373 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">Generally, a defendant may remove to the appropriate federal district court \u201cany civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). Federal coui'ts have original diversity jurisdiction over suits between citizens of different states where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). A corporation is \u201cdeemed to be a citizen of every State and foreign state by which it has been incorporated and of the State or foreign state where it has its principal place of business.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">The district court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over this case. Diversity exists between Stubbs, a citizen of Georgia, and CitiMortgage, a corporation incorporated in New York with its principal place of business in Missouri. Further, Stubbs\u2019s complaint alleged damages in excess of $75,000. Thus, the district court properly exercised diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">The denial of a motion to remand is \u201can interlocutory order reviewable pursuant to district court certification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) or on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Woodard v. STP Corp., </em>170 F.3d 1043, 1044 (11th Cir.1999). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), an appellate court may exercise jurisdiction over such an order if (1) a district judge states in the order that he is \u201cof the opinion that such order in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>volves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,\u201d and (2) an application to appeal is made to the appropriate appellate court within ten days of such an order. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing the case without giving Stubbs an opportunity to appeal. Because the district court did not certify the issue for immediate appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1292(b), Stubbs could not seek interlocutory review of the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to remand. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in ruling on the motion to dismiss before Stubbs could appeal the denial of his motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">The district court correctly found that CitiMortgage\u2019s motion to dismiss was unopposed by Stubbs. Under the Northern District of Georgia\u2019s Local Rules, \u201c[a]ny party opposing a motion shall serve the party\u2019s response ... not later than fourteen (14) days after service of the motion .... Failure to file a response shall indicate that there is no opposition to the motion.\u201d LR 7.1(B), N.D. Ga. Furthermore, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure grant three additional days to a party who is filing in response to an action that was served by mail. Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Stubbs argues that the district court erred in finding the motion to dismiss unopposed after only nineteen days. However, under Local Rule 7.1(B) and Rule 6(d), the motion could be deemed unopposed after seventeen days. Thus, the district court did not err in finding the motion unopposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 872 (11th Cir.2008) (per cu-riam). Although we liberally construe the pleadings of pro se litigants, \u201cwe nevertheless ... require! ] them to conform to procedural rules.\u201d <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, \u201cissues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Factual allegations in a complaint \u201cmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). Thus, \u201c[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">On the merits, the arguments raised by Stubbs have no basis in Georgia law. Thus, he failed to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
