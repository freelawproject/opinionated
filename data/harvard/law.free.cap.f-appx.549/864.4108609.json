(\u201cDefendants\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-23\">This dispute arose out of the non judicial foreclosure sale of Abdullahi\u2019s property in Cumming, Georgia (\u201cProperty\u201d). In 2005, Abdullahi obtained a loan which was secured by a Security Deed on the Property. The Security Deed granted to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>(\u201cMERS\u201d), and to MERS\u2019s successors and assigns, the power of sale in the event of Abdullahi\u2019s default under the note. The Security Deed was later transferred and assigned to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LLC. BOA then became the rightful holder of the Security Deed when it merged with BAC. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-1106(a)(2) (providing that the contract rights of each party to a merger are vested automatically in the surviving corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">After Abdullahi failed to make one or more payments required under the 2005 note, BOA \u2014 through its lawyers at Pen-dergast \u2014 began foreclosure proceedings on the Property. While Abdullahi was in the process of applying for a modification of his loan, the Property was foreclosed on. Ownership of the Property was later transferred to Freddie Mac.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Abdullahi filed suit against Defendants in state court, seeking monetary damages and rescission of the foreclosure. The suit was removed to federal court. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of a case under Rule 12(b)(6), \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003). To survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, \u201ca plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">\n<em>Wrongful Foreclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">On appeal, Abdullahi challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim for wrongful foreclosure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Georgia, \u201ca plaintiff asserting a claim of wrongful foreclosure [must] establish a legal duty owed to it by the foreclosing party, a breach of that duty, a causal connection between the breach of that duty and the injury it sustained, and damages.\u201d <em>Heritage Creek Dev. Corp. v. Colonial Bank, </em>268 Ga.App. 369, 601 S.E.2d 842, 844 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">Because BOA was the only \u201cforeclosing party\u201d and because Abdullahi failed to allege that either Freddie Mac or Pendergast owed him a specific legal duty, the district court dismissed properly Abdullahi\u2019s claim for wrongful foreclosure against Freddie Mac and Pendergast.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">Abdullahi has also not alleged sufficiently that BOA breached a legal duty or that such a breach caused his injuries. On the day of the foreclosure, BOA was the rightful holder of the Security Deed. The Security Deed grants explicitly the \u201csuccessors and assigns of MERS\u201d the power of sale and \u201cthe right to foreclose and sell the Property\u201d in the event of Abdullahi\u2019s default. Because Abdullahi defaulted on the loan, BOA was entitled to foreclose on the Property. BOA breached no duty to Abdullahi. And Abdullahi\u2019s complained-of injuries were caused proximately by Abdullahi\u2019s own failure to make loan payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>On appeal, Abdullahi contends that the foreclosure notice letter<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> violated O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-162.2 because it failed to identify the <em>secured creditor. </em>This argument differs from Abdullahi\u2019s complaint, in which he alleged only that the foreclosure notice letter failed to identify the <em>oumer of the loan. </em>In any event, the Georgia Supreme Court has concluded that section 44-14-162.2 does not categorically require the foreclosure notice to name either the secured creditor or the note holder. <em>See You v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>293 Ga. 67, 743 S.E.2d 428, 433-34 (2013). Instead, the notice must name \u201cthe individual or entity who shall have full authority to negotiate, amend, and modify all terms of the mortgage with the debtor.\u201d Because Abdullahi\u2019s complaint alleged only that the foreclosure letter failed to identify the owner of the loan \u2014 and did not allege that the owner of the loan was in fact the entity with full authority to negotiate, amend, and modify the mortgage \u2014 Abdullahi has not alleged sufficiently a violation of Georgia law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">\n<em>Promissory Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Abdullahi argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claim for promissory estoppel based on BOA\u2019s alleged promise that the foreclosure sale had been rescinded. To state a claim for promissory estoppel under Georgia law, Abdullahi must allege \u201cthat (1) defendant made certain promises, (2) defendant should have expected that plaintiffs would rely on such promises, (3) the plaintiffs did in fact rely on such promises to their detriment, and (4) injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\u201d <em>Canterbury Forest Ass\u2019n v. Collins, </em>243 Ga.App. 425, 532 S.E.2d 736, 739 (2000). \u201cPromissory estoppel cannot be applied unless the promisee reasonably relied on the promise.\u201d <em>Gerdes v. Russell Rowe Commc\u2019ns, </em>232 Ga.App. 534, 502 S.E.2d 352, 354 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Abdullahi\u2019s promissory estoppel claim is based on these statements made by BOA employee Stephanie Beal:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (1) Beal was told that the Property had been sold, but had been told that it was \u201cpossible\u201d to have the foreclosure rescinded; (2) that her supervisor and the underwriter had put in \u201cescalated requests\u201d to have the foreclosure rescinded; (3) that she had been told that the foreclosure had been rescinded; and (4) that BOA\u2019s computer system still showed that the Property had been foreclosed on and that it may take time for the system to be updated.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Nothing in these statements constituted a promise by BOA to rescind the foreclosure sale. Instead, Beal was merely relaying what she understood the status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>of Abdullahi\u2019s foreclosure proceedings to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Even if Beal\u2019s statements could be construed as a promise, Abdullahi has not alleged sufficiently that his reliance on those statements was reasonable. First, Beal \u2014 a Home Servicing Specialist in BOA\u2019s Loan Modification Department\u2014 told Abdullahi expressly that she was \u201cnot in the foreclosure department\u201d and had no \u201cupdated status information\u201d on foreclosures. Thus, Abdullahi had no good reason to believe that Beal had authority to make promises about his foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Second, the Security Deed provided expressly that \u201c[extension of the time for payment or modification of amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument ... shall not operate to release the liability of Borrower.... \u201d The Security Deed also described the circumstances under which Abdullahi could reinstate after acceleration of his loan payments and made clear that Abdullahi\u2019s failure to cure a default authorized BOA to invoke its power of sale. Based on the Security Deed\u2019s \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d language, Abdullahi could not rely reasonably on Beal\u2019s representations about the possibility of a rescission. <em>See Gerdes, </em>502 S.E.2d at 355 (rejecting a promissory estoppel claim when the \u201cclear and unambiguous provision [in an employment contract] served to place appellant on due notice that he could not thereafter reasonably rely upon any words or other course of dealing to his inducement, other than a modification agreement actually reduced to writing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ABM\">\n<em>Constructive Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">To state a claim for constructive fraud under Georgia law, Abdullahi must allege, among other things, the existence of a confidential relationship between himself and Defendants. <em>See Delta Diversified, Inc. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>171 Ga. App. 625, 320 S.E.2d 767, 776 (1984). A confidential relationship exists \u201cwhere one party is so situated as to exercise a controlling influence over the will, conduct, and interest of another.... \u201d <em>First Union Nat\u2019l Bank v. Gurley, </em>208 Ga.App. 647, 431 S.E.2d 379, 381 (1993). \u201cThe mere fact that one reposes trust and confidence in another does not create a confidential relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Abdullahi has the burden of showing the existence of a confidential relationship. <em>See Jerry Dickerson Presents, Inc. v. Concert/Southern Chastain Promotions, </em>260 Ga.App. 316, 579 S.E.2d 761, 770 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Abdullahi has failed to allege sufficiently the existence of a confidential relationship with Defendants. Georgia courts have said that \u201cno confidential relationship [exists] between a bank and its customers borrowing funds.\u201d <em>Delta Diversified, Inc., </em>320 S.E.2d at 776; <em>see also Dixie Diners Atlanta v. Gwinnett Fed. Bank FSB, </em>211 Ga.App. 364, 439 S.E.2d 53, 56 (1993) (\u201cThere is, moreover, <em>particularly </em>no confidential relationship between lender and borrower ... for they are creditor and debtor with clearly opposite interests .... \u201d). And Abdullahi cannot show that he had a confidential relationship with Pendergast, when Pendergast was representing BOA in the foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-14\">. Because Abdullahi does not challenge the district court's dismissal of his claims for quiet title, violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and for injunctive relief, these claims are abandoned. <em>See Access Now, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004). For the same reason, Ab-dullahi has also abandoned his motion for leave to amend his first amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-26\">. Abdullahi\u2019s complaint also named as a defendant BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, which has since merged with BOA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\">. In support of his wrongful foreclosure claim, Abdullahi raises here two arguments that were not raised in the district court: (1) that he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on the day of the foreclosure sale and, thus, the foreclosure sale was prohibited by an automatic stay; and (2) that the foreclosure newspaper advertisements were defective. We do not review issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b891-6\">. Abdullahi received three notice letters. Because he does not challenge expressly the district court's dismissal of his claims for attempted wrongful foreclosure based on the first two foreclosure notices, he has abandoned that argument. <em>See Access Now, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">. Abdullahi also argues that the district court misconstrued his argument about the enforceability of the promissory note. To preserve an issue for appeal, a party \"must first clearly present it to the district court ... in such a way as to afford the district court an opportunity to recognize and rule on it.\" <em>Juris v. Inamed Corp., </em>685 F.3d 1294, 1325 (11th Cir.2012). Nowhere in his complaint does Ab-dullahi raise clearly the issue he now asserts on appeal: that the promissory note was unenforceable because it was not delivered properly to the lender. Because this argument was presented for the first time on appeal, it is waived. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b891-13\">.Because Abdullahi makes no allegations about promises made by Freddie Mac or by Pendergast, he stated no claim for promissory estoppel against those defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
