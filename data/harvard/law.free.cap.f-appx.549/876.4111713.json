No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Reyes was employed by Goya as a \u201csales broker.\u201d After Goya terminated Reyes\u2019s employment, Reyes filed suit against Goya, seeking overtime pay under the FLSA. The case proceeded to a jury trial, during which Reyes presented the testimony of five witnesses, including himself. At the conclusion of Reyes\u2019s case-in-chief, Goya moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). The district court granted Goya\u2019s motion, determining that Reyes qualified as an \u201coutside salesman\u201d within the meaning of the FLSA and, thus, was exempt from the Act\u2019s overtime pay provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for directed verdict, we apply the same standard of review as applied by the district court. <em>Carter v. Miami, </em>870 F.2d 578, 581 (11th Cir.1989). A directed verdict is granted properly if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, \u201cpoint[s] overwhelmingly in favor of one party, such that reasonable people could not arrive at a contrary verdict.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Broadly speaking, the FLSA provides that employees are entitled to receive overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of forty hours. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). But the Act exempts expressly \u201coutside salesmen\u201d from this provision. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 213(a). The employer bears the burden of proving that an employee qualifies as an outside salesman. <em>See Gregory v. First Title of Am., Inc., </em>555 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The term \u201coutside salesmen\u201d is defined as an employee \u201c[wjhose primary duty is ... making sales ... and ... [w]ho is customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer\u2019s place ... of business in performing such primary duty.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.500(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">\u201cDetermination of an employee\u2019s primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case, with the major emphasis on the character of the employee\u2019s job as a whole.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.700(a). Some of the factors we may consider when determining an employee\u2019s primary duty are \u201cthe relative importance of the exempt duties as compared with other types of duties; the amount of time spent performing exempt work; the employee\u2019s relative freedom from direct supervision; and the relationship between the employee\u2019s salary and the wages paid to other employees .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Exempt outside sales work includes \u201cwork performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee\u2019s own outside sales\u201d and \u201cother work that furthers the employee\u2019s sales efforts.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.500(a). That an employee is compensated on a commission basis supports a determination that the employee is an \u201coutside salesman.\u201d <em>See Gregory, </em>555 F.3d at 1309-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Reyes characterizes his primary duty with Goya as \u201cmerchandizing\u201d which included restocking store shelves, cleaning the products, and rotating merchandise. To the extent that Reyes spent time selling Goya products, Reyes alleges that he merely placed orders to replenish products already carried by his assigned retail stores. Reyes contends that he was not a salesman because he had no authority to negotiate the prices of Goya\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Reyes\u2019s characterization of his duties as a sales broker for Goya is contradicted entirely by the testimony of Reyes\u2019s other witnesses: two Goya sales brokers each with nearly 20 years\u2019 experience, Reyes\u2019s direct supervisor, and Goya\u2019s vice president of sales. Each of these witnesses testified that a sales broker\u2019s primary duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>is to sell Goya products. Sales brokers are given weekly sales goals and are expected to talk regularly with their assigned retail store managers to promote new Goya products, request better product placement, and to reorder inventory. The witnesses testified consistently that Goya sales brokers did not report to the Goya offices on a regular basis except to attend monthly sales meetings, worked with little supervision, set them own schedules, and were paid a commission based on their individual volume of sales. According to each witness, duties such as restocking store shelves, cleaning inventory, and rotating inventory \u2014 duties that Reyes contends are non-exempt \u2014 are performed regularly by Goya sales brokers in conjunction with and in furtherance of their own sales efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Reyes, the evidence demonstrates that\u2014 although Reyes may have personally spent little time promoting Goya products \u2014 his position as a sales broker at Goya qualified him as an \u201coutside salesman\u201d under the FLSA. Because the evidence presented at trial \u201cpoint[ed] overwhelmingly in favor of\u2019 Goya, the district court granted properly Goya\u2019s motion for directed verdict.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b902-7\"> Because we conclude that Reyes was an \"outside salesman\u201d exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime wage provisions, we need not address Reyes's remaining three arguments: (1) that the district court erred in determining that Defendant Frank Unanue could not be held individually liable under the FLSA for Reyes's unpaid overtime wages; (2) that this case should be reassigned to a new district judge on remand due to judicial bias; and (3) that the district court erred by excluding portions of Unanue\u2019s deposition from being read to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
