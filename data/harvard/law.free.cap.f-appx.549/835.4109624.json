He pled guilty to one count of possessing and one count of distributing child pornography. From age 9 to 14, Heaton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>had been subject to regular, sexual, sadistic, and masochistic abuse by a male family friend. As an adult, Heaton was diagnosed with considerable anxiety and partial Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d), which developed as a result of his childhood abuse. Heaton\u2019s psychological evaluation indicated that, while he met the criteria for pedophilia, his interest in viewing child pornography that depicted young children and sadistic and masochistic acts was likely an effort to understand his own memories of abuse. Additionally, when Heaton was 26, he was convicted of child molestation. This prior conviction raised Heaton\u2019s statutory mandatory minimum sentence from 5 to 15 years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1). Heaton denies that the molestation ever occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">On appeal, Heaton argues that the 15-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment violated the Eighth Amendment as applied to his case because the district court\u2019s adherence to the mandatory minimum required that the court ignore the extensive sexual abuse and torture that Heaton endured as a child, and the PTSD that Heaton developed as a result of this trauma. Heaton argues that courts must graduate and proportion the punishment for a crime to both the offender and the offense, thus making his personal circumstances a required consideration. He claims that his sentence was grossly disproportionate to the offense, especially when taking into account his abuse and reduced mental capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legality of a sentence under the Eighth Amendment. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The Eighth Amendment provides that \u201c[ejxcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VIII. \u201cIn non-capital cases, the Eighth Amendment encompasses, at most, only a narrow proportionality principle.\u201d <em>United States v. Brant, </em>62 F.3d 367, 368 (11th Cir.1995). To determine whether an Eighth Amendment violation has occurred, we first must make \u201ca threshold determination that the sentence imposed is grossly disproportionate to the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only after determining that the sentence is grossly disproportionate to the offense, do we address the remaining \u201cSolem factors\u201d \u2014 the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction, and the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions. <em>Id.; Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 292, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 3011, 77 L.Ed.2d 637, (1983). The burden is on the defendant to make the threshold showing that his sentence is grossly disproportionate to the offense committed. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">\u201cOutside the context of capital punishment, <em>successful </em>challenges to the proportionality of sentences are exceedingly rare,\u201d largely because we accord substantial deference to Congress\u2019s broad authority in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes. <em>United States v. Road, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn general, a sentence within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1243 (holding that a 140-year sentence for producing and distributing child pornography was not cruel and unusual because the sentence was within the statutory limits, and, thus, was not disproportionate to the offense) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">We have never found a term of imprisonment to violate the Eighth Amendment, and \u201coutside the special category of juvenile offenders[,] the Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>found only one.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1343 (11th Cir.2010). The Supreme Court\u2019s precedent clearly establishes \u201cthat the mandatory nature of a non-capital penalty is irrelevant for proportionality purposes.\u201d <em>Id.; see Miller v. Alabama, </em>567 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 2469-70, 183 L.Ed.2d 407 (2012) (holding narrowly that mandatory life sentences without parole were prohibited for juvenile offenders). In <em>Farley, </em>we explained that the one case in which the Supreme Court held that a non-capital sentence imposed on an adult violated the Eighth Amendment involved a sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed on a petty criminal who wrote a bad check for $100, and whose prior crimes were relatively minor and nonviolent. <em>Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1337 (citing <em>Solem, </em>463 U.S. at 280, 103 S.Ct. at 3005). We also noted that, not only were all of the crimes committed in <em>Solem </em>nonviolent, none were crimes against a person. <em>Id. </em>at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">By contrast, <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 961, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 2684, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991), involved a defendant who was convicted of possessing 672 grams of cocaine and sentenced to life without parole. The Supreme Court explained that the crime in <em>Harmelin </em>was far more serious than the relatively minor, nonviolent, passive crime in <em>Solem. Id. </em>at 1001-02, 111 S.Ct. at 2705-06. The Court explained that the \u201c[possession, use, and distribution\u201d of illegal drugs threatened grave harm to society, not only because of the pernicious effects of drug use on the users, but also because the sale of drugs often leads to additional, violent crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 1002-03, 111 S.Ct. at 2705-06. Because of these ill effects, state legislatures are permitted to decide that the threat posed to the individual and society by the possession of such a large amount of cocaine \u2014 \u201cin terms of violence, crime, and social displacement \u2014 is momentous enough to warrant the deterrence and retribution of a life sentence without parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1003, 111 S.Ct. at 2706. Furthermore, the Supreme Court held that imposing a mandatory sentence of such severity without any consideration of mitigating factors, such as the defendant\u2019s lack of prior felony convictions, may be cruel, but was not unusual. <em>Id. </em>at 994, 111 S.Ct. at 2701.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in sentencing Heaton to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Heaton\u2019s case \u201cis not one of those extraordinary cases, one of those exceedingly rare situations, in which the specified term of imprisonment violates the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>See Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1344. Like in <em>Harmelin </em>and unlike in <em>Solem, </em>Heaton\u2019s crime was of a socially destructive nature, not a \u201crelatively minor, nonviolent crime.\u201d <em>See Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. at 1002, 111 S.Ct. at 2705-06; <em>Solem, </em>463 U.S. at 281, 303, 103 S.Ct. at 3005, 3016-17. Like the drug crime in <em>Harmelin, </em>Heaton\u2019s acquisition, possession, and distribution of thousands of images \u2014 depicting adults conducting lewd and cruel acts on very young children\u2014 served to support a socially destructive industry that is built on torturing and traumatizing young children. <em>See New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 757-58 &amp; 758 n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3355 &amp; n. 9, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (agreeing with a New York legislative finding that \u201cthe use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child\u201d and to children as a whole and emphasizing that preventing such harm is \u201ca government objective of surpassing importance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Moreover, Heaton\u2019s prior offense of child molestation, which was responsible for increasing his mandatory minimum sentence from 5 to 15 years, was a crime against a person, specifically, a child, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>was violent and predatory in nature. Unlike in <em>Solem, Harmelin, </em>and <em>Miller, </em>where defendants were sentenced to life without parole, the harshest sentence apart from the death penalty, Heaton received only 15 years. <em>See Miller, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2469-70; <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. at 1002, 111 S.Ct. at 2705-06; <em>Solem, </em>463 U.S. at 281, 303, 103 S.Ct. at 3005, 3016-17. Further, unlike the defendant in <em>Miller, </em>Heaton was an adult male. Because Heaton was not a juvenile and received a more lenient sentence than life, Miller\u2019s narrow holding does not apply here. <em>See Miller, </em>567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2469-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">According to our precedent and that of the Supreme Court, Heaton\u2019s sentence was not unconstitutional. The receipt of a 15-year sentence for the offense committed, given Heaton\u2019s past conviction, does not meet the rigorous standard required to find a term of imprisonment, imposed on an adult, so grossly disproportionate as to be cruel and unusual. <em>See Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1343; <em>Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1243. Based on the above analysis, we hold that Heaton has failed to make a threshold showing that imposing his sentence at the statutory minimum violated the Eighth Amendment. Accordingly, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
