Cain, </em>149 F.3d 374, 376-78 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that under the prison mailbox rule, a prisoner is deemed to have filed a document in federal court when he deposits it in the prison mail system). The notice of appeal was not timely as to the district court\u2019s final judgment entered on June 24, 2009, or any of the district court\u2019s orders entered prior to August 2012. <em>See </em>FED. R. APP. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to consider those decisions in the instant appeal. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Nevertheless, because the notice of appeal was filed within 60 days of the district court\u2019s entry of an order denying six post-judgment motions filed on July 12, 2012, we have the requisite jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Even with the benefit of liberal construction, Villalon does not challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his July 12, 2012, motions or the court\u2019s determination that the motions were filed in the wrong case. By failing to do so, Villalon has waived the only issues over which this court has jurisdiction. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999). Moreover, the July 12, 2012, motions were, in essence, meaningless, unauthorized motions which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, Villalon\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and it is DISMISSED as frivolous, <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
