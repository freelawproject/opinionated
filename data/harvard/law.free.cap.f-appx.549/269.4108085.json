Lockett, Jr., guilty of six counts of income tax evasion. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>motion for release on bond pending sentencing. Following a hearing, the district court denied the motion on the ground that Lockett failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he would not be a flight risk and danger to the community if released pending sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">A convicted defendant does not have a constitutional right to bail. <em>United States v. Olis, </em>450 F.3d 583, 585 (5th Cir.2006). A defendant \u201cwho has been found guilty of an offense and who is awaiting imposition ... of sentence\u201d shall be detained pending sentencing \u201cunless the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Lockett does not dispute the district court\u2019s factual findings on the issues of flight risk and danger to the community. Instead, he argues that the district court violated his rights to due process and confrontation when it allowed, over his objections, the introduction of hearsay evidence at the hearing on his motion for release on bond pending sentencing. However, even if we do not consider the few challenged instances of hearsay testimony, the totality of the evidence adduced at the bond hearing clearly supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Lockett has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that he is not a flight risk or a danger to the community. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(1). Lock-ett\u2019s challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">AFFIRMED. Lockett\u2019s motion for bond pending judgment is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
