As part of the conspiracy, Lopez received fraudulent credit cards from co-defendant Manuel La-Brada. Lopez used the credit cards to buy diesel fuel and sell it to truck drivers at a discounted price. Lopez and LaBrada then split the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">On appeal, Lopez argues that, despite his sentencing objections, the government failed to present sufficient and reliable evidence to support the application of two sentencing enhancements: (1) a 4-level enhancement because the offense involved 50 or more victims, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(B); and (2) an 8-level enhancement for a fraud loss of more than $70,000, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2B 1. 1(b)(1)(E). For the reasons that follow, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-18\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the interpretation and application of the Guidelines, and reviews underlying factual findings, including the district court\u2019s calculation of the number of victims and amount of loss, for clear error. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 892, 894-95 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWhen the government seeks to apply an enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines over a defendant\u2019s factual objection, it has the burden of introducing \u2018sufficient and reliable\u2019 evidence to prove the necessary facts by a preponderance of the evidence\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number><em>United States v. Washington, </em>714 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th Cir.2013). \u201c[A]bsent a stipulation or agreement between the parties, an attorney\u2019s factual assertions at a sentencing hearing do not constitute evidence that a district court can rely on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the government knew of the defendant\u2019s objection and had an opportunity to introduce relevant evidence, the government will not be permitted to present evidence at resentencing absent special circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1362-63. Circuit courts have broad discretion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 to fashion an appropriate mandate on remand after the vacatur of a sentence. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>606 F.3d 1303, 1304 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">A. VICTIM ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Lopez first challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a 4-level enhancement for the number of victims. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, if an offense involved 50 or more victims, the offense level is increased by 4 levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(B). Application Note 1 defines a \u201cvictim\u201d in part as \u201cany person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection (b)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 comment, (n.l). Application Note 4(E) further defines a \u201cvictim\u201d in a case involving \u201cmeans of identification\u201d as \u201cany individual whose means of identification was <em>used </em>unlawfully or without authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 comment. (n.4(E)(ii)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">In the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI), the probation office recommended a 4-level enhancement based on the number of victims involved in Lopez\u2019s offense. The PSI stated: \u201cThe government has provided several lists of credit card numbers that were found during the investigation of the instant offense\u201d and that \u201c[a] review of that information revealed that a total of 115 individuals and four banking institutions were victims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Lopez objected in writing and at the sentencing hearing to the 4-level victim enhancement. At the sentencing hearing he argued that the only victims were people who suffered actual losses or whose identification and credit card numbers were \u201cused.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">The government did not present any witnesses or exhibits to support the number of victims it alleged were involved, nor did it present evidence to show which card numbers were used. The probation officer, who participated in the hearing but did not testify as a witness, stated that \u201cjust passing along the credit card numbers from one person to another ... accounts for use of the card.\u201d The government argued that \u201csomeone whose identity is stolen\u201d counts as a victim. After listening to each side\u2019s argument, the district court overruled Lopez\u2019s objection and sentenced him with the 4-level enhancement recommended by the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">After Lopez\u2019s sentencing hearing, we clarified the meaning of the phrase \u201cwas used\u201d in the commentary to the victim enhancement guideline in another case involving identity theft and fraudulent use of credit cards, <em>United States v. Hall, </em>704 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.2013). In Hall we found that the \u201cmere transfer of the personal identifying information, without more action, did not employ that information for the purpose for which the conspiracy was intended-the procurement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>fraudulent credit cards and cash advances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322. It was not until the co-conspirators secured the fraudulent credit cards that the personal information \u201cwas used\u201d and the individuals became victims for the purposes of a \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2) enhancement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">In light of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hall, </em>the district court\u2019s finding here that there were more than 50 victims is incorrect. The mere theft or possession of the personal information was insufficient under this guideline section to make someone a victim, because the \u201cpersonal identifying information was not used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322. Only those individuals whose information was used to make a fraudulent credit card or to make purchases constituted victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Unlike in <em>Hall, </em>the record here is not clear as to the number of victims whose identification \u201cwas used,\u201d as opposed to transferred. Because <em>Hall </em>was decided after Lopez\u2019s sentencing hearing, we remand to permit the parties to present evidence and allow the district court to resentence Lopez in accordance with the meaning of this phrase as established in <em>Hall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">B. AMOUNT OF LOSS ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Lopez also challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the amount of loss was more than $70,000, which in turn supported an 8-level enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(E). Lopez objected to the loss amount calculation in the PSI and at the sentencing hearing. Lopez questioned whether additional card numbers found on computers seized during the arrest or the loss amount related to those cards had been adequately tied to him or the conspiracy. Specifically he objected to paragraph 17 of the PSI during the sentencing hearing. Instead of all 115 individual\u2019s cards, he argued he should only be responsible for the loss amounts associated with the 28 cards he and his co-defendant had in their possession when they were arrested. Thus the objections raised two factual issues: which card numbers were attributable to Lopez and should be included in the calculation, and whether the losses alleged on those cards were attributable to the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">In response, the probation officer, who was not sworn or called as a witness, said that Lopez was held accountable for all of the card numbers because of his participation in the conspiracy, describing it as \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d The government made additional arguments to support the probation officer\u2019s statements, asserting that the existence of additional numbers on the computers was a reasonably foreseeable act in furtherance of the conspiracy. The government did not offer any witnesses or exhibits. Instead the government relied on the PSI report, the probation officer\u2019s statements, and its own factual assertions. Again the district court overruled Lopez\u2019s objection and sentenced Lopez using the 8-level loss amount enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">In light of Lopez\u2019s objections, however, we must consider whether there was sufficient and reliable evidence to support a finding that the card numbers on the co-defendant\u2019s computers and the alleged losses associated with those cards could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>attributed to Lopez. <em>Washington, </em>714 F.3d at 1361. We remand because the government did not present sufficient and reliable evidence at the sentencing hearing of the loss amount for these 115 individuals\u2019 cards. Even if Lopez\u2019s admissions in his factual proffer were sufficient to establish that the card numbers found on the computers constituted relevant conduct under the Guidelines, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), Lopez questioned whether the losses associated with any card numbers from the computers were attributable to the conspiracy. In response the government did not submit any evidence to show dates, amounts, or other factual information that would have established by a preponderance those losses and their connection to the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Because the government had ample notice of the defendant\u2019s sentencing objection and a full opportunity to introduce relevant evidence, we decline to allow the presentation of new evidence on this issue. <em>Washington, </em>714 F.3d at 1362. Lopez concedes a $24,000 loss amount. We therefore remand for resentencing with a 4-level increase. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(C) (providing for 4-level increase for loss amount more than $10,000 and less than $30,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">We vacate Lopez\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing in accordance with this opinion. Because we have found Lopez\u2019s sentence was procedurally unreasonable based on the calculation errors discussed above, we do not reach Lopez\u2019s argument that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-8\">. Lopez also claimed, in his objections below and on appeal, that those individuals who were reimbursed by their banks should not be classified as victims. This argument is foreclosed by Application Note 4(E) to \u00a7 2B1.1, which defines a victim in identify theft cases as, in addition to one who has sustained a loss, one \"whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\" <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.4(E)(ii)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-8\">. The government tries to cast Lopez\u2019s objection to this enhancement as a legal one. The government argues that Lopez is not contesting the fact that the additional numbers existed, but rather he is claiming he should not be held responsible for the additional numbers. However, we read Lopez\u2019s objections to raise questions of fact about the loss amounts that placed an evidentiary burden on the government. Thus, we reject the government\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
