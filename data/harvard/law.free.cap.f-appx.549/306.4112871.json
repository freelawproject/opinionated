He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court sentenced him within his guidelines range to 32 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-23\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Vallejo-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence was within his advisory guidelines range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Vallejo-Gonzalez wishes to preserve for further review the argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to within-guidelines sentences calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis. As conceded by him, such an argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 232-33 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Vallejo-Gonzalez argues that his sentence was greater than necessary because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis and gives heavy weight to a defendant\u2019s criminal history through enhancements, such as his crime-of-violence enhancement, that are based on prior convictions. He notes that the conviction underlying his crime-of-violence enhancement was not assessed any criminal history points because it occurred too long ago. He further contends that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his instant illegal reentry offense and failed to reflect his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The district court listened to Vallejo-Gonzalez\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence but found that a 32-month sentence was appropriate. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Vallejo-Gonzalez has not shown that his sentence was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.
