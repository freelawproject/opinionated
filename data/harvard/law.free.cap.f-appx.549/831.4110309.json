Arbor Station brought an unlawful detainer action against Franklin in state court and was awarded a judgment of possession. In the federal district court, Franklin filed a complaint and a motion for a temporary restraining order against Arbor Station to prevent it from acting on the writ of possession. She based her claim for federal jurisdiction on the fact that her complaint that the state courts violated her due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and that Arbor Station and Parnell violated the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. She filed two motions to amend, and both proposed amended complaints included claims against the two state court judges who had decided the unlawful detainer action. The district court granted Franklin\u2019s second motion to amend in part but directed her that because the state court judges were entitled to absolute judicial immunity, her amended complaint should not include claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Franklin submitted a third and then fourth amended complaint, omitting her claims against the state court judges. The fourth amended complaint raises claims against Arbor Station; its attorney, Justin Parnell; and its law firm, Parnell <em>&amp; </em>Crum, PA. Franklin filed a motion to amend her complaint yet again, proposing to add claims against Arbor Station employees, Montgomery County Courts, and Montgomery County. The court did not consider Franklin\u2019s motion to amend and dismissed her fourth amended complaint without prejudice, concluding that all of her claims were barred by res judicata and that her complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Franklin contends that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint, in ordering her to file an amended complaint containing no claims against the state court judges, and in refusing to consider her proposed fifth amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of an <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted, viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). We may affirm a district court\u2019s judgment on any ground supported by the record. <em>Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cnty., </em>480 F.3d 1072, 1088 n. 21 (11th Cir.2007). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the district courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to review state court final judgments because \u201cthat task is reserved for state appellate courts or, as a last resort, the United States Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies \u201cboth to federal claims raised in the state court and to those \u2018inextricably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>intertwined\u2019 with the state court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A claim brought in federal court is inextricably intertwined with a state court judgment if it would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the state court judgment or if it \u201csucceeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The doctrine does not apply if a party did not have a \u201creasonable opportunity to raise his federal claim in state proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Although Franklin does not directly request that the district court vacate or review the state trial court\u2019s decisions, all of her federal claims are complaints of injuries caused by the state court\u2019s decision in favor of Arbor Station on its unlawful detainer claim and the corresponding grant of a writ of possession. The district court could not decide in Franklin\u2019s favor on any of those counts unless it decided that the state court erred in its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The district court could not decide Count 17 (unlawful threat to evict her based on the writ of possession) in Franklin\u2019s favor unless it necessarily decided the writ of possession was wrongfully issued by the state court. Similarly, the district court could not decide in Franklin\u2019s favor on Count 18 (litigating an unlawful detain-er action despite a lack of service of process) without deciding that the state trial court erroneously determined that service of process was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Counts 9, 11, 12, and 13 all involve alleged misrepresentations made by Arbor Station and Parnell to the state trial court, in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The only way these alleged misrepresentations could have injured Franklin is by convincing the state court to rule against her. So those claims cannot be decided in her favor without determining that the state court\u2019s decisions were error. Count 14 alleges that Arbor Station made misrepresentations to the district court when it told the district court that the state court judge had dismissed the appeal because, according to her, the judge only \u201cpurported\u201d to dismiss the appeal. This claim necessarily rests on her contention that the state court improperly remanded her appeal before she perfected it, so the district court could not find in her favor on this claim without concluding that the state court\u2019s disposition of her appeal was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">In Counts 15 and 16, Franklin alleges that Arbor Station violated FDCPA by threatening to collect and collecting \u201cprohibited legal fees.\u201d The Alabama Code provides for a landlord to recover \u201creasonable attorney fees\u201d incurred in enforcing a rental agreement. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 35-9A-421. Although Franklin asserts in her complaint that Arbor Station \u201ccould not legally collect said fees,\u201d that determination was one for the state court to make in deciding the unlawful detainer action. Under <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>we cannot overturn that determination. To the extent that Franklin\u2019s complaint alleges violations of her Fourteenth Amendment rights (not made in a separate count but in language sprinkled throughout the complaint), those allegations rest on her contention that the state court did not handle the unlawful detainer action correctly. We will not\u2014 and cannot \u2014 nullify that state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Because the district court had no jurisdiction to consider the claims Franklin made based on federal law, it had no jurisdiction to consider the remaining state-law claims. <em>Scarfo v. Ginsberg, </em>175 F.3d 957, 962 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201c[Ojnce the district court determines that subject matter jurisdiction over a plaintiffs federal claims does not exist, courts must dismiss a plaintiffs state law claims.\u201d). For those reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing all of Franklin\u2019s claims, although we do so on different grounds, concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>that the district court had no subject matter jurisdiction over them.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The district court did not err in effectively dismissing Franklin\u2019s claims against the state court judges by directing her to remove them from her complaint. \u201cJudges are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages for those acts taken while they are acting in their judicial capacity unless they acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted). This immunity attaches even if a judge acts \u201cin excess of his or her jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Franklin alleges that the state district court judge acted in the clear absence of jurisdiction because the court did not have personal jurisdiction over her because she was never properly served. And she alleges that the state circuit court judge did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the case was not properly in his court. Judges do not lose their judicial immunity even if they act in absence of jurisdiction as long as they do not have knowledge that they lack jurisdiction or act \u201cin the face of clearly valid statutes or case law expressly depriving [them] of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Dykes v. Hosemann, </em>743 F.2d 1488, 1497 (11th Cir.1984). Fi'anklin does not allege that either judge knew he lacked jurisdiction, and there is no Alabama statute that clearly deprives them of jurisdiction. In fact, Alabama Code \u00a7\u00a7 6&amp;emdash; 6-330 and 6-6-350 indicate that the circuit court did have subject matter jurisdiction because those statutes provide that appeals in unlawful detainer actions from state district courts go to the state circuit courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The court also did not err in declining to consider Franklin\u2019s motion to amend her complaint for a fifth time. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 instructs courts to \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend a pleading \u201cwhen justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). However, \u201cjustice does not require district courts to waste their time on hopeless cases,\u201d and \u201cleave may be denied if a proposed amendment ... fails to state a claim.\u201d <em>Mizzaro v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>544 F.3d 1230, 1255 (11th Cir.2008). Franklin has not demonstrated that justice requires the district court to consider her claims against the proposed new defendants: Arbor Station employees, Montgomery County, and the Montgomery County court system. Franklin\u2019s cursory allegations against the Arbor Station employees do not provide actual grounds for relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (explaining that \u201c[tjhreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice\u201d to state a claim). And her claims against Montgomery County and Montgomery Court System are based on challenges of the state court decisions concluding they had jurisdiction and so are barred by <em>Roolcer-Feldman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\">. Franklin also stated, on appeal, that the district court abused its discretion in denying her a temporary restraining order, and that the district court should not have ordered her to drop her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against Arbor Station. However, these cursory statements are not enough to render the arguments properly raised before this Court. Accordingly, these arguments have been waived. <em>Marek v. Singletary, </em>62 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.1995) (\"Issues not clearly raised in the briefs are considered abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
