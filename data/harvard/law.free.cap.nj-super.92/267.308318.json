J. S. </em>3A:85-1 (hereafter the first count) and of extortion in violation of <em>N. J. S. </em>3A:105-1 (second count) while \u201ca public officer of the Housing Authority, * * * to wit: a mason foreman,\u201d in that he did unlawfully and corruptly \u201csolicit\u201d and \u201creceive and take, by color of his office, from Armando Cilento, the sum of $500 * * *\u201d as a \u201cfee\u201d or \u201creward\u201d not allowed by law. He was sentenced to one year in the Essex County Penitentiary on the first count and sentence was suspended on the second count, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Defendant\u2019s first point is that he was not \u201ca \u2018public officer\u2019 within the intendment of the common law crime of misconduct in office and within the intendment of <em>N. J. S. </em>3A :105-1.\u201d We hold that he was. <em>State v. Begyn, </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>(1961). lie was a mason foreman and Cilento worked under him. It was defendant\u2019s job to supervise Cilento, to see that he did his work \u201cwith required skill\u201d and efficiently, to evaluate \u201chis work ability, physical fitness and character,\u201d and to report upon these matters to the executives of the Housing Authority. Defendant argues that there is no proof that he did so report on Cilento. That is immaterial. It is sufficient that defendant was in a position in which he appeared to be able to do so and that Cilento believed he could do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Defendant contends that the only statute under which the crime with which he was charged may be prosecuted is <em>N. J. S. </em>2A :93-8; therefore, the indictment upon which he was convicted was invalid and the entire prosecution was illegal and, in any event, this statute evidences the legislative intent that foremen are not to be considered public officers. We disagree. Assuming that he could have been charged under <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:93 \u2014 8, that does not make the prosecution under <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:85-1 and <em>N. J. S. </em>2A -.105-1 invalid or improper. Defendant was more than merely the foreman contemplated by <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:93-8; as we have said, under the facts here involved he was a public officer. <em>Cf. State v. Johnson, 67 N. J. Super. </em>414, 419 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Defendant argues also (Point III of his brief) that \u201cthe trial court erred in its various rulings on the essential element of \u2018color of office.\u2019 \u201d What we have said about the first point disposes of this argument as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Defendant\u2019s next point is that \u201cthe trial court erred when it admitted evidence of an extraneous crime and of an extraneous non-criminal transaction.\u201d The indictment charged the payment of $500 by Cilento to defendant between March 10 and April 21, 1961. The evidence of the \u201cextraneous crime\u201d challenged was of the payment of $500 in 1958 by Cilento to defendant for assurance against being laid off; that of \u201cthe non-criminal transaction\u201d was the payment of $86 by Cilento to defendant which defendant said was for a gift for a supervisor of their department. We find no error in the admission of this evidence. .It was relevant to show the relationship of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the parties, the subservience of Cilento to defendant, and defendant\u2019s course of dealing with him and defendant\u2019s scheme, motive and intent. <em>Cf. State v. Kociolek, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>400, 418-419 (1957); <em>State v. Campisi, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>455, 459 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Einally, defendant argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in its charge when it attributed certain testimony to the defendant.\u201d The defendant points out that he did not take the stand and yet the judge charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201cSuccinctly stated the State contends that the defendant Attanasio during- the time alleged in the indictment, namely, March 10 to April 21, 1961, entered into a corrupt agx-eement pertaining to Cilento\u2019s employment in the Newark Housing Authox-ity. The defendant denies this and contends that he did not have the power or the authority to do anything for Cilento, and that he never spoke to Cilento about his status as an employee, temporary or permanent, and that he never received any money from Cilento at any time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Defendant argues that this was prejudicial error because it \u201cclearly set up straw men of the defense which could be easily destroyed\u201d especially since \u201cCilento quite innocently had given $300 to Attanasio\u201d as a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> To begin with, we question whether the objections to the charge were specific enough to preserve to defendant the right to challenge the above-quoted portion thereof in this appeal. Be that as it may, the charge must be read as a whole and, so read, the challenged portion seems to us harmless. The jurors were well aware of the fact that defendant had not testified and it must have been obvious to them that the court was not talking about actual testimony but about the issues involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
