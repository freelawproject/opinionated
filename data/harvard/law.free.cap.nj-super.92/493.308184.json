J. S. A. </em>33 :1-12(1) into a club license, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>33 :1-12(5); (2) did the fact that the \u201cC\u201d license, commercial in nature, permitted a business operation in a residential zone, contrary to the provisions of the municipal zoning ordinance, render it invalid ?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The hearing officer held that the special conditions imposed effected a curtailment of the statutory privileges of the holder of a \u201cC\u201d license, and thus were nugatory. He held also that the fact that the premises involved were not subject to commercial use in a residential zone did not preclude the issuance of the license, citing <em>Lubliner v. Bd. of Alcoholic Beverage Control for City of </em>Paterson, 59 <em>N. J. Super. </em>419 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960), modified and affirmed 33 <em>N. J. </em>428 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number> We agree with both legal conclusions and find substantial evidence in the record to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On the oral argument of this appeal the municipality also contends that in granting the <em>\u201cG\u201d </em>license it was lulled into the belief that the licensee would accept the special conditions imposed, and granted the license on that basis. Consequently, the municipality maintains that the case should be remanded to it for consideration of the application in light of the Division\u2019s determination. This point was not raised below and we therefore decline to pass upon its merits. See <em>Reynolds Offset Co., Inc. v. Summer, </em>58 <em>N. J. Super. </em>542, 548 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
