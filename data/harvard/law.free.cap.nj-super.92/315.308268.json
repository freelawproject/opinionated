J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AiN\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint, filed December 13, 1963, alleged that \u201cprior to August 1961\u201d he purchased defendant\u2019s products; that in making said purchase and using the products he relied upon the \u201cexpressed and implied warranties of the defendant * * * as to the fitness * * * for the use thereof and for which it was intended\u201d; that in violation of said warranties the products were not fit for use. and that plaintiff used the products and was injured. In answers to interrogatories plaintiff admitted that his injuries developed prior to October 31, 1961. Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations, <em>N. J. S. 2A: 14-2 </em>The trial court denied the motion, holding that the six-year statute, <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:14-1, applied since the action was for breach of contract. We granted leave to appeal and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">It must he noted that the issues in this case are not affected by the Uniform Commercial Code. <em>N. J. S. </em>12A:2-725 specifically provides that the Code\u2019s statute of limitations does not apply to causes of actions which accrued before its effective date, January 1, 1963. Therefore, we express no opinion as to the effect of the Code upon <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:14-2 and the New Jersey cases hereafter mentioned. We decide this case without reference to the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The view of most American jurisdictions is that \u201can action to recover for personal injuries is, in essence, a personal injury action, and, regardless of whether it is based upon an alleged breach of an implied warranty or is based upon an alleged tort, the limitations statute governing actions for personal injuries is controlling.\u201d Annotation, \u201cWhat statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of limitations governs cause of action for personal injuries against retailer, manufacturer, and the like based on breach of implied warranty,\u201d 37 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>703, 704 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">New Jersey has followed the majority rule. The question was first raised in a medical malpractice case, <em>Weinstein v. Blanchard, </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>332 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932), which involved the substantially identical forerunner of <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:14-2. The court there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201cThe fourth count is based upon a claim for damages arising out of injury to the person by reason of the failure of defendant to properly perform the alleged contract to operate upon and treat plaintiff, and claiming like damages. * * * With respect to [this count] the question depends on whether or not the third section of the statute of limitations (3 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>3164) applies to all actions that may arise from the injury, where the injury complained of is a personal injury, whether they are brought in tort or in contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">We are constrained to think that it does. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">* * * to yield to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, namely, that the longer period of limitation applies, \u2018would be to permit a plaintiff to sue in tort within two years, or to frame his action in contract upon the same facts and thus gain four years.\u2019 Such would not be a reasonable construction of the third section of our statute, for therein the Legislature made no distinction whatsoever between torts and contracts. It deals with injuries to persons resulting from the wrongful act, neglect or default of another. Whether framed in tort or in contract, what gives rise to the action? Unskilled treatment. And, so, whether the duty arises through law, the common law, or whether the duty arises out of a contractual relationship, is immaterial so far as the limitation of the action is concerned.\u201d (at <em>pp. </em>333-334, 338-339).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\"><em>Weinstein </em>was approved and followed by the Supreme Court in <em>Burns v. Bethehem Steel Co., 20 N. J. </em>37 (1955). The court there said that <em>Weinstein </em>was \u201cin conformity with the great weight of authority which refuses to permit the results of litigation to turn on distinctions between various forms of action.\u201d See also <em>Rex v. Hutner, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>489 (1958) ; <em>Tackling v. Chrysler Corp., </em>77 <em>N. J. Super. </em>12 <em>(Law Div. </em>1962); <em>Tomlin v. Hildreth, </em>65 <em>N. J. L. </em>438, 445 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1900) ; <em>Oroz v. American President Lines, Ltd., </em>259 <em>F. 2d </em>636 (2 <em>Cir. </em>1958), <em>certiorari </em>denied 359 <em>U. S. </em>908, 179 <em>S. Ct. </em>584, 3 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>572 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The plaintiff relies upon <em>Simon v. Graham Bakery, </em>17 <em>N. J. 525 </em>(1955), but in that ease the Supreme Court expressly avoided the question here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Plaintiff cites also <em>Blessington v. McCrory Stores Corp., </em>305 <em>N. Y. </em>140, 111 <em>N. E. 2d </em>421, 37 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>698 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1953), but that case turned upon a New York statute different from ours. The six-year limit under section 48(1) of the Civil Practice Act (C. P. A.), the statute involved in <em>Blessington, </em>was for actions \u201cupon a contract obligation or liability express or implied.\u201d The three-year period governed by section 49(6) of that statute covered actions \u201cto recover damages for an injury to property or a personal injury <em>resulting from negligence\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The cause of action pleaded in <em>Blessington </em>was not based on negligence but on breach of warranty, and <em>Blessington </em>held that section 48(1) governed. We note that, after <em>Blessington, </em>when the C. P. A. was replaced by the <em>Civil Practice Law and Buies, </em>section 214 of the new act placed a three-year limitation on actions \u201cto recover damages for a personal injury except as provided in section 215.\u201d Section 215 deals with intentional torts, libel and slander. The <em>Legislative Studies and Beports </em>appended to the act stated, at <em>page </em>313, that by said section 214 \u201cThe negligence limitation is deleted; all actions for personal injury are thus subject to a three-year period except those covered in section 215. * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">At the oral argument plaintiff cited <em>Public Administrator of New York County v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., </em>224 <em>F. Supp. </em>236 <em>(S. D. N. Y. </em>1963), for the proposition that <em>Blessington </em>still represents the New York law, in spite of <em>C. P. L. R., </em>section 214. However, that case made no mention of section 214. In any event, we hold that under the well settled New Jersey law which controls this action, it was barred by <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:14-2, the two-year statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The judgment is reversed and judgment is entered in favor of defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
