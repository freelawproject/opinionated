A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ARz\">In this medical malpractice case plaintiffs appeal from a judgment for defendants entered upon a jury verdict of no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Plaintiffs contend that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting \u201cextensive cross-examination of an expert witness on inflammatory matters not relevant to the issues\u201d of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 argument requires reference to the \u201cExcerpts from Transcript\u201d contained in the appendix, which consist solely of the testimony of Dr. Emanuel M. Josephson. The doctor was called as a witness by plaintiffs to render an opinion that defendants in their care and treatment of plaintiff Ethel Lawlor departed from standards of care recognized in the medical profession. In the course of the preliminary examination relative to qualifications, the doctor testified to his premedical and medical training and experience, his research of the surgical problem involved in the action, and the nature and extent of his activities as a practicing member of the medical profession. In the latter connection he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">\u201cI have been engaged <em>primarily </em>in general medical work with special interest at various times in various fields. <em>I am engaged in the practice of medicine as well as research. </em>Research has been the basis of publication of numerous papers and leading journals here and abroad and also three books embodying my <em>researches in medicine.\" </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>At this juncture the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">\u201cMr. Bums [plaintiffs\u2019 attorney] : My hypothetical is going to take some time. Do you wish to cross-examine on the qualifications before I start, rather than have me read a question for twenty minutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">The Court: Is there any cross on the qualifications?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">Mr. Carton [defendants\u2019 attorney] : Well, it will be rather extended. I don\u2019t know whether I should do it now or as part of my general cross-examination. I will do it either way the Court wants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">The Court: I think perhaps we had better dispose of it at this point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Defendants\u2019 attorney then conducted the cross-examination which is under review. Strictly speaking, it might well be said that portions of the cross-examination, if proper, were more appropriate to general cross-examination, as distinguished from cross-examination on qualifications, as defendants\u2019 attorney anticipated. However, plaintiffs make no point of this in their brief and the attorney for plaintiffs frankly stated on oral argument that the same objections to the cross-examination would have been made had it been a part of the general cross-examination. Furthermore, the witness was not held to be disqualified by the court, and the weight and sufficiency of the testimony was submitted to the jury subject to its determination of credibility. Thus, the meritorious question before us is whether the trial judge, regardless of the stage of the case, mistakenly exercised his discretion in granting the latitude of cross-examination which appears in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">In this connection it should be pointed out that the scope of cross-examination is a matter for the control of the trial judge and that an appellate court will not interfere with such control unless clear error and prejudice is shown. <em>Soronen v. Olde Milford Inn, </em>84 <em>N. J. Super. </em>372, 373, 381 <em>(App. Div. </em>1964). Accord, <em>Rivera v. Grill, </em>65 <em>N. J. Super. </em>253 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certification denied 34 <em>N. J. </em>471 (1961) ; <em>Rynar v. Lincoln Transit Co., </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>525 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Plaintiffs at the outset of their brief concede that this is the rule. They argue only that questions put to the doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>concerning the contents and titles of some of his non-medical writings were intrinsically \u201cinflammatory,\u201d and wholly irrelevant to the issues presented in this medical malpractice case, as for example, pamphlets written by the doctor entitled \u201cThe Strange Death of Franklin D. Roosevelt,\u201d and \u201cRockefeller, the Internationalist,\u201d \u201cWake Up America! We Finance Rockefeller Interests,\u201d \u201cAmerica\u2019s Betrayal, the Rockefeller Empire,\u201d \u201cKennedy\u2019s General Aniline Deal,\u201d and an article, \u201cThe Red Record of Adlai Stevenson, Stalin\u2019s Choice for President,\u201d and his allusion to Nelson Rockefeller personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Standing alone, it is doubtful that the admitted discretion of the trial judge would be so broad as to permit the doctor\u2019s political, and perhaps economic, views to reach the ears of a jury. However, they may not be so isolated, but must be considered in the context of the doctor\u2019s - entire testimony, and the legitimate purposes of cross-examination. As noted above, the witness attempted to convey the impression that he was qualified to testify by reason of the fact, among others, that he devoted his time primarily to general medical work and medical research and that he was essentially a \u201cfull time\u201d practicing doctor. The stated purpose of the cross-examination under scrutiny was to establish that the doctor\u2019s interests were deeply involved in time-consuming activities in other fields which affected his credibility in his assertions concerning the time and thought spent on problems within the field of medicine, particularly since the witness admitted that in the course of his very lengthy career he had written between 5,000 and 10,000 articles along with 14 books, a large part of which were on non-medical subjects, and maintained in the same building in which his medical offices were located a publishing establishment, the business of which was to arrange for the publication of his extensive writings.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It is unfortunate that the nature of the doctor\u2019s non-medical writings and the titling of them might have had the side effect of prejudicing jurors who did not share his views. But the trial judge in his discretion was entitled to permit the defendant to bring to the attention of the jury the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>deuce from which that body could infer that by reason of his non-medical interests the witness\u2019s purported knowledge of the medical problem presented by the case was less than he claimed, and that such deficiency affected his credibility, and thus the weight to be accorded to his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Nor may the doctor\u2019s testimony relative to his writings on medical matters and the medical profession, even though not directly under attack, be disregarded, since it formed a background, was in a general sense related to the examination on non-medical writings, and in combination with the latter could have had bearing upon the issue of whether or not he was an essentially credible witness. Specifically, in some instances the propriety of the witness\u2019s published views regarding the medical profession, when viewed in the context of the entire evidence, was susceptible of inferences that the doctor had exhibited bias against the medical profession generally. Eor example, he had written a book, \u201cRackets, Social Service and Medical,\u201d which had been published by his own publishing firm, Chedney Press, and another similarly published, \u201cYour Life is Their Toy. Merchants in Medicine,\u201d in which he stated that \u201csurgery per so is a simple, mechanical art that can be learned readily by a moron.\u201d When questioned about this, ho glibly stated that \u201cit has been done repeatedly.\u201d When interrogated further upon this subject the witness stated that he had also written, \u201cThere are few operations as complicated as rebuilding a pair of shoos.\u201d That viewpoint could not only be considered as evidencing bias but it could also bo interpreted as a cynicism deeply affecting the depth of his knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In the same work he, who was prepared to answer a hypothetical question, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201cHypothetic [sic] questions are a part of the ciiieaneiy of the law. But they are downright dishonest when used in these medical cases. For they imply an omniscience which neither the medical profession nor any of ils members possess. There is so much that it is not known about physiology that it is utterly impossible for any honest physician to say that any disease or physiologic derangement may or may not follow on any specific injury. The honest physician can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>merely testify that in his knowledge or opinion the consequences of a specific injury are usual or unusual. If he says more, the physician is either stupid or he lies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Lastly, it is observed that upon the trial judge\u2019s view of the testimony he might well have concluded that the witness was evasive, and thus that he should grant greater latitude in cross-examination than he otherwise might. Eor example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">\u201cQ. Do you regard these textbooks as authorities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">A. For the purpose for which I used them, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">Q. This is the first time you have looked at a textbook for a long time, isn\u2019t it, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">Q. When have you previously looked at textbooks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">A. Whenever I had occasion to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">* <em>iji </em>* Sji * * Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">Q. How much of your time, Doctor, do you spend now practicing medicine ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\">A. As much time as my practice requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">Professor McCormick illuminates the problem involved in this case. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-15\">\u201cThere are three main functions of cross-examination: (1) to shed light on the credibility of the direct testimony; (2) to bring out additional facts related to those elicited on direct, and (3) in states following the \u2018wide-open\u2019 rule, to bring out additional facts which tend to elucidate any issue in the case. As to cross-examination designed <em>to </em>serve the second or third of these functions, there seems to be no reason why the usual standard of relevancy as applied to testimony offered on direct examination should not equally be applied to facts sought to be elicited on cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-17\">As to the first function, that of evaluating the credibility of the evidence given on direct, the object and purpose is contrastingly different. Here the test of relevancy is not whether the answer sought will elucidate any of the main issues, but whether it will to a useful extent aid the court or jxiry in appraising the credibility of the witness and assessing the probative value of the direct testimony.\u201d <em>McCormick, Evidence </em>(1954), \u00a729, <em>pp. </em>54-55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">Considering the witness\u2019s testimony in the aggregate and in context, we are satisfied that the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion was within the proper discharge of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>functions in acting in the manner which is criticized on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
