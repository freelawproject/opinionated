A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A0y\">Defendants were convicted after a trial by jury upon joint indictments charging them with the rape of Miss L and the robbery of Alfred E. Blyskal.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">Of the several grounds which they raise on appeal we find only one of determinative merit, <em>viz., </em>that the court erred in limiting cross-examination of the complaining witnesses, which was designed to affect their credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">The proofs offered by the State ran thus: On March 7, 1964 Blyskal and Miss L, by prior arrangement, had a social engagement. At about 10:30 of that evening Blyskal, operat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ing a 1955 Cadillac, called for Miss L at her address in Irvington. They drove about for a while and then went to the Joli Lounge, a tavern in Newark, where they had \u201cabout 3 or 4 drinks\u201d and \u201clistened to the music.\u201d At about 2 a. m. they left the tavern and went to Blyskal\u2019s car, which was parked about 15 feet away. According to Miss L, Blyskal said he felt a little tired and \u201che wanted to doze off for a half hour.\u201d While they were seated in the car, he in the driver\u2019s seat and she beside him, the car door on Blyskal\u2019s side was opened by one of two men. One man \u201chad a pipe or some type of a bat or something\u201d and struck Blyskal in the face with it. Mention was made by the men of getting Blyskal\u2019s wallet. Before he had an opportunity to give them the wallet, the man who struck him said, \u201cjump in the car and let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Prom the stand Blyskal identified defendant Steele as that person, and defendant Stokes as his companion. Blyskal was pulled from the car and thrown to the ground. The two men then jumped into the Cadillac and, with Miss L sitting in the middle of the front seat, drove off. Blyskal, despite some difficulty in locating a telephone, managed to reach the police and inform them of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The testimony relevant to the alleged rape came entirely from Miss L. She testified that the men drove her to a desolate spot in Weequahic Park where, after the car was parked, she was \u201ctaken in the back of the car.\u201d She did not remember who \u201ctook\u201d her there. Her clothing was removed \u201cfrom the waist down.\u201d She did not remember who took her clothing off, or whether she herself removed it. She then said that her abductors, whom she identified as the two defendants, successively had sexual intercourse with her, in all four times, in the course of which they kissed her mouth and fondled her breasts. The entire affair lasted 20 minutes. She had a clear and detailed recollection of what happened, admitted that she had not been threatened either en route to the park or at the time of the \u201cattack,\u201d or that acts of violence (other than the intercourse itself) had been practiced upon her. In fact, in her direct examination she gave no testimony whatever that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>she submitted to the men through fear of violence. It was only-after the direct examination was concluded that the court through a series of leading questions, which in form would have been objectionable had they been propounded by the prosecutor, asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">\u201cQ. Miss E., before the cross-examination starts, they forced you into the back of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Q. Were you in fear when you went into the back of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">A. Of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">Q. They didn\u2019t ask you to have relations, did they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">A. No, I didn\u2019t have any choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">Q. Explain that to the jury \u2014 that you had no choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">A. I had no choice. By that I mean I think they would have killed me. I had no choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">Q. You were in fear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">A. Yes, of course.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">Miss L said that after the several acts of intercourse, she dressed and told the defendants that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get involved in anything and to just leave the car and park it,\u201d and \u201cjust leave me, which they did.\u201d Pursuant to her request thej1- dropped her off at 20th Street and 16th Avenue, Newark, a little after 4 a. m., leaving the car with her. After about \u201cfive or ten minutes\u201d she left and started walking toward her home. Immediately thereafter she was accosted by detectives who asked her if she was Miss L. Upon identifying herself she was taken to a police station house. There she identified defendants, as did Blyskal who had preceded her to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">While the evidence <em>prima facie </em>made out both the robbery and the rape charges, and in our judgment was sufficient to sustain a conviction of both, it is patent that as to both charges the identification of defendants as the persons who had committed the offenses was in serious issue since both maintained that they were not present when the alleged crimes were committed. Purthermore, in connection with the rape charge, there is implicit in the testimony of the complaining witness herself the question of whether defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>had with force and violence had intercourse with her against her will, as required by the rape statute, or, on the contrary, whether despite her protestations in answer to the judge\u2019s questions, she had in fact, for reasons unconnected with fear, voluntarily submitted. Thus, the issue of credibility both as to Blvskal and Miss L assumed formidable proportions.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The specific challenge which defendants make to the court\u2019s limitation of the scope of cross-examination is based upon: (1) the refusal of the court to permit the cross-examiner to inquire into Blyskal\u2019s activities during the day with respect to the-imbibing of alcoholic beverages; (2) the interrogation of that witness concerning his alleged illicit sexual relationship with Miss L, and (3) Miss L\u2019s testimony, previously not referred to, that defendants had robbed her of $70, a matter which she did not report to the police officers who apprehended her and took her into custody. It is argued that (1) Blyskal\u2019s entire drinking activities, taken in conjunction with the events of the evening and the fact that he was \u201cdrowsy,\u201d if established, might seriously have affected the weight to be accorded to his assertion that he was physically able to identify defendants as of the time he was robbed; (2) in light of Miss L\u2019s avowed quiescence, evidence relating to her sexual immorality was relevant to a showing of defect in character in a sex offense case, on the issue of her consent, and (3) her credibility might also have been affected had defendants been able to establish the fact that she had not reported to the police the robbery which allegedly was perpetrated on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\"> Considerable latitude is customarily allowed in the cross-examination of a witness, but the extent of such examination rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. </em>Siegler, 12 N. <em>J. </em>520, 526-527 (1953). In consonance with this general rule the trial judge has broad discretion to determine the proper limits of cross-examination of a witness whose credibility is put in issue. <em>State v. Pontery, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>457, 473 (1955). Thus, it has been held in a bastardy proceeding that cross-examination was properly limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>when it sought to attack the credibility of the complaining witness, <em>State v. Arbus, </em>54 <em>N. J. Super. </em>76, 82-84 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959); see also Annotation, \u201cCross-examination as to sexual morality for purposes of affecting credibility of witness,\u201d 65 <em>A. L. R. </em>410 (1930); and in a prosecution for carnal abuse it was held that cross-examination which sought to inquire into evidence of sexual acts on other occasions with persons other than the defendant was properly excluded. <em>State v. Raymond, </em>74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>434, 438 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">But cross-examination upon proper foundation has been permitted with respect to the complaining witness\u2019s general reputation for chastity, or lack of it, as bearing on the issue of consent in a rape case. <em>State v. Rubertone, </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>285, 287 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1916) <em>(dictum; </em>carnal abuse case); <em>State v. Yevchak, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>584, 587 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943) (no proper foundation; rape case); <em>O\u2019Blenis v. State, </em>47 <em>N. J. L. </em>279 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1885) (rape case); Annotation, \u201cAdmissibility in rape cases of evidence of previous unchastity, or reputation for unchastity, of prosecutrix,\u201d 140 <em>A. L. R. </em>364, 380 <em>et seq. </em>(1942) ; 1 <em>Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. </em>1940), \u00a762, <em>p. </em>464. See also <em>State v. Orlando, </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>175, 180 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937), where cross-examination designed to establish that the intercourse was bjr consent and not forcible was allowed; and <em>State v. Lasowski, </em>4 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>489, 491, 133 <em>A. </em>415 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1926), where it was held to be within the discretionary control of the court to permit cross-examination of the prosecutrix\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The rule that the trial judge has broad discretion in controlling cross-examination is widely endorsed. And a number of jurisdictions have also specifically subscribed to the rule that the defense should be accorded great latitude in the cross-examination of the complaining witness in sex cases where an accusation is easily made and difficult to disprove. See <em>People v. Clark, </em>63 <em>Cal. 2d </em>503, 47 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>382, 407 <em>P. 2d </em>294 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1965); <em>People v. Rainford, </em>58 <em>Ill. App. 2d </em>312, 208 <em>N. E. 2d </em>314, 316 <em>(App. Ct. </em>1965) ; <em>Frady v. State, </em>212 <em>Ga. </em>84, 90 <em>S. E. 2d </em>664, 665 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1955); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Sherrick v. State, </em>157 <em>Neb. </em>623, 61 <em>N. W. 2d </em>358, 366 <em>(Sup.

Rosenberry, </em>156 <em>Kan. </em>508, 134 <em>P. 2d </em>414, 416 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943); <em>State v. Jones, 62 Idaho </em>552, 113 <em>P. 2d </em>1106 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941) ; <em>DeSalvo v. People, </em>98 <em>Colo. </em>368, 56 P. <em>2d </em>28, 29 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936); <em>State v. Warner, </em>79 <em>Utah </em>510, 13 <em>P. 2d </em>317, 319 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1932); <em>State v. Paddock, </em>86 <em>Mont. </em>569, 284 P. 549, 551 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1930) ; <em>State v. Brooks, 181 Iowa </em>874, <em>165 N. W. </em>194, 198 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1917); 3 <em>Wharton, Criminal Evidence (12th ed. </em>1955) \u00a7862, <em>p. </em>244. These authorities support the proposition that a clear abuse o\u00ed discretion in the limitation o\u00ed cross-examination of the prosecutrix in rape cases justifies reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We are satisfied that in the circumstances of this case fundamental fairness required that wider latitude should have been granted defendants in the examination of Blyskal on the issue of the weight of his identification of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Furthermore, we believe that a ruling made by the court in the course of cross-examination of Blyskal was couched in language capable of prejudicial effect. At the outset of that cross-examination defendants attempted to probe Blyskal concerning his relationship with Miss L. The following then appears in the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I will not. permit you to ask <em>any </em>questions about sexual relations. It would be prejudicial to the State\u2019s ease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">and again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">\u201c* * \u00ed <em>j\u00b1ny </em>qu(iStion concerning sexual relations don\u2019t ask. I will not permit it.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">We are satisfied that the court ruled correctly insofar as it enjoined defendants from questioning Blyskal about his relationship with Miss In However, if defendants\u2019 counsel could reasonably have understood (as is now contended they did) that the uso of the word \u201cany\u201d precluded them generally from questioning Miss L, the complaining witness, concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>her chastity, for the purpose of affecting her credibility, or from introducing evidence of her general reputation for chastity, error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Although we fully recognize that the trial court has wide discretion in regulating or fixing the limits of cross-examination, it seems apparent that the judge did not curb the examination under review with this in mind. Erom the record it clearly appears that the court mistakenly understood that where, as here, defendants deny presence at and participation in a crime, or where they offer proof of alibi, or both, they are denied the privilege of developing on cross-examination facts militating against the conclusion that a crime was in fact committed. Eor example, when Miss L was being interrogated about what occurred during the course of the ride from the tavern to Weequahic Park, she was asked whether she smelled the breaths of the men. The prosecutor objected upon the ground that the question was irrelevant, and well it might have been. However, at that juncture the trial judge revealed his thinking. In sustaining the objection upon the ground of irrelevancy he said, \u201cI don\u2019t [think so] either because your defense is one of alibi. What difference does it make whether there was or was not alcohol on their breath ?\u201d When the attorney suggested that it went to credibility the court said, \u201cHow can it affect her [Miss L\u2019s] credibility if your defense is that they were not there? Do you want to withdraw that question or do you want to still press it ?\u201d The attorney pressed the ruling and the court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\"> Later, when Miss L was being cross-examined on a statement she had given to the police, without objection to an apparently innocuous answer, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201cQ. What time did you return on Monday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">A. I was there Monday morning, and they took the case down all over again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">THE COURT: Is there anything in this statement about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">MR. ROSENTHALL: Nothing in this statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">THE COURT: What is the purpose of the examination? Again, <em>your defense is alibi, </em>isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>HR. ROSENTHALL: That is right; but if the occurrence <em>never took place, </em>your Honor * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">THE COURT: <em>That isn\u2019t your defense, </em>is it? <em>Your defense is that these men ircre not there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">HR. ROSENTHAI/L: Correct.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Notwithstanding that the judge then allowed the answer to stand, he plainly indicated that where alibi is pleaded cross-examination on the subject of whether a crime was in fact committed hv anybody is improper. This concept is clearly erroneous. Where the presence of defendant at the scene of the crime is essential to show its commission by him, the burden of proving that presence beyond a reasonable doubt is upon the State. Defendant has neither the burden nor the duty to show that he was elsewhere at the time and so conld not have committed the offense. <em>State v. </em>Peetros, 45 <em>N. J. </em>540, 551 (1965). Alibi is simply a part of defendant\u2019s general denial of guilt. <em>Id.j </em>a.t <em>p. </em>544.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">We are obliged to conclude that the judge\u2019s misconception of the limited scope of cross-examination where alibi is pleaded led him to think erroneously that, as a matter of law, he ivas barred from the exercise of Ms discretion in determining the length to which the cross-examination in this case should have been permitted. It is well settled that discretion means <em>legal </em>discretion, in the exercise of which the judge must take account of the law applicable to the particular circumstances of the case and he governed accordingly. If the trial judge misconceives the applicable law or misapplies it to the factual complex, in total effect the exercise of legal discretion lacks a foundation and becomes an arbitrary act. When this occurs it is the duty of the reviewing court to adjudicate the controversy in light of the applicable law in order that a manifest denial of justice he avoided. <em>Kavanaugh v. </em>Quigley, 63 <em>N. J. Super. </em>153, 158 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Unversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
