Statements of value are usually matters of opinion upon which the purchaser is not entitled to rely; citing <em>Medbury v. Watson, </em>6 Metc. 246, 260; <em>Manning v. Albee, </em>11 Allen, 520; <em>Ellis v. Andrews, </em>56 N. Y. 83; <em>Van Epps v. Harrison, </em>5 Hill, 63; and exaggeration in matters of opinion does not constitute' fraudulent misrepresentation; citing <em>Dawson v. Graham, </em>48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Iowa, 378; <em>Gordon v. Butler, 105 </em>U. S. 553; <em>Holbrook v. Connor, </em>60 Me. 578; <em>Uhler v. Semple, </em>20 N. J. Eq. 291.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-3\">3. The statements that much of the land was good farming land; that it had nearly $30,000 worth of hemlock on it, and that it could he sold in Escanaba or Marquette any day for $25,-600, even if made, were matters of opinion, and could not have been otherwise understood. At least, it would need to be shown that such opinions were absolutely without foundation, intended to be relied on, and were knowingly false; citing <em>Collins v. Jackson, </em>54 Mich. 186.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-4\"><em>Dallas Boudeman, </em>of counsel for defendant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\"><em>1, </em>Where a transaction which has been entered into has been induced by fraud, it is voidable at the instance of the \u25a0defrauded party; citing <em>Carroll v. Rice, </em>Walk. Ch. 373; <em>Galloway v. Holmes, </em>1 Doug. 330; <em>Jewett v. Petit, </em>4 Mich. 508; <em>Dunks v. Fuller, </em>32 Id. 242.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">2. Where a transaction, such as this one, rests upon fraud or false representations, it can be avoided by the party defrauded, even though the principal, or all of the joint contracting parties, \u2022did not fully know of all the means used for the deception, or \u25a0did not know of the representations. The court in such a case would place all parties <em>in statu quo, </em>and if any of the parties \u25a0are innocent of any moral wrong they are not financially injured; citing <em>Gardner v. Ogden, </em>22 N. Y. 327; <em>Conkey v. Bond, </em>36 Id. 427; <em>Taussig v. Hart, 58 </em>Id. 425; <em>Bain v. Brown, </em>56 Id. 285; <em>Tewksbury v.

It may be claimed by complainants that the statement of these parties as to the value of the lands is but the expression of opinion. This is not true in such a case as this; citing <em>Wright v. Wright, </em>37 Mich. 55; <em>Nowlin v. Snow, </em>40 Id. 699; <em>Holcomb v. Noble, </em>69 Id. 396; <em>Manning v. Albee, 11 </em>Allen, 520; <em>Simar v. Canaday, </em>53 N. Y. 298; <em>Burr v. Willson, </em>22 Minn. 206.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-10\">' <em>Ciarle &amp; Pearl (E. M. Irish, </em>of counsel), for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-11\">Montgomery, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeR\">This is a bill filed to foreclose a mortgage for $8,000 given on lands in the county of Marquette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>to secure a portion of tlie purchase price thereof. The \u2022\u2022complainant Pearce is named as trustee in the mortgage; the complainant Hyde is the real owner of the security. The defendant filed an answer, and claimed the benefit of -a cross-bill, alleging that there was fraud perpetrated upon the defendant in the sale of the lands by. the complainant Hyde and one Alonzo L. Foster, who, as tenant in common with Hyde, conveyed the lands to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The facts appearing by the testimony are that complain\u2022ant Hyde and Foster held the legal title to the lands in question. It appears, however, that one Warrick Price was .a partner with Foster in the lumber business, and was also interested with him in these lands. It is very doubtful whether Hyde knew anything of this relation, but this is immaterial, as we shall see later on. In April, 1890, Warwick Price, who had had some deal with defendant before,' informed him that he knew of a good bargain in the Upper Peninsula, and that he had got the lands traded for Iowa lands, which he could sell at a large advance, and proposed \u2022to defendant that, if he (the defendant) would furnish the .money, he (Price) would pay 5 per cent, on the money .\u2022advanced on the Michigan lands, and divide the profits in the property with defendant, and defendant assented to this -arrangement. In these negotiations Price stated that the Michigan lands could be bought for $20,000. . Subsequent negotiations resulted in a meeting between Price, Foster, \u2022complainant Hyde, and the defendant. . Defendant testified that previous to this he had said to Mr. Price that, before \u2022closing any deal, he desired to see the owners of the land; to quote his own language, <em>\u201cI </em>says I want to see these principals in Michigan which you claim to represent.\u201d On the occasion of the meeting of the three, it is claimed that Hyde and Foster misrepresented the character and value of the lands in question; and because of these misrepresentations, and of the misstatements of Price, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>now seeks to rescind the contract, and defeat the foreclosure of the mortgage in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Defendant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cHe came to me after these gentlemen came down that, morning, and said he had made them an offer of $2,000 less than he had agreed to sell me. I had agreed to put. it at $20,000 the day before. When Mr. Hyde and Mr-Foster came down, Mr. Price came in, and told me he had pressed them down $2,000; it was $2,000 our way; instead of being $20,000, he had bought it of them at $18,000. I says, 'All right. You have Avon $2,000 for us.\u2019 He says, 'Yes, I did that. That goes to profit and loss account.\u201d\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">It is contended by defendant that complainant Hyde is; bound by the representations of Price, for the reason that, he has profited by the fraud which it is claimed Price perpetrated upon defendant. But it seems to us that the-defendant does not occupy a position entitling him to&gt; maintain this claim. If the defendant\u2019s testimony as to-Price\u2019s position as agent is true, then it amounts to this:He (defendant) combined Avith Hyde and Foster\u2019s agent to-buy the land of the principals, and to take advantage of\u2019 the betrayal of trust by the agent, and profit to the extent, of $2,000 reduction from the price Avhich he had previously agreed with the agent to pay. If, under these circumstances,, he was deceived by the agent, a court of equity will not. relieve him.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">We think, aside from the false statements of Price, if any, the fraud charged in the cross-bill is not made out-by a preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">But another reason why the relief prayed in this ansAver cannot be granted is that the proper parties are not before the court. After the sale to Ware, Foster indorsed the note, which was given to Foster and Hyde jointly, to Hyde. The consideration for the land Avas $18,000, of which $10,-000 Avas paid in cash. One thousand dollars of this, and the note, were retained by complainant Hyde, and the.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>'other $9,000, in cash, was paid to Foster. Before a rescission of this transaction could be decreed, Foster was a .necessary party, and upon defendant\u2019s theory Price was .also a necessary party. No attempt was made by defendant to bring in these parties; and upon the case and pleadings, as they stood, no decree of rescission could be properly made by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The decree will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
