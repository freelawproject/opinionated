See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b213-5\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Abduali Nizametdinov, a native of China and citizen of Uzbekistan, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals affirming without opinion the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Nizametdinov challenges the immigration judge\u2019s negative credibility finding. We have thoroughly reviewed the record in light of the immigration judge\u2019s findings and conclude that Nizametdinov\u2019s assertions are without merit. The immigration judge cited specific, cogent reasons for concluding that Nizametdinov\u2019s testimony was not credible. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). As the negative credibility determination is supported by the record and is entitled to deference, Nizametdinov does not qualify for the relief sought. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000); <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 323 (4th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The standard for eligibility for withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Nizametdinov failed to establish entitlement to asylum, he cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">To obtain relief under the Convention Against Torture, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003). Nizametdinov\u2019s evidence does not support such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
