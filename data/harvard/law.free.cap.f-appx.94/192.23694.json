Because we find that he fails to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as discussed below, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The district court\u2019s order denied Jordan\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Jordan\u2019s judgment of conviction was entered August 16, 2000. This court affirmed by an opinion filed November 20, 2001, and a mandate issued on December 12, 2001. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>2001 WL 1470842 (4th Cir. Nov.20, 2001) (No. 00-4606) (unpublished). Jordan filed a \u00a7 2255 motion dated January 28, 2003, in the district court. Construing the motion as having been filed on that date, <em>see Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), under the rule announced in <em>Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003), the motion was filed within the one-year limitations period. Under <em>Clay, </em>a federal criminal conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court\u2019s affirmation of the conviction in the Supreme Court. <em>Clay, </em>537 U.S. at 524-25, 123 S.Ct. 1072. Thus, in light of <em>Clay, </em>we now find Jordan\u2019s motion was timely filed under the AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Jordan may not appeal from the denial of relief on his \u00a7 2255 motion, however, unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">While we conclude that jurists of reason could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling, we have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Jordan has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
