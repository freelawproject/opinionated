Austin was convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000), possession of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 (2000), possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000), and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(l,3) (2000). On appeal, he alleges the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-21\">We find that there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Glasser, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Austin\u2019s counsel asserts that the firearm found near crack cocaine in Austin\u2019s apartment should not be considered actively employed in furtherance of his drug trafficking. However, we must assume that the jury resolved this issue in the Government\u2019s favor. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1190 (4th Cir.1997). Thus, we deny Austin\u2019s motion to substitute attorney, deny his motion to extend time to file pro se formal brief, and affirm his conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
