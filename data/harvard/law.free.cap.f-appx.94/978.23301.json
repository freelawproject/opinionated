Counsel for Mobley has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but presenting one issue for this Court\u2019s review. Although notified of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Mobley has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Mobley contends that the sentence imposed was too severe. After Mobley\u2019s admitted violations of the terms of his supervised release, the district court determined that Mobley\u2019s suggested prison term was 21 to 24 months. USSG \u00a7 7B1.4(b)(2) (2003). The court sentenced Mobley at the low end of this suggested range. He has provided no support for his claim that this sentence is too severe. Accordingly, we reject Mobley\u2019s argument and affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Because this court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review, we deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
