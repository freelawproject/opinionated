Reliable information contained in the PSR and introduced at sentencing showed that Contreras supplied cellular telephones to other members of the operation, she equipped others with materials necessary to the furtherance of the drug operation, she directed others to complete financial transactions for the drug operation, she set prices and controlled the delivery of the methamphetamine, and she paid her brother a flat fee for drug deliveries that he made while she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>herself was paid in pounds of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Contreras had a supervisory or managerial role in the drug operation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 329 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Manthei, </em>913 F.2d 1130, 1135 (5th Cir.1990). Nor did the district court err in applying the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard to a disputed sentencing issue. <em>See United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.3d 1225, 1240 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
