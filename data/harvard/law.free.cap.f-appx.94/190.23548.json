We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Damte faded to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812). We find Damte faded to make a compelling case for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">In addition, we find Damte faded to meet the higher standards necessary to be granted either withholding from removal or withholding under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003); <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">We deny Damte\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
