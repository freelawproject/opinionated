For the first time on appeal, Fannin argues that the district court erroneously determined that he was an armed career criminal because his three previous convictions for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon were related under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). Fannin additionally argues that the district court erroneously rejected his testimony at sentencing and erroneously found that he possessed the firearm in connection with a controlled substances offense. Fannin further contends that the district court erred by denying his objections to a two-level increase assessed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) and a four-level increase assessed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-23\">As Fannin\u2019s three prior violent felony offenses were committed on different occasions, he qualified as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) regardless whether the prior convictions were related under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, and the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, in so finding. <em>See United States v. Medina-Gutierrez, </em>980 F.2d 980, 982-83 (5th Cir.1992). The evidence in the record shows that the district court\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>termination that Fannin possessed the firearm in connection with a controlled substances offense was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Vazquez, </em>161 F.3d 909, 912 (5th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s rejection of Fannin\u2019s testimony to the contrary is a credibility determination that we will not disturb on appeal. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>217 F.3d 323, 331-32 (5th Cir.2000). Because the remainder of Fannin\u2019s arguments concern only offense level increases that did not affect his guidelines sentencing range as an armed career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, those arguments are moot. <em>See United States v. Mankins, </em>135 F.3d 946, 950 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
