Harward\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising for the court\u2019s consideration the issue of whether the district court properly increased Harward\u2019s offense level by three levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.7 but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Harward filed a pro se supplemental brief raising the same issue as her counsel. She also challenges her sentence because she was denied an adjustment under the \u201csafety valve\u201d, acceptance of responsibility, and a minor role adjustment, and had her offense level computed using drugs obtained during civil rights violations and/or seized from co-defendants. Finally, Harward asserts that she received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">\u2022 We review, the district court\u2019s factual determinations concerning the application of the Sentencing Guidelines for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). After careful consideration, we find the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that Harward committed a new criminal offense while on bond. Accordingly, the district court properly increased the offense level for the offense committed while on release by three levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.7; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Harward asserts in her pro se supplemental brief that the district court erred in denying her an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The district court\u2019s determination regarding acceptance of responsibility is factual, and we review it with great deference for clear error. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5) (2000); <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">It is undisputed that Harward was arrested for committing a new criminal offense after being released on bond. The district court may consider whether a defendant has voluntarily terminated or withdrawn from criminal conduct in deciding whether she has accepted responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(b)). In light of Harward\u2019s intervening arrest, the district court did not clearly err in denying the reduction. <em>See United States v. Kidd, </em>12 F.3d 30, 34 (4th Cir.1993) (finding that defendant\u2019s continued criminal conduct is inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">In addition, Harward was found to have obstructed justice both before and after her arrest on the first charge. This obstruction of justice precluded the sentencing court from granting a reduction in Harward\u2019s offense level for acceptance of responsibility unless Harward could demonstrate that her circumstances presented an \u201cextraordinary case.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 4. The district court did not clearly err in determining that Harward failed to present such an extraordinary case. <em>See, United States v. Hudson, </em>272 F.3d 260, 264 (4th Cir.2001)(holding that fear that government will not recommend a downward departure is not the extraordinary case that permits the grant of acceptance of responsibility when the defendant\u2019s conduct supports an obstruction of justice finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">Harward also avers that the district court erred by denying her an adjustment for her minor role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The district court\u2019s factual determinations concerning this adjustment are reviewed for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 201 (4th Cir.1999). The adjustments of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>this section are aimed at persons who are \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202. The court asks whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was material or essential to the commission of the offense. <em>Id. </em>The record reveals that Harward played a highly material role in obtaining and distributing the drugs that were the object of the conspiracy in this case. Accordingly, we find no error in the denial of the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">As for Harward\u2019s remaining challenges to her sentence, we may. only review the record for plain error because Harward waived her appellate rights on these issues. A failure to properly and timely object constitutes a waiver. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>954 F.2d 182, 186-87 (4th Cir. 1992). Only incorrect' guidelines applications which amount to plain error may be reviewed on appeal. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Under this standard, Harward must show error, which was plain, that affected her substantial rights. Even then, this court will not notice the error unless it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508, (1993). Because Harward made no objections at sentencing, she waived appellate review. Finding that the district court did not commit plain error in applying the sentencing guidelines, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Finally, Harward claims that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not properly raised on direct appeal unless the record conclusively reveals that the defendant\u2019s representation was defective. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). We have reviewed the record and determine that it does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, Harward\u2019s ineffective assistance claims are not cognizable in this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">We have reviewed the' record in accordance with <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the1 client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may file a motion for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state'that a'copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
