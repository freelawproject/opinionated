This court lacks jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s determination that Noshahi filed an untimely asylum application and failed to meet an exception for waiving the deadline. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Because this court lacks jurisdiction over the IJ\u2019s determination that Noshahi failed to timely file his asylum application and was therefore statutorily ineligible for asylum, we need not address Noshahi\u2019s remaining argument challenging the denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-24\">Noshahi also argues that he is entitled to relief under the Legal Immigration and Family Equity Act and various other pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>visions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This court does not have jurisdiction to consider these arguments because they were not presented at the administrative level. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 554 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Noshahi does not address in his brief the denial of relief pursuant to the Convention Against Torture, nor does he address the denial of voluntary departure. Accordingly, these claims are abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Noshahi has also failed to brief in an adequate fashion and has therefore abandoned the denial of withholding of removal and his claim that the BIA\u2019s dismissal violated his constitutional rights. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The petition for review is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under file limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
