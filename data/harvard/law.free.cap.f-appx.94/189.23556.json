Means\u2019 attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising as a potentially meritorious issue the district court\u2019s decision to deny Means a minor or minimal role adjustment, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2002), but asserting that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Means has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">A minimal participant in a concerted criminal activity is one who lacks \u201cknowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and the activities of others....\u201d USCG \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.4). A minor participant is one who is \u201cless culpable than most other participants,\u201d but is not a minimal participant. <em>Id. </em>A defendant has the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to a mitigating role adjustment. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 203 (4th Cir.1999). Means was arrested in New Mexico while transporting three kilograms of cocaine and twelve grams of crack from California to South Carolina with co-defendant Dewayne Brewton, the leader of the conspiracy, who had recruited Means to help transport drugs. The district court determined that Means did not qualify for a minor or minimal role adjustment. Our review of the record discloses that the district court\u2019s decision was not clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and has found none. We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
