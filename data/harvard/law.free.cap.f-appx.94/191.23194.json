Morgan pled guilty to four counts of mail fraud and one count of use of a false social security number. He was sentenced to sixteen months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, he maintains that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for a third continuance of his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">A district court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance in a sentencing hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983); <em>United States v. Speed, </em>53 F.3d 643, 644 (4th Cir.1995). An abuse of discretion in this context is \u201can unreasoning and arbitrary \u2018insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. LaRouche, </em>896 F.2d 815, 823 (4th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Morris, </em>461 U.S. at 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610). Whether the district court abused its discretion \u201cin denying a continuance is not mechanical; it depends mainly on the reasons presented to the district court at the time the request was denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To prevail on such a charge, the defendant must show that the denial was arbitrary and that it substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s opportunity to secure a fair sentence. <em>Speed, </em>53 F.3d at 644. In other words, a defendant \u201cmust demonstrate substantial impairment of his opportunity to secure a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>No. 97-4525, 155 F.3d 562, 1998 WL 453848, at *2 (4th Cir. July 24, 1998)(L) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to deny Morgan\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we affirm Morgan\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
