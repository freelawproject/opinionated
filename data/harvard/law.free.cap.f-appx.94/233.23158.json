After Chowdhury filed his petition for review in this court, the BIA granted his application to reopen his removal proceedings, sustained Chow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>dhury\u2019s appeal, withdrew the IJ\u2019s order of removal, and remanded to the IJ for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision. Chowdhury then moved this court for dismissal of his petition without prejudice as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The exhaustion requirement is statutorily mandated and is jurisdictional. <em>Townsend v.

Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Chowdhury\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings and Chowdhury\u2019s petition for review is moot. <em>See Townsend, </em>799 F.2d at 181-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Petition for review DISMISSED as moot; motion to dismiss DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
