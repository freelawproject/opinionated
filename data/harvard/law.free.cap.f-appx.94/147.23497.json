Beza, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d). The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s decision and order denying Beza\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-23\">Beza claims the immigration judge erred in finding he failed to present credible evidence in support of his asylum application. We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision, which was designated by the Board as the final agency determination, and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Beza was not credible. As such, Beza failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to qualify for relief from deportation. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b) .(2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-24\">In addition, we find substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that there was no nexus between Beza\u2019s application for asylum and the successful applications filed by his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-25\">Accordingly, we deny Beza\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-26\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
