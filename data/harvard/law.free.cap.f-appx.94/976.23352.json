Liedke pled guilty to disqualified possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). In his plea agreement, Liedke waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence except in the face of an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-20\">Liedke\u2019s appointed counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues presented on appeal but raising one question. Liedke was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief but has failed to do so. Liedke challenges the district court\u2019s downward departure below the statutory minimum sentence for the firearm offense. He asserts the court improperly relied on factors other than Liedke\u2019s cooperation to limit the downward departure granted upon the Government\u2019s motion filed pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1' (2002). This court does not review downward departures unless the departure resulted in an illegal sentence or resulted from an incorrect application of the guidelines. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995) (citing * 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (2000)). These factors are not presented in Liedke\u2019s sentencing. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review Liedke\u2019s sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-22\">Moreover, in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000), this Court held that \u201ca defendant may not appeal his sentence if his plea agreement contains an express and unqualified waiver of the right to appeal, unless that waiver was unknowing or involuntary.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). Liedke has presented no evidence that his decision to waive his appellate rights was unknowing or unintelligent, or claimed, any exception to the validity of the plea waier. Thus, Liedke\u2019s appeal is also foreclosed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>appellate waiver he knowingly signed in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss Liedke\u2019s appeal. We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
