Hill argues that the district court should not have dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim because the alleged conspiracy violated his constitutional rights. He next argues that the district court should have converted his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint into a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition when Hill\u2019s state court conviction became final. Finally, Hill argues that the district court erred in assessing a strik\u00e9 against him for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-21\">At the time Hill filed his original 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, his claims were subject to being stayed because Hill had not yet been convicted in Mississippi state court. <em>See Mackey v. Dickson, </em>47 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.1995). Following Hill\u2019s conviction, the district court correctly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See id.; see also Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Hill has failed to provide any evidence that he had exhausted his state court remedies with regard to his claims as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). Hill has not shown that exhaustion of his state court remedies would be futile. <em>See Deters v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 789, 795-96 (5th Cir. 1993). Thus, the district court did not err in refusing to convert his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint into a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Finally, the district court did not err in assessing a strike against Hill. Hill\u2019s complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, which counts as a strike. <em>See Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 461-64 (5th Cir.1998); 28 U.S.C. 915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-15\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
