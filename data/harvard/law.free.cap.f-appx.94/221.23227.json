They have not challenged the denial of withholding of removal or the finding that they are not entitled to asylum on the basis of a well-founded fear of future persecution. These claims are therefore abandoned. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. I.N.S., </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">The petitioners argue that the BIA erred in determining that they were not persecuted based upon their religion and ethnicity. The petitioners argue that they established past persecution based on Fenny Tjandra Tjin\u2019s fear following the rape of Chinese women during riots in Jakarta in May 1998, her feeling of isolation during church bombings and burnings, and her loss of a night\u2019s sleep following a threatening phone call to her home. After reviewing the record and the briefs, we conclude that the decision, that the petitioners\u2019 allegations did not rise to the level of persecution, is supported by substantial evidence and that the evidence in the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ and BIA. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Abdel-Masieh v. I.N.S., </em>73 F.3d 579, 583-84 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Gomez-Mejia v.
