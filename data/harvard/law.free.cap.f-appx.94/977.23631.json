Jones\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. Califo</em>rnia 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-24\">Counsel suggests that the court may have erred in denying Jones an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The district court\u2019s determination regarding acceptance of responsibility is factual, and we review it with great deference for clear error. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5) (2002); <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>in concluding that Jones had not demonstrated acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">In his pro se brief, Jones essentially repeats counsel\u2019s argument regarding acceptance of responsibility. Jones also asserts that he provided assistance to the Government, before and after his sentencing in the instant case, in the investigation of other crimes. To the extent that we construe these assertions as alleging that he was improperly denied a downward departure from his Guidelines range based upon substantial assistance, we note that Jones did not raise this issue before the district court and does not assert that any failure by the Government to move for a departure was based upon an improper motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Accordingly, we find this argument does not entitle Jones to any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">We have reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
