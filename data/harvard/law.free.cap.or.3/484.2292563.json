Respondents here, defendants below, executed an undertaking, and procured the discharge of Morst from arrest. After judgment against Morst, and after execution against his property and a return of none found, an execution was issued against his person, which was returned not served, as Morst had left the state. On the twenty-fourth of March, 1869, appellants brought an action against the respondents on the undertaking, and on the twenty-sixth day of April, 1869, the justice gave judgment for the defendants, assigning as ground therefor, no cause of action. On the second of June, appellants filed a petition for a writ of review, and an allowance was made. On the fourteenth of June, in the circuit court, respondents\u2019 counsel moved to strike out and quash the writ. The court below sustained the motion, and filed his reasons, to which ruling the appellants excepted and took an appeal here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-5\"><em>Kelly &amp; Heed, </em>for appellants, assign as error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-6\">1st.

At the December Term, 1860, of the supreme court of this state, the same question was before that court, as is now here. In <em>Blanchard et al. </em>v. <em>Bennett et al., </em>1 Oregon, 329, the court held, \u201ca <em>certiorari </em>may have been a proper remedy, and so may have been an appeal; the statute regulating appeals from justices of the peace allows appeals in all cases, etc., (Laws of Oregon, 1854; p. 295, sec. 185.) I therefore conclude that appeals lie in all cases from the final decisions of justices of the peace, and the remedy by <em>certiorari </em>is concurrent.\u201d When the writ of review was substituted for that of certiorari, it was subject to the same construction and application. The only difference in the law is found in sec. 575 of the Code, which was not distinctly found in the law of 1854. That declares that the writ of review \u201cshall be allowed, in all cases where there is no <em>appeal, </em>or <em>other </em>plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, and where the inferior court officer appears to have exercised such functions erroneously, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">When a party complains <em>only </em>of the errors in law appearing upon the record and proceedings, it is certainly not a. plain, speedy or adequate remedy to force him to rely upon an appeal, which, under sec. 536, subdiv. 3, p. 285, of the Code, requires the same proceedings as though the case had been commenced in the circuit court, involving witnesses and a multitude of costs and disbursements, instead of having the pure questions of law, governing the case, heard and decided with comparatively no trouble or cost. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The circuit judge, in allowing the writ, passes to some extent upon whether the causes alleged are errors of law or not, and if they involve more than legal questions, it might be proper to deny the writ and leave the party to his appeal, as the mode by which all the questions of law and fact may be retried. In review, everything is tried and decided from an inspection of the record, and an appeal cannot accomplish this without imposing a great incumbrance of other matters. Evidently the legislature intended this construction, for in sec. 116, p. 604, of the act relating to courts of justices of -the peace, distinctly withdraws the operations of the see. 64, p. 595, which gives an <em>appeal </em>in <em>all cases </em>from such court, except in three cases mentioned, in these words, <em>\u201cNo </em>provision of this act in relation to appeals, or the right of appeal, in either civil or criminal cases, must be construed so as to prevent either party to a judgment, given in a justice\u2019s court from having the same review in the circuit court, for errors in law appearing upon the face of such judgment, or the proceedings connected therewith, as provided in title 1 chap. VII,\u201d which is the law in reference to review. Taking the two laws together, and the reasons which operate in allowing the writ of review, we think that a party may have a right to \u25a0 a writ of review for <em>errors </em>in law apparent upon the record, etc., at the same time that he might have a right of appeal, which would retry the merits of the case as well as review the questions of law; that review and appeal may thus be Concurrent remedies; and it follows then, that the expiration of a right to appeal, as to time, does not extinguish the right to a review. The one cuts off all possibility of having the case reheard upon its merits; but if the law, apparent from the papers, forbid such a judgment, then the judgment may be reversed or modified as to the mere questions of law at any time during the limit assigned for review. We think the judgment should be reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
