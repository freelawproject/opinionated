Boydsion, </em>sworn:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-11\">\u201cMy arm was broken about the middle of August, 1888. At the first <em>the </em>defendant applied a splint. 'x\u2018 * * The second or third day he dressed it again in a similar manner. A little more than three weeks after the injury, defendant took the splint off at his office, examined the arm particularly, and said, \u00a3Xt has commenced to heal.\u2019 He then did it up in a hurry and went away, saying he would be back in half an hour. He came back in half an hour and took the bandage off; the arm lying along on the table, and the hand fell over on to the palm. X said to him, \u2018You said it had united.\u2019 He replied, \u00a3Xt was just stuck.\u2019 X <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>was under defendant\u2019s care in all about three months. At the end of that time the arm was in the condition it is now.\u201d (The arm was exhibited to the jury; its present condition was thus described by a medical expert):</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-4\">\u201c The injury was an oblique fracture of both bones of the right forearm <em>(ulna and </em>radius) just below the middle. The fragments have united in a deformed or crooked condition. That is, the superior or upper end of the inferior or lower fragment of the <em>ulna </em>projects backwards and slightly upwards \u2014 in other words, <em>overrides </em>the upper fragment of the same bone (the <em>ulna). </em>The superior or upper end of the lower fragment of the <em>radius </em>projects a little forwards, or in technical language <em>anteriority. </em>The right hand, is considerably turned inwards \u2014 or <em>pronated. </em>The forearm presents a distorted and twisted appearance, with somewhat of a lump or projection on the back of the seat of fracture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">\u201cThe union is probably <em>osseous </em>or bony. The arm is almost as strong \u2014 though not as useful as prior to the injury. The injured fore-arm appears about three fourths of an inch shorter than the other, and is flexed or bent forward or inward at the point of fracture; the direction of the arm from that point to the wrist being about eight degrees from the natural position.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-6\">The plaintiff testified further: \u201cI followed the defendant\u2019s directions as to the treatment. When defendant discharged me he took the splints off, helped me to put my coat on, and said \u2018It is all right.\u2019 About three weeks after that he looked at it; he said \u2018 It is crooked.\u2019\u2019 I told him it was just so when he discharged me. He told me to come to his office. By his advice a tin straightener or splint was made and applied, in order to render the arm more straight.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-7\"><em>Dr. Watkins, </em>testified: \u201c Last spring I saw the arm. The <em>radius </em>was slipped-by a little more at its fraeuturedends than the <em>ulna. </em>I think the <em>ulna </em>was united, and that the <em>radius </em>had not a bony union. The arm was somewhat bent. Ordinarily the bones will unite in six or eight weeks. There is a union of the <em>radius, </em>the union is <em>cartilaginous. </em>If bony union had taken place, and the bone became solid, a steady train would not displace it (so as to cause an angle). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>If the fracturo is very oblique it will be more difficult to keep the bones in place.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-4\"><em>Dr. </em>Chapman:testified: \u00a3\u00a3 J saw the plaintiff\u2019s arm nearly a year ago; it was crooked. lie was at work, but had not a good use of it. My mode of treating such a fracture, after reduction, is to dress it in splints, putting a roller bandage on first, then splints on the inner and outside of the arm, anu bandage outside or over the splints.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\"><em>Dr. Wythe-, </em>deposed: \u00a3\u00a3I saw the arm about-months after the injury. I advised that it be broken over again.\u201d Burch, Starr, and Hay, each testified that the arm was about in its present condition, when the plaintiff was discharged from treatment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-8\">The defendant, <em>Dr. J. 8. GiUner.- </em>\u2014 Testified in his own behalf. \u00a3\u00a3I am a physician and surgeon. I was graduated in 1836, at the medical college of Pennsylvania. When called to treat the plaintiff, I reduced the fracture, and applied a roller bandage, commenced bandaging at the fingers, and carried it up towards the elbow, then applied splints on the inner and outer side of the fore-arm. I applied a compress (made by wrapping a small stick with cloth) on the inner and outer side of the arm, under the splints, to press between the <em>ulna </em>and <em>radius. </em>When the splints were wrapped, I placed the arm in a sling, with the hand in a position between <em>supination </em>and <em>pronation. </em>On the morning of the eighth of September, plaintiff came to the office, and the bandages were loose. I examined the arm; the fractured parts were in proper position, and were as when the fracture was first reduced. I saw him on each alternate day after that. On the twelfth and fourteenth of September, I told the plaintiff I wanted he should procure another surgeon, to act in consultation with me; that I was not disposed to take the risk of a prosecution. He said that if I did the best I could, I should not be responsible for the result. I took off the wooden splints on the thirty-first of October. The arm was then straight, and in proper shape. I then dressed it again, using pasteboard splints. I then discharged the plaintiff, telling him to wear the pasteboard splints six weeks. Before the wooden splints were taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>off, plaintiff told -me lie had removed the bandages, because they were painful. He went to work in a tin shop without my knowledge. Dr. Wythe being consulted, advised with me, the support made of tin. The <em>ulna </em>and <em>radius </em>were both frpctured, the latter obliquely. If the bones had been grown together, they could have come to their present position without a refracture. But not so, if they had been joined by a bony union. I follow Gross\u2019 system.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\"><em>Dr. Ghapman, </em>called by defendant, testified: \u201cThere are cases where, although the bones are in proper position, a bony or <em>osseous </em>deposit will not take place. The first union is <em>cartilaginous; </em>after a long time generally, the <em>cartilaginous </em>deposits will gradually assume an <em>osseous </em>character, and may in time become bone.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-6\">This statement was objected to, and the plaintiff moved to strike it out, on the ground that the plaintiff alleges, (which the answer does not deny), that the fracture was simple, and the injury one that could have been easily cured: <em>Reid, </em>that the allegation that the'fracture was a \u201csimple fracture,\u201d must be deemed admitted, but the statement that the injury could have been cured by ordinary care and surgical skill, is the statement of a conclusion, and cannot b\u00a1e treated as a fact, admitted by the pleadings. The motion was overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-7\"><em>Dr. Bodman, </em>testified: \u201c Absorption may take place after the fractured bone has united. It may be caused by too much exercise, by physical debility, or other and perhaps complicated causes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-8\"><em>Dr. Loryea, </em>testified: \u201cA proper degree of excitement in the system favors the secretion and deposit about the place of fracture, of plastic <em>osseous </em>matter, that afterwards takes the consistency and form of bone. But if the system becomes too much excited, amounting to inflammation, the deposit will be suspended. If the excitement ceases and the system becomes torpid, that will also suspend such secretions. My opinion is, that the <em>ulna </em>is in a state of <em>osseous </em>union, and the <em>radius </em>in a state of <em>cartilaginous </em>union, and that it is probably the union of the two bones with each other that now prevents the ordinary and natural mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tion of the wrist. What union there is, is very nearly a bony union. When the <em>nutricious </em>artery is injured, ossification will be tardy.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-4\"><em>Rev. Mr. Myers, </em>sworn: Corroborated the statement of Dr. Giltner as to the mode of dressi ng the arm in the first instance. And testified that both arms appeared of the same length at the time defendant was discharged from treatment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-5\"><em>F. M. Grey, </em>testified: \u201cOn one occasion, when the defendant was dressing the plaintiff\u2019s arm, the plaintiff said he had dreamed and hurt his arm in the night. And that the bandages had become loose. About the time the defendant was discharged the arm was straight and of the same length as the other. When the defendant looked at it some weeks after that, a lump was on it, and the plaintiff then said eit was straight when the splints were taken off,\u2019 and that the lump \u2018had come since.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-6\"><em>Dr. R. Glisan, </em>testified: \u201cI have been acquainted with the defendant and his practice four or five years. I once saw him amputate a fore-arm.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-7\">Question. \u2014 \u201cHave you known enough of his practice to be able to judge in regard to his skill as a surgeon, and if yes, what is your opinion on that subject?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-8\">The question was objected to as incompetent and the objection sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-9\">Question. \u2014 \u201cHow did he perform the surgical operation you have witnessed ? \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-10\">The same objection was made, but was overruled, and the witness answered:</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-11\">\u201cHe performed the operations skillfully.\u201d Witness continued \u2014 \u201c If this fracture was properly reduced, and if a bony union then took place, the parts might acquire their present position by a re-fracture, or possibly by re-absorption of the <em>osseous </em>deposit. Cases of such absorption are rare.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-12\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>\u2014 After a firm cartilaginous union, it would not be likely to get into this position, but if the union was slight, such a thing would not be very uncommon or very improbable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-13\">Question. \u2014 \u201cIf the arm had not been reduced or dressed with splints, what would have been its present condition ?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-14\">Answer. \u2014 '\u201cThe same as it is now.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Mr. Crouch, </em>testified: \u201cAbout the tenth of January, I heard plaintiff say his arm was getting along pretty well, and that he took the splints off because they hurt him. while turning the crank at the tin-shop.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-4\"><em>John Kersher, </em>testified: \u201cIn March I heard the plaintiff say he took the splints off because they hurt him when he was at work.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\"><em>Parrish Giltner, </em>testified: \u201cWhen the defendant took the wood splints off, he, told the plaintiff he ought not to work for some time. My father (the defendant) measured both arms at that time; they were of the same length.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\">The evidence also showed that the plaintiff, about the time or soon after the wood splints were permanently removed, commenced to exercise the arm by turning a light crank of a machine used for rimming or edging small tin-can heads.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-7\">The plaintiff testified that the exercise was in pursuance of defendant\u2019s advice and direction. The defendant testified the contrary. The plaintiff testified that he wore the pasteboard splints after his discharge, and while exercising, for some weeks, and that he wore them until they were literally worn into fragments. Several medical experts were examined as to the probability of the present condition of the arm being produced without a perceptible and painful re-fracture, if <em>osseous </em>or <em>cartilaginous </em>union had once taken place, while the fractured parts were in apposition. But no very decided opinions were elicited on that point.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b144-8\">Upton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArD\">in charging the jury, after stating the issues made by the pleadings, explained the duties and liabilities of physicians and surgeons, substantially as in the case of <em>jHeath </em>v. <em>Glisan et al, </em>the judge proceeded to say: \u201cIf you should find that Dr. Giltner, the defendant, refractured the arm, it does not follow from that fact alone that he was guilty of bad surgery. Nor does it follow from the fact that the plaintiff was not informed what the surgeon was doing or about to do. If you find from the evidence that the arm was purposely refractured by the defendant under circumstances that disclose a want of ordinary care and skill on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>part \u2014 or that he refraetured it improperly, either because of gross ignorance or the want of ordinary care or skill on his part, that act of itself renders the defendant liable. But unless you do find from the evidence both that the defendant refraetured the arm, and that it was the result of a lack of ordinary skill or care, there is no blame to be attributed in consequence of that act, and your inquiries should be directed to other branches of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Counsel both for the plaintiff and for the defendant have remarked upon the propriety or impropriety of what they term a compromise verdict. In regard to that, it is my duty to say to you, that jurors should carefully and patiently canvass and examine all the evidence, with an honest and conscientious effort to reconcile any differences of opinion they may entertain of the truth of the matters put in issue. And it is sometimes the case, when only dollars and cents are involved, when, it is probable the exact truth can never be known, and where there isan honest difference of opinion among jurors, as, for an instance, when the matter between the parties is the state of their accounts, which have been loosely kept, and there is doubt as to the true balance, that concessions may be made for the benefit of both parties, which are not fully in accord with the individual juror\u2019s view of the facts proved. But in this class of cases, each party has a right to insist that the jury, and each juror, should render a verdict, if at all, literally \u201caccording to the law and the evidence, as given on the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">When a man enters upon a trade or profession for his life\u2019s business, he stakes the efforts of a lifetime in building up for himself a character and a name in that trade or profession; and if tho plaintiff's case is not established by the proofs, the defendant is entitled to a verdict at your hands, which you have no right to withhold from him. But if the defendant assumed to act in a profession of which ho is grossly ignorant, or if, after undertaking the grave responsibility of treating the plaintiff\u2019s broken limb, he has failed to treat the case with that ordinary care and skill that every one has a right to expect of his physician and surgeon, and has thus deprived the plaintiff, for the remainder o\u00a3 his life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>of the proper use of Ms right hand, your verdict should compensate the plaintiff for the injury he has sustained, and place a mark on the defendant\u2019s professional standing that time will not efface.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The jury rendered a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
