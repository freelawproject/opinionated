Jackson, having appeared as attorney for the defendant, made and filed a motion to discharge the attachment above stated. Said motion being denied, the defendant withdrew.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-4\">The affidavit for attachment was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">\u201cInjustice\u2019s court, before Norman Martin, for the precinct of Wapatoo, state of Oregon, county of Washington.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAf3\">\u201cJ, W. Thompson <em>v. </em>\u201cWilliam White.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-9\">\u201cJ. W. Thompson, the plaintiff above named, being duly sworn, says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-10\">1. \u201cThat a sufficient cause of action exists in his favor against the defendant, William White, the grounds of which appear in the sworn complaint hereunto annexed, all the statements contained in which are true to the knowledge of this deponent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-11\">\u20222. That the defendant is about to convey away and dispose of his personal property in such a manner as thereby to defraud his creditors of their just and lawful dues.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-12\">3. That the said plaintiff has commenced an action in this court by issuing the summons hereto annexed against said William White, upon the cause of action above annexed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-13\">Subscribed and sworn, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-14\">The affidavit was not annexed to the complaint or summons. The evidence shows that said White (then defendant) was a farmer at the time his team was levied upon. That the acting constable, Bridgwater, was about to levy on a quantity of wheat, but said White, desiring to use the wheat, requested the constable not to take it, but to levy on something else instead. Thereupon the constable took the horses in White\u2019s presence, and without objection. Parol evidence was offered, to show that the defendant\u2019s appearance in the original action was special. Both the .attachment and execution were regular on their face.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-15\"><em>H. </em>Jackson, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahk\">claimed that the appearance in the original action was special, and did not confer juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>diction of tbe person, so as to enable tbe court to render judgment on tlie merits, after the defendant withdrew; that the defendant should show a ease within sec. 120, p. 605 of the Code, to authorize a special constable; that the affidavit was insufficient; and that tbe property was exempt from execution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-4\"><em>W. D. </em>Hare, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">The writ protects the officer. The appearance of the defendant is shown by tbe docket, and does not appear to be special. The levy on the horses was made at this plaintiff\u2019s request. He did not demand the property as exempt. (Code sec. 279.) The affidavit for attachment is colorable, and sufficient to give jurisdiction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b137-6\">Upton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">The following rulings were made in the ease:</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">The affidavit for the attachment was insufficient to confer jurisdiction to issue the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The writ of attachment is regular on its face, and protects the officer when sued for damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The order appointing Bridgwater to serve process is in the form prescribed by sec. 120 of the justice\u2019s act. The court had jurisdiction to pass upon the necessity of the appointment, and has made such record as the law req \u00f1ires. When a court has acquired jurisdiction and is acting within it, error will not be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">There being no fraud alleged, parol evidence is not admissible to dispiite the docket of the justice of the peace, or to so explain it as to make it import a want of jurisdiction, when on its face it imports jurisdiction of tbe person.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">Tbe docket entry is evidence that the defendant appeared in the cause, and the appearance is equivalent to service of summons. The defendant\u2019s withdrawal from the cause did not oust the jurisdiction. The court had jurisdiction to render judgment and issue the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">A void attachment, although regular on its face, does not protect the defendants Thompson and Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">Property can not be claimed as exempt from execution, unless \u201cselected and reserved by the judgment debtor or Ms agent at the time of the levy,\u201d or before sale and witbin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>a reasonable time after tbe levy shall be known to him. It is too late, for one knowing of tbe levy from tbe first, to set np tbe claim after sale. (Code sec. 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Tbe plaintiff should recover from tbe defendants Thompson and Martin for tbe detention, from tbe time of tbe seizure of tbe property to tbe levy of tbe execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Tbe plaintiff bad a verdict for $24.00.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
