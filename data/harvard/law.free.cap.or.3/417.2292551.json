PEASE, Administrator, Respondent, <em>v. </em>JAMES K. KELLY and others, Appellants.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-8\">Vendob\u2019s Lien. \u2014 A mortgage is a more certain security than a vendor\u2019s lien, and under our laws, .the tailing of a mortgage for the purchase money, is a waiver of the vendor\u2019s lien.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-9\">Idem. \u2014 A vendor\u2019s lien exists in ease there is no higher security.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-10\">Idem. \u2014 Both the lien of a mortgage and a vendor\u2019s lien cannot exist at the same time.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-11\">The complaint in substance alleges that Robert Moore in his lifetime, in 1852, sold and conveyed by deed to Daniel H. Ferguson, a tract of land, and water privilege at the Willamette Falls, for fifty thousand dollars; of which sum forty-five thousand remained unpaid, and a note for that amount was taken by Moore, secured by mortgage on the premises. In 1853, Ferguson sold the premises subject to the mortgage, to the Willamette Falls Transportation Company, who made extensive improvements thereon, and failed; leaving their work subject to the liens of mechanics and material men, in addition to the incumbrance of this mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>gage. In 1854, Moore assigned this note and mortgage, by written assignment to O. C. Pratt, to secure the payment of a sum of money, loaned by Prattjto Moore. In 1855, Pratt assigned by written assignment to Leander Holmes, and, at the same time, Moore executed a second assignment of the note and mortgage to Holmes, but, at the same time, and as a part of the same transaction, took back an agreement from' Holmes to pay him (Moore) certain sums of money, and especially $9000, which sums were to be secured to Moore by a new mortgage . on the land in question, so soon as Holmes should get the legal title, and discharge the premises from certain mechanics\u2019 liens, which were pending against the property, amounting to about $9,000.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-5\"><em>J. K. Kelly </em>and <em>Mitchell &amp; Dolph, </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">A vendor\u2019s lien, recognized by the courts of some of the states, and rejected by others, is a dangerous principle, and one opposed to the prevailing policy of this country, which discourages secret liens. <em>(Bayley </em>v. <em>Greenleaf, </em>7 Wheaton, 78; 5 Curtis, 216; 1 Lead. Cases in Equity, 363; <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Munou, </em>3 Kansas, 182.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">Taking an express security on the land itself for the whole amount unpaid, as by a mortgage, will merge the implied lien. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>4 Wheat. 255; 27 Ill. 422; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>1 Paige, 30, 31; and others.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-8\">A vendor\u2019s lien will not be enforced against a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser without notice. (7 Wheaton, 50; 1 Leading Cases in Eq. 371.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-9\"><em>Logan &amp; Shattuch, J. B. Upton </em>and <em>Bronaugh &amp; Bybee, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-10\">Even if it be held that Moore\u2019s assignment of the $45,000 note and mortgage to Holmes was full, so as to divest Moore at law of all interest in and control over those writings, yet, if $9,000 of the <em>purchase money </em>of the land, intended to be evidenced and secured by those instruments, remains actually due to Moore, under the agreement be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>tween him and Holmes, at the time o\u00ed assigning the note and mortgage; and if the defendants had notice, actual or constructive, of that fact at the time they became the purchasers of tho land, then Moore\u2019s estate still retains in equity a vendor\u2019s lien against the land for said $9,000 debt, unless Moore did some act amounting to a waiver of such liep. (4 Kent, 152; 1 John. Oh. E. 308; 5 Ohio, 35; 18 Ark. 142; 1 Paige, 23 and numerous other cases cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-5\">The taking of a <em>distinct </em>security for the purchase money, is a vfaiver of this lien, but the taking of a mortgage on the land is not. (17 Ohio 500.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-6\">The rule <em>caveat emptor </em>applies to Kelly\u2019s purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale, of the interest of the Willamette Palls M. &amp;'T. Co. in the land. (2 Kent, 78; 16 Cal. 559; 9 Wheat. 616, 648, and other cases.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-10\">. The briefs in this case are very full, and embrace very many points of interest to tho bar. Only such points are referred to here as belong to the views taken by the court. \u2014 Hep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b439-7\">Boise, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyDN\">In this case, Moore took a note and security on the land for the purchase money. A mortgage is a more certain and definite security than a vendor\u2019s lien. The lien exists if there is no higher security, but we think that the taking of a mortgage, which is an open and public lien, is a waiver of the vendor\u2019s lien, and we think that both liens cannot exist at the same time, and such seems to be the well established doctrine of the cases. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>4 Wheat. 255; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>1 Paige, 30; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>12 Cal. 30; <em>Camden </em>v. <em>Vail, </em>23 Cal. 633; 1st Leading cases in Equity, 365; 27 Ill. 422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">This view of the matter necessarily disposes of all the questions in the case, and it will not be necessary in disposing of the case, to consider the numerous other points which were disbussed on the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The judgment will bo reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
