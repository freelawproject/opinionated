He has been detained pending trial since his arrest in 2012. At Muhto-rov\u2019s request, the district court recently continued his trial until March 12, 2018, so it can take place after his co-defendant, Bakhtiyor Jumaev, is tried in January.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Muhtorov has filed three motions for pretrial release\u2014in 2012, 2015, and 2017. The district court denied his first two motions, but on June 23, 2017, it issued an order allowing his release (\u201cthe June 23 order\u201d), subject to home detention with an ankle bracelet and various other conditions. The government now challenges the June 23 order, which we have stayed pending resolution of this appeal. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Muhtorov came to the United States from Uzbekistan as a refugee in 2007. The government became aware of him through his year-long e-mail communications with an administrator of the IJU\u2019s official website. The IJU has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization since 2005. It is an ally of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban and has engaged in fights against United States troops in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The government intercepted Muhtorov\u2019s communications during surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801-1811, 1821-1829. In them, Muhtorov expressed his \u201csupport of the [IJU],, his profession of allegiance to them, and his profession of wanting to provide whatever support he could to them.\u201d App., Vol. 4 at 867. In particular, he discussed purchasing portable satellite equipment and sending $300 in cash, which he had received from his co-defendant, Jumaev. Further, he swore his \u201cBay\u2019ah,\u201d or allegiance, to the IJU and said \u201che would do whatever is necessary for them or whatever they asked of him, even to the point of death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 903. Muhtorov also discussed martyrdom with Jumaev, and the men said they would meet in heaven. <em>Id. </em>at 920. Additionally, in email and phone conversations, they talked about joining the \u201cwedding\u201d (a common code word for the jihadist movement, martyrdom operations, or an armed struggle) and referenced the \u201cwedding house,\u201d and the \u201cwedding gift\u201d (which typically refers to financial support). The men also discussed going to Turkey to study at a ma-drassa, or religious school.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">In January 2012, Muhtorov was arrested at the Chicago airport, en route to Istanbul, Turkey. He had purchased a one-way ticket. At the time of his arrest, he had almost $3,000 in cash, two new iPhones in their original packaging, and a new iPad in the same condition. His own phone contained videos showing combat against coalition forces, instructions on making improvised explosive devices, and graphic images of jihadists beheading captured men.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">A grand jury indicted Muhtorov for conspiracy and attempt to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. He has been detained pending trial since his arrest for the past five and one-half years. The delay in proceeding to trial is the result of a confluence of factors, including his motions to suppress evidence obtained under FISA and other extensive pretrial motions; threats to a key government witness, which necessitated extensive discussions about the conditions of that witness\u2019s testimony; issues stemming from the severance of the trials; and the need to translate voluminous documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">Muhtorov first sought release in February 2012 at a detention hearing before the magistrate judge, which centered on testimony by an FBI agent. The magistrate judge denied the motion for release after concluding (1) by a preponderance of the evidence, that no condition or combination of conditions of release would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>reasonably assure Muhtorows appearance at future court proceedings; and (2) by clear and convincing evidence, that Muh-torov presents a risk to other persons and the community and that no condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the community\u2019s safety. The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Muhtorov next sought pretrial release in July 2015 through a motion for reconsideration of bail based on the extraordinary length of pretrial detention and the due process implications thereof. By then, Muhtorov had been in custody for three and one-half years, though his motion acknowledged the lack of any speedy trial issues and conceded the pretrial process had taken a long time due to the case\u2019s complexity. The government objected that Muhtorov could not reopen the detention hearing because he had not presented any new information that was not known to him at the time of the detention hearing and that has a material bearing on whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of other persons and the community, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f). The district court denied the second motion for release after concluding that Muhtorov presents a <em>\u201cbona fide,\u201d </em>\u201cserious flight risk.\u201d App., Vol. 3 at 475.. It cited \u201c[t]he serious nature of the charges\u201d; \u201cthe severity of the penalties for conviction\u201d (15 years per count, with a possibility the sentences could run consecutively for a total of 60 years);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cthe fact he was apprehended while in the process of leaving the country and destined for the Middle East carrying money and electronic equipment capable of being used by a terrorist organization\u201d; and \u201cthe threat of violence implicit in these acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And it opined that the trial delays were occasioned, to some degree, by the complexity of the case, numerous motions filed by Muhtorov, and translation issues\u2014not by lack of diligence or zeal by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">That brings us to the third motion for pretrial release and the June 23 order granting it. That motion was precipitated by a continuance of Jumaev\u2019s trial, which spurred Muhtorov to request his own continuance so as to proceed second and call Jumaev as a defense witness. The district court reopened Muhtorov\u2019s detention hearing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f)(2) based on the following new information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">\u2022 The' government dismissed counts 5 and 6 of the indictment, which charged that Muhtorov and Jumaev conspired to provide material support and resources to the IJU in the form of personnel (namely, Abdullo Jumaev) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2339A, 2339B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">\u2022 The \u201cactual factual basis\u201d for the nature of the alleged crimes and the flight and danger risk Muhtorov poses, App., Vol. 9 at 1934, is now based on more than one FBI agent\u2019s testimony. Three evidentiary hearings show the government\u2019s case may be weaker and Muhtorov\u2019s defenses stronger, so \u201c[tjhere is reason to believe ... that Mr, Muhtorov has been invested with a sense of a direction and a reason to stay and see the trial of his case through.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1934-35.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">\u2022 The district court reassessed the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g)(1) and (2), as detailed below, and determined the evidence \u201csuggest[s] Mr. Muhtorov\u2019s bark was more serious than his bite.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1936.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Ultimately, the district court found that \u201ca combination of conditions for release can be crafted that will assure [Muhto-rov\u2019s] attendance at [trial] and protect the safety of the community.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 1935. It imposed those conditions of release at a hearing on June 26, 2017. Restrictions include GPS ankle monitoring and a 24-hour lockdown at Muhtorov\u2019s home, though he may leave his home for three approved exceptions: (1) religious purposes (i.e., weekly mosque services); (2) meetings with his attorneys; and (3) medical appointments. In addition, Muhtorov has surrendered his passport and cannot have access to internet-capable devices that allow access to social media. The probation office will monitor his electronics as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The government filed this appeal and sought an emergency stay of the release order, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">II. Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The Bail Reform Act sets out the framework for evaluating whether pretrial detention is appropriate. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142. A defendant may be detained pending trial only if a \u201cjudicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d <em>Id </em>\u00a7 3142(e)(1). To make such a finding, the judicial officer must hold a detention hearing per 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f). The factors relevant to considering whether there are release conditions that can ensure the defendant\u2019s appearance and the safety of the community are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, including whether the offense is a federal crime of terrorism; (2) the weight of the evidence; (3) the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger the defendant would pose to the community if released. <em>Id </em>\u00a7 3142(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">In this case, the charges against Muhto-rov establish a rebuttable presumption that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the community.\u201d <em>Id </em>\u00a7 3142(e)(3)(C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is Muhtorov\u2019s burden to rebut the presumption. <em>United States v. Stricklin, </em>932 F.2d 1353, 1355 (10th Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (\u201cThe defendant\u2019s burden of production is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced.\u201d). \u201cHowever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the community always remains with the government.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 1354-55. \u201cThe government must prove risk of flight by a preponderance of the evidence, and it must prove dangerousness to any other person or to the community by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros, </em>328 F.3d 610, 616 (10th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). Having twice found the government met this burden, the district court changed course in the June 23 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">We review the district court\u2019s ultimate release decision de novo because it presents mixed questions of law and fact; however, we review the underlying findings of historical fact for clear error. <em>Id </em>at 613. \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court, on review of the entire record, is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilgert, </em>314 F.3d 506, 515 (10th Cir. 2002) (brackets and internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>quotation marks omitted). We review the district court\u2019s findings with significant deference, cognizant that \u201cour role is not to re-weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">A. The Statutory Presumption of Detention</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The government faults the district court for not \u201caddressing the presumption of detention\u201d and \u201cnot mak[ing] a specific finding that the defendant has rebutted the presumption.\u201d Mem. Br. at 11-12. We have previously held that \u201c[e]ven if a defendant\u2019s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for consideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\u201d <em>Stricklin, </em>982 F.2d at 1355 (citing <em>United States v. Cook, </em>880 F.2d 1158, 1162 (10th Cir. 1989)). But the district court did not need to use a set of \u201cmagic\u201d words when considering the presumption, as the government intimates. We deemed it \u201csignificant[ ]\u201d in <em>Stricklin </em>that \u201cthere was no finding that defendant was successful in rebutting\u201d the \u00a7 3142(e) detention presumption, 932 F.2d at 1355. But we emphasized!that the government made a \u201cstrong evidentiary showing\u201d while noting that the defendant offered no documentary evidence and the district court made no findings whatsoever on the strength of the defendant\u2019s showings. <em>Id. </em>at 1354-55. Likewise, in <em>Cook, </em>we found error when the district court \u201ccompletely skipped over\u201d the rebuttable presumption of detention in denying a motion to revoke release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(b). 880 F.2d at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Here, by contrast, it is clear the district court was aware of, and guided by, the rebuttable presumption. This was the third motion for pretrial release, and the parties and court discussed the presumption in detail with respect to all three motions; indeed, it played a role in Muhtorov\u2019s continuing detention. And the district court explicitly referenced the presumption at the outset of the June 23 order. <em>See </em>App., Vol. 9 at 1929. It also operated within the framework of the presumption when it made detailed findings on the ways in which the circumstances had changed since its original finding that no conditions could guarantee Muhtorov\u2019s appearance at trial or the community\u2019s safety. For these reasons, we reject the government\u2019s argument that the district court did not give any weight to the rebuttable presumption or make appropriate findings as to whether Muhtorov rebutted the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">B. The \u00a7 3142(g) Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">Next, we turn to the government\u2019s argument that the district court did not identify significant evidence to overcome the statutory presumption and the evidentiary record\u2014both of which show that no conditions of release can reasonably assure Muhtorov\u2019s appearance at trial or the safety of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">1. Nature and Circumstances of Offense Charged</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">The first factor is \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is ... a Federal crime of terrorism.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g)(1). Muhtorov has been charged with knowingly providing support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, or attempting or conspiring to do so, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B, which is a federal crime of terrorism. This factor has remained constant: The district court repeatedly recognized the serious nature of the charges in resolving all three of Muh-torov\u2019s motions for pretrial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">Likewise, the circumstances surrounding Muhtorov\u2019s arrest have not changed. He expressed his willingness to support the IJU in multiple e-mails and phone conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>sations and was arrested while attempting to board a one-way flight to Turkey, in possession of cash and electronic equipment. He resigned from his job shortly before the trip. And he told his- daughter in the preceding months that he might not see her again on earth, but he would see her in heaven if she was a good Muslim girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">2. Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The second factor\u2014\u201cthe weight of the evidence against the person,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g)(2)\u2014was the primary focus of the June 23 order. The district court\u2019s treatment of this factor changed dramatically from its earlier analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The district court noted the government\u2019s dismissal of the last two counts of the indictment. It then reassessed the strength of the evidence against Muhtorov based on new or changed information gleaned from three hearings: (1) a January 2017 suppression hearing that demonstrated some weaknesses in the government\u2019s translations of the evidence and its linguists; (2) a February 2017 <em>James </em>hearing that gave a thorough overview of the government\u2019s evidence to support its conspiracy claims; and (3) a March 2017 <em>Dm-bert </em>hearing from which it can be inferred that the IJU\u2019s administrator did not take Muhtorov seriously and that Muhtorov left for Turkey without a definitive plan with anyone from the IJU. Ultimately, the district court concluded that the evidence against Muhtorov is not as strong as it seemed to be at the initial detention hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">To support its revised assessment, the district court also cited expert testimony that may undermine the government\u2019s theory that the madrassa that Muhtorov planned to attend was a known conduit to the IJU. It focused on the fact that Muhto-rov\u2019s oath to the IJU was made but not accepted. And it observed that \u201clarge majorities\u201d of the Muhtorov-Jumaev conversations involved \u201cprattle and topics other than terrorism or plans to support it.\u201d App., Vol. 9 at 1936. Pointing to all of these purported deficiencies, the district court concluded that the evidence now \u201csuggests] Mr. Muhtorov\u2019s bark was more serious than his bite,\u201d <em>id. </em>Even so, the district court expressed \u201cconcern[s] about witness intimidation and the actions of Mrs. Muhtorov and others having previously attempted to contact\u201d potential witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 1935. It also acknowledged the government \u201cmay have thwarted an actual plan to provide smartphones and services to the IJU.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">3. Defendant\u2019s History and Characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The third factor is \u201cthe history and characteristics of the person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g)(3). It encompasses the defendant\u2019s \u201ccharacter, physical and mental condition, family ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, and record concerning appearance at court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3142(g)(3)(A). It also takes into account whether the defendant was being punished for another offense at the time of his arrest. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3142(g)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">The district court generally referenced Muhtorov\u2019s \u201cwork history\u201d as a commercial truck driver. App., Vol, 9 at 1936. It also described his \u201cfamily and community ties\u201d as \u201csubstantial,\u201d focusing on his relationship with \u25a0 his wife. <em>Id. </em>The district court stated that his wife has lived and worked in the community for ten years, as Muhtorov did for five years without incident before his arrest. <em>Id. </em>And it noted that his wife has visited him during his detention, the couple now has a third child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>born during his incarceration, and thus \u201c[tjheir familial relationship has deepened.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">4. Nature and Seriousness of the Danger to Any Person or the Community</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The fourth factor is \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the person\u2019s release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g)(4), As explained above, Muhtorov is presumed to be a danger to the community because of the nature of his charges. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3142(e). This presumption is rebuttable, but it remains in the case as a factor militating against release, to be weighed along with evidence related to the \u00a7 3142(g) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The district court\u2019s reassessment of this factor is closely tied to its revised appraisal of the second factor. It suggests that since the evidence against Muhtorov is not as strong as the district court originally appraised it to be, Muhtorov may not be as dangerous either.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">5. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">We discern no clear error in the individual factual findings listed above. But reviewing the overall release decision de novo, we disagree with the district court\u2019s assessment of the implications and significance of those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">It does not appear that the district court\u2019s release decision turned on its assessment of the first and third factors. Its findings on those factors deviated from its earlier findings in minor respects only. The bulk of the June 23 order was devoted to the district court\u2019s analysis of the second and fourth factors, which seems to be the impetus for the release order. The district court changed its position as to the propriety of release based largely on its revised assessment of the strength of the government\u2019s evidence against Muhtorov, which in turn affected its opinion as to the danger Muhtorov presents to the community and the likelihood he will appear for trial. Its analysis suffers from several major flaws, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">First, the district court cited newly exposed weaknesses in the government\u2019s translations and linguists as a new development that undermines the strength of the government\u2019s case even though any implications are unclear. Testimony at the January 2017 suppression hearing revealed that one of the government\u2019s translators listed his Interagency Language Roundtable test score for Uzbek as a \u201c2 plus\u201d on his resume when it was actually a \u201c2.\u201d A level-two score may not be ideal for translations at a professional level; however, a government expert testified that \u201calmost all of the language that occurs in regular life is at a level 2,\u201d including \u201croutine day-to-day conversation.\u201d App., Vol. 8 at 1525. The court did not identify what material inculpatory statements, if any, depend on the translator\u2019s interpreting skills. At least some of the post-arrest statements can be proven without his translations, such as Muhtorov\u2019s admissions as to the telephone number and e-mail addresses he used to communicate with the IJU and the websites he visited.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">Second, the district court concluded that testimony from the <em>James </em>and <em>Daubert </em>hearings\u2014which focused on the IJU\u2019s failure to accept Muhtorov\u2019s overtures or take him seriously\u2014\u201cgave rise to additional inferences that may be favorable to\u201d Muhto-rov and \u201cundermined the seriousness or depth\u201d of the co-defendant\u2019s conspiracy. App., Vol. 9 at 1934, 1936. This focus on the IJU\u2019s actions is misplaced. Muhtorov is charged, in part, with <em>conspiring </em>to provide and an <em>attempt </em>to provide material support to terrorists. Even assuming the testimony from these hearings weakens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>the government\u2019s evidence that Muhtorov <em>actually </em>provided material support to the IJU, it does not impact the conspiracy and attempt components of the offense. Likewise, any purported disinterest from the IJU does not minimize his coordinated efforts with his alleged co-conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Third, for the same reasons, we reject the district court\u2019s conclusion that Muhto-rov is less dangerous because the IJU had not accepted him and he had not formulated a concrete plan to serve the IJU before his attempted departure. Here, too, the significant concern of our dangerousness inquiry is Muhtorov\u2019s alleged intent to further IJU\u2019s terrorism and the concrete, affirmative sj;eps that he took in manifesting his intent. Nor does the timing of his statement to his daughter, which Muhto-rov emphasizes took place months before his arrest, alter our conclusion. The implications of that statement still evince a substantial risk of community danger in light of his ongoing communications with the IJU and Jumaev at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Simply put, the evidence does not support the district court\u2019s assessment that Muhtorov no longer poses a danger or presents a flight risk that cannot be minimized by strict release conditions. Muhto-rov has professed that he is willing to fight and die for his cause, and he took affirmative steps to further that goal. The contents of his phone reflect Islamic extremist tendencies. And the government alleges that his brother, Hurshid Muhtorov, fought in Syria for the Islamic State in the recent pasj; and has attempted to intimidate a witness in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The government has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Muhtorov would be a flight risk, even with the release conditions imposed by the district court. And it has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the conditions of release, though restrictive, would not reasonably assure the safety of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">The temporary stay of the June 23 order, which was granted on July 7, 2017, is now lifted. For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the district court\u2019s release order dated June 23, 2017. Muhtorov shall be detained pending trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-5\">. Since the time of Muhtorov\u2019s indictment, the maximum prison term listed in \u00a7 2339B has since been amended from 15 years to 20 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">. A rebuttable presumption arises under this provision where the defendant faces charges for certain offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332(g)(5)(B) that carry sentences of ten years. Muhtorov\u2019s alleged crime\u2014a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B\u2014is among the designated offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
