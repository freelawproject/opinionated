Murphy, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b786-14\">Jason Throne embezzled money from his employer and did not report the income to the IRS. Pursuant to an agreement with the government, Throne pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and one count of making a false tax return, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1), In arriving at an advisory sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court increased Throne\u2019s offense level on the mail-fraud conviction by two because Throne \u201cabused a position of ... private trust ... in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. Throne asserts the district court erred in applying \u00a7 3B1.3 to increase his offense level, thus rendering his sentence procedurally unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hildreth, </em>485 F.3d 1120, 1127 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cTo impose a procedurally reasonable sentence, a district court must calculate the proper advisory Guidelines range.... \u201d (quotation omitted)). Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-17\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b786-18\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b786-19\">All the record facts and evidence relevant to the applicability of \u00a7 3B1.3 are set out in Throne\u2019s plea agreement with the government. The plea agreement provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-20\">Hunter Douglas, Inc. (HDI) and its affiliate, Hunter Douglas Window Fashions, Inc. (HDWFI), [are] in the business of designing, manufacturing, and fabricating window coverings.... HDWFI\u2019s place of business was Broomfield, Colorado.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>The defendant Jason Timothy Throne, a lawyer, joined HDI as an intellectual property counsel in 1993. He was promoted to intellectual property general counsel in 2001 and remained in that position until his HDI employment was terminated in June 2014. Until 2015, Throne was licensed to practice law in New Hampshire and registered to practice in patent cases before the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">Throne\u2019s duties during the relevant times included managing and overseeing patents and trademarks for HDI and HDWFI; managing outside patent attorneys and outside inventors; evaluating and licensing inventors\u2019 technologies; the day-to-day management of patent and trademark litigation; advising senior management on patent and trademark issues; formulating, negotiating, and implementing licensing strategies; tracking the development of new products and processes within HDI\u2019s North American companies; establishing patent and trademark strategies for HDI; keeping inventors abreast of new technologies and inventions in the window coverings industry; advising in-house tax counsel on patent and trademark issues; and \u201cbrainstorming\u201d with inventors and other company employees to assess the possibility of patenting new inventions, to enhance inventions, and to respond to competitive threats. In addition, Throne is listed as an inventor in forty-two of HDI\u2019s United States patents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-6\">In September 2007, HDI provided Throne with a written policy statement that said full-time employees, such as him, could not have outside employment without approval. Throne ... acknowledged that he understood that policy and signed an HDI form on which he checked a box next to the words, \u201cNo; I do not have a 2nd Job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">Throne resided in Colorado from the time he joined HDI until July 2004, when he moved to Maine. Beginning in 1995, while he lived in Colorado, and continuing until his employment ended, Throne worked primarily from his home.... His supervisors approved that arrangement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAfn7\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-8\">On December 29, 1999, Throne arranged for Patent Services Group, Inc. (PSG) to be incorporated in Colorado. At about the same time, he opened post office box 2019 in Boulder, Colorado, stating , on a Postal Service application that the box would be used by PSG. In early 2000, Throne opened an account in the name of PSG at Vectra Bank in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-9\">Beginning in early 2000 and continuing to April 2014, Throne prepared 162 false PSG invoices, each addressed, \u201cJason T. Throne Hunter Douglas Inc.,\u201d and each showing the Boulder post office box as PSG\u2019s address. Throne stated on each invoice that PSG had performed patent searches for Hunter Douglas and that Hunter Douglas owed money to PSG for those services. After writing \u201cOK to pay\u201d and his initials on each of the invoices, Throne submitted them on a monthly basis to the accounting department at the HDWFI office in Colorado.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-10\">Relying on Throne\u2019s approvals, the accounting department paid the invoices by mailing HDWFI checks to the Boulder post office box between April 18, 2000, and April 25, 2014.... The total amount of the checks was $4,841,146.09.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-11\">After retrieving the checks from the post office, Throne deposited them into the PSG account at Vectra Bank. He then caused the money to be moved from that account to personal bank ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>counts and used it for ... personal expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-4\">Other than submitting the invoices to the HDWFI accounting department, Throne never mentioned PSG to anyone at HDI or HDWFI. Neither his supervisors nor any other Hunter Douglas employee was aware of any services provided by PSG. Physical searches of Hunter Douglas\u2019s files produced no memoranda, reports, summaries, analyses, or other materials documenting patent searches or any other services provided by PSG....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">On November 22, 2013, HDWFI\u2019s accounting department prepared a summary of the year\u2019s legal charges, including the payments to PSG, mad emailed it to two company employees. One of the recipients was N.H., a patent engineer whom Throne ... supervised ... and who had assisted him in investigating patents and evaluating the enforceability of the company\u2019s intellectual property.... N.H. sent an email to the accounting department and to Throne, saying, \u201cI have NO idea what all of the \u2018Patent services group\u2019 astronomical charges are.\u201d She asked Throne, \u201cJason, do you know what those are? I have never heard of that.\u201d Throne immediately contacted N.H. by telephone and told her that PSG was a patent search service and the payments had been approved. Later that day, Throne sent an email to N.H. and other HDWFI employees, misrepresenting that PSG \u201cis a patent search service that I use that tracks a number of different developments throughout the organization.\u201d He claimed that he used PSG \u201cto conduct state of the art searches for different inventors and to conduct validity searches for are [sic] lawsuits, which for this year have been very high.\u201d In that email and in his earlier call to N.H., Throne continued to hide his relationship to PSG.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">On June 3, 2014, two Hunter Douglas supervisors ..., having determined there was a connection between Throne and PSG, confronted him about it. Throne responded by misrepresenting that his wife, as the owner of PSG, performed patent searches under his guidance....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">The government\u2019s position is that the patent searches described in the PSG invoices were not. conducted and that Throne knew they were not conducted. The defendant\u2019s position is that he conducted the searches....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">The defendant agrees that, assuming he did the patent searches described in the PSG invoices, he nevertheless defrauded HDI and HDWFI out of $4,841,146.09 because arranging for such searches was his responsibility as a paid HDI employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">R. Vol. I at 17-22 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">A United States Probation Officer prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) that recommended a two-level enhancement to Throne\u2019s offense level because Throne\u2019s position of private trust significantly facilitated the commission and/or concealment of his mail fraud offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. The PSR\u2019s recommendation was based exclusively on the stipulated facts set out in the plea agreement entered into by Throne and the United States. Both the government and Throne objected to the proposed \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement, asserting Throne\u2019s position as an attorney was not a significant factor allowing him to carry out the fraud. At the sentencing hearing, both the prosecutor and defense counsel repeated their previously lodged objections to the \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>The district court overruled the objections, concluding the enhancement was appropriate. In so doing, the district court specifically recognized the substantial managerial discretion placed in Throne as Hunter Douglas\u2019s intellectual property general counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ag8-dedup-0\">Essentially, I agree with the probation officer. The stipulated facts here are that his duties included managing and overseeing patent and trademarks for [Hunter Douglas and a subsidiary]. He managed the outside patent attorneys, the outside inventors, the day-to-day management of patents and trademark litigation, tracking and development of new products, et cetera.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The district court also found that Throne utilized that managerial discretion to facilitate the embezzlement: \u201cHe had authority to both approve and submit invoices for patent searches, which were then paid by the firm\u2019s accounting department without any further scrutiny. And it appears to me that if he weren\u2019t in this position of trust as their patent attorney, this couldn\u2019t have gone on for 15 years.\u201d The district court calculated the total offense level to be twenty-five and the criminal history category to be I, which yielded an advisory guideline range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months as to the mail fraud conviction. The court sentenced Throne to seventy-one months\u2019 imprisonment on the mail fraud count and thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment on the tax count and ordered the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"a0u-dedup-0\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AT3\">Whether a defendant occupied a position of trust under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 is \u201cgenerally a factual matter\u201d this court reviews for clear error. <em>United States v. </em>Spear, 491 F.3d 1150, 1153 (10th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cNevertheless, this court review[s] a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>to see if the correct standard was applied to the factual findings.\u201d <em>United States v. Arreola, </em>548 F.3d 1340, 1345 (10th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">Section 3B1.3 provides for an enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant abuses a position of private trust \u201cin a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d Thus, for this sentencing enhancement to apply, the record must demonstrate: (1) the defendant occupied a position of trust; and (2) the position of trust was used to facilitate significantly the commission or concealment of the crime. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3; <em>Spear, </em>491 F.3d at 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">1. Position of Private Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">The commentary to \u00a7 3B1.3 makes clear that the defining characteristic of a position of public or private trust is the presence of professional or managerial discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-13\">\u201cPublic or private trust\u201d refers to a position of public or private trust characterized by professional or managerial discretion (i.e., substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference). Persons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily non-discretionary in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, cmt. n.l. \u201cOur cases interpreting the guideline make clear that the term \u2018position of trust\u2019 is a bit of a misnomer. It actually has little to do with <em>trustworthiness </em>and everything to do with <em>authority </em>and <em>discretion.\" Spear, </em>491 F.3d at 1154; <em>see also United States v. Edwards, </em>325 F.3d 1184, 1187 (10th Cir. 2003) (hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ing that the lack of \u201cany ... authority to make substantial discretionary judgments\u201d is key in determining whether the enhancement applies). \u201cThe discretion necessary to qualify for the enhancement exists where the person charged had the authority to make broad case-by-case decisions for the organization.\u201d <em>Spear, </em>491 F.3d at 1155.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The district court did not err in concluding Throne occupied a position of private trust as Hunter Douglas\u2019s intellectual property general counsel. The stipulated facts make clear Throne had authority to make substantial discretionary judgments. His authority included, among other duties, managing and overseeing Hunter Douglas\u2019s patents and trademarks; managing outside patent attorneys and inventors; formulating, negotiating, and implementing licensing strategies; tracking the development of Hunter Douglas products and processes; and \u201cbrainstorming\u201d with inventors and company employees to assess the possibility of patenting new inventions, to enhance inventions, and to respond to competitive threats. Furthermore, given these undisputed facts, along with a further stipulation that Throne could have Hunter Douglas vendors paid via his signature authority, it was reasonable for the district court to infer that Throne had the power to choose necessary vendors and set those vendors\u2019 rates of compensation. In light of these facts, there is simply no doubt Throne occupied a position of private trust. <em>See Arreola, </em>548 F.3d at 1346-47 (holding that an employee with authority to activate new vendors on employer\u2019s procurement system, together with authority to purchase goods and services valued up to $100,000, occupied a position of trust).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">2. Significant Facilitation</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Having determined the district court did not err in concluding Throne occupied a position of private trust, this court moves on to determine if that position was used in a \u201cmanner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. \u201cThat step is satisfied where the person\u2019s duties allow the more effective commission of the crime by \u2018making the detection of the offense or the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the offense more difficult.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spear, </em>491 F.3d at 1155-56 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, cmt. n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">In light of this standard, there is simply no doubt the district court correctly concluded Throne\u2019s position of private trust (i.e., intellectual property general counsel) significantly facilitated his embezzlement of funds from Hunter Douglas. Based on Throne\u2019s management of Hunter Douglas\u2019s intellectual property portfolio, the record strongly supports an inference that Throne could (1) choose vendors for critical goods/services and (2) purchase necessary/desirable patents. From this it is quite easy to infer it would be necessary to do due diligence on acquisitions of intellectual property, including the use of a patent search entity. The record here makes clear Throne could use any such vendor he chose, including a fictitious vendor he created to siphon funds away from Hunter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Douglas. These actions would not have been possible if the position Throne occupied were merely ministerial. <em>See United States v. Chee, </em>514 F.3d 1106, 1118 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201cThe primary concern of \u00a7 3B1.3 is to penalize defendants who take advantage of a position that provides them freedom to commit or conceal a difficult-to-detect wrong.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">For those reasons set out above, the sentence imposed by the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b786-21\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-5\">. Throne asserts the district court erred in analyzing the applicability of \u00a7 3B1.3 to his conduct by focusing on his trustworthiness, rather than on whether his position as intellectual property general counsel was characterized by managerial or professional discretion. Although some isolated statements on the part of the district court at the sentencing hearing refer to Throne being a trusted employee of Hunter Douglas, the transcript of the sentencing hearing, when considered as a whole, leaves no doubt the district court applied the correct legal test in concluding Throne occupied a position of private trust. That is, the district court specifically focused on Throne's exceedingly broad authority and discretion in managing all aspects of Hunter Douglas\u2019s intellectual property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
