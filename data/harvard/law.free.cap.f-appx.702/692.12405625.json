We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 3145(c), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"ad_-dedup-0\">1\u20141</p>\n<p id=\"AoVD\">On March 3, 2017, police stopped Mr. Voog for a traffic violation in Washington City, Utah, He gave the police a false name and date of birth. Officers searched the vehicle and found Mr. Voog\u2019s identification, a firearm, and drug-related items. He was subsequently charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and three counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>unlawful possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">A magistrate judge held a detention hearing, and then ordered Mr. Voog detained pending trial. Mr. Voog filed a motion to have the district court judge review the detention order. The district court held another hearing, and then determined on de novo review that Mr. Voog should be detained pending trial. Mr. Voog now appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Under the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be detained pending trial if a judicial officer finds that \u201cthat no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e). In making this determination, the court must consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">(1) [T]he nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense .,. involves ... a controlled substance [or] firearm ... (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history of the characteristics of the person, including\u2014(A) the person\u2019s character, physical and mental condition, family ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, and record concerning appearance at court proceedings; and (B) whether at the time of the current offense or arrest, the person was on probation, on parole, or on other release pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under Federal, State, or local law; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the person\u2019s release....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-12\"><em>Id, </em>\u00a7 3142(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">The district court considered the evidence and the relevant factors. The court found that the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged weighed in favor of detention because the charged offenses are \u201cserious offenses involving firearms and controlled substances.\u201d Aplee. Supp. App. at 21. The court also found the second factor weighed in favor of detention. The court noted that the indictment provides probable cause that Mr. Voog committed the offenses, and further noted that the \u201cevidence, while circumstantial, appears strong.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">Next, the court considered the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics. The court observed that \u201cMr. Voog is a 34 year old man with a significant criminal history,\u201d noting that \u201chis prior history is similar to that charged in the instant case, namely the illegal possession of weapons and narcotics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court further observed that Mr. Voog is unemployed, homeless, and has a long history of substance abuse. Finally, the court found that Mr. Voog has a history of non-appearance and non-compliance, noting \u201carrests for contempt of court, obstruction of justice, providing false information, and giving false personal identity to an officer.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 22. The court determined that \u201c[t]hese charges call into question [Mr. Voog\u2019s] credibility, including whether [he] would comply with release conditions\u201d and concluded that all of the above considerations weighed in favor of detention. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">As for the final factor\u2014the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the defendant\u2019s release\u2014the district court-found that \u201c[f]or many of the same reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>set forth above, this factor weighs in favor of detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given all of these considerations, the court found that Mr. Voog \u201cposes a risk of flight and detention is required to assure the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">We review de novo mixed questions of law and fact concerning the detention decision. <em>United States v. Cisneros, </em>328 F.3d 610, 613 (10th Cir. 2003). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On appeal, Mr. Voog does not assert a specific procedural, factual, or legal error in the district court\u2019s disposition. Instead, he goes through the factors and offers his own analysis of how the evidence should be weighed. Efe concedes that the nature and circumstances of his offenses \u201cwill generally weigh ... in favor of detention.\u201d Aplt. Memo. Br. at 1. For the second factor, he argues that the evidence against him is circumstantial. For the third factor, he admits that he has a history of methamphetamine addiction, he is unemployed, and he is homeless, but he asserts without citing any record support that \u201che does have the ability to obtain both employment and safe housing immediately upon being released.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Finally, with resp\u00e9ct to whether he is a danger to the community, he argues that he \u201chas no history of violence and his entire drug history is that of addiction. When he is not partaking of methamphetamine he is a functioning member of society.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Mr. Voog\u2019s current charges involve both drugs and firearms, and he has a long criminal history of being convicted for offenses involving drugs and firearms. He is addicted to methamphetamine, admitting that he was using the drug daily at the time of his arrest. \u201cThe concern about safety [of the community] is to be given a broader construction than the mere danger of physical violence. Safety of the community refers to the danger that the defendant might engage in criminal activity to the detriment of the community.\u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>880 F.2d 1158, 1161 (10th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Mr. Voog\u2019s penchant for combining firearms and drugs demonstrates that he is a danger to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Our de novo review of the record reveals no error in the district court\u2019s consideration of the statutory factors or the weight it accorded the factors. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order detaining Mr. Voog pending trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ARCx\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal, <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App, P, 32,1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
