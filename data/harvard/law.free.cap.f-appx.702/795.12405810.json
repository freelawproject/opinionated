Baldock, United States Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b815-23\" pgmap=\"815(12) 816(121)\">Petitioner John Patrick Fletcher, a Colorado state prisoner appearing pro se, seeks a certif\u00edcate of appealability (OOA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). In a written order, the district court denied .the motion as time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Because Petitioner has not shown \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling,\u201d we summarily deny Petitioner a COA and dismiss his .appeal. Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p> <p id=\"b816-4\" pgmap=\"816\">We need not detail Petitioner\u2019s arguments challenging application of \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s one-year limitation period to his petition. Suffice to say we have carefully reviewed his \u201cCombined Opening Brief and Application for a Certificate of Appeal-ability,\u201d the record on appeal, and the district court\u2019s written order denying his petition as time-barred. Based on our review, we conclude the district court accurately analyzed the statute of limitations issue and properly dismissed the petition. Where -the district court accurately analyzes an issue and articulates a cogent rationale, we see no useful purpose in writing at length. Thus, we reject Petitioner\u2019s 'argument that his petition for a writ of habeas corpus is timely substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s written order which ably explains why Petitioner is not entitled to- a COA. '</p> <p id=\"b816-6\" pgmap=\"816\">COA DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED. Motion for IFP DENIED as moot</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b815-25\" pgmap=\"815\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
