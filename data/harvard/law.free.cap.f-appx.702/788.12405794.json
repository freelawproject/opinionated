In a separate appeal, they also challenge the court\u2019s award of costs to some of the defendants. We dismiss the appeal of the grant of summary judgment as untimely. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 over the remainder of the appeal, we affirm the denial of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration and the award of costs,</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">In August 2014, Plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma raising various claims against government officials arising out of their arrest and booking on charges of obstructing an officer, speeding, and failing to possess a valid driver\u2019s license. The district court granted summary judgment for the government defendants and entered judgment against Plaintiffs on March 31, 2016. Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary-judgment ruling on May 2, 2016, which the court denied on May 12, 2016. They filed a notice of appeal challenging both rulings on May 26, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">After entry of judgment the district-court clerk awarded costs for printing and copying to some of the defendants in the amount of $52.11. Plaintiffs challenged this award but the district court denied relief on August 4, 2016. Plaintiffs then filed another notice of appeal\u2014this one relating solely to the issue of costs\u2014on August 24, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">We dismiss as untimely Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the grant of summary judgment. <em>See Lebahn v. Owens, </em>813 F.3d 1300, 1304 (10th Cir. 2016) (\u201cThis court has jurisdiction only to review district court judgments from which a timely notice of appeal has been filed.\u201d). Although a notice of appeal ordinarily must be filed \u201cwithin 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from,\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), \u201ca motion under [Fed. R. Civ. P.] 59 or .., 60 may toll a party\u2019s time to file a notice of appeal,\u201d <em>Lebahn, </em>813 F.3d at 1304. But only if the motion is filed within 28 days of the judgment. <em>See id.; </em>Fed. R. App. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>4(a)(4)(A). Here, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration was not filed until May 2, 2016, more than 28 days after the entry of judgment on March 81, 2016. They argue that they mailed their motion and that the date of mailing should constitute the date of filing. But the date of mailing is considered the filing date only for prisoners, <em>see </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(c)(1), and Plaintiffs have not shown that they were prisoners at the time. In any event, the record reflects that they mailed their motion on April 29, 2016\u2014still too late. Thus, the time to appeal the summary judgment was not tolled and their jVlay 26 notice of appeal is too late to challenge it.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">On the other hand, Plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal, is tipiely with respect to the May 12 denial of their motion for reconsideration. <em>See Lebahn, </em>813 F.3d at 1305 (\u201cThe district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion is separately appealable from the district court\u2019s underlying judgment.\u201d). But their appellate briefs, even construed liberally, <em>see Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005), do not challenge this ruling. We therefore affirm the denial. <em>See Coleman v. B-G Maint. Mgmt. of Colo., Inc., </em>108 F.3d 1199, 1205 (10th Cir. 1997) (\u201cIssues not raised in the opening brief are deemed abandoned or waived.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">That leaves only Plaintiffs\u2019 timely appeal of the award of $52.11 in costs. Plaintiffs contend that the district court erroneously awarded costs for copying expenses relating to depositions that were not taken. Plaintiffs are correct on the law\u2014such costs should not be awarded. But they are wrong on the facts. Despite the district court\u2019s statement in its order approving costs that costs relating to depositions were awarded, the record clearly shows that the $52.11 award was based on other costs. Although the district court misspoke in its order, the award was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We DISMISS the appeal of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, AFFIRM the court\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration, and AFFIRM the award of costs. Plaintiffs\u2019 request for their own costs is DENIED. Plaintiffs\u2019 request to strike any opposing briefs is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-13\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of these appeals. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cases are therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
