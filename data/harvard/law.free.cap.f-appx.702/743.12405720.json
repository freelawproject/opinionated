Lucero Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b764-23\">Andres Garcia-Damian appeals his 46-month sentence for illegal reentry. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b764-25\">Garcia-Damian is a Mexican citizen. On March 25, 2015, he pled guilty to one count of illegal reentry after removal in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Prior to his removal, Garcia-Damian lived in Texas for approximately eleven years. In August 2012, he pled guilty to a domestic violence assault charge involving his wife, for which he received a 45-day sentence. And in November 2013, he pled guilty to one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Indecency With a Child\u2014Sexual Contact, which is a second degree felony in Texas. He received a deferred sentence of six years\u2019 probation. This conviction stemmed from approximately eight instances of Garcia-Damian asking his eight-year-old stepdaughter to sit on his lap and rubbing her private area with his hand over her clothes. As a result of this conviction, Garcia-Damian was removed to Mexico in June 2014. Four months later he was apprehended in New Mexico, leading to the current illegal reentry charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Applying the 2014 version of the Sentencing Guidelines, a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated Garcia-Damian\u2019s total offense level at 21, with a criminal history category of III, for an advisory Guidelines range of 46-57 months\u2019 imprisonment. The total offense level was calculated using a base offense level of eight, a sixteen-level enhancement for re-' moval following a felony conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2014), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Garcia-Damian\u2019s criminal history category was based on his prior assault and indecency charges, and the fact that he committed the illegal reentry offense while on probation. See \u00a7 4Al.l(c), (d) (2014). The PSR recommended a within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Garcia-Damian moved for a downward variance on the grounds that his wife and stepdaughter, who were the victims of his prior crimes, supported him. He also filed an objection to the PSR\u2019s sixteen-level enhancement, arguing that it should not apply because his indecency offense did not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the applicable Guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">At sentencing, the district court denied Garcia-Damian\u2019s requested variance after considering the motion, counsels\u2019 statements at the hearing, and two letters of support -written by his wife and stepdaughter. The court concluded that it was \u201cnot inclined to grant a variance based on that motion or any other basis that you might have in mind.\u201d However, it continued the hearing to allow further briefing on the PSR objection. At the continued hearing, the district court heard oral argument from both parties and an allocution statement from Garcia-Damian. It then overruled Garcia-Damian\u2019s objection to the PSR and imposed a 46-month sentence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-11\">I\u2019m finding that the [indecency] conviction in the defendant\u2019s [PSR], .,. and the 16-level enhancement ... are appropriate and applicable in this particular case as a crime of violence, so the objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-12\">I reviewed the entirety of the [PSR] as well as the factual findings, all of ... Mr. Garcia\u2019s criminal history, I\u2019ve considered the sent\u00e9ncing guideline applications and the factors in 18 United States Code Section 3553(a)(1) through (7).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-13\">The offense level is 21, the criminal history category is III, the range is 46 to 57 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-14\">I note that the defendant, Mr. Garcia, reentered the United States unlawfully after he had been deported, and that was after being convicted of a felony crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">Garcia-Damian now appeals both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">On appeal, Garcia-Damian asserts a series of procedural reasonableness challenges that he did not raise before the district court. Accordingly, we review for plain error and will reverse only if there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) which affects substantial rights, and (4) which seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d United States v. Romero, 491 F.3d 1173, 1176-78 (10th Cir. 2007). A district court commits procedural error by \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Garcia-Damian argues that the district court failed to adequately explain its sentence and its rejection of his motion for a downward variance. When imposing a within-Guidelines sentence, a court must state \u201cthe reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d \u00a7 3553(c). However, our circuit has repeatedly stated that \u00a7 3553(c) requires only that a district court provide \u201ca general statement noting the appropriate guideline range and how it was calculated.\u201d United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, 477 F.3d 1196, 1202 (10th Cir. 2007) (quotations omitted). \u201c[Tjhis general statement need involve no ritualistic incantation to establish consideration of a legal issue, nor do we demand that the district court recite any magic words to prove that it considered the various [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors ....\u201d Id. (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In Ruiz-Terrazas, we reviewed the rejection of a downward variance motion and a sentencing explanation that is almosj; identical to that provided by the district court below. We concluded \u201cthe district court committed no error at all.\u201d Id. at 1199. Thus, although we agree that \u201ca more detailed sentencing explanation can often prove beneficial, even if it is not mandatory,\u201d id. at 1202, in light of the substantially similar explanation deemed sufficient in Ruiz-Terrazas, we cannot say that any error the district court might have committed in this case was plain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Garcia-Damian also argues that the district court erroneously presumed the applicable Guidelines range was reasonable. Unlike appellate courts, district courts \u201cdo[ ] not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply.\u201d Rita v United States, 551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). However, Garcia-Damian has failed to show that the district court com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>mitted such an error. The court never expressly applied such a presumption, and Garcia-Damian has not identified a case in which this court found reversible error without an express application. See, e.g., United States v. Conlan, 500 F.3d 1167, 1168-69 (10th Cir. 2007) (district court noted \u201cthe presumption of reasonableness of the guidelines\u201d at sentencing). \u201c[A]bsent some indication in the record suggesting otherwise,\u201d we presume that sentencing courts \u201cknow the law and apply it in making their decisions.\u201d Ruiz-Terrazas, 477 F.3d at 1201 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Finally, Garcia-Damian asserts that the district court committed error by failing to apply \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l) of the Guidelines, which allows for a downward departure if the defendant\u2019s \u201ccriminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history\u201d or likelihood of recidivism. However, Garcia-Damian did not move for a downward departure on this basis, and he provides no case law to support the proposition that a district court commits procedural error by failing to grant an unrequested discretionary departure. Accordingly, we discern no plain error. See United States v. Sierra-Castillo, 405 F.3d 932, 938 (10th Cir. 2005) (\u201cThe defendant has the burden of proving entitlement to a downward departure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">We next review the substantive reasonableness of Garcia-Damian\u2019s sentence. \u201c[Substantive reasonableness addresses whether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d United States v. Huckins, 529 F.3d 1312, 1317 (10th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted). We review the substantive reasonableness of \u201call sentences\u2014 whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d Gall, 552 U.S. at 41, 128 S.Ct. 586. A within-Guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable. United States v. Gambino-Zavala, 539 F.3d 1221, 1232 (10th Cir. 2008). We will \u201cdeem a sentence unreasonable only if it is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly unreasonable,\u201d United States v. Gantt, 679 F.3d 1240, 1249 (10th Cir. 2012) (quotation omitted), and \u201cwe will reverse a determination only if the court exceeded the bounds of permissible choice, given the facts and the applicable law in the case at hand,\u201d McComb, 519 F.3d at 1053 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Garcia-Damian\u2019s substantive reasonableness challenge is two-fold: he contends that the district court failed to accord proper weight to mitigating \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that subsequent amendments to the Guidelines demonstrate the unreasonable severity of his sentence. Regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Garcia-Damian argues that a below-Guidelines sentence was warranted due to his minimal criminal history, significant ties to the United States, family support, and cultural assimilation, and because the facts of his prior convictions are \u201cnot as serious\u201d as other violent offenses. But under our deferential standard of reasonableness review, mere disagreement with the manner in which the district court weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not enough to reverse a sentence. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cInstead, we must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the [sentence].\u201d United States v. Smart, 518 F.3d 800, 808 (10th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted). We do not perceive any abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s weighing of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">We are sympathetic to Garcia-Damian\u2019s argument .that his sentence is unduly' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>harsh, as demonstrated by subsequent Guideline amendments lowering his appli- \u2022 . cable range to 10-16 months. However, he does not assert that these amendments have been made retroactive by the Sentencing Commission or offer any other argument that would permit us to find substantive unreasonableness based solely on non-retroactive amendments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our circuit has cast doubt on the notion that such amendments warrant resentencing. See Vasquez-Alcarez, 647 F.3d at 979 (rejecting argument that a proposed\u2014but not yet adopted\u2014amendment can be used to find substantive unreasonableness, and noting that, even if adopted, the amendment \u201cwould not apply retroactively unless the Commission says it does\u201d)\u2019. At least one unpublished opinion has explicitly rejected defendant\u2019s argument. United States v. Rodriguez-Garcia, 459 Fed.Appx. 754, 757-58 (10th Cir. 2012) (unpublished) (concluding it is \u201cbeyond our authority\u201d to remand based on non-retroactive Guideline amendment, and observing that the court would decline to do so even if permissible because such remand would interfere with the \u201cSentencing Commission\u2019s prerogative\u201d of determining retroactivity (quotation omitted)). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that Garcia-Damian\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable due to the Guideline amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b764-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R, App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir, R. 32.1,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\">. Garcia-Damian\u2019s original counsel failed to file an appeal. In a subsequent 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the district court determined that counsel was ineffective for failing to consult with Garcia-Damian about his desire to appeal, Consequently, final judgment was vacated and re-entered to permit the timely filing of this direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\">. None of the cases Garcia-Damian references affect this conclusion. First, United States v. Brown, 654 Fed.Appx. 896 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished), involved an outside-Guidelines sentence and is thus inapposite. See United States v. Fraser, 647 F.3d 1242, 1246 (10th Cir. 2011) (noting sentencing court\u2019s explanatory obligation differs for outside-Guidelines sentences). Second, because we concluded that the sentencing explanation in United States v. McComb, 519 F.3d 1049 (10th Cir. 2007), \"met[] and exceeded\u201d the legal requirement, id. at 1055, that case does not purport to set the floor for a legally sufficient sentencing explanation, id. at 1056 (\u201c[W]e have upheld sentences that have done far less to address a defendant's request for a different sentence.\u201d). Finally, in United States v. Sanchez-Juarez, 446 F.3d 1109 (10th Cir. 2006), we remanded because the district court did not mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the record provided \"no indication\u201d that it had considered them. Id. at 1116. In contrast, the district court in this case entertained Garcia-Damian\u2019s variance motion and oral argument from both parties about the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it stated that it had considered the factors before imposing a final sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b768-8\">. In a \"sharply criticized.\u201d opinion, United States v. Vasquez-Alcarez, 647 F,3d 973, 980 (10th Cir. 2011), the First Circuit has suggested resentencing may be appropriate in this situation. See United States v. Godin, 522 F.3d 133, 136 (1st Cir. 2008). Because Garcia-Damian does not cite Godin or argue for adoption of its analysis, we offer no views as to the validity of its approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
