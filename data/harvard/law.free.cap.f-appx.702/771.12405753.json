Lucero, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b791-28\">Torrey Banks appeals a district court order dismissing his claims. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Banks sued the Colorado Governor and various other state and federal officials, alleging they violated his rights under Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-60-501, which is the Colorado statute adopting the interstate agreement on detainers. The district court identified several defects in Banks\u2019 complaint, explained those deficiencies in detail, and ordered him to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Banks\u2019 amended complaint raised three claims: malicious prosecution, obstruction of justice, and violation of due process. The district court concluded that Banks\u2019 first two claims were frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and his third claim failed to meet the pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. It dismissed Banks\u2019 claims<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and entered judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Even under the liberal standard we apply to pro se pleadings, Banks\u2019 brief is inadequate to preserve any issues for review. We construe his brief liberally and hold it to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by lawyers. See Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux <em>&amp; </em>Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005). And we ignore technical defects if \u201cwe can reasonably read the pleadings to state a valid claim on which [he] could prevail.\u201d Diversey v. Schmidly, 738 F.3d 1196, 1199 (10th Cir. 2013) (quotation omitted). But we cannot serve as Banks\u2019 attorney by \u201cconstructing arguments and searching the record.\u201d Garrett, 425 F.3d at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Banks\u2019 brief contains no real argument that the district court erred by dismissing his claims, Instead, Banks merely reiterates the allegations in his amended complaint. By failing to meaningfully contest the district court\u2019s rulings, Banks has waived any argument that it erred. See Harsco Corp. v. Renn\u00e9r, 475 F.3d 1179, 1190 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[A] party waives those arguments that its opening brief inadequately addresses.\u201d); Garrett, 425 F.3d at 841 (holding that pro se plaintiffs inadequate \u201cbriefs disentitle him to review by this court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">AFFIRMED. Because Banks has not advanced \u201ca reasoned, nonfrivolous argument\u201d that the district court erred, DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, 937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir. 1991), we DENY his motion to proceed without prepayment of costs and fees. Banks must immediately pay the filing fee to the Clerk of the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-17\"> After examining Banks\u2019 brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32,1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-26\">. It dismissed Banks\u2019 first two claims with prejudice and his third claim without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
