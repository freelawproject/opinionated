Matheson, Jr. Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b805-25\">State prisoner Reco Sells was convicted of Lewd or Indecent Proposal to a Child and of Facilitating Sexual Conduct with a Minor by Use of a Computer. The district court denied his application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 challenging his convictions. He seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) from this court to appeal that ruling. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we deny a COA and dismiss this matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The district court\u2019s Opinion and Order details the facts leading to Mr. Sells\u2019s prosecution and outlines the procedural history of this case, including the direct appeal and post-conviction proceedings in the state courts. We will repeat that information only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">I. COA AND AEDPA REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">A prisoner needs a COA to appeal from a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas application. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When a state court has decided the applicant\u2019s claim on the merits, we \u201clook to the District Court\u2019s application of [the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u2018AEDPA\u2019) ] to [the applicant\u2019s] constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable among jurists of reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">AEDPA provides that federal courts cannot grant habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">When, -as here, the district court dismissed some of the claims on procedural grounds, we will grant a COA as to those claims only if the applicant can demonstrate both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">II. ANTICIPATORY PROCEDURAL BAR AND PROCEDURAL DEFAULT</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Mr. Sells listed eight grounds for relief in his \u00a7 2254 application. The first ground claimed that his convictions for three of the counts violated double jeopardy, but Mr. Sells did not present this argument to the state courts as to one of the counts. He also did not present his second ground\u2014 claiming he was improperly convicted under general rather than specific statutory provisions\u2014to the state courts. The district court denied relief on these claims based on anticipatory procedural bar. An anticipatory procedural bar occurs when \u201cthe court to which the petitioner would be required to present his claims in order to [satisfy] the exhaustion requirement would now find the claims procedurally barred.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 735 n.1, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). Mr. Sells has not shown, and we cannot discern, how reasonable jurists would debate the district court\u2019s ruling on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">The district court also denied relief on three other grounds<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because (1) they were not presented to the Oklahoma Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) on direct appeal, (2) the OCCA affirmed the state district court\u2019s denial of post-conviction relief because these grounds were procedurally barred under an independent and adequate state ground, ROA Vol. I, Doc. 7-5, and (3) Mr. Sells could not show cause and prejudice for the procedural default or a miscarriage of justice based on factual innocence. <em>See Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 750, 753, 111 S.Ct. 2546. We have carefully reviewed the state court rulings on these issues and considered Mr. Sells\u2019s arguments, and we cannot say that reasonable jurists would debate the district court\u2019s decision on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">III. AEDPA REVIEW OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The district court determined that the OCCA had addressed four of Mr. Sells\u2019s claims on the merits and, applying AED-PA review, concluded that the OCCA\u2019s rejection of those claims was not contrary to or an unreasonable, application of clearly established Supreme Court law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">\n<em>A.Double Jeopardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">On direct appeal, Mr. Sells argued that his convictions under Counts 2 and 3 for Lewd or Indecent Proposal to a Child violated the Double Jeopardy Clause\u2019s protection \u201cagainst multiple punishments for the same offense imposed in a single proceeding.\u201d <em>Jones v. Thomas, </em>491 U.S. 376, 381, 109 S.Ct. 2522, 105 L.Ed.2d 322 (1989) (quotations omitted); <em>see </em>U.S. Const, amend. V. The OCCA rejected this claim because \u201c[t]he evidence shows the commission of two separate crimes on separate days.\u201d ROA Vol. I, Doc. 7-3 at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">As the district court' pointed out, the charged conduct and jury instructions were different for each count, and Mr. Sells failed to show the OCCA\u2019s decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court law. Moreover, the OCCA determined that Mr. Sells committed two crimes under state law. Reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s conclusion that the OCCA\u2019s ruling on this issue was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">\n<em>B.Sufftciency of the Evidence on Entrapment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">The OCCA rejected Mr. Sells\u2019s contention that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not entrapped. The OCCA reviewed the evidence and determined a rational trier of fact could have found lack of entrapment beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court, applying AEDPA deference, found the OCCA\u2019s affirmance was reasonable. Having reviewed the relevant materials, we conclude reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">\n<em>C.Jury Instructions (Two Grounds)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">Mr. Sells made two other claims: (1) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on \u201csentence entrapment,\u201d and (2) Instruction No. 26 was fundamentally unfair and violated due process because it was confusing and reversed the burden of proof. On direct appeal, the OCCA disagreed, holding the evidence did not entitle Mr. Sells to a \u201csentence entrapment\u201d in--<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>struction and that Instruction No. 26 (concerning the involvement of law enforcement in detecting an offense) was clear and valid, a holding the district court found reasonable. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion for substantially the same reasons it stated, a conclusion that reasonable jurists would not debate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">We deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"Ara\">ENTERED FOR THE COURT,</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b805-26\">This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-9\">. Mr. Sells is proceeding pro se. Although we liberally construe a pro se litigant\u2019s filings, <em>see Erickson </em>v. <em>Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007), we may not \"assume the role of advocate,\u201d <em>Yang v. Archuleta, </em>525 F.3d 925, 927 n.1 (10th Cir. 2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-14\">. These grounds claimed violations of the fair trial right, the hearsay rule, and the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">. The district court rejected as an improper ground for federal habeas relief Mr, Sells's challenges to his convictions based on alleged error in the application of state law. <em>See </em>District Court Order and Opinion at 8-9; ROA Vol. I, Doc. 15, The district court\u2019s treatment of these challenges is not reasonably debatable. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (holding federal habeas relief is not available to correct errors of state law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-21\">. In his brief to this court, Mr. Sells contends his counsel was ineffective because he did not obtain evidence that would have been relevant to the case. Aplt. Br. at 2-3, 2-4. We do not consider this argument because it was absent from his \u00a7 2254 application. <em>See </em>ROA Vol. I, Doc. 1; <em>Gonzales v. Tapia, </em>383 Fed.Appx. 774, 776 (10th Cir. 2010) (unpublished) (declining to consider a claim of excessive bail raised, for the first time in a COA application because \"it was not raised in federal district court\u201d) (cited for persuasive value under 10th Cir. R. 32.1(A)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
