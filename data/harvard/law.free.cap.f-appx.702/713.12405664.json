Moritz, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Oklahoma prisoner Arley Duncan seeks a certificate of appeal-ability (COA) to appeal the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas application. The district court dismissed his application as untimely and declined to issue a COA. Because reasonable jurists would not debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling, <em>see Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), we deny Duncan\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) imposes upon \u201ca[ny] person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a [sjtate court\u201d a one-year limitations period for filing an application for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). That period begins to run from one of four statutory accrual dates. \u00a7 2244(d)(l)(A)-(D). For state prisoners whose convictions became final before AEDPA\u2019s enactment, the one-year period ran from April 24, 1996, to April 24, 1997. <em>See Serrano v. Williams, </em>383 F.3d 1181, 1183 (10th Cir. 2004). But the one-year period is statutorily tolled for \u201c[tjhe time during which a properly filed application for [sjtate post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(2). And, in some cases, an applicant may be able to demonstrate grounds for equitable tolling of the one-year period. <em>See Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (explaining that habeas applicant is \u201c \u2018entitled to equitable tolling\u2019 only if he shows \u2018(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\u2019 and prevented timely filing\u201d (quoting <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005))).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">In 1983, Duncan pled guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for a life sentence. More than 30 years later\u2014in 2015\u2014 Duncan filed this \u00a7 2241 habeas application. He asserts that he is entitled to federal habeas relief because (1) the prosecutor breached the plea agreement; (2) the state enacted new laws after he entered the plea agreement and its retroactive application of those laws deprived him of his liberty interest in parole created under the agreement, in violation of his due process rights; (3) he wasn\u2019t fully informed of the facts before he entered his plea, thus rendering his plea void as unknowing and involuntary; and (4) his plea is invalid because he received ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>The respondent moved to dismiss Duncan\u2019s petition as untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court extensively catalogued Duncan\u2019s efforts, between 1995, and 2015, to obtain relief from his conviction and sentence through various state and federal post-conviction proceedings. Based on this review, the court concluded that the application was untimely and that Duncan failed to demonstrate any circumstances excusing its untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">First, the court pointed out that Duncan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was filed well beyond AEDPA\u2019s one-year deadline of April 24, 1997. Next, the court reasoned that Duncan wasn\u2019t entitled to statutory tolling under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) because his first state post-conviction proceedings concluded pri- or to that deadline and he initiated his second and third state post-conviction proceedings after that deadline expired. <em>See May v. Workman, </em>339 F.3d 1236, 1237 (10th Cir. 2003) (noting that AEDPA\u2019s one-year period \u201cis tolled or suspended during the pendency of a state application for post-conviction relief properly filed <em>during </em>the limitations period\u201d (emphasis added)). The court then reasoned that Duncan didn\u2019t demonstrate that the one-year period began to run later than April 24, 1996, under any alternative statutory accrual date. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) (running period from date on which state impediment to filing habeas application is removed if such impediment prevented applicant from filing application); \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) (running period from date on which Supreme Court recognizes new constitutional right if Supreme Court makes newly-recognized right \u201cretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review\u201d); \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) (running period from \u201cdate on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence\u201d). Finally, the court noted that Duncan didn\u2019t allege that he was entitled to equitable tolling. <em>See Holland, </em>560 U.S. at 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549 (explaining circumstances applicant must demonstrate to support equitable tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">To obtain a COA, Duncan must \u201cma[ke] a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Because the district court dismissed Duncan\u2019s habeas application on procedural grounds, Duncan must make this showing by demonstrating both (1) that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the [application] states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d and (2) that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Duncan appears to identify two aspects of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling as subject to reasonable debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">First, Duncan argues that the district court erred in determining that he could have discovered the factual predicate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>his prosecutorial-breach-of-plea-agreement claim by 2005. But, as the district court noted, Duncan expressly asserted in his habeas application that the letters Duncan cites to support his claim \u201cwere discovered (approx. 2005)\u201d by his family. R. vol. 1, 27. In arguing that the district court nevertheless erred in relying on that assertion, Duncan has revised his timeline. He now asserts that his family discovered, and that he knew about, the same letters in 2007. And he further asserts that he presented his prosecutorial-breach-of-plea-agreement claim to the state courts in 2010 through a post-conviction proceeding and that that claim was \u201ctaken to exhaustion\u201d when the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) denied his appeal from that post-conviction proceeding, Aplt. Br. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Though Duncan doesn\u2019t refer to AED-PA\u2019s statutory accrual provisions in his brief, it appears he seeks to start his AEDPA one-year clock as of the \u201cdate on which the factual predicate of [his] claim could have been discovered.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). But even under Duncan\u2019s revised timeline, reasonable jurists wouldn\u2019t debate the district court\u2019s determination that Duncan\u2019s prosecutorial-breach-of-plea-agreement claim was untimely. Assuming Duncan learned of the factual predicate for that claim in 2007, he would have had to file a habeas application asserting that claim by 2008. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). That one-year period would have been tolled during his timely and proper efforts to exhaust his claim in state court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). By his own account though, Duncan didn\u2019t present that claim to a state court until 2010\u2014two years after \u00a7 2244(d)(l)(D)\u2019s one-year deadline would have expired\u2014when he filed an application for state post-conviction relief, Moreover, Duncan fails to offer any explanation for the additional four-year gap between the OCOA\u2019s 2011 decision affirming the denial of his state post-conviction relief on that claim, and his 2015 filing of the instant \u00a7 2241' application. Thus, under either the timeline as understood by the district court or Duncan\u2019s revised timeline, .reasonable jurists wouldn\u2019t debate the untimeliness of his proseeutorial-breach-of-plea-agreement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Second, Duncan appears to argue that the district court may have erred in concluding that his third and fourth claims\u2014both of which relate to ineffective assistance of counsel\u2014were untimely because he presented those claims in state court before' AEDPA\u2019s enactment. Though Duncan\u2019s argument on this point isn\u2019t clear, we construe it as an argument that AEDPA\u2019s one-year deadline doesn\u2019t apply to these claims. But Duncan is a state prisoner and AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations applies to habeas applications filed by \u201ca person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a [s]tate court.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Because his conviction was final before AED-PA\u2019s enactment, he was entitled to a one-year grace period running from April 24, 1996, to April 24, 1997. <em>See Serrano, </em>883 F.3d at 1183. It appears that Duncan may have exhausted his third and fourth habeas claims sometime in 1995. If so, that means that he had until April 24, 1997, to file a federal habeas application asserting those claims. But he failed to do so. Instead, he filed his first federal habeas application in August 1998, and didn\u2019t assert those claims in that untimely application. Thus, we see no room for reasonable debate regarding the untimeliness of Duncan\u2019s third and fourth claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Because Duncan hasn\u2019t made the requisite showing to obtain a COA, we deny his COA request and dismiss this matter, As a final matter, we deny his motion to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-11\"> This order isn't binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judi-cata, and collateral estoppel. But it may be cited for its persuasive value. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-12\">. Because Duncan is a pro se litigant, we liberally construe his pleadings. <em>Jordan v. Sosa, </em>654 F.3d 1012, 1018 n.8 (10th Cir. 2011). But we don\u2019t \"construct[] arguments\u201d or \u201dsearch[] the record\u201d to find.support for his position. <em>Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">. The respondent also pointed out that some of Duncan's habeas claims are improperly asserted under \u00a7 2241 because they challenge the validity of his conviction, not the execution of his sentence. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 865 (10th Cir. 2000) (explaining that state prisoners may challenge validity of conviction or sentence under \u00a7 2254 and execution of sentence under \u00a7 2241). But AEDPA's one-year deadline applies equally to both types of habeas applications. <em>Burger v. Scott, </em>317 F.3d 1133, 1138 (10th Cir. 2003) (\u00a7 2241 applications); <em>Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 802-03 (10th Cir. 2000) (\u00a7 2254 applications). And as we conclude <em>infra, </em>the district court\u2019s conclusion that that deadline bars Duncan\u2019s habeas claims isn\u2019t reasonably debatable. Thus, we don\u2019t express any opinion regarding whether Duncan properly asserted his habeas claims under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
