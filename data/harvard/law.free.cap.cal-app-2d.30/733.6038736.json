An appeal was then taken to this court from that order. The attorney-general has appeared and moved to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that the order remand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ing petitioner to the hospital after a hearing upon an application for restoration of sanity (see. 1026a, Pen. Code) is not an appealable order, and that the remedy is by a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>With this contention we are in accord. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>97 Cal. App. 321 [275 Pac. 815], the court held that an order directing that defendant be confined in a state hospital is not an appealable order under section 1237 of the Penal Code, and that the remedy under sections 1026 and 1026a of the Penal Code is by a proceeding in <em>habeas corpus. </em>The power to discharge a patient otherwise than upon <em>habeas corpus </em>is vested exclusively in the officers of the hospital. <em>(Kellogg </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>87 Cal. 192 [25 Pac. 677, 12 L. R A. 104].)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">On the authority of those cases the motion to dismiss the appeal is granted. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
