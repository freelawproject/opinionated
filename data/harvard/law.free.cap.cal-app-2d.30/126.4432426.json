This appeal is from the judgment and order denying his motion for a new trial. There is also a purported appeal from the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">Viewing the evidence most favorable to the prosecution <em>[People </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>90 Cal. App. 657, 658 [266 Pac. 558]), the facts in the instant case are:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">May 6, 1938, defendant went to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Fortalesa. He knocked at the front door, which was open, whereupon Mrs. Fortalesa told her husband that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>was at the door. Thereafter defendant shot Mr. Fortalesa, who died as a result of the wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Defendant relies for reversal of the judgment on the following propositions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\n<em>First: The trial court committed prejudicial error in sustaining objections to the following questions:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\n<em>(a) \u201cQ. Do you recall if any time in February or March or April that you and Mary were together and Mary told you that her husband was going to get Clemente?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">\n<em>\u201cA. Yes.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">\n<em>\u201cMR. FERGUSON: That is objected to. Incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, not tending to illustrate &lt;my issues involved in this case.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">\n<em>\u201cTHE COURT: The objection is sustained.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\"><em>(b) \u201cQ. Will you just tell </em>ws <em>what he said and what you said?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">\n<em>\u201cMR. FERGUSON: Object to that as immaterial and hearsay.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">\n<em>\u201cMRS. ROOT: Now, if your Honor pleases, it is not hearsay in that it was a definite threat as made against the life of Clemente Valenda.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">\n<em>\u201cTHE COURT: The defendant was not there, was he?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-15\">\n<em>\u201cMRS. ROOT: The defendant was not there.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-16\">\n<em>\u201cTHE COURT: Objection sustained.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-17\">\n<em>Second: The district attorney committed prejudicial error in stating, during the course of his argument, to the jury the following:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-18\">\n<em>\u201c . . . She said also that the deceased, and this was vicious, a vicmis statement for her to make, one that I wish she had not made, that the evidence in this case would justify the belief that the deceased knew that his wife was getting money from the defendant and was happy to have a meal ticket. Mrs. Root dipped very, very far down into filth when she made that statement to you, because there is not a bit of evidence in the case to establish that or sustain that statement.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-19\">\n<em>Third: The trial court committed prejudicial error in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">It was not <em>prejudicial error </em>for the trial court to sustain an objection to the question set forth in paragraph (a) of appellant\u2019s first proposition. The law is established that error in sustaining an objection to a question is not <em>prejudicial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>if the question was answered before the objection thereto was sustained and a motion to strike the answer was not made. <em>[People </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>80 Cal. App. 623, 626 [252 Pac. 635].) In the present ease the question asked the witness was answered before an objection was made thereto, and a motion to strike the answer was not made. It therefore is clear that the question and answer were left for the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Neither was it <em>prejudicial </em>error for the trial court to sustain the objection to the question set forth in paragraph (b) of appellant\u2019s first proposition. The law is established that the erroneous exclusion of evidence is not <em>prejudicial </em>error where the excluded evidence is cumulative to other evidence which is introduced at the trial. (5 Cor. Jur. See. (1937) 1057, see. 1749. See, also, cases cited in 8 Cal. Jur. (1922) 619, sec. 600, note 6; and 4 Cal. Jur. Ten-year Supp. (1936) p. 876, sec. 600.) In the instant case the trial court permitted other testimony that deceased had made threats against the defendant\u2019s life. Therefore, the excluded evidence was merely cumulative to evidence which was received during the course of the trial, and hence the error was not prejudicial to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The second proposition presented by appellant may not be urged in this court for the reason that he did not lay the proper foundation in the trial court for review here of the alleged misconduct of the district attorney. The law is settled that, unless the harmful result of the alleged misconduct of a district attorney cannot be obviated by appropriate instructions of the trial court, a defendant may not predicate error thereon in this court in the absence of (1) an assignment of such alleged misconduct as error, and (2) a request to the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard it. <em>[People </em>v. <em>DuBois, </em>16 Cal. App. (2d) 81, 87 [60 Pac. (2d) 190].) Defendant neither assigned the alleged misconduct as error nor did he request the trial judge to instruct the jury to disregard such misconduct, although the harm, if any, might well have been obviated by an appropriate instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is likewise without merit. The law is settled that evidence which merely tends to impeach the testimony of a witness is not such newly discovered evidence as will form the basis for granting a motion for a new trial. <em>[People </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>64 Cal. App. 628, 631 [222 Pac. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>183]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>118 Cal. App. 115, 119 [4 Pac. (2d) 799]. See cases cited in 8 Cal. Jur. (1922) 431, sec. 454, note 14, and 4 Cal. Jur. Ten-year Supp. (1936) 754.) In the instant case the newly discovered evidence consisted solely of an affidavit of Mrs. Fortalesa impeaching her testimony at the time of the trial. Hence, the trial court ruled correctly in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\">An appeal does not lie from the sentence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>27 Cal. App. (2d) 353, 357 [81 Pac. (2d) 243].) Therefore, the purported appeal from the sentence is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The judgment and order are and each is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Grail, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
