There was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that decedent was legally liable for the support of his wife at the time of his death, and the commission was forced to the conclusive presumption that the said widow was dependent upon the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">An application by petitioner to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on March 27, 1939.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
