The motion of the appellant for a new trial was denied. Proceedings were suspended without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the imposition of sentence and the appellant was placed on probation for a period of five years, one of the terms thereof being that he spend the first year in the county jail. He appeals from the judgment and from the order denying his motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The contention of the appellant is that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction because \"the prosecution is bound by the exculpatory parts of the statement which it produced to prove the crime. \u2019 \u2019 Reliance is placed upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Salaz, </em>66 Cal.App. 173 [225 P. 777], <em>People </em>v. <em>Estrada, </em>60 Cal.App. 477 [213 P. 67], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>85 Cal.App.2d 577 [193 P.2d 953]. It will be necessary to state the evidence which is pertinent to the issue thus raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Georgia Hill Walker, the only witness, other than the defendants, to the incident which resulted in the death of Edward Joseph May, testified as follows: About 10:30 p.m. on August 21, 1958, she returned to the home in which she was living with Mr. May. She had been drinking \u201csince early that day.\u201d After she returned home, she, May and the two defendants were there. Mr. May told the defendants to leave. They left but they came back. At that time, she was on the floor and May was holding her down by her wrists, but he did not strike her. He was \u201cmad\u201d because she had been away from the house so long. She thought that the defendant Hart hit May and she remembered that both of the defendants picked him up and carried him into the bedroom. She did not know whether he was unconscious. She had drawn $400 out of the bank and had given May some money to pay bills but she was not sure how much she had given him. He had about $276 and she told him to hide it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She did not recall any discussion about any money when the defendants were in the house. She went into the bedroom later after the appellant came out and said, \u201cEd is hurt awful bad; I think he is dead.\u201d May was bleeding through the nose and blood was all over his face. She wiped his face with a wet towel. She said, \u201cCall a doctor.\" A doctor did not come. She went back into the living room and sat down and the next thing which she knew was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>that the police were there. On cross-examination, she testified that the appellant and May had been very close friends over the preceding year and had visited together frequently. She did not see May strike the defendant Hart at any time that night. She was drunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">An autopsy surgeon testified that he ascribed the death to asphyxia due to the inhalation of blood following a fractured nose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Other conditions which he found were: \u201cAcute scalp hematomata\u201d and \u201cAcute alcoholism.\u201d In response to a question as to whether any of the acute scalp hematomas could have caused unconsciousness, the witness answered that \u201cthe continuous sustaining of force that produces them also produces unconsciousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Edmund R. Chappel, a police officer of the city of Alhambra, testified that he arrived at the May home about 1:42 a.m. Officer Nixon accompanied Chappel. The ambulance attendants entered at the same time. Officer Chappel examined May\u2019s wallet and found no money in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Ted B. Bennett, a police officer of the city of Alhambra, had a conversation with the appellant Fuqua at the May home at about 2:40 a.m. on August 22. Fuqua said that during the course of the evening, after an interval of drinking, Georgia Hill (as Mrs. Walker was then known) put her arm around Fuqua and May walked over and, after objecting verbally, \u201cswung at Fuqua.\u201d Hart intervened and in the ensuing struggle a glass of beer was spilled on Hart\u2019s sweater and May was knocked to the floor. Eventually all four arrived in the bedroom where an argument took place. Fuqua and Hart were asked to leave by both Georgia Hill and May and they left. After Fuqua moved his automobile out of the driveway, he parked up the street and noticed that Hart had parked in front of the house. Fuqua went to the point where Hart was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>They heard loud noises coining from the house and ran up to the front porch and attempted to enter but the front door was held by a chain latch which allowed it to be opened three or four inches. They saw Georgia Hill on the floor and May was straddling her or holding her down and striking her. Hart said, \u201cI can\u2019t stand to see a woman beat up,\u201d and ran around to the rear. When Fuqua saw Hart enter the rear door, he also ran around to the back. He arrived just as Hart came into the living room and fell to his knees. Hart asked Georgia Hill if she was hurt, and she said, \u201cYes, he is hurting me. He always takes advantage of me when we have been drinking.\u201d Hart struck May, knocking him away from Georgia Hill. They picked him up and carried him into the bedroom. He and Hart returned to the living room where Georgia Hill was and resumed drinking and talking. After a short time they heard a loud thump and rushed into the bedroom and noted May lying on the floor against the southwest wall. He and Hart picked him up, attempted to revive him by wiping his face with a wet towel, and then called an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">At the police station, another statement, which was recorded, was taken from Fuqua at about 5 a. m. Therein Fuqua said in part as follows: Earlier in the evening Hart told Fuqua that May was supposed to have about $300 which he had obtained from Georgia Hill and \u201che says maybe if we get him real drunk we can take some of it . . . and he\u2019ll never know the difference, so that sounded all right to me.\u201d Fuqua and Jim Brady, May\u2019s son-in-law, had on previous occasions removed money from May\u2019s pocket when he was drunk. Fuqua then stated: \u201c. . . so I agreed that we\u2019d try to get Ed drunk and put him in bed and take, take some of his money, not all of it, just some of it, and so me and Ed [May] left for the liquor store and Don stayed there at the house.\u201d This was about 10:30 [p. m.]. When they returned, Georgia Hill had come home. The four then sat in the kitchen and talked and drank. Georgia Hill got up and put her arm around Fuqua. May told Fuqua to get out. May turned around as if he were going to walk away and then \u201cswung at me.\u201d Fuqua grabbed him by the arms. Hart shoved May and May fell down on the floor. Fuqua then took May into the bedroom and tried to calm him. Hart and Georgia Hill entered the room and an argument ensued between Hart and May in which Georgia Hill participated. Fuqua and Hart thereafter left the house after Fuqua had taken some food and beer which was in the refrigerator. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>They were out in front of the house, leaning against the fender of Hart\u2019s automobile and drinking beer, when \u201cwe heard Ed\u2019s and Georgia\u2019s voice yelling and making a bunch of, of commotion and everything, so Don [Hart] said let\u2019s go up there and see what they\u2019re doing. At that time I had given up- I, well, I had forgotten all about, seeing that, ah, the trouble and everything was caused by, ah, getting any of Eddie\u2019s money.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They went up to the door. Fuqua then continued as follows: \u201cAnd I- Don and me both thought that they were scuffing in there, and so Don said let\u2019s go in there and break it up; that he didn\u2019t like a man hitting a woman, so Don opened the front door, but it was-had a chain latch on it and we-it would only open about three inches. Georgia was laying on the floor and Ed was kneeling by her. They, they didn\u2019t even seem to notice that we were at the door or anything because, ah, Ed just kept on arguing with her, telling her she was a liar and so Don ran around the house. . . . Don ran around the house and I stayed there at the front door and then I seen him, Don, coming in the back door, so I ran around because I didn\u2019t want, I didn\u2019t want a bunch of trouble there, so Don ran up there and jerked Ed off <em>a </em>Georgia and hit him and Ed fell back on the floor.... He, ah, walked over there and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>that- and Ed at the time he hadn\u2019t hit Georgia, well he wasn\u2019t hitting Georgia then because Don ran around over there and asked Georgia if she was hurt. ... If Ed had hit her, and she said right after you guys left he started in on me, he says-she says he wouldn't do it when he is sober, when he gets like that he always blames it on me after everybody leaves. So then Don walked over to Ed and hit him. . . . And then Don hit Ed and Ed went down on the, the floor on his back. . . . And Don walked over and kind of raised him up a little bit and backhanded him two or three times. And so Ed\u2019s nose started bleeding and he looked like he was knocked out because his nose started bleeding, started bleeding and it was bleeding quite a bit because he, he had to have his mouth open to breath [e]. He was breathing like he was hard-like it was hard to breath [e]. So somebody said well let\u2019s carry him into the bedroom. So Don picked him up by the front, ah, his head and shoulders, and I picked him up by the legs and we carried him into the bedroom and laid him down on the bed and at that time he was still breathing. . . . [After a question as to whether May suffered any injury while being carried into the bedroom] No, ah, not that I know of because, ah, he was pretty heavy and it was pretty hard carrying him. He could have hit his head, ah, I don\u2019t remember it but he could have \u2019cause he was pretty hard to carry and everything, we were walking with him pretty fast in there. And so me and Don, earlier when we talked about the money, decided that anything one of us got that we\u2019d split fifty-fifty. So when we laid him down on the bed, Don looked and got his wallet and brought it out. . . . Yeah, and opened it up. No, before he found the wallet, he reached in one pocket pulled out a dollar bill that was crumpled up in the pocket, then he had the wallet out and there was three five dollar bills in there so he gave me one five and he took the other five and put the other five back in Eddie\u2019s wallet. ... So we left him there and went back in there and so Don started talking to Georgia and telling, in the living room, telling her that, ah, he was sorry for the trouble and that kind of stuff and that it wouldn\u2019t happen again, so while he was talking I went to the restroom and, ah, went back to the back bedroom and, ah, I was <em>gonna </em>get that other five. ...\u201d After Fuqua took the last five dollar bill and became alarmed at the condition of May, he called an ambulance. As to whether there was a discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>between him and Hart before they returned to the house as to going back to attempt to get money, Fuqua further stated: \u201cWell, I think we discussed it just a minute, ah, we knew, both lmew that Ed was pretty drunk. . . . And that a, a few more shots and he\u2019d pass out and so we heard this commotion up there and, ah, that set that off so we went up there, ah, to try to straighten that- to, to calm them down, so then we could, we could continue where we left off earlier.\u2019\u2019 Then the following questions and answers were recorded:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cB Now, did Don, ah, at any time say, ah, maybe I should knock him out, or something like that, so we can get the dough? F Ah, yes, ah, earlier that evening, I mean, I, well, I mean, you know guys talk. B Yeah. F I mean, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t, I, that, that wasn\u2019t even entered my mind after he says, he said that, ah, well when he gets to drinking and everything, if he won\u2019t pass out maybe we can knock him out. B Yeah. F And get it. But I mean, ah, as far as I\u2019m concerned that wasn\u2019t planned on, ah, anything like that wasn\u2019t more or less planned on with me,-B Um hum. F \u2014but, ah \u2014B Actually it was in the back of Don\u2019s mind, he discussed it, isn\u2019t that it? F It could <em>a </em>been, I mean, ah, that\u2019s what he said. . . . B Actually, ah, when you went back to the house the second time, you heard this commotion, wasn\u2019t it for the purpose of either you or Don to try to get Ed to drink more or if that didn\u2019t seem to be a good idea, for either you or Don to knock him out so that you could get the money? F Um hum. B Isn\u2019t that correct? F Um hum. B That is. F But, ah, he had, ah, said, ah, to me and I probably agreed at that time that that\u2019s what we\u2019d do. B Um hum. F You know, if we couldn\u2019t get him to pass out that we\u2019d knock him out but, ah, I don\u2019t think that I could have hit Ed because if, if I was planning on <em>hit </em>him I\u2019d have hit him when he struck at me earlier in the evening. B Um hum. T Well, do you think that that Don Hart, ah, carried the ball as far as Ed, do you think that\u2019s why he struck him, ah? F <em>Mo. </em>I don\u2019t, well, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what was in the back of Don\u2019s mind, but, ah, like I said, when we went in there and Georgia was crying and everything Don cussed, I think he called Ed a son-of-a-bitch and walked over and hit him. B But wasn\u2019t it a fact that a good part of the evening Don had tried to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>get Ed to start a fight with the possible hope that Ed would get knocked out for the purpose of taking his money ? F Yes. But \u2014B The fact is Don through a good part of the evening deliberately antagonized Ed? F Yes. B To try to get Ed to have him fight him? F Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">At 1:30 p. m. on August 22, Officers Bennett and Twitchell had a conversation with the defendant Hart and the appellant Fuqua which was recorded. Part of that conversation was as follows: Hart said that he and Fuqua \u201cjust started talking about it, that he had a large amount of money, you know, we should wait \u2019til he passes out or, you know, drinks quite a bit until he passes out and then we\u2019d take it.\u201d Officer Twitchell asked, \u201cWhat, what if you couldn\u2019t get him drunk enough to pass out?\u201d Hart replied, \u201cWell, we mentioned hitting him or something or knocking him out.\u201d Fuqua was then asked if that was \u201cthe way you more or less remember the conversation,\u201d and he answered, \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Fuqua did not know whether the idea of getting the money was his idea or Hart\u2019s. Fuqua was asked what he remembered of the conversation with Hart after they left the house. He stated: \u201cWell, I wanted to wait until they, the lights went out, see, and they went to bed and went to sleep, once they went to sleep, in <em>the </em>condition that they were, ah, I mean, they couldn\u2019t <em>woken </em>up, I was all for crawling through the window, you know, and looking through Ed\u2019s house and, ah, there was a bunch of noise. We were discussing this on the front porch at that time, there was a bunch of noise coming from in there and Don said, ah, he\u2019s beating her up. . . . He said we can\u2019t let him do that so <em>he </em>tried to open the door and it had one of those chain latches on it and we could just see so much but we could see that Georgia was laying on the floor and Ed was kneeling by her. \u2019 \u2019 He did not actually see May strike Georgia Hill, \u201cbut just looking through the door it looked like he had been or else was going to.\u201d Hart stated: \u201cI couldn\u2019t get in the front door and so I ran around the back door and I come in and, ah, he was kneeling over her, pushing her, you know, and I got on my knees and I told him to get away, yeah, I told him to get away and I asked her, I says, are you all right, Georgia, and she was cussing and said he had been beating me or something like that. And he said something to me, you know, <em>he </em>cussed at me or something and then, oh, I hit him then.\u201d After Hart completed his statements as to that occurrence, Fuqua was asked if that was more or less his version of what happened and <em>he </em>answered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u201cYes.\u201d As to Hart\u2019s actions, Fuqua further said: \u201cWell, he did, he did kneel down on his knees and ask Georgia if she was hurt and she was bawling and cussing and saying that he had been beating me up. . . . So, then Ed started cussing Don and then Don hit him. I don\u2019t know if he raised up when he him [hit] him or stayed in the position he was. . . . Ed fell down, over there and so Don went over there and, and slapped him two or three times after he hit him that one time. ...\u201d He further said that May's nose started to bleed and he was lying on the floor on his back and appeared to be \u201cknocked out.\u201d Hart stated that May was moving after the first blow and Fuqua said, \u201cYeah, like a groggy fighter would in the ring, you know.\u201d But, Hart said, after the slaps, it was \u201cjust like he had passed out\u201d and he began snoring and breathing hard. Fuqua said that they carried May into the bedroom \u201cand tossed him on the bed, and ah, rolled him over on his side, we looked through his pockets, you know, to see if he had any of that money on him and, ah, Don [Hart] reached in one pocket and there was a single dollar bill in there, so he took that, then he found a wallet and there was $15 in there and he give me five and he took five and put one five back in Ed\u2019s wallet.\u201d Fuqua said that later he went back into the bedroom \u201cto see about getting the other five\u201d and he \u201ctook the five.\u201d Hart said that Fuqua later called an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">As a witness on his own behalf, on direct examination Hart testified as to the incident when May had Georgia Hill on the floor as follows: \u201cWell, I parked my car out in front, and Robbie parked up the street in front of my car. I asked him if he got any of the beer, and we opened a can of beer on the curb. We were leaning against the car drinking and talking about all the trouble, I mean, what could have been caused there, you know, a big fight, and everything. So I said, \u2018I am glad we left.\u2019 And that is when we heard this screaming and yelling coming from the house. ... We ran up to the door, we were still on the porch, and we listened for awhile, and we heard them arguing; then we heard a slap. . . . Well, I opened the screen door, and I tried to go in the front door, and it had a chain lock on it, and it would open so far only, to where I could see in. And I saw Georgia on the floor, by the couch, and Ed was on top of her. . . . Well, I told Robbie, \u2018We have got to get in there; we can\u2019t let him beat her up like that.\u2019 So I couldn\u2019t get in the front door, so I ran around to the back door. I ran in the back door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>and ran over to Georgia, and I fell down on my knees and I asked her if she was all right. And she was crying, and she said, \u2018No, he has been beating me.\u2019 So I asked him to leave her alone. . . . One hand was on her arm\u2014one hand was on her arm, and the other hand was raised back. . . . Well, I asked him to leave her alone, and he says, \u2018Why, you son of a bitch, \u2019 and his fist was doubled up and his arm was back like he was going to throw his arm forward, and throw a punch at me, so I hit him. ... I hit him with my fist. . . . Well, he fell off her, and I jumped over on top of him and I slapped him. And I asked Robbie, I said, \u2018Robbie, come on, give me a hand with him and we will lay him on the bed.\u2019 So Robbie picked him up by his feet and I picked him up under his arms, and we carried him into the bedroom and threw him down there on the bed. . . . Well, then we went through his pockets to see if he had any of Georgia\u2019s money, that Georgia asked me about earlier. And we got into his wallet and he had some money in there, and we took that out. \u2019 \u2019 He testified that the only reason he struck May in the face with his left hand was because \u201che was on top of Georgia beating her.\u201d On cross-examination, Hart testified in part as follows: \u201cQ. When did you first find out there were three hundred dollars around the house ? A. When Georgia told me. Q. And you believed at that time that Ed May had $300.00 on him, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir. Q. And after that, you and Fuqua discussed getting Ed May drunk or knocking him out in order to get some of his money, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir. Q. Where were you when you and Fuqua discussed either getting Ed May drunk or knocking him out to get some of the money ? A. I\u2019m not sure. I believe we were in the kitchen. Q. Just you and Fuqua in the kitchen alone, is that correct, at that time? A. Yes, sir. Q. And you referred to it as some of his, meaning Ed May\u2019s money, didn\u2019t you? A. No, sir. Q. You didn\u2019t at any time tell the officers it was Georgia\u2019s money, did you? A. I believe I did. Q. You did at some time? A. I believe so. Q. Do you remember when and who you told it to? A. No, sir. Q. As a matter of fact, you referred to it as \u2018his,\u2019 meaning Ed May\u2019s money, isn\u2019t that true, his money? A. I may have. Q. Now, when you were in the kitchen with Fuqua discussing means of getting that money, you said to Fuqua, \u2018It would sure be nice to have that money,\u2019 didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir. Q. And what you had in mind at that time was securing the money either by getting Ed May drunk or by knocking him out, isn\u2019t that true? A. That was talk. Q. That was what was in your mind, wasn\u2019t it? A. No, sir. Q. What <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>was in your mind, then? A. Getting Georgia\u2019s money back. Q. You mean for Georgia? A. Yes, sir. Q. Well, it was you that needed some money, wasn\u2019t it? A. Needed some money? Q. Yes. You wanted to get it for yourself because you needed some money, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir. Q. Well, then, you did intend to get it for yourself, and not for Georgia, isn\u2019t that true? A. No, sir. Q. You knew from your past acquaintance with Ed May, did you not, that if he drank enough, he would pass out in time, is that correct? A. Yes, sir. Q. But you and Fuqua decided that if he didn\u2019t pass out\u2014or discussed between you if he didn\u2019t pass out, you would be sure to see to it that he did by striking him, isn\u2019t that true ? A. Yes, sir, I believe we said that. Q. And then after he did pass out \u2014that is, he was passed out, I presume, when you took him into the bedroom, isn\u2019t that true? A. Yes, sir. Q. And you laid him on the bed? A. Yes, sir. Q. And immediately you went into his pockets to look for money, is that right? A. Yes, sir. Q. And you found some money? A. Yes, sir. Q. You found $15.00 in his wallet, is that right? A. I believe that is what it was. Q. And you gave Fuqua five and you took five yourself, is that right? A. Yes, sir. Q. And did you find the other one-dollar bill in there, too ? A. No, sir. Q. Well, you took the other one-dollar bill, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir. Q. You must have found it there? A. In his pants pocket. Q. You went through more than one pocket, then? A. Yes, sir. Q. Any reason why you left five dollars in his wallet? A. No, sir. Q. Isn\u2019t it true that you left the $5.00 in his wallet so that when he came to and discovered $5.00 in his wallet he would think he spent the rest and not know that it had been stolen from him isn\u2019t that true? A. No, sir. Q. Did you intend to give any of that money to Georgia? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you give any of it to her ? A. No, sir. Q. Did you at any time tell her you had gotten any money from Ed May? A. Yes, sir. Q. When did you tell her that? A. When I went back out into the living room. Q. What did you say to Georgia, then? A. I told Georgia that we had found about $15.00 on him. Q. But you didn\u2019t give her not even a dime of it, did you? Well, let\u2019s say not even a dollar of it, since it was all in paper-Did you? A. No, sir, I didn\u2019t. Q. It was because you still had the $6.00 in your pocket when you were arrested? A. Yes, sir.\u201d He further testified that at the time of the fatal encounter, it was not his intention to get any money from May but he just wanted \u201cto get him off of Georgia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The appellant Fuqua testified in his own behalf. He admitted that at first he had told the officers an untrue story: \u201cQ. Now, right after you and Don picked Ed up from the floor and put him back on the bed, did you and Don try to cook up a false story as to how he got on the floor? A. Yes, sir. Q. You were going to tell the police that you heard the thump from the front room and both went in and found him on the floor, is that right? A. Yes, sir. Q. You knew that wasn\u2019t true? A. Yes, sir. Q. When you talked to the officers on the back porch, which story did you tell them, the true one or the one that you had cooked up? A. I believe that I told them the one that we had cooked up first. Q. And they told you that that wasn\u2019t true, or something? A. Yes, sir. Q. Then you told them the truth? A. Yes, sir.\u201d On cross-examination he testified as follows: \u201cQ. By Mb. Smith : That proposition of getting Ed May drunk so you could get his money sounded all right to you, didn\u2019t it? A. Well, as far as getting Georgia\u2019s money back for her, yes. Q. Isn\u2019t it true that you and Hart agreed that you would split everything 50-50 ? A. There was something like that mentioned. Q. That was the money that you got from Ed May that you would split 50-50, is that right ? A. I believe it was mentioned, yes. Q. And you meant you and Don Hart, and you didn\u2019t include Georgia in that 50-50, did you? A. That is why I went back to get the other five. Q. What do you mean, you went back to get the other five? A. Because it was Georgia\u2019s money. Q. Did you tell Don Hart you were going back to get the other five? A. No, sir. Q. Did you tell Georgia that you were going back to get the other five ? A. No, sir. Q. Did you tell her you had gotten any money from Ed May? A. I didn\u2019t, no.\u201d He further testified: \u201cQ. Well, let\u2019s ask you this: After Hart got through slapping Ed May, he appeared to be unconscious, didn\u2019t he? He passed out, didn\u2019t he? A. Yes, sir. Q. And you and Don Hart immediately picked him up and took him in the bedroom, \u2022isn\u2019t that true? A. Well, he helped Georgia to the couch first, and then we carried him to the bedroom. Q. And then you immediately took him in the bedroom after Georgia was on the couch, is that right ? A. Yes, sir. Q. And then you immediately, you or Hart, immediately went through his pockets to find the wallet, that is true, isn\u2019t it? A. After Don said about seeing if he had Georgia\u2019s money. Q. And at that time you believed that Ed Hart [sic] had approximately $300.00 on his person, isn\u2019t that true? A. Yes, sir. Q. Now, were you in the kitchen when you first discussed this getting Ed May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>knocked out, either from liquor or from blows, to get his money? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In the course of stating his decision that the defendants were guilty of the charge of murder in the second degree, the trial judge said: \u201cI am satisfied in my own mind that these young men planned a course of procedure to get the money of the victim. I don\u2019t believe there was any abandonment of that original plan. The fact that they carried it out satisfied me beyond a reasonable doubt that there wasn\u2019t such an abandonment ; that they carried through the original plan to its fruition. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">We turn now to the eases, mentioned above, upon which the appellant primarily relies. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Estrada, </em>60 Cal.App. 477 [213 P. 67], the only direct evidence that the deceased was killed by the defendant consisted of a written statement made by the defendant shortly after his arrest. The defendant did not testify at the trial. The judgment of conviction of manslaughter was reversed. The court said, at pages 481-483: \u201cIn our opinion there is nothing indicated by the narrative as expressed in the statement of the defendant to warrant the conclusion that defendant, in repelling the attack of Murillo, acted other than in necessary self-defense. ... It was not necessary that the defendant should have in words pictured his state of mind as it was at the time of the attack, for under his statement of the encounter the circumstances were such as to indicate nothing else but that by doing what he did he was defending himself against a murderous assault then being made by the deceased. . . . The proof on the part of the prosecution (referring now to the statement of the defendant) did, as we have indicated, show a case of justification, and there is nothing in any of the other evidence presented which in anywise tends to contradict or dispute defendant\u2019s version of the affair. ... We conclude that defendant\u2019s first contention is well made and that the verdict of the jury is not supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Salaz, </em>66 Cal.App. 173 [225 P. 777], the court said, at page 181: \u201cThe jury could not have found, from the evidence for the people, that the killing was done by appellant except upon the latter\u2019s admissions which carried, in close and immediate connection with proof of the killing, circumstances of necessary self-defense. Since, therefore, the proof on the part of the prosecution tends to show that the act of appellant was justifiable, there was, at the close of the people\u2019s case, no presumption against the accused that he had committed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>unlawful homicide. No presumption of guilt weighed against the presumption of innocence. 'Upon a trial for murder, the commission of the homicide by the defendant being proved, the burden of proving circumstances of mitigation, or that justify or excuse it, devolves upon him, <em>unless the proof on the part of the prosecution tends to show that the crime committed only amounts to manslaughter, or that the defendant was justifiable or excusable.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u201cBut it does not necessarily follow that appellant\u2019s account of the killing, though uncontradicted by direct evidence, should control the jury. If there be any well-established circumstance in the case which may reasonably be regarded as incompatible with the theory of the defense that the killing was justifiable, then the jury, from a consideration of all the evidence, was warranted in finding that the act amounted to an unlawful homicide. The question therefore is.- Does the record furnish evidence of any circumstance which cannot reasonably be reconciled with the theory that appellant acted in self-defense?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">A judgment of conviction of manslaughter was reversed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>85 Cal.App.2d 577 [193 P.2d 953], on the basis of reasoning similar to that found in the Estrada and Salaz eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">More recently the Supreme Court has had occasion to state the applicable principle as follows: \u201cThe sentence in the Salaz case which, according to defendant, should be applied to the present case, does not stand for a rule of law that a defendant cannot be convicted if the prosecution introduces <em>some </em>evidence which tends to prove that defendant did not act in the manner or have the state of mind which is necessary to constitute a crime and there is other evidence sufficient to show guilt. As the Salaz case itself indicates, if there is prosecution evidence which tends to disprove criminality and other prosecution evidence which tends to prove criminality, it is the function of the trier of fact to determine which version is to be believed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Freudenberg </em>(1953), 121 Cal.App.2d 564, 575-576 [263 P.2d 875] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rutland </em>(1953), 120 Cal.App.2d 798, 800 [261 P.2d 735] ; <em>of. People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1930), 211 Cal. 322, 329-330 [295 P. 333, 71 A.L.R. 1385] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1944), 25 Cal.2d 59, 90-93 [153 P.2d 21].)  The courts may sometimes say that the prosecution is \u2018bound by\u2019 extrajudicial statements of defendant which are introduced by the prosecution and which are irreconcilable with guilt, but this concept is applicable only where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>no other competent and substantial evidence which could establish guilt. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1952), 111 Cal.App.2d 281, 283 [244 P.2d 500] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coppla </em>(1950), 100 Cal.App.2d 766, 769 [224 P.2d 828].) \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>45 Cal.2d 538, 542-543 [290 P.2d 1].) A helpful discussion is also found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>48 Cal.2d 78 [307 P.2d 921], In that case, in the defendant\u2019s testimony at the trial he gave materially the same account of the killing as was contained in his statements made to a deputy district attorney shortly after the killing and to another deputy district attorney the day after the killing-. The Supreme Court said, at pages 82-83: \u201cDefendant urges that his undisputed testimony and statements to the deputy district attorneys show that no sufficient interval for deliberation and premeditation elapsed between the time that he cut the boy slightly, with no purpose to kill, and the time that he cut the boy\u2019s throat to silence his screams. The jury, however, could disbelieve the evidence that defendant\u2019s original purpose as he waited for the boy with open knife was merely to cut him slightly, and could believe, from other evidence, that defendant\u2019s purpose was a lustful intent to kill. And there was evidence upon which the jury could predicate a determination that this intent was formed willfully, deliberately, and after premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u201cPortions of defendant\u2019s testimony and his statements to the deputy district attorneys are to the following effect: Defendant saw the boy leave the theater. Defendant almost immediately thereafter left the theater, looked about the lobby and saw that the boy was not there, concluded that the boy had gone to the men\u2019s room, and himself went to the men\u2019s room. Prom the sounds which defendant then heard, he concluded that the boy was in the booth. The jury were not required to believe defendant\u2019s testimony that he decided to cut the boy slightly when defendant heard him in the booth; they could determine that defendant followed the boy from the theater to the men\u2019s room with the formed purpose of cutting him fatally. According to one of defendant\u2019s statements to a deputy district attorney defendant left his seat in the theater 'about half a minute or so, maybe more, \u2019 after he saw the boy walk down the aisle, and in response to the question \u2018Did you expect to see him in the toilet?\u2019 answered \u2018Yes, I expected to.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u201cIt is defendant\u2019s position that, despite the foregoing extrajudicial statements and the testimony of defendant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>People are bound by portions of the extrajudicial statements of defendant, introduced in evidence by the People, such as the following: Defendant cut the boy \u2018Mainly to see what would happen, I guess ... to see what the reaction would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u201c \u2018Question: When did it enter your mind to do that? Answer: After I had gone into the head. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Question: Tell me, did the little boy have anything to do with your going to the restroom? Answer: No. ... I would have gone up anyway if he hadn\u2019t gone out ... I thought to grab this kid as he came out and my original intention was to just cut him a little bit and scare him but--</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u201c \u2018Question: (Interposing) Any reason for that? Answer: No. . . . [OJther than just scare him was my original intention. Then I got panicky and killed him.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u201cDefendant urges that \u2018where the prosecution introduces evidence favorable to the accused and does not controvert such evidence, the prosecution is bound by such uneontradicted evidence\u2019 (citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Coppla </em>(1950), 100 Cal.App.2d 766, 769 [224 P.2d 828] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Toledo </em>(1948), 85 Cal.App.2d 577, 581 [193 P.2d 953]). But here the statements of defendant presented by the People were not all uncontradicted evidence in his favor. Eather, the very statements of defendant on which defendant now relies contained, among other evidence, evidence on which, as already indicated, the jury could predicate a determination (based on the evidence in the ease as a whole, rather than the isolated statements of defendant which he contends show lack of deliberation and premeditation) that defendant followed his victim from the theater with a formulated intent to injure him fatally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">The contention of the appellant in the present case revolves around the claim that the statements received in evidence show that the \u201cmotivation for the striking of decedent by Hart was not for the purpose of getting money\u201d but, rather, was the concern of the defendants \u201cabout the beating of Mrs. Walker by the decedent.\u201d The trial court was, of course, dealing with the state of mind of each of the defendants at the time of the striking of May by Hart.  As succinctly stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyles, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 482 [319 P.2d 745], at page 486: \u201c. . . intent is rarely susceptible of direct proof and ordinarily must be inferred from a consideration of all the facts and circumstances shown in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>denee.  And, it necessarily follows, that if the evidence is sufficient to justify a reasonable inference that the requisite intent existed, the finding of its presence in a particular ease, may not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d  In the present case, Mrs. Walker testified that she thought that the defendant Hart had hit May. The nature of the injuries received by May was such as to justify the trier of fact in reaching the conclusion that more force had been used than was reasonably necessary under the circumstances to divert May from his attack upon Mrs. Walker. The appellant Fuqua testified that at first he had told the officers an untrue story as to hearing a noise and finding May upon the bedroom floor. Fuqua\u2019s statements which were offered by the prosecution were sufficient to sustain the inference that the defendants had planned to take money from May\u2019s person when he should become so intoxicated that he would not be aware of the theft or, if that did not occur, when May should become unconscious as a result of blows from the defendants or one of them. Moreover, it is obvious that the appellant was referring to the plan to obtain May\u2019s money when, in one statement with respect to the conversation after he and Hart had left the house, the appellant said; \u201cWell, I wanted to wait until they, the lights went out, see, and they went to bed and went to sleep, once they went to sleep, in the condition that they were, ah, I mean, they couldn\u2019t <em>woken </em>up, I was all for crawling through the window, you know, and looking through Ed\u2019s house and, ah, there was a bunch of noise. We were discussing this on the front porch at that time, there was a bunch of noise coming from in there and Don said, ah, he\u2019s beating her up.\u201d Immediately after Hart struck May several times, the defendants carried him into the bedroom and took money from his wallet. Such evidence was sufficient to support the inference that such purpose of taking money from May motivated the defendants at the time May was hit, unless, under the authorities upon which the appellant relies, the trial court was bound to accept literally the assertions of the appellant and Hart that at that moment their plan of taking money from May had been temporarily abandoned. The trier of fact might reasonably infer that an additional motivation\u2014that of protecting Mrs. Walker\u2014had conveniently joined rather than displaced the desire to steal May\u2019s money. In this connection, the trier of fact might well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>conclude that more force was used than was reasonably necessary to stop May\u2019s attack on Mrs. Walker. Certainly, where the statement of a defendant bears in itself indicia of inconsistency, which gain weight and importance in the light of the other evidence, it cannot be said that such defendant\u2019s version of the affair is in nowise contradicted or disputed. On the contrary, the reasoning in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnston, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d 78, 82-83, which has been quoted herein, is applicable. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>159 Cal.App.2d 808, 810-811 [324 P.2d 291].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u201c As so often repeated, the function of an appellate tribunal begins and ends with a determination of whether <em>the </em>record on <em>appeal </em>contains <em>evidence, </em>contradicted or uncontradicted, which supports directly or upon reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, the conclusion of the trier of the facts.  As was said by our Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Newland, </em>15 Cal.2d 678, 681, 682 [104 P.2d 778], in the performance of that function, ' \u201cWe must assume in favor of the verdict the existence of every fact which the jury could have reasonably deduced from the evidence, and then determine whether such facts are sufficient to support the verdict.\u201d  If the circumstances reasonably justify the verdict of the jury, the opinion of the reviewing court that those circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with the innocence of the defendant will not warrant interference with the determination of the jury. (Citing cases.)\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lyles, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 482, 487-488.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">With respect to the determination of the trial court that the killing constituted murder in the second degree, the appellant is in no better position to complain than was the appellant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>39 Cal.App.2d 587 [103 P.2d 1020], wherein it was said at page 591: \u201cAssuming that there could be a reasonable doubt on the part of a jury as to the intent of appellant to commit robbery, or that the act was not the result of previous planning or deliberate determination, and assuming that the crime was one of 'drunk rolling\u2019, with an intent to commit larceny rather than robbery, nevertheless the felonious intent to commit larceny by the use of felonious means, in the perpetration of which the victim was slain, would constitute murder of the second degree. Under such circumstances malice is implied. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 188; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>9 Cal.App. 194 [98 P. 247].)  A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>felonious purpose, accomplished by felonious means, is sufficient to constitute murder in the second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The judgment and the order denying the motion for a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Shinn, P.
