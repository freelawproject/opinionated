The plaintiff\u2019s complaint, which asserted an action in the nature of certiorari, was dismissed on the ground that the claims should have been brought instead as counterclaims in a separate action. Because we conclude that the underlying certiorari action was by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>nature an appellate proceeding, rather than a claim amenable to assertion via counterclaim, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Giragosian owned and operated a gun shop in Arlington (town) for thirty years. On March 16, 2007, the town\u2019s chief of police, after a hearing, issued an order forfeiting Gira-gosian\u2019s five firearms licenses. (The reasons for the chief\u2019s order can be found in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) The five licenses Giragosian held were (1) a license to sell firearms under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122; (2) a license to sell ammunition under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122B; (3) a license to be in business as a gunsmith under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122; (4) a class A license to carry firearms under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131; and (5) a license to possess a machine gun under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131*</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The revocation of a license under any of these sections may be appealed. However, the timing and mechanism of appeal are not the same for each statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 122B, which governs Giragosian\u2019s license to sell ammunition, provides that a license revocation is to be appealed within thirty days by filing a petition in the District Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 131, which governs Giragosian\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>license to carry firearms and license to possess a machine gun, provides a ninety-day period in which to appeal to the District Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 122, governing Giragosian\u2019s licenses to sell firearms and to operate as a gunsmith, does not itself provide any mechanism for appeal from the revocation or suspension of a license. However, a person who is \u201crefused\u201d a license under this section may within ten days thereafter apply for such a license to the colonel of the State police. G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Because it will aid in understanding the discussion that follows, we pause here to set out the provisions of G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, which governs actions in the nature of certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">\u201cA civil action in the nature of certiorari to correct errors in proceedings which are not according to the course of the common law, which proceedings are not otherwise reviewable by motion or by appeal, may be brought in the supreme judicial or superior court or, if the matter involves any right, title or interest in land, or arises under or involves the subdivision by-laws or regulations, in the land court or, if the matter involves fence viewers, in the district court. Such action shall be commenced within sixty days next after the proceeding complained of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 2006, c. 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>As noted above, the town\u2019s police chief revoked Giragosian\u2019s licenses on March 16, 2007. Giragosian sought judicial review by filing a complaint in the District Court on April 17, 2007. As best we can determine from the limited record before us,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Giragosian did not appeal the revocation of his licenses under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122 (license to sell firearms and to practice gun-smithing).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because Giragosian did not invoke G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122, in his complaint, the District Court judge concluded that those license revocations were not before him. The judge held that the remaining three license revocations (i.e., sale of ammunition, class A license to carry, and machine gun possession) had been properly appealed to him and, after hearing, concluded that the police chief had acted reasonably in revoking them. A memorandum of decision dated June 1, 2007, and an amended memorandum dated June 7, 2007, are contained in the record; both reflect the same reasoning and outcome.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On May 17, 2007, the town filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking an injunction requiring Giragosian to surrender all firearms and ammunition. This suit was necessitated by the fact that Giragosian had refused to surrender these items despite the revocation of his licenses two months earlier. Giragosian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>answered the complaint on June 6, 2007. The requested injunction issued on June 13, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">On July 5, 2007, Giragosian filed a motion for leave to amend his answer to assert a counterclaim appealing the revocation of the G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122, licenses (sale of firearms and gun-smithing). That motion was denied on the ground that Girago-sian had failed first to timely appeal to the colonel of the State police.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">On July 7, 2007, Giragosian filed a certiorari complaint in the Superior Court, naming the police chief as the defendant, seeking review of the District Court decision that had affirmed the revocation of his G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 122B &amp; 131 licenses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. His complaint alleged various irregularities in the District Court proceeding, including a lack of impartiality on the part of the District Court judge and that judge\u2019s improper consideration of information extrinsic to the proceedings. On December 27, 2007, the chief filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that Giragosian\u2019s claims should have instead been brought as counterclaims in the other Superior Court action in which the town sought an injunction. The Superior Court judge agreed with the chief, concluding that the matter should have been brought as a compulsory counterclaim in the Superior Court injunction action and, as a result, dismissed the certiorari complaint. This is the order that is on appeal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Giragosian argues that the judge erred when she ruled that Giragosian could not seek review of the District Court judge\u2019s decision by way of his certiorari complaint, but rather was required to assert them as compulsory counterclaims in the town\u2019s injunction action. We begin our analysis by examining the nature of the two procedural avenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Counterclaims can be either compulsory, Mass.R.Civ.P. 13(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1405 (1996), or permissive, Mass.R. Civ.R 13(b), 365 Mass. 758 (1974). A compulsory counterclaim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>is \u201cany claim for relief the court has power to give which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party,[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim.\u201d Mass.R. Civ.R 13(a). A permissive counterclaim, on the other hand, is \u201cany claim against an opposing party,\u201d Mass.R.Civ.R 13(b). Whether compulsory or permissive, only a \u201cclaim\u201d can be asserted as a counterclaim. A claim is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201c1. The aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right enforceable by the court .... 2. The assertion of an existing right; any right to payment or to an equitable remedy even if contingent or provisional. . . . 3. A demand for money, property, or a legal remedy to which one asserts a right; esp., the part of a complaint in a civil action specifying what relief the plaintiff asks for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 281-282 (9th ed. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We are presented here with a review of a prior adjudication, not a \u201cclaim.\u201d The police chief has pointed us to no authority, nor have we found any, requiring a party to pursue an appeal by way of a compulsory counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">An action in the nature of certiorari is an action to \u201ccorrect errors in proceedings which are not according to the course of the common law, which proceedings are not otherwise reviewable by motion or by appeal.\u201d G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, as amended by St. 1986, c. 95. Such an action in the nature of certiorari may result in \u201cjudgment quashing or affirming such proceedings or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>such other judgment as justice may require.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The scope of review is limited to \u201cerrors of law apparent on the record.\u201d <em>Durbin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Kingston, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4 (2004). In short, an action in the nature of certiorari is a form of appellate review; in other words, \u201c[a] proceeding undertaken to have a decision reconsidered by a higher authority; especially], the submission of a lower court\u2019s or agency\u2019s decision to a higher court for review and possible reversal . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 112 (9th ed. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In this case, Giragosian filed his certiorari complaint seeking review of the District Court\u2019s affirmance of the revocation of his licenses. He specifically prayed that the Superior Court \u201creverse the decision of the Cambridge District Court, [and] order Defendant Ryan to restore all of Giragosian\u2019s licenses.\u201d Giragosian was clearly seeking appellate review, rather than asserting a claim. As such, his grievance could not properly have been brought as a counterclaim, whether compulsory or permissive. The Superior Court judge, therefore, erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Although the summary judgment order must be vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings, only three of the licenses will be at issue on remand: the license to sell ammunition under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122B; the class A license to carry firearms under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131; and the license to possess a machine gun under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131. The revocations of those three were properly appealed to the District Court, and in turn were the subject of Giragosian\u2019s timely certiorari complaint. The \u00a7 122 licenses (sale of firearms and gunsmithing) were not appealable to the District Court, both because \u00a7 122 does not provide for the appeal of license revocations to that court, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122, and because the District Court does not have jurisdiction over a certiorari action unless it involves fence viewers. G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. Thus, although Giragosian asks that we review the revocation of all five licenses, only the \u00a7\u00a7 122B and 131 licenses are properly before us, just as they were the only ones properly before the Superior Court in the certiorari action. Further proceedings in the Superior Court on remand will be limited to the \u00a7\u00a7 122B and 131 licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">For the reasons set out above, the order allowing summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>judgment is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\">In December, 2002, Giragosian left an unlicensed customer unsupervised in the store\u2019s training area, in violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 130. In Giragosian\u2019s absence, the customer killed himself. His license temporarily suspended, Giragosian applied for restoration but did not supply truthful answers on the application. He also failed to complete the required safety course prior to reinstatement of his licenses. Giragosian failed to maintain records of all firearm transactions as required by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 123. Giragosian failed, in violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 123, to report the theft of firearms from his store in September, 2005. Police across the State have recovered these guns from crime scenes. In January, 2007, another customer took his own life in the store, using one of Giragosian\u2019s guns. After this second suicide, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) inspected and discovered that Giragosian, among other violations, manufactured firearms without a manufacturer\u2019s license and failed, in violation of Federal law, to report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation handgun sales to selected individuals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-10\">With respect to the licenses issued pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122, the chief was empowered to forfeit or suspend such licenses by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 125. See Randall &amp; Franklin, Municipal Law and Practice \u00a7 16.10, at 33 (5th ed. 2006). Sections 122B and 131 contain within themselves provisions enabling the revocation of licenses within their scope. G.

The District Court judge found (and we accept) that Giragosian did not mention section 122 in his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Nor could Giragosian have done so. Section 122 sets out only an appeal mechanism for refusals to issue licenses, and says nothing about revocations or suspensions. General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 125, which enables the suspension and forfeiture of \u00a7 122 licenses, also contains no mechanism by which such decisions are to be appealed. By contrast, sections 122B and 131 both explicitly provide that license denials, suspensions, and revocations can be appealed. Compare G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 122, with G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 122B &amp; 131. Although the reason for this difference is not readily apparent, we apply the plain language of the statute where, as here, it would not lead to an \u201cabsurd result, or one contrary to the Legislature\u2019s manifest intention.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 253 (1998). In the absence of an appeal mechanism in \u00a7 122B, Giragosian was required to seek review by timely filing a complaint in the nature of certiorari with either the Superior Court or the Supreme Judicial Court. G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. This he did not do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The District Court docket has not been supplied, and we do not know when either decision was entered on the docket.

The District Court decision was dated June 1, 2007, and the amended decision was dated June 7, 2007. Giragosian argues that his claim did not mature until the amended decision and, hence, he could not have pursued his appeal as a counterclaim. Given our disposition on other grounds, we need not reach this argument. Moreover, even were we required to reach the issue, we would be hampered by Giragosian\u2019s failure, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>to provide any information about when either decision was entered on the docket or when judgment entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
