The parties, as well as their children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>are United States citizens who were living in Massachusetts when the marriage suffered an irretrievable breakdown in 2004. On May 30, 2004, the couple (with their children) returned to Lebanon for the purposes of there obtaining a religious divorce. Once in Lebanon, the father did not institute divorce proceedings as he had agreed, but instead sought and obtained custody of the two children. The mother returned to the Commonwealth and instituted the underlying divorce action, in which she also sought custody and child support. Following a trial, a judge of the Probate and Family Court concluded that no deference was due the custody order issued by a Jaafarite religious tribunal (Jaafarite Court) in Lebanon. The probate judge based his decision on evidence, including the testimony of experts, that the Jaafarite Court\u2019s custody order was not made in \u201csubstantial conformity\u201d with Massachusetts law regarding the best interests of the children. With a modification to the judgment, discussed <em>infra, </em>we affirm the award of custody to the mother and child support in the amount of $184 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">I. <em>Background. </em>A. <em>Facts. </em>\u201cWe draw our factual summary from the findings of the judge, . . . and the uncontested facts of record, all of which are supported by the trial record. We reserve some details for later discussion where pertinent to our analysis.\u201d <em>Millennium Equity Holdings, LLC </em>v. <em>Mahlowitz, </em>456 Mass. 627, 630 (2010) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The mother and the father, who were bom in Lebanon, are Shia Muslims. The father emigrated from Lebanon to the United States where he then entered college in Massachusetts, earning an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering in 1990, and thereafter a graduate degree in software engineering. The father became a United States citizen in 1992. The parties were married on June 29,1995, in an Islamic religious ceremony performed in Lebanon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time, the father was employed in Boston as a software engineer, and he returned to Massachusetts soon after the wedding. The mother joined him in May, 1996, becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2001. Two sons were bom of the marriage, the first in November of 1998 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the second in September of 2002. Both sons were bom in the Commonwealth and therefore are United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">During the years the parties resided in Massachusetts, the mother was primarily responsible for the home and, after the birth of the children, was their primary caretaker. As the father worked increasingly less (and eventually not at all) due to health issues, the mother also was employed outside the home, first as a salesperson and later as a financial administrator. In 2002, the father began receiving private long term disability payments; in 2004, he began receiving Social Security Disability Insurance benefits after the Social Security Administration determined him to be disabled from employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 2003, the father traveled to Lebanon for medical treatments, and the mother alone cared for the two children until his return three months later, in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The parties began to experience marital difficulties, and after the father\u2019s return to Massachusetts, they discussed divorce. The judge found that the marriage suffered an irretrievable breakdown in the Commonwealth in 2004. He further found that the parties \u201cagreed to return to Lebanon for the purposes of obtaining a religious divorce,\u201d and that \u201cthe [mother] would receive custody of the children.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties sold the marital residence and equally divided the sale proceeds. On May 30, 2004, the parties traveled with their young sons to Beirut, Lebanon, where the mother and the children stayed at the home of her parents and the father stayed at the home of his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Once in Lebanon, the father did not agree to a divorce or to giving the mother custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">B. <em>Proceedings. </em>On June 23, 2004, the father initiated an action for reconciliation and custody in the Jaafarite Court in Lebanon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That court has jurisdiction over family matters aris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ing between persons of the Shia sect of the Islamic religion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At about the same time, he sought the imposition of a travel ban against the mother. On July 5,2004, the father brought a guardianship action seeking custody of the two children. By a temporary order dated July 29, 2004, the father was given custody of the children and a travel ban issued that prohibited the mother and the children from traveling outside Lebanon. Additional proceedings not relevant here also were instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The mother was advised by her attorneys that, absent the father\u2019s agreement, she would have no chance of obtaining custody of the two sons in the Jaafarite Court in Lebanon after they reached the age of two years. The probate judge found that she entered into an agreement that the father have custody of the minor children and that she have visitation two days per week \u201conly because she knew that under the substantive law of [the Jaafarite Court], she could not obtain custody and was merely attempting to secure visitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">On November 14, 2005, the Jaafarite Court entered a permanent decree in the guardianship action, which confirmed the parties\u2019 agreement that the father would have guardianship (legal and physical custody) of the children, then seven and three years old. No divorce proceeding was initiated in the Jaafarite Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The travel ban imposed on the mother was lifted sometime in late 2005; she eventually left Lebanon without the children, returning to Massachusetts in March of 2006. On April 5, 2007, she filed the underlying complaint for divorce in which she also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>sought custody of the children.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An attorney appeared on behalf of the father and filed an answer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Following a two-day trial, a judgment of divorce nisi issued on October 1, 2008, which became absolute on December 31, 2008. The judgment granted a divorce for the cause of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage; awarded legal and physical custody of the children to the mother, with reasonable visitation to the father; divided their property; and ordered the father to pay $184 dollars in weekly child support.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">On appeal, the father does not specifically challenge the probate judge\u2019s findings that it was in the best interests of the minor children that the mother be awarded legal and physical custody of them. Rather, he claims that the Jaafarite Court decree awarding him custody is entitled to deference. As to the child support order, the father asserts that the probate judge erred in calculating the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">II. <em>Discussion. </em>In deciding the question whether the Jaafarite Court\u2019s decree should be given deference, the probate judge engaged in a two-step determination. He first determined that the Probate and Family Court \u201chas jurisdiction to make a custody determination in this case pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(2), because no other state is the home state of the [children], the [mother] resides here, and because the children and the parties resided here until 2004, there exists substantial evidence here regarding the children and their care.\u201d Second, he \u201cdecline[d] to give deference to the Lebanese Judgment because it was not in \u2018substantial conformity\u2019 with the laws of Massachusetts. G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>c. 209B, \u00a7 14.\u201d The father\u2019s various challenges to these conclusions are discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><em>A. Jurisdiction under MCCJA. </em>The father claims that the probate judge erred in concluding that, because \u201cno other state is the home state\u201d of the children, the judge properly could exercise jurisdiction pursuant to G. L. c. 209B, also known as the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (MCCJA).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Under <em>Khan </em>v. <em>Saminni, </em>446 Mass. 88, 91 (2006), whether to extend deference to the judgment of another nation begins with our consideration of whether \u00a7 2 of the MCCJA bars or permits the exercise of jurisdiction. \u201cThe Probate Court judge\u2019s decision to exercise jurisdiction under the MCCJA is a discretionary one.\u201d <em>Orchard </em>v. <em>Orchard, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 775, 779 (1997), citing <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 809, 815 (1988). See <em>Adoption of Yvette (No. 1), </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 327, 335 (2008), citing <em>E.N. </em>v. <em>E.S., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 182, 191-192 &amp; n.20 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">That portion of the MCCJA on which the probate judge relied in exercising jurisdiction is G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(2), inserted by St. 1983, c. 680, \u00a7 1, which permits the exercise of jurisdiction if \u201cit appears that no other state would have jurisdiction under paragraph (l).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Lebanon does not have jurisdiction unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>it \u201cis the home state of the child on the commencement of the custody proceeding,\u201d G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(1), that is, unless the children had resided with a parent in Lebanon for at least six consecutive months \u201cimmediately preceding the date of commencement of the custody proceeding\u201d in Lebanon. G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1983, c. 680, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Here, the parties and their two children traveled from Massachusetts to Lebanon on May 30, 2004; slightly more than one month later, on July 5, 2004, the father filed the guardianship action that produced a temporary custody order and ultimately a decree awarding him legal and physical custody of the children. Lebanon was thus not the home State of the children at the commencement of the father\u2019s custody proceeding. The probate judge permissibly could exercise jurisdiction because the children had been living with a parent in Lebanon for less than six months when the father filed the guardianship action in the Jaafarite Court in Lebanon, and thus \u201cno other state\u201d had jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">B. <em>Substantial conformity. </em>To support his argument that the probate judge erred in concluding that the Jaafarite Court decree was not decided under law in substantial conformity with Massachusetts law governing child custody cases, the father claims (1) that the testimony of his expert supports the conclusion that \u201cthe relevant standard for custody matters under the Jaafarite School of Islamic Law in Lebanon is the best interests of the children\u201d; and (2) the mother was under no duress when she entered into the agreement in Lebanon that gave custody to the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">1. <em>Best interests standard. </em>The probate judge\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding the substantive law of best interests applied in the Lebanese Jaafarite Court, as compared to that applied in the Commonwealth, are set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201cBased on the evidence, it is clear that male children in Lebanon go to the Father at the age of two. The parents are not evaluated equally when determining the best interest of the children and which parent should have physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>custody. Although the Mother can obtain custody, it is only if the father is a criminal or cannot or will not care for the children. Unlike Massachusetts which requires that the court determine the best interest of the child and which parent should have custody based upon the \u2018happiness and welfare of the children,\u2019 it is clear that the Lebanese law does not take that into consideration unless the father is unfit. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We have said that the \u201c \u2018substantial conformity\u2019 test requires the satisfaction of three procedural components: whether the foreign court (1) had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter; (2) applied procedural and substantive law reasonably comparable to ours; and (3) based its order on the \u2018best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Qiuyue Shao </em>v. <em>Yue Ma, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 314 (2007), citing <em>Khan, </em>446 Mass. at 95. This \u201canalysis tracks standards reflecting the traditional doctrine of comity.\u201d <em>Khan, supra </em>at 94, citing <em>Schiereck </em>v. <em>Schiereck, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 380 (1982) (\u201cBecause the decree was issued by a foreign court, the doctrine of comity is invoked. See <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Guyot, </em>159 U.S. 113, 163-164 [1895]\u201d). See <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), </em>392 Mass. 728, 735 (1984).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These and other traditional principles of international comity all find their source in the seminal decision of the United States Supreme Court, <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Guyot, supra </em>at 163-167, 190-191, 202-203, 228.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The issue before us, whether the substantive laws of the Jaa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>farite Court in Lebanon are in substantial conformity with those of Massachusetts, turns largely on the question whether the Lebanese Jaafarite Court considers the best interests of the children, as that standard is understood under the laws of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Here, the probate judge credited evidence, including certain testimony of the parties\u2019 experts, that, as between separating or divorcing parents, the Jaafarite Court in Lebanon will give the father custody of a son over the age of two absent circumstances, not present here, that would render him unfit. Compare <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 812-813, 816, citing <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), </em>392 Mass. at 735-736 (where no expert testimony or evidence presented regarding governing principles of family law in Sharia Court in Israel, and \u201cto what extent those principles . . . would be substantially consistent with the governing principles of Massachusetts law regarding child custody,\u201d case remanded for determination, among other things, whether law applicable in foreign court includes \u201cbasic concern for the best interests of the children, as contrasted, for example, with an undue consideration for purely parental interests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">As the judge\u2019s findings reflect, not only the mother\u2019s experts, but also those of the father support the rulings as to the law that governed the parties\u2019 custody proceedings in the Jaafarite Court in Lebanon. The father\u2019s expert \u201ctestified that custody in Lebanon is determined according to the \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 but that there is a presumption that it is in the best interest of male children [to] be in the custody of the mother until the age of two and after that, [that] they be in the custody of the father.\u201d A second expert testifying for the father stated, in response to a question regarding the mother\u2019s right to petition for custody in Lebanon, that \u201conce a male child reaches the age of two, the father is more entitled to custody.\u201d The mother\u2019s expert testified that \u201cin Lebanese Jaafarite Court, best interest for the child is being with the father after the age of two.\u201d The presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>may be rebutted only upon evidence of unfitness, such as that the father \u201cis a criminal, taking drugs, or incapable of caring for the child.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The father argues that the presumption could have been rebutted by the mother, had she sought custody in the Lebanese Jaa-farite Court on the basis that the father was disabled. He claims this would have \u201ctriggered an investigation into the fitness of the parents\u201d and a custody determination that would have applied a best interests standard. It was within the probate judge\u2019s discretion to credit some, but not all, of the testimony of the father\u2019s experts and to reject an expert\u2019s opinion, in whole or in part. See <em>Guardianship of Brandon, </em>424 Mass. 482, 499 (1997); <em>Dewan </em>v. <em>Dewan, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 135 (1991). The evidence presented in this case amply supports the judge\u2019s finding that it is not the relative fitness of the parents that is considered by the Jaafarite Court in Lebanon, but only the father\u2019s fitness, and if both parents are fit, then the father will be awarded custody. On this basis, the judge\u2019s conclusion was correct that no deference was due the Jaafarite Court custody decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The best interests of a child is the overarching principle that governs custody disputes in the Commonwealth. See <em>Custody of Kali, </em>439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003), and cases and authorities collected therein. \u201c[T]he touchstone inquiry of what is \u2018best for the child\u2019 is firmly rooted in American history, dating back to the Nineteenth Century.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>What is in a child\u2019s best interest depends upon the particular needs of the child, and is left largely to the discretion of the judge, who \u201cmay consider any factor pertinent to those interests.\u201d <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 529, 535 (2005). Thus, no case has set forth a definitive list of criteria that must be considered in determining what is in a child\u2019s best interest. However, some constants are revealed in our decisional law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Custody of Kali, supra </em>at 842 (it is in best interests of child to preserve \u201ccurrent placement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>with a parent, if it is a satisfactory one\u201d; \u201cstability and continuity with the child\u2019s primary caregiver is itself an important factor in a child\u2019s successful upbringing\u201d; it is a gender-neutral inquiry). Other factors that have been considered all focus on what is in the child\u2019s best interest. See, e.g., <em>Hersey </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>271 Mass. 545, 555 (1930) (parental fault does not override child\u2019s best interest; child happy and healthy in present home with half-brother and in care of her mother); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>326 Mass. 214, 217 (1950) (in deciding custody, judge could credit testimony \u201cas to the home in which the girl seemed to be happier\u201d); <em>Vilakazi </em>v. <em>Maxie, </em>371 Mass. 406, 409 (1976) (\u201cIn providing for the custody of a minor child, while the feelings and the wishes of the parents should not be disregarded, the happiness and the welfare of the child should be the controlling consideration\u201d), quoting from <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>304 Mass. 248, 250 (1939); <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>383 Mass. 232, 233 (1981) (discussing diverse religious practices of parents; overriding goal is to serve best interests of children even where \u201cattainment of that purpose may involve some limitation of the liberties\u201d of a parent); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Massa, </em>431 Mass. 619, 636 (2000) (consideration given to which parent \u201cwould more likely be able to make appropriate decisions to address the children\u2019s special needs\u201d); <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Puchalski, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 555, 557 (1980) (judge could consider that father\u2019s home not \u201ca settled home\u201d as child would be cared for by many different relatives); <em>Rolde </em>v. <em>Rolde, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 405 (1981) (that mother was \u201cprimary nurturing parent\u201d and \u201cprimary caretaker,\u201d and that children have \u201cstrongest bond\u201d with mother, were factors \u201chighly significant for the welfare of the children\u201d); <em>Bouchard </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>v. <em>Bouchard, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899-900 (1981) (findings should examine \u201crelative advantages of the respective parental environments\u201d and \u201cin what respects that environment has been helpful or detrimental to the child\u2019s well being\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">This is by no means an exhaustive list of all the factors that have been considered by our courts as relevant to a child\u2019s best interests, nor do we suggest which of these factors are appropriate to consider in any given case. We list them only to underscore our determination that, in the Commonwealth, as in most jurisdictions in the United States, the best interests analysis is a child-centered one that focuses on the specific needs and interests of a child and how these might best be met. The standard does not focus on \u201cpurely parental interests,\u201d <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 813, and significantly, it requires a gender-neutral analysis. See <em>Silvia </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 340-341 (1980) (Massachusetts comprehensive statutory scheme and common law regarding care and maintenance of minor children treats mother and father alike). See also <em>Custody of Kali, </em>439 Mass. at 842; Kindregan &amp; Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7\u00a7 47.1 &amp; 47.6 (3d ed. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The best interests analysis our courts employ is thus unlike the presumptive entitlement to custody that governed the custody proceeding in the Jaafarite Court in Lebanon. The custody judgment of that court is therefore not in substantial conformity with the laws of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">2. <em>Custody agreement as bar. </em>Our conclusion that the Lebanese Jaafarite Court would not have considered the children\u2019s best interests, as that standard is understood in the Commonwealth, also resolves the father\u2019s claim that the parties\u2019 agreement as to custody that was entered into in Lebanon bars the mother from seeking custody in the Probate and Family Court. Cf. <em>Vorontsova </em>v. <em>Waronzov, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 20, 25 n.11 (2009) (concluding there was no error in judge\u2019s refusal to recognize foreign nation\u2019s divorce certificate under doctrine of comity; noting support for proposition that court could consider whether circumstances warrant collateral attack on ground of fraud, even where it would not have been permitted in foreign nation).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The father claims on appeal that the probate judge erred in concluding that the mother was under duress when she entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>into the agreement. He argues that the mother was not under duress because she had other alternatives available to her in that she could have challenged the father\u2019s claim to custody and, at a hearing, the children\u2019s best interests would have been considered, which might have resulted in an award of custody to the mother. See note 15, <em>supra. </em>The father relies on <em>Khan </em>to support his claim that the custody agreement is a bar to seeking custody in the Probate and Family Court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In <em>Khan, </em>unlike the case before us, the law of Trinidad was determined to be in substantial conformity with our own in that \u201cTrinidad judges are bound by statute and case law to treat the welfare of the minor child as the paramount consideration in determining custody issues.\u201d 446 Mass. at <em>97.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That case did not, on appeal, raise any question of duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Here, the probate judge credited the mother\u2019s testimony that the parties had agreed to return to Lebanon for the purposes of obtaining a religious divorce there, and had agreed that the mother would receive custody of the children.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The judge also found, \u201cAlthough the Wife was represented in Lebanon and entered into an agreement regarding custody and visitation, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>credit her testimony that she did so only because she knew under the substantive law of that court, she could not obtain custody and was merely attempting to secure visitation.\u201d Finally, the judge concluded that under governing law in the Lebanese Jaafarite Court, the mother would not have been awarded custody of the sons after the age of two had she sought custody in that court. See discussion, <em>supra. </em>These subsidiary and ultimate findings and rulings support a determination that the mother\u2019s agreement to give guardianship of the children to the father was obtained under duress and was thus unenforceable. See <em>Cabot Corp. </em>v. <em>AVX Corp., </em>448 Mass. 629, 637 (2007) (\u201cIt is well established that a contract entered into under duress is voidable\u201d). To avoid enforcement of a contract, a contracting party may prevail on a theory of duress if she demonstrates \u201c(1) that one side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) that circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) that said circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637-638, quoting from <em>International Underwater Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 340, 342 (1979). Cf. <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>278 N.J. Super. 218, 222 (1994) (one-sided settlement agreement obtained in exchange for granting wife Jewish divorce was unenforceable as a product of duress); <em>Golding </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>176 A.D.2d 20, 21-24 (N.Y. 1992) (wife compelled to enter into agreement by husband\u2019s invocation of his power to refuse to give her a Jewish divorce).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">C. <em>Child support. </em>The father\u2019s assertion that the child support order is erroneous assumes (1) that the judgment that orders him to pay $1,840 per week is a scrivener\u2019s error, and that $184 is intended; and (2) that the judge\u2019s finding that the mother earns approximately $60,000 a year is not an error and requires a recalculation of the child support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">It is apparent from the judge\u2019s findings that he intended to order $184 in weekly child support. The findings state that the father should pay child support to the mother \u201cin the amount of $184.00 per week which is consistent with the child support guidelines.\u201d Thus, it is clear that the judgment contains a scrivener\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Regarding the mother\u2019s salary, the Child Support Guidelines worksheet that was before the probate judge is based on an an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>nual income of the mother in the amount of $45,290. Furthermore, even though the finding states that the mother \u201cearns approximately $60,000 per year,\u201d the findings also refer to the mother\u2019s financial statement, which reflects that the mother\u2019s current annual income is $45,284.20 per year \u2014 an amount consistent with the mother\u2019s paycheck. The $60,000 figure thus seems to be an error, but a harmless one. Apart from these two minor errors, the findings are sufficient and the judgment is presumptively correct under the Child Support Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">So much of the judgment as orders the father to pay $1,840 in weekly child support payments is to be modified to order the father to pay $184 in weekly child support payments. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">This was the mother\u2019s first marriage.

The judge noted that the mother\u2019s expert testified that \u201cfor a woman to obtain a divorce in the court which had jurisdiction over the parties in this case, she would have to prove that the husband committed a crime, abused her, or abandoned her but that a man can obtain a divorce whenever he wants.\u201d The mother\u2019s expert further testified that the mother only could obtain a divorce in a Jaafarite Court if the father agreed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">An earlier complaint for divorce was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In the instant action, the judge found that the marriage suffered an irretrievable breakdown within the Commonwealth during 2004. Thus, the jurisdictional requirements of G.

The probate judge made no findings regarding whether the mother ever changed her domicile from Massachusetts to Lebanon. It is uncontested, and the evidence supports a conclusion, that the mother was domiciled in the Commonwealth at least as of the date of commencement of the underlying divorce action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The father does not appeal from the judgment insofar as it divides the marital estate between the parties in a manner the judge determined to be \u201crelatively equal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Section 2 of G.

On these factors the scale tips in favor of the mother. The parties and their children are United States citizens, and at the time the father filed reconciliation and guardianship actions in the Jaafarite Court, the only residence of the parties as an intact married couple, and the only home the children ever had known, was in the Commonwealth.

So far as appears from the trial court record, that claim was advanced only in the father\u2019s proposed conclusions of law and is there undeveloped by argument or citation to relevant authority. He relies in his brief on <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>406 Mass. 88, 90-91 (1989), and <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Gala, </em>66 Mass.
