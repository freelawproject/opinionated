For this injury, O\u2019Connell was awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35. The insurer, Peerless Insurance Co., acknowledged liability but contested the amount that O\u2019Connell was due. An administrative judge (AJ) at the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) awarded O\u2019Connell specified benefits that were based on his determination of the \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d that she earned at the salon. In the only issue before us on appeal, O\u2019Connell argues that the AJ erred by not including in her wages the tips that she received from her customers. The AJ refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>to do so, because she did not report the tips for tax purposes. We conclude that the AJ did not err in disregarding that income.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><em>Background. </em>O\u2019Connell worked at the salon on a part-time basis. The employer paid her an hourly wage of $6.75 (the minimum wage), plus additional compensation based on the amount of work she performed. In this manner, O\u2019Connell received an average of about $227 per week directly from her employer, which worked out to slightly more than $11 per hour. The AJ used this figure as her average weekly wage, and on this basis he awarded \u00a7 34 benefits of $136.51 per week for the four-month period she was totally incapacitated, and \u00a7 35 benefits of $102.38 for the two-month period she was partially incapacitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">At an evidentiary hearing, O\u2019Connell asserted \u2014 and the employer did not contest \u2014 that she regularly received tips from her customers. She specifically testified that she received total tips ranging from twenty-five to sixty-five dollars per day, and that her tips averaged forty-five dollars per day. While the insurer did not affirmatively concede the amount of O\u2019Connell\u2019s tips, neither did it challenge her figures (in cross-examination or otherwise). Instead, the insurer focused on whether O\u2019Connell had reported such tips for tax purposes, either to the employer or to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">For purposes of this appeal, the insurer has established that O\u2019Connell did not report her tip income directly to the IRS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, it is uncontested that O\u2019Connell never formally reported her tip income to her employer in the manner contemplated by Federal law. However, she asserts that the employer nevertheless had actual knowledge of the amount of her tip income because of the particular system that the employer used at the salon to collect and distribute tips. Specifically, when a customer tipped an employee, the tip was placed into a box labeled with that employee\u2019s name and the amount was recorded on paper. This was to occur regardless of whether the tip was given to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>person at the front desk or to the hair stylist directly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the end of each day, the employer would tally up the tips received for each employee and distribute the money accordingly. According to the employer, this procedure was to help ensure that the cash register balanced. At the end of each day, the employer would discard its informal tallies, and it thus kept no permanent record of each employee\u2019s tip income.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The AJ concluded that O\u2019Connell forfeited her right to have her tip income included within her \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d by failing to report her tips for tax purposes. He relied on an administrative ruling by the DIA\u2019s reviewing board, see <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Captain Parker Pub, </em>11 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 84 (1997) <em>(Dawson), </em>and he offered his view that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">\u201cas in <em>Dawson, </em>I find that the Employee cannot have it both ways and should bear the burden of her failure to report her tip income rather than the Insurer, whose interest in the accurate setting of rates for the Employer, based on actual income information, is undeniably thwarted by the Employee\u2019s omission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The reviewing board summarily affirmed the AJ\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201c[I]n cases of summary affirmance of a decision of the administrative judge by the board, the reviewing court is inspecting the findings and reasoning of the administrative judge.\u201d <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 306, 313 (2007), citing <em>Coggin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 587 (1997). Because the AJ relied on the reviewing board\u2019s earlier ruling in <em>Dawson, </em>our review of the AJ\u2019s decision will necessarily require us to consider the reasoning that the reviewing board employed there. We begin, however, by reviewing the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s seminal case on the treatment of tip income, <em>Powers\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 515 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">In <em>Powers\u2019s Case, </em>the court held that tip income generally should be included in an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d for purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation act. However, that case did not squarely address whether tip income should still be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>included if the employee did not report the amount of that income to her employer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In any event, even to the extent that <em>Powers\u2019s Case </em>can be read as suggesting that tip income should be included regardless of whether it was in fact reported, that would not resolve the issue before us, because \u2014 as discussed further below \u2014 the key statutory language at the heart of this dispute was not enacted until much later.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The workers\u2019 compensation act does not directly address whether unreported tip income should be considered in setting benefits. However, the unemployment insurance act does do so through a provision enacted in 1976. Specifically, that statute states that cash tips are to be included as \u201cwages\u201d \u201conly in the amount reported by the employee to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a) of the Federal Internal Revenue Code.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(,s')(A)(6), as inserted by St. 1990, c. 154, \u00a7 5. The AJ placed great reliance upon this definition in reaching his con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>elusion that unreported tips should be disregarded in determining workers\u2019 compensation benefits, as did the reviewing board in <em>Dawson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Even though <em>Dawson </em>is an administrative decision that is not binding on this court, O\u2019Connell does not claim that <em>Dawson </em>was wrongly decided. Instead, O\u2019Connell argues only that <em>Dawson </em>should be applied narrowly. She argues that the key question should not be whether the tip income was reported for tax purposes, but instead whether an employer had sufficient knowledge of the tip income to allow its insurer to accurately determine insurance rates (the concern identified by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Powers\u2019s Case, </em>see note 3, <em>supra). </em>Under the particular facts present here, O\u2019Connell asserts that the employer had actual knowledge of how much each employee received in tips each day, even though the employer chose to discard this information at the end of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">There is some force behind O\u2019Connell\u2019s argument. First, to the extent that the animating concern is the inability to set accurate insurance rates, the fact that the employer here actually had access to the amount of tip income each employee was earning goes at least part of the way to satisfying that concern. Second, although the AJ\u2019s observation that the employee was trying to \u201chave it both ways\u201d is undeniably true, the same can be said of the employer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, it is not our job to weigh such competing policy considerations; instead, that role falls to the Legislature and, to the extent the Legislature delegates the issue, to the DIA. The narrow issue before us is whether the reviewing board\u2019s interpretation of the DIA\u2019s legislative charge is a reasonable one. See <em>Provencal </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Health Ins. Connector Authy., </em>456 Mass. 506, 514 (2010) (\u201csubstantial deference\u201d owed to agency\u2019s interpretation of statute it administers). We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The workers\u2019 compensation act and the unemployment insurance act provide parallel worker protection schemes. Both are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>designed to provide workers benefits when their ability to work is limited, the first by injury, and the second by economic conditions. See <em>Bradley\u2019s Case, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 359, 362 n.5 (2002). There was no error in the reviewing board\u2019s looking to the legislative definition of \u201cwages\u201d in G. L. c. 151A for guidance in interpreting G. L. c. 152. In fact, the Supreme Judicial Court has expressly approved doing just that. See <em>Borofsky\u2019s Case, </em>411 Mass. 379, 380 (1991) (relying in part on the definition of \u201cwages\u201d in G. L. c. 151 A, in affirming a decision of the reviewing board excluding health insurance benefits from an employee\u2019s \u201cearnings\u201d for purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation act).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See generally <em>Boswell </em>v. <em>Zephyr Lines, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 241, 247 (1993) (noting that courts should look to related statutes for interpretive guidance). In sum, where the Legislature has prohibited the consideration of tip income in determining unemployment benefits unless such income has formally been reported to the employer in accordance with Federal tax law, we discern no error in the reviewing board\u2019s decision to treat such income in the same manner for purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">\n<em>Order of the Department of Industrial Accidents Reviewing Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Although O\u2019Connell testified that she \u201cbelieve[d]\u2019\u2019 that she had reported her tips to the IRS, she acknowledged that she did not \u201cknow\u201d this, and she did not bring a copy of any tax documents that could have proven her contention. The AJ found her testimony on this point not credible, and the employee does not challenge that finding on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\">At oral argument, the insurer expressed skepticism about the extent to which hair stylists put into the box any cash tips they received directly from customers. However, this point was never developed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In <em>Powers\u2019s Case, </em>the insurer had argued that tips should not be included in the calculation of \u201caverage weekly wage,\u201d because the employer would have no knowledge of how much tip income the employee received, and this in turn prevented the accurate setting of insurance rates. The court acknowledged this potential problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">\u201cSome difficulty may arise in fixing the rate of insurance to be charged by the insurer to the employer over that existing in cases where the payroll of the employer discloses all the earnings of the employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 520. However, the court ultimately rejected this as a basis for concluding that tips should not be included, stating that the potential problem \u201ccannot affect the principle.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court added that: \u201cThe employee, a part of whose earnings comes from tips received in consequence of his service to the employer, is bound to make full disclosure for the propose of enabling just insurance rates to be fixed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>By this last sentence, it is not clear if the court was saying that employees could be expected to comply with their reporting obligations so that the potential difficulties would not materialize, or that the problem would be addressed by making the employee\u2019s reporting his tip income a precondition to his receiving credit for it. The court\u2019s opinion does not state whether the employee there \u2014 who ultimately received the benefit of the higher wage calculation \u2014 did in fact report her tips. <em>Powers\u2019s Case </em>therefore does not definitively resolve how unreported tip income should be treated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Section 6053(a) mandates that employees who receive tips of the sort at issue in this case \u201cshall report all such tips in one or more written statements furnished to his employer on or before the 10th day following such month. Such statements shall be furnished by the employee under such regulations, at such other times before such 10th day, and in such form and manner, as may be prescribed by the Secretary [of the Treasury].\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6053(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Although the employer knew that its employees were earning tip income and in fact determined each day how much tip income each employee earned that day, the employer was apparently happy to ignore such income unless the employees formally reported it (all the while presumably enjoying lower insurance rates and smaller tax obligations for the employer share of Federal or State taxes).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\">As the court in <em>Borofsky\u2019s Case </em>noted, G. L. c. 152 expressly incorporates some aspects of G. L. c. 151A by reference. Specifically, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(9), added by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 13, an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage in the commonwealth\u201d is to be \u201cdetermined according to the provisions of subsection (a) of section twenty-nine of chapter one hundred and fifty-one A.\u201d In <em>Dawson, </em>the reviewing board made a suggestion that this cross-reference necessarily imports into G. L. c. 152, the definition of \u201cwage\u201d included in G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 l(s)(A)(6) (in which case the board would be required to exclude unreported tip income from \u201cwages\u201d). <em>Dawson, </em>11 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. at 86. However, <em>Borofsky\u2019s Case </em>does <em>not </em>treat the c. 151A definition of \u201cwage\u201d as being directly incorporated into c. 152; instead, the case notably highlights that the scope of c. 151 A, \u00a7 29(a), is limited to \u201cthe method of computing the average weekly benefits and [that it] does not identify the variables considered when computing that average.\u201d <em>Borofsky\u2019s Case, </em>411 Mass. at 380. In any event, <em>Dawson </em>makes plain the reviewing board\u2019s view that unreported tip income should be excluded regardless of whether the board is bound to that conclusion. The question whether the board has discretion to treat such income in a different manner is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
