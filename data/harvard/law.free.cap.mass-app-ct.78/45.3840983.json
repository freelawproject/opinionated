Officer Keith Strange of the Framingham police department is a member of that department\u2019s \u201cTruck Team,\u201d which is charged with enforcing both Federal and State commercial vehicle regulations. As required for that assignment, Officer Strange has been certified as an inspector by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), a division of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Officer Strange\u2019s duties include performing administrative safety inspections of commercial vehicles. Consistent with his training, Officer Strange\u2019s selection of a vehicle for inspection does not require him first to observe an infraction. Rather, he identifies and randomly selects a commercial motor vehicle, makes a stop, and conducts an administrative safety inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">On March 10, 2009, Officer Strange was in the parking lot of a vacant restaurant performing administrative safety inspections. He observed a large, two-axle dump truck, operated by the defendant, traveling on Concord Street, a public way in Framingham. Believing it to weigh over 10,000 pounds, therefore qualifying it as a commercial vehicle under Federal and State regulations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he signaled the defendant to pull into the parking lot. He then left his police cruiser, approached the driver (later identified as the defendant), and requested that he hand over his license, medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>certificate and the registration of the truck. The defendant was unable to provide a valid commercial driver\u2019s license and informed the officer it had been revoked. He was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a suspended license in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The statutory basis of the above described inspection is contained in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 19L(a), which provides for the adoption of regulations to ensure compliance by interstate and intrastate motor carriers with State and Federal laws, including \u201cregulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, contained in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>Under Mass.R.Crim.P. 34, we may, prior to a trial, answer questions of law that are \u201cof importance to the general public, or questions of substantial significance which have not previously been considered by the [United States] Supreme Court or by either of the appellate courts of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bankert, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 118, 120 (2006), quoting from Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2213 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Here, the defendant claims that police use of random stops, not based on any reasonable suspicion of a violation of an administrative regulation, to effect warrantless administrative safety inspections of commercial vehicles, violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. That precise question has not been addressed in our decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The question is, however, materially controlled by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tart, </em>408 Mass. 249 (1990), in which the court, applying the three-part analysis of the United States Supreme Court in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. 691, 702-703 (1987), upheld the constitutionality of warrantless administrative inspections of commercial fishing vessels.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In <em>Tart, </em>the court concluded that (1) the Commonwealth has a \u201csubstantial interest\u201d in regulating the fishing industry; (2) the \u201cmobile nature\u201d of fishing vessels and the limited opportunities of the Commonwealth to ensure regulatory compliance rendered \u201cunannounced, even frequent, inspections . . . essential\u201d; and (3) the statute allowing for administrative inspections provides a \u201cconstitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant,\u201d in that commercial fishermen are on notice both of the permitting requirement and of the statutory basis for inspection, the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of which is clear and narrowly defined. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tart, supra </em>at 254-256.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We think that the analyses in <em>Tart </em>and <em>Burger </em>apply as well in the context of administrative safety inspections of closely regulated commercial transport vehicles. The Commonwealth\u2019s regulation of the trucking industry presents nearly identical challenges to effective regulatory enforcement of the fishing industry discussed in <em>Tart, supra. </em>The defendant does not contest that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in the regulatory scheme is substantial. Section 19L of G. L. c. 90 seeks to enforce the State and Federal regulations that will ensure safe operation of interstate and intrastate commercial vehicles on the public ways of the Commonwealth, by inspection of documents that reflect that the operator is properly licensed and able to operate the vehicle safely, by inspection of documents pertaining to the vehicle, and the vehicle itself, to determine that the vehicle is properly maintained and its cargo is safely carried. The statute furthers the Commonwealth\u2019s substantial interest in protecting from harm those who travel on or near its ways. See, e.g. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>356 F.3d 130, 135 (1st Cir. 2004) (\u201cthe interstate trucking industry is regulated extensively by both [F]ederal and [S]tate agencies. Federal regulations alone cover such things as drivers\u2019 qualifications, drivers\u2019 hours of service, inspection, repair and maintenance of trucks, vehicle parts and accessories, reporting of accidents, recording of itineraries, safe handling of cargo, transportation of hazardous materials, and a myriad of other issues\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The defendant does not contest that warrantless inspections are necessary to further that regulatory scheme. Instead, the defendant argues that, unlike in <em>Tart, </em>the statute and regulations at issue here fail to provide a constitutionally adequate substitute for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>warrant, in that they do not meaningfully limit the time, place, or frequency of inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Under <em>Tart </em>and <em>Burger, </em>whether a statute or regulation provides an adequate substitute for a warrant turns on whether it satisfactorily performs \u201cthe two basic functions of a warrant: it must advise the owner of the commercial premises that the search is being made pursuant to the law and has a properly defined scope, and it must limit the discretion of the inspecting officers.\u201d <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. at 703. \u201c[I]n defining how a statute limits the discretion of the inspectors, ... it must be \u2018carefully limited in time, place, and scope.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biswell, </em>406 U.S. 311, 315 (1972). Accord <em>Tart, supra </em>at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 136,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the court concluded that the regulations now before us satisfied that standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201cThe carefully delineated scope of the [F]ederal regulations suitably cabins the discretion of the enforcing officer. Moreover, the regulations themselves give ample notice to interstate tmckers that inspections will be made on a regular basis. To cinch matters, commercial drivers are required by law to be familiar with the applicable regulations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The First Circuit\u2019s analysis and conclusions in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maldonado </em>are persuasive. Among other things, the applicable regulations limit who may perform inspections (licensed FMCSA agents), which vehicles may be inspected (commercial vehicles), when they may be inspected (vehicles in operation), and what items may be inspected (e.g., license, registration, drug and alcohol testing records, hazardous materials records). See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 19L; 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 396.9(a) and (b) (2009). The statutory and regulatory scheme informs any operator of interstate or intrastate motor carriers operating on the public ways of the Commonwealth that he or she may be required to produce a license. The scope of the inspection is narrowly defined and its sole purpose is to ensure that operators have proper documentation and their vehicles are being safely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>operated. \u201cTherefore, the discretion of the inspector is limited.\u201d <em>Tart, </em>408 Mass, at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The defendant additionally argues that, even if constitutionally sound, an administrative safety inspection may not be initiated, as it was in this case, by a random, suspicionless traffic stop. The text of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 396.9(a) specifically provides for inspections by FMCSA-certified officers of \u201cvehicles <em>in operation </em>and intermodal equipment <em>in </em>operation\u201d (emphasis added). This language authorizes suspicionless stops of commercial vehicles in operation for the sole purpose of performing administrative inspections. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>153 N.H. 399, 403 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hewitt, </em>400 N.J. Super. 376, 384-386 (2008); <em>McCauley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 150, 152-156 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Indeed, restrictions of the nature suggested by the defendant would render meaningless the enforcement needs of this particular regulatory scheme. \u201cTrucks operate twenty-four hours a day and the officers must, necessarily, have the authority to conduct these administrative inspections at any time.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dominguez-Prieto, </em>923 F.2d 464, 470 (6th Cir. 1991). Accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>545 F.3d 1195, 1203 n.7 (9th Cir. 2008), cert, denied, 129 S. Ct. 1383 (2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>569 F.3d 355, 356-357 (8th Cir. 2009).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">We also reject the argument that an administrative inspection in the context of a highly regulated industry that is conducted pursuant to the FMCSA regulations is analogous to the arbitrary selection of vehicles at a sobriety checkpoint, which is prohibited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>454 Mass. 318, 323 (2009). In such cases, we are concerned with constitutionally protected privacy concerns of ordinary citizens and not the attenuated expectation of privacy that accompanies pervasive government regulation of an industry. See <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. at 700; <em>Tart, supra </em>at 253-254.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Accordingly, our answer to the reported question is: No. The random stop of a commercial vehicle for the purpose of conducting an administrative safety inspection, pursuant to which the defendant was requested to produce his license, was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-14\">This case comes to us in an unusual posture. The case was reported without findings of fact by the motion judge; the record does not contain the motion judge\u2019s report framing the legal question or a copy of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Because the parties are in substantial agreement as to the relevant legal question and the essential factual predicate, we decide the question in the interest of judicial economy. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>431 Mass. 188, 193 n.9 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">No argument is made that the inspection violated the defendant\u2019s rights under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The certification required, inter alia, completion of a two-week training program provided by the State police, demonstration that two written examinations administered by DOT had been passed, and participation in a field training program that, as testified to by Officer Strange, \u201cincluded thirty-two Level 1 inspections. ... A Level 1 inspection is a complete inspection of both the driver and the commercial motor vehicle. We do everything from checking driver credentials, logbook, license, medical certificate and so on. Upon doing that we then start on the commercial motor vehicle.

Finally, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shaefer, Michael &amp; Clairton Siag, Inc., 637 </em>F.2d 200 (3d Cir. 1980), involved a stop that was pretextual. See note 10, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The defendant expressed concern that, by upholding the constitutionality of suspicionless administrative traffic stops, the door might be opened to pretextual stops that have as their target, for example, illegal immigrants. Nothing in this record provides a basis for the defendant\u2019s concerns. Thus, the question we are asked to answer does not implicate any allegation of false pretenses or pretext. We note that \u201can administrative search may not be used as a subterfuge to avoid the burden of establishing probable cause to support criminal investigative search.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bizarria, </em>31 Mass.
