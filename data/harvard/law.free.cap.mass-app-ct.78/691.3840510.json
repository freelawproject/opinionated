Realty Trust (trust), and Woodhaven Realty Company. The Niininens complained that they had leased residential premises in Lexington from the trust from 1998 to 2000, during which time they were exposed to mold. The family was required to vacate the premises and stay in a hotel, and claimed $14,000 in damages in addition to medical expenses. The complaint was served on the trust on December 7, 2001. Later that month, Vermont Mutual Insurance Group (Vermont Mutual), the parent company of Northern Security Insurance Company, Inc. (Northern Security), sent a reservation of rights letter to the trust noting that the trust was only covered for one of the counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter failed to inform the trust at that time that it could retain its own counsel for which the insurance company would be required to pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In response, the trust rejected representation with the reservation of rights, and subsequently retained attorney William J. Dailey, Jr., of Sloane and Walsh, LLP (Sloane &amp; Walsh). Dailey and the trust agreed that Dailey would be paid $225 per hour. This rate was unusually low for Dailey,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but he agreed to it because his friends and neighbors were members of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Throughout his defense, Dailey provided status reports to Northern Security, keeping it abreast of the developments in the case, and mailed two bills reflecting the rate of $225. The first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>bill was sent in April, 2002, but was not paid until June, 2003. In addition to the inordinate delay in paying the bill, the amount paid was at a rate of $150 per hour.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In October, 2003, Dailey settled the underlying suit for $75,000, apparently an excellent result given the original demand of $650,000. In June, 2004, Sloane &amp; Walsh sent a G. L. c. 93A demand letter to Vermont Mutual seeking the balance between its rate of $225 and Northern Security\u2019s rate of $150. In July, 2004, Northern Security responded, denying any c. 93A violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">At issue, initially, was $12,860, the difference between the bill Sloane &amp; Walsh submitted and what Northern Security paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\"><em>The legal proceedings. </em>On October 22, 2004, Northern Security filed an action seeking a judgment declaring its rights, duties, liabilities, and obligations under the policy of insurance. Specifically, Northern Security asked the Superior Court judge to determine what constituted reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for the services rendered by Sloane &amp; Walsh in defending the trust. Sloane &amp; Walsh answered and brought a counterclaim against Northern Security alleging breach of contract as a third-party beneficiary, violations of G. L. c. 93A, and unjust enrichment or quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Sloane &amp; Walsh also filed a motion on the pleadings seeking partial judgment that $225, not $150, per hour was the market rate for someone of attorney Dailey\u2019s abilities. In January, 2006, the motion judge ruled that \u201c$225 per hour is per se reasonable as an hourly fee for an attorney in the Boston Metropolitan area.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response to the motion judge\u2019s ruling, in April, 2006, Sloane &amp; Walsh sent a second c. 93A demand letter to Northern Security\u2019s counsel offering to dismiss the case if Northern Security agreed to pay the amount that the judge determined to be the minimum fee due. Northern Security never responded notwithstanding having received advice, even prior to the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>decision, from its corporate counsel and its branch office claims manager that $225 an hour was a reasonable fee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sloane &amp; Walsh then filed a supplemental counterclaim, seeking an additional violation of c. 93A against Northern Security for failure to respond to its demand letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Trial was later held before a different judge, who ruled that the fair and reasonable hourly rate for services rendered by Dai-ley was $350 per hour and ordered Northern Security to pay that amount. The judge also found that Northern Security violated c. 93A and awarded Sloane &amp; Walsh its attorney\u2019s fees. In finding the c. 93A violation, the judge explained that Northern Security could not reasonably or plausibly have believed that it did not have to pay Sloane &amp; Walsh at a rate of $225 after the previous judge\u2019s ruling and after Northern Security\u2019s counsel and its claims manager opined that Northern Security would probably have to pay that amount.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge also noted that Northern Security\u2019s failure to respond to Sloane &amp; Walsh\u2019s April 18, 2006, settlement offer demonstrated an unfair settlement practice in that it demonstrated Northern Security\u2019s failure to negotiate. The judge ruled, however, that Northern Security\u2019s violations were not so egregious as to require punitive damages. All remaining claims and counterclaims were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Northern Security appeals, claiming error by (1) the motion judge in ruling that $225 per hour was per se reasonable; (2) the trial judge in finding a c. 93A, \u00a7 11, violation where Northern Security had a rational basis to pay $150 per hour; and (3) the trial judge in not capping the award at a maximum of $225 per hour. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cWhen an insurer seeks to defend its insured under a reservation of rights, and the insured is unwilling that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>insurer do so, the insured may require the insurer either to relinquish its reservation of rights or relinquish its defense of the insured and reimburse the insured for its defense costs.\u201d <em>Herbert </em>A. <em>Sullivan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 387, 406-407 (2003). In such an instance, the insurer must pay the reasonable charges of the insured\u2019s retained counsel. <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>346 Mass. 677, 685 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The issue thus boils down to the reasonableness of the amount of the fee paid ($150) versus the fee demanded ($225). Northern Security\u2019s rationale for the $150 rate was that it reflected what it paid its panel attorneys; indeed, the rate was ten dollars more than Northern Security\u2019s highest rate. The problem with this position, in the view of the trial judge, was his belief that the insured was entitled to have a reasonable fee paid, based on market rather than panel rates. Panel rates, the judge correctly observed, often reflect, first, what Northern Security was able to bargain for as a large insurance company handling various cases involving many attorneys, who presumably wish to continue receiving referrals; and second, the justifiable interest of a company such as Northern Security to keep its legal costs down, especially in routine cases, which may be at odds with an insured\u2019s desire to pay more for legal representation in the hope of minimizing legal exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Here, the evidence was overwhelming in support of the $225 rate. An expert opined that the figure was not only \u201cextremely reasonable\u201d but also \u201cremarkable\u201d given attorney Dailey\u2019s abilities and reputation. Dailey himself testified that his normal fee for reservation of rights cases was $385 per hour.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, as Northern Security \u201ccould have included in the [policy] explicit provisions concerning the cost of defence in various situations . . . , we think that uncertainty should be resolved against the insurer.\u201d <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>346 Mass. at 685.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Finding no fault with the above rulings of the trial judge, we now turn to whether he was justified in holding that Northern Security\u2019s offer to pay the $150 rate was a violation of c. 93A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Northern Security claims that since it had a rational basis upon which to pay its suggested rate, the judge\u2019s c. 93A finding was unwarranted. It further asserts that it filed for declaratory judgment to rule on that precise point.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We need not detail at length the well-known principles covering violations of c. 93A, \u00a7 11, other than noting that unfairness is determined from an examination of all the pertinent circumstances. <em>Duclersaint </em>v. <em>Federal Natl. Mort. Assn., </em>427 Mass. 809, 814 (1998). Ordinarily, \u201ca good faith dispute as to whether money is owed, or performance of some kind is due, is not the stuff of which a c. 93A claim is made.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Mere nonpayment of a debt normally does not justify finding c. 93A liability. <em>Community Builders </em>v. <em>Indian Motocycle Assocs., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 537, 559 (1998). However, other additional conduct may lend support to finding a c. 93A violation. <em>Id. </em>at 557-558 (\u201cdefendants . . . withheld payment unconscionably, stringing [plaintiff] along in performing more services, but refusing substantial payments, all with a purpose of coercing [plaintiff] to settle for substantially less compensation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Here, Northern Security unnecessarily and unreasonably delayed payment for fourteen months despite acknowledging that, while it asserted that it did not owe the hourly fee of $225, it owed at least $150.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, it did not pay the undisputed and reasonable court expenses, e.g., court reporters and experts, thereby placing Sloane &amp; Walsh in a precarious position in defending the case; it refused to negotiate, as demonstrated by its failure to respond to Sloane &amp; Walsh\u2019s efforts to resolve the matter<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; it disregarded advice from its own counsel and claims manager<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; and, based on Dailey\u2019s testimony regarding Northern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Security\u2019s past practices, it intentionally delayed payment of its bills in the hope of unfairly securing an advantageous financial outcome.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Lastly, Dailey appeared to have achieved an excellent resolution of the underlying case. All in all, while close, in taking all of these factors together, the judge was justified in finding a violation of c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\"><em>The award of a $350 per hour fee. </em>Ordinarily, the question what constitutes reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is left to the sound discretion of the judge. <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Linnane, </em>434 Mass. 301, 302-303 (2001). Judicial discretion in this regard is guided by several factors, including \u201cthe nature of the case and the issues presented, the time and labor required, the amount of damages involved, the result obtained, the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney, the usual price charged for similar services by other attorneys in the same area, and the amount of awards in similar cases.\u201d <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388-389 (1979). \u201cNo one factor is determinative, and a factor-by-factor analysis ... is not required.\u201d <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Linnane, supra </em>at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The judge found that the $350 per hour fee was reasonable and that Northern Security should be required to pay Sloane &amp; Walsh that fee. If nothing else were in the record, our inquiry would end there. However, detrimentally to Sloane &amp; Walsh, it had agreed upon a fee with its client in the amount of $225 per hour. If no third party were involved and the trust failed to pay the agreed upon fee, suit would be brought seeking that amount. \u201cCompensation is that amount of money that reasonably will make the injured party whole. Compensatory damages may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>exceed this amount. Anything beyond that amount is a windfall. . . . General Laws c. 93A, consistent with this principle, states that \u2018recovery shall be in the amount of actual damages.\u2019 See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9(3) and 11, fifth par.\u201d <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demou-las, </em>433 Mass. 1, 15 (2000). Because Northern Security\u2019s obligation was to protect and indemnify the trust against its losses, Northern Security\u2019s liability for attorney\u2019s fees should not exceed the amount of fees the trust in fact incurred.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The matter is remanded to ascertain the amount of damages, with interest, based on a rate of $225 per hour, plus attorney\u2019s fees. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. Finally, Sloane &amp; Walsh having prevailed on the c. 93A count, its request for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs is allowed. <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10-11 (2004). Sloane &amp; Walsh is to file, within fourteen days, its request for fees. Northern Security shall then have seven days to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Representation with a reservation of rights \u201cpermit[s] the insurer to assume the defense of the claim against the policyholder without waiving, surrendering, or losing the right to contend that the claim is not subject to indemnity under the policy.\u201d Fischer, Insurer or Policyholder Control of the Defense and the Duty to Fund Settlements, 2 Nev.

While claims under \u00a7 11 that concern the rights of those who engage in the conduct of a trade or business do not incorporate violations of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3, as does c. 93A, \u00a7 9, <em>Jet Line Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass. 706, 717 n.11 (1989), a judge may nonetheless rely on a c. 176D violation as evidence of an unfair business practice under \u00a7 11. <em>R.W.

Co., </em>417 Mass. 115, 122 n.5 (1994), but it was still compelled to offer sufficient evidence of the reasonableness of its $150 fee rate. This it failed to do. Indeed, the judge in his findings outlined cases in which he noted comparable hourly fees of $345, $325, $275, $320 to $325, and $350. It appears that little, if any, credible evidence was offered indicating a justification of the $150 rate other than, \u201cThat\u2019s what we pay our panel attorneys.\u201d The judge in this case was free to find such evidence lacking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">As noted, Northern Security here delayed payment of undisputed bills.
