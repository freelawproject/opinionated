The indictment alleges that the defendant violated various subsections of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, by knowingly having in his possession, or knowingly having under his control in a vehicle, firearms or ammunition. During pretrial hearings, several questions of law arose which the judge determined to be material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>to the ultimate decision, and the resolution of which would be necessary in order to conduct a fair trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">With the consent of the Commonwealth and the defendant, the judge reported the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201c1. Whether G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a) requires proof that a defendant \u2018carried\u2019 a firearm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201c2. Whether satisfaction of the firearm identification card exception set out in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(/), by itself, satisfies the firearm possession exemption set out in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a)(4)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\u201c3. Whether satisfaction of the firearm identification card exception set out in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(/) is a defense for a violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(ra)?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The judge included a summary of the essential facts as alleged by the Commonwealth and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The Commonwealth alleges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">\u201c[i]n late February, 2007, the defendant drove from his home in Georgia to Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, where his girlfriend, Lauren Satterfield, was a student. The defendant stayed in the dormitory room Sat-terfield shared with Rachel Gorman. On or about February 26, 2007, the defendant\u2019s car was towed to a private lot at the order of the college public safety department. On or about February 27, 2007, the defendant borrowed Gor-man\u2019s car and drove to the lot where his car was being stored. He transferred some of his belongings to Gorman\u2019s car and drove back to the campus. Among the items placed in Gorman\u2019s car were a number of weapons the defendant had brought from Georgia, including a handgun, a shotgun, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>and a rifle. When Gorman learned that the weapons now were in her car, Gorman protested. The defendant returned to the lot and transferred the weapons back to his car. On or about March 3, 2007, the defendant was trespassed <em>[sic] </em>from the campus and moved to a hotel in Hadley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\u201cOn or about March 5, 2007, Gorman reported this information to the public safety department. On March 8, 2008, the defendant\u2019s car was search[ed] pursuant to a warrant. Amongst the property seized was the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">- .45 caliber pistol with 2 high capacity magazines</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">- 12 ga. shotgun</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">- .308 caliber semi-automatic rifle with 4 high capacity magazines</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">- 76 rounds \u2014 pellet-type shotgun ammunition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">- 1494 rounds, .308 caliber full metal jacket ammunition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">\u201cThe shot gun was loaded with two rounds of ammunition.\u201d The defendant alleges that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">\u201che arrived in South Hadley on February 26, 2007 and that his car was towed within hours of his arrival, that he intended to stay in Massachusetts, and that he was in the process of seeking an apartment at the time of his arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">\n<em>Question one: \u201cWhether G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a) requires proof that a defendant \u2018carried\u2019 a firearm?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">The first question reported was answered in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 150 (2008). In <em>Duncan, </em>this court determined that \u201c[t]o establish the defendant\u2019s] guilt of unlawful possession of a firearm under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant (1) knowingly (2) had in [his] possession (3) a firearm (4) without a license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153. In setting forth the elements of the statute, this court noted that the word \u201ccarries\u201d was removed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), in a 1990 amendment, and \u201c[s]ince the time of that amendment, \u00a7 10(a) has simply prohibited the knowing possession of a firearm without a license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153 n.4, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>449 Mass. 207, 225-226, cert, denied, 552 U.S. 1079 (2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The answer to question one is \u201cno,\u201d G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), does not require proof that a defendant \u201ccarried\u201d a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\n<em>Question two: \u201cWhether satisfaction of the firearm identification card exception set out in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(j), by itself, satisfies the firearm possession exemption set out in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a)(4)?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), a person must either possess a valid license, or qualify for one of the exemptions to the licensing requirements, in order to \u201cknowingly ha[ve] in his possession; or knowingly ha[ve] under his control in a vehicle[,]\u201d a firearm within the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The language at issue here is the provision contained in \u00a7 10(a)(4) which exempts those who have \u201ccomplied with the provisions of sections one hundred and twenty-nine C and one hundred and thirty-one G of chapter one hundred and forty[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 129C, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cNo person, other than a licensed dealer or one who has been issued a license to carry a pistol or revolver or an exempt person as hereinafter described, shall own or possess any firearm, rifle, shotgun or ammunition unless he has been issued a firearm identification card by the licensing authority pursuant to the provisions of section one hundred and twenty-nine B.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Exempt persons, uses, and circumstances are defined in subsections <em>(a) </em>through (w) inclusive. Subsection (/) of \u00a7 129C provides a sixty-day grace period for certain persons, temporarily exempting them from the requirements of \u00a7 129C.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We must determine whether the exemption for new and returning residents contained in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(/), by itself, satisfies the firearm exemption contained in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The Commonwealth argues that the firearm exemption set out in \u00a7 10(a)(4) is to be read literally, and thus applies only to persons who have complied with the provisions of both \u201csections one hundred and twenty-nine C <em>and </em>one hundred and thirty-one G of chapter one hundred and forty\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (emphasis added). We do not agree with this contention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">\u201cAny person who is not a resident of the commonwealth may carry a pistol or revolver in or through the commonwealth for the purpose of taking part in a pistol or revolver competition or attending any meeting or exhibition of any organized group of firearm collectors or for the purpose of hunting; provided, that such person is a resident of the United States and has a permit or license to carry firearms issued under the laws of any state, district or territory thereof which has licensing requirements which prohibit the issuance of permits or licenses to persons who have been convicted of a felony or who have been convicted of the unlawful use, possession or sale of narcotic or harmful drugs; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>provided, further, that in the case of a person traveling in or through the commonwealth for the purpose of hunting, he has on his person a hunting or sporting license issued by the commonwealth or by the state of his destination. Police officers and other peace officers of any state, territory or jurisdiction within the United States duly authorized to possess firearms by the laws thereof shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have a permit or license to carry firearms as described in this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>398 Mass. 135 (1986), answered a similar reported question. A District Court judge asked the court: \u201cCan a person who possesses <em>and carries </em>a firearm on his person or under his control in a vehicle without a license be convicted [of violating G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a) (1984 ed.)] where that person is a \u2018new resident\u2019 within the meaning of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(/)?\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Id. </em>at 135. The court answered in the affirmative based on the earlier version of \u00a7 10(a) which existed in 1984, and concluded that because Wood was not charged with possession of a firearm without a firearm identification card issued pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B, but rather with unlawfully carrying a firearm under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), the exception set out in \u00a7 129C(/) did not allow the defendant to carry a firearm during the sixty-day period he qualified as a new resident. <em>Wood, supra </em>at 137. The court emphasized that since the defendant was a new resident within the meaning of \u00a7 <em>129C(j) </em>at the time of his arrest, \u201c[t]his status entitled [him] to own or to possess a firearm during his first sixty days in the State, notwithstanding his noncompliance with the ordinary licensing requirements.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The court also addressed, briefly, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s argument that requiring a person to comply with the provisions of <em>both </em>G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C and \u00a7 131G, essentially eliminates the exemption provided by G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a)(3)\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 138. The court concluded that, because \u201cG. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131G, by its own terms, permits the carrying of a firearm . . . there is no need to satisfy the provisions of both \u00a7\u00a7 129C and 131G ... in all circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We further note that, since \u00a7 129C(/) refers to <em>new residents </em>and certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>returning residents </em>who possess a firearm, while \u00a7 131G refers to <em>nonresidents </em>who carry certain firearms, it would be virtually impossible to ever satisfy the requirements of both sections simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The answer to question two is \u201cyes,\u201d by satisfying the exception set out in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(/), new residents and certain returning residents thereby satisfy the firearm exemption set out in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a)(4), for a limited period of time, without also complying with the provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131G.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\n<em>Question three: \u201cWhether satisfaction of the firearm identification card exception set out in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129CQ) is a defense for a violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(m)?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"pAXU\">The third question asks whether the new resident exemption contained in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(/), provides a defense for violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(m), by knowingly having in one\u2019s possession, or knowingly having control of, in a vehicle, a \u201clarge capacity weapon or large capacity feeding device therefor,\u201d without being in possession of a valid class A or class B license to carry firearms issued under authority of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 131 or 13 IF.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Section 10(m) goes on to state that \u201c[t]he possession of a valid firearm identification card issued under section 129B shall not be a defense for a violation of this subsection[.]\u201d General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 129C, provides an exemption only from the firearm identification card requirement set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B, not the licensing requirements of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 131 or 13 IF. In addition, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(/), entitles new residents to own or possess \u201cany firearm, rifle or shotgun and any ammunition therefor.\u201d A large capacity feeding device is not among the list of items covered by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(/).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Also, the definition set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, for a \u201clarge capacity weapon\u201d includes specific language that \u201c[t]he term \u2018large capacity weapon\u2019 shall be a secondary designation and shall apply to a weapon <em>in addition </em>to its primary designation as a firearm, rifle or shotgun\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The answer to question three is \u201cno,\u201d satisfaction of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(/), does not provide a defense to a violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we answer Questions 1 and 3, \u201cNo,\u201d and Question 2, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-12\">Rule 34 of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">\u201cIf, prior to trial . . . , a question of law arises which the trial judge determines is so important or doubtful as to require the decision of the Appeals Court, the judge may report the case so far as necessary to present the question of law arising therein.
