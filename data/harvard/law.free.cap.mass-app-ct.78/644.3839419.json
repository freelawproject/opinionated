L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His principal issue focuses on the meaning of \u201coperation\u201d under that statute. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">1. <em>Operation of the motor vehicle. </em>A. <em>Operation as matter of law. </em>At trial, the Commonwealth pursued only one theory: that the defendant, who was under the influence of intoxicating liquor and was found slumped over the wheel, operated a motor vehicle by putting the keys in the ignition and turning the electricity on, but not turning the engine on. There was no evidence from which the jury could infer that the defendant drove his car drunk before getting behind the wheel. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 1008, 1011 (1987). The defendant argues that the evidence of operation was insufficient as matter of law because putting a key into the ignition and turning it does not constitute operation when the engine has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>engaged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue whether a defendant who places the key in the ignition and turns the electricity on without starting the engine may be found to be \u201coperating\u201d the vehicle for purposes of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, is one of first impression in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">To define \u201coperation\u201d we must look to the touchstone case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Uski, </em>263 Mass. 22, 24 (1928), which held that \u201c[a] person operates a motor vehicle within the meaning of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, when, in the vehicle, he intentionally does any act or makes use of any mechanical or electrical agency which alone or in sequence will set in motion the motive power of that vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merry, </em>453 Mass. 653, 661 (2009) (reaffirming <em>Uski </em>definition of operation). Under the <em>Uski </em>definition, turning the key in the ignition to the \u201con\u201d setting could be found to be part of a sequence that would set the vehicle\u2019s engine in motion and that would, thus, constitute operation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Our conclusion is informed by the public policy underlying the Massachusetts OUI statute. The purpose of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, is to \u201cprotectQ the public from intoxicated drivers,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ginnetti, </em>400 Mass. 181, 184 (1987), by \u201cdeter[ring] individuals who have been drinking intoxicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>liquor from getting into their vehicles, except as passengers.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sudderth, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 317, 300-321 (1994), quoting from <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghylin, </em>250 N.W.2d 252, 255 (N.D. 1977). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>279 Conn. 546, 554-555 (2006), quoting from <em>State </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>70 Ohio St. 3d 150, 153-154 (1994) (\u201c[a] clear purpose of the [Ohio OUI statute] is to discourage persons from putting themselves in the position in which they can potentially cause the movement of a motor vehicle while intoxicated . . .\u201d). Even an intoxicated person who is sleeping behind the wheel is dangerous because \u201cthat person may awaken and decide to drive while still under the influence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelton, </em>168 Vt. 629, 630 (1998).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In sum, applying the <em>Uski </em>definition to the facts before us, we conclude that, as matter of law, the evidence that the defendant, who was found in the driver\u2019s seat, turned the ignition key \u2014 an act that the jury could have found to be the first step in a sequence to set in motion the motive power of the vehicle \u2014 was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that he \u201coperated\u201d the motor vehicle. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>279 Conn. at 551-555 (holding that inserting a key into the ignition constitutes operation under a definition of operation similar to the <em>Uski </em>definition because this is an act that is part of a sequence that will \u201cset in motion the motive power of the vehicle\u201d) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AE0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>We are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s interpretation of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ginnetti, </em>400 Mass. at 184, as requiring that an engine be engaged and as meaning that turning the key to the \u201con\u201d position could not constitute operation. Specifically, the defendant argues that turning the key in the ignition to a position that does not start the car would only draw power from the battery and thus neither starts the engine nor makes use of the power provided by its engine. Even if we assume, arguendo, that the defendant is correct and that turning the key to the \u201con\u201d position does not engage the engine,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant misconstrues <em>Ginnetti. </em>In <em>Ginnetti, supra </em>at 183-184, the court was faced with the question whether a vehicle with a functioning engine was rendered inoperable within the meaning of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, \u201cmerely because it is immovable due to road or other conditions not involving the vehicle itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184. Applying the <em>Uski </em>definition to the facts before it, the court concluded that \u201cthe defendant . . . operate[d] a motor vehicle by starting its engine or by making use of the power provided by its engine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183-184. In so holding, the court did not state that operation was conditioned on an engine being engaged, or that <em>Uski </em>so ruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Finally, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the jury instructions were inappropriate. The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to which defense counsel did not object at trial, did not create a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice. Contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the defendant\u2019s claim, the instructions did not leave jurors with the impression that evidence that the defendant was sleeping in the driver\u2019s seat with a key turned in the ignition compelled a finding of operation. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Plowman, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 234 (1990).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant, who does not challenge being under the influence of intoxicating liquor<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or the fact that the vehicle was on a public way,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> argues on appeal that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence that he \u201coperate[d] a motor vehicle.\u201d See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l). More specifically, he contends that as a factual matter, the Commonwealth failed to prove that he put the key in the ignition of the car and turned the key. We consider \u201cwhether the evidence, in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the contrary evidence presented by the defendant, is sufficient ... to permit the jury to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth shows that the defendant was found asleep in the driver\u2019s seat \u201cslumped over the wheel of the van holding a roast beef sandwich in his hands, with sauce dripping down his hand.\u201d The defendant\u2019s feet were \u201cright in front of him.\u201d The vehicle\u2019s dashboard was illuminated. The key was in the ignition and had been turned to the \u201con\u201d position so that the \u201cenergy to the vehicle was on,\u201d but the engine itself was off and \u201c[t]he vehicle was not running.\u201d The police officer had to \u201cphysically turn the ignition back\u201d in order to remove the key. The police did not observe anyone else in the van at the time of arrest. Viewed as a whole, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant, while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle, put a key in the ignition and turned it to the \u201con\u201d position. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabral, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 909 (2010) (\u201cCircumstantial evidence may be exclusive evidence of operation of a motor vehicle, a required element of OUI\u201d), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petersen, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 49, 52 (2006), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>363 Mass. 554, 562 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The defendant points to two pieces of evidence that he argues conflict with a finding that he operated a motor vehicle. First, the defendant cites testimony by the defendant and the arresting officer that the defendant, upon being awakened by the police officer, told the officer that the officer did not have the vehicle\u2019s keys. The defendant testified that, after he moved to the driver\u2019s seat and began eating his food, he did not remember what happened until the police officer woke him up. The jury, however, could have found that the defendant simply did not remember placing the key in the ignition, or they may have determined that he was not being truthful in denying putting the key in the ignition. Moreover, the existence of contradictory evidence does not require a finding of not guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>430 Mass. 317, 323-324 (1999). Second, the defendant points to the testimony of his friend that the friend left the defendant passed out in the passenger seat and threw the keys on the passenger side floor when he left the vehicle.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even if the jury credited this testimony, it does not require a finding of not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>guilty because the jury could reasonably have inferred that the defendant, who admitted moving from the passenger seat into the driver\u2019s seat, picked up the key and put it in the ignition when he moved to the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">2. <em>Other issues. </em>A. Though he did not object below, the defendant argues that the prosecutor misstated the evidence during his closing argument, creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice requiring reversal. We disagree. The prosecutor\u2019s argument disputing the defendant\u2019s characterization that he was the victim of a conspiracy by the police officers was an appropriate response to defense counsel\u2019s argument that implied such a conspiracy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duguay, </em>430 Mass. 397, 404 (1999). We also conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defense witness\u2019s testimony corroborated the officers\u2019 testimony was a fair representation of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">B. The defendant argues that his right to testify was \u201cimproperly muzzled\u201d at trial because he was not permitted to testify that he intended to sleep overnight in the van so that he could go to court in Gloucester the next day. The defendant, however, was permitted to elicit testimony from the defendant\u2019s friend that the defendant said he had to work early in the morning and planned to sleep in the van overnight. Furthermore, the record supports the conclusion that the defendant accepted his attorney\u2019s strategic advice not to testify during his examination about his plans to sleep in the van because such testimony might open the door to evidence of prior convictions of driving under the influence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finstein, </em>426 Mass. 200, 203-204 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">C. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to replace his attorney, and the judge denied the motion. The record reflects that as soon as the judge became aware of a conflict between the defendant and his counsel, the defendant was provided an opportunity to explain his reasons for wanting to remove his attorney. The judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>motion where (1) this trial counsel was the defendant\u2019s third attorney; (2) the case was two years old; (3) although the defendant was upset with his attorney for arguing a motion for a new trial on his behalf, but without the defendant\u2019s presence, the defendant\u2019s presence would not have affected the outcome of that motion for a new trial; and (4) the defendant merely complained of something that any lawyer who represented him \u201cwho had any competence at all would do.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, </em>393 Mass. 801, 804 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">D. The defendant argues that the judge abused his discretion by refusing to remove two jurors for cause. We disagree. With respect to each of the complained-of jurors, the judge dispelled any concerns about the juror\u2019s bias through follow-up questioning, in which the jurors said they would consider all the evidence to determine whether a police officer was telling the truth in the event that the officer\u2019s testimony was challenged. A trial judge is afforded \u201ca large degree of discretion\u201d in the jury selection process. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, </em>433 Mass. 439, 442-443 (2001) , quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vann Long, </em>419 Mass. 798, 808 (1995). \u201cWhere, as here, a judge has explored the grounds for any possible claim that a juror cannot be impartial, and has determined that a juror stands indifferent, [the court] will not conclude that the judge abused his discretion by em-panelling the juror unless juror prejudice is manifest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, supra </em>at 443. No such prejudice was manifest here.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">E. The defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence of prior convictions presented at the subsequent offense portion of his trial. Reviewing the issue under the familiar standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 676-678, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s contention is without merit. First, there was ample evidence that the defendant was the person who had been convicted of similar offenses once in 1986 and twice in 1988. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>447 Mass. 593, 602 (2006) (\u201c[Registry of Motor Vehicles] records, which contained more particularized identifying information . . . , also reflected the offenses and the fact that they were the defendant\u2019s\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 450, 458-460 (2002) , <em>S.C., </em>439 Mass. 460 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>58 Mass. App. Ct. 368, 372 (2003). Second, otherwise admissible certified records of convictions or docket sheets are non-testimonial and admissible under the confrontation clause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 5 (2010). Finally, the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury with regard to the prior convictions were proper where the judge simply instructed the jury that the documents in question were OUI convictions and reminded the jury that the Commonwealth still had the burden to prove that the defendant was the person who had committed these previous offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">F. There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied his right to speedy trial. Pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 36(b)(1)(C), 378 Mass. 910 (1979), \u201ca criminal defendant who is not brought to trial within one year of the return day in the court in which the case is awaiting trial is presumptively entitled to dismissal of the charges unless the Commonwealth justifies the delay.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 502 (2010). The return day here was March 8, 2005. The defendant\u2019s trial began on January 23, 2007, 686 days later. \u201cThe delay may be excused by a showing that it falls within one of the \u2018[ejxcluded [pjeriods\u2019 provided in rule 36(b)(2), or by a showing that the defendant acquiesced in, was responsible for, or benefited from the delay.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>411 Mass. 503, 504 (1992). Of the 686 days between those two dates, the docket sheet and documents filed in support of or opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss show that many days are excluded from the calculation. Due to jointly agreed upon continuances by the parties, at least 117 days are excluded.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 285, 298 (1983). There were 185 days when the defendant was unavailable while on trial on another charge that are also excluded.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See Mass.R.Crim.P. 36(b)(2)(A)(iii), 378 Mass. 910 (1979). Finally, the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>motion to dismiss, which was filed on December 13, 2006, and decided on January 10, 2007, also tolled the running of the rule 36 time for twenty-nine days. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>411 Mass. at 505 n.4. In total there were at least<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> 331 days that were excluded from the 686 days between arraignment and trial, meaning that fewer than 365 days remain to count against the Commonwealth. Therefore, the defendant was tried within the time constraints of mle 36(b), and the order denying the motion to dismiss is affirmed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-10\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), as amended through St. 2003, c. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">\u201cWhoever, upon any way or in any place to which the public has a right of access, or upon any way or in any place to which members of the public have access as invitees or licensees, operates a motor vehicle with a percentage, by weight, of alcohol in their blood of eight one-hundredths or greater, or while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, or of marijuana, narcotic drugs, depressants or stimulant substances, all as defined in section one of chapter ninety-four C, or the vapors of glue shall be punished ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">\u201cIf the defendant has been previously convicted or assigned to an alcohol or controlled substance education, treatment, or rehabilitation program . . . because of a like offense three times preceding the date of the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted, the defendant shall be punished by a fine of not less than [$1,500] nor more than [$25,000] and by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than two and one-half years nor more than five years . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Quite correctly, the defendant does not dispute that operation can occur even when the vehicle is \u201cstanding still.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sudderth, </em>37 Mass.

L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, includes \u201cat least ordinary stops upon the highway, and such stops are to be regarded as fairly incidental to its operation\u201d). Such an instruction was inappropriate here where the Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that the defendant was operating the vehicle by putting the key in the ignition and turning it. This theory did not depend on any previous operation of the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The defendant admitted at trial that he had consumed at least ten \u201cwhite Russian\u201d drinks that evening and was \u201chighly intoxicated.\u201d Furthermore, the arresting officer reported that the defendant smelled very strongly of alcohol, had slurred speech, was unsteady on his feet, and had glassy, bloodshot eyes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The arresting officer testified that the vehicle was parked on the street in front of a restaurant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The defendant also argues that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden by not introducing sufficient evidence that the defendant\u2019s friend was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>not the person operating the vehicle. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boothby, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 582, 582-583 (2005) (police arrived at scene after accident and multiple people claimed that they were driving the car at the time of the accident). <em>Boothby, </em>however, is distinguishable from the current case because, here, the police only found one possible operator at the scene and the present case does not involve a confession by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\">This figure includes (1) ninety-one days between March 30, 2005 (the first scheduled pretrial hearing date), and June 29, 2005 (the actual date of the pretrial hearing); and (2) twenty-six days between August 19, 2005 (the first scheduled date for the final pretrial hearing), and September 14, 2005 (the actual date of the final pretrial hearing).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The defendant\u2019s trial on an unrelated charge began on October 5, 2006. The excluded period extends until fourteen days after sentencing. See Mass. R.Crim.P. 36(b)(2)(A)(iii). Due to a mutually agreed-upon continuance, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>change in counsel between the bifurcated portions of the trial, and another delay between the second portion of the trial and sentencing, the defendant was sentenced on March 24, 2006. Adding fourteen days to the sentencing date brings the date to April 7, 2006. Thus, the total excludable period for the unrelated charge is 185 days from October 5, 2006, to April 7, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Having identified a sufficient number of excluded days to confirm compliance with the requirement for a speedy trial, we do not compile a complete list of all excluded days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The defendant also appeals from the denial of his pro se motion to dismiss under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 35. Assuming, arguendo, that the judge denied the motion \u2014 there is no record of such ruling \u2014 and that this issue is properly before this court, we affirm. General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 35, applies only <em>to </em>mid-trial continuances, and the delay complained of by the defendant is prior to the commencement of trial and, thus, does not fall within the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
