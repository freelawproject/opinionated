G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A. The offense occurred when the defendant was sixteen years old. The victim, then fourteen years old, who was at the defendant\u2019s house along with several other teenagers late on a Friday evening in December, 2003, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>forcibly raped by his codefendant, sixteen year old Kamil Os-trowsky, while the defendant held her down by her shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The police investigated the crime, and when the defendant was seventeen years old, the complaining witness was videotaped as part of a Sexual Abuse Investigation Network (SAIN) interview. The follow-up police investigation was completed well before the defendant turned eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In February, 2006, when the defendant was eighteen years old, the complaining witness contacted the police and indicated that she wanted to prosecute, and the police applied for a complaint against the defendant. On August 23, 2006, when the defendant was nineteen, a complaint issued in the Norfolk County Division of the Juvenile Court Department against the defendant alleging one count of rape of a child by force, as well as other charges not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 72A, as amended by St. 1996, c. 200, \u00a7 13A, states in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">\u201cIf a person commits an offense or violation prior to his seventeenth birthday, and is not apprehended until after his eighteenth birthday, the [juvenile] court, after a hearing, shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that said person committed the offense charged, and shall, in its discretion, either order that the person be discharged, if satisfied that such discharge is consistent with the protection of the public; or, if the court is of the opinion that the interests of the public require that such person be tried for such offense or violation instead of being discharged, the court shall dismiss the delinquency complaint and cause a criminal complaint to be issued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">After a hearing under \u00a7 72A, the Juvenile Court transferred the proceedings. A grand jury subsequently returned an indictment against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">It is undisputed that the defendant was in no way responsible for the delay in his prosecution. The defendant argues that because he did not evade or attempt to evade prosecution and was identified and available for prosecution while still seventeen, he was not \u201capprehended\u201d after his eighteenth birthday within the meaning of \u00a7 72A. On this basis, the defendant filed a mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tion to dismiss, alleging that the Juvenile Court did not have jurisdiction to transfer the defendant under \u00a7 72A, and therefore the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction. A Superior Court judge concluded that the transfer from Juvenile Court was authorized under the statute and denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 251, 257 (1983), we \u201cconstrue[d] \u2018apprehended\u2019 as used in \u00a7 72A to mean that a person is taken into custody and available to the Juvenile Court for disposition of the case against him.\u201d That case, to be sure, involved a defendant who, after an initial apprehension before he was seventeen years old, later defaulted and then was apprehended again on a default warrant only after he was eighteen. <em>Id. </em>at 252. But the construction of the statute in <em>A Juvenile </em>was not limited to those circumstances. Because all parties agree that the defendant in this case was not \u201ctaken into custody <em>and </em>available to the Juvenile Court for disposition of the case against him,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 257 (emphasis added), \u201cuntil after his eighteenth birthday,\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, his case was subject to a \u00a7 72A proceeding, regardless of whether the defendant was taken into custody only after evading or attempting to evade prosecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">While the language of the statute and our construction of it in A <em>Juvenile </em>bind us, we do note that the alternative construction of the statute proposed by the defendant would result in defendants over seventeen, like the defendant here, who age out of the Juvenile Court before being taken into custody but who did not evade or attempt to evade prosecution, being free of any possibility of any criminal prosecution for crimes committed prior to their seventeenth birthdays since after aging out they would not be subject to prosecution in the Juvenile Court, see G. L. c: 119, \u00a7\u00a7 72 and 74, or in any other court. It is most unlikely that the Legislature would have intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The defendant also argues that on the facts and circumstances of this case, the prosecution of the defendant in the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Court, where, as the judge noted, there might have been less flexibility in sentencing than in the Juvenile Court, violated his due process rights. Because this issue was not raised below, we decline to address it here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Finally, the defendant argues that the first complaint doctrine was violated by the testimony of the individual identified by the victim as the first complaint witness. The judge properly identified one of the friends of the victim, Jane,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as the first complaint witness based on a voir dire of the victim. The rape occurred on a Friday night. The victim testified that the next day, on Saturday morning, she told Jane that she was raped without providing more detail. The victim further testified that she had a more detailed conversation with Jane the following day, Sunday, at a cheerleading benefit, identifying both codefendant Kamil Os-trowsky and the defendant as her rapists.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Jane testified, over objection, that the first complaint she heard from the victim was on Sunday at the cheerleading benefit. Her testimony of the substance of her first conversation with the victim was that the victim told her she had been raped by Os-trowsky, and that she had not mentioned the defendant. From the details to which Jane testified, this appears to be a description of the Sunday conversation to which the victim testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Even assuming, however, that it might, as the defendant argues, be error to admit the testimony of a first complaint witness about what the victim testified was actually the \u201csecond\" complaint \u2014 a question we need not decide \u2014 there would be no warrant for reversal here because the admission of the first complaint witness\u2019s testimony was not prejudicial. The test for prejudicial error is the familiar one: whether we are \u201csure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\" <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994) (citation omitted). The defense theory was that this was a case of consensual sex, not rape, and the defendant was not involved. In support of this theory, the defendant offered videotape testimony from Ostrowsky (who was deported following incarceration for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>an unrelated offense) admitting to statutory rape but not the use of force and claiming that the defendant was not involved. The defense also emphasized that on the night in question, the victim voluntarily began kissing Ostrowsky, and that she also, by her own admission, had consensual sex with Ostrowsky less than two weeks after the alleged rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s substantive evidence in this case ties the defendant to the sexual assault against the victim in two ways. First, there is the victim\u2019s account of the crime describing the defendant\u2019s role. Second, there is the testimony by the victim, confirmed by Jane who was the first complaint witness, that within days of the assault, the victim called the defendant with Jane on the line and the defendant apologized, admitting to his role in the rape. This latter evidence was the centerpiece of the Commonwealth\u2019s closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The first complaint testimony, which was not to be considered for its substance but only to evaluate the credibility of the victim, supports the victim\u2019s account that this was not a case of consensual sex, but it does not link the defendant to the crime in any way. Given the similarly corroborative implications of the independently admissible evidence of Jane\u2019s presence on the three-way telephone call shortly after the first complaint to which she testified, the complaint testimony adds little to the Commonwealth\u2019s case in terms of bolstering the credibility of the victim. On the other hand, the failure of Jane to remember any mention of the defendant in the complaint may have been marginally harmful to the Commonwealth\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In these circumstances, we think that the admission of Jane\u2019s first complaint testimony, even assuming there was any error in its admission, could at most have had but a slight effect on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The Commonwealth argues that apprehension occurs not only when an individual is arrested and available to the court, but also when \u201cprocess commences.\u201d Since the defendant was neither taken into custody nor subject to process on or before his eighteenth birthday, we may assume without deciding that commencement of process and availability to the court would also amount to \u201capprehension.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The defendant makes no argument that this failure should be excused because of \u201ca substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 356 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b671-9\">Grasso, J.</author>\n<p id=\"adt-dedup-0\">(concurring). I concur in the result, but write separately to express my view that the judge did not err in admitting the testimony of the victim\u2019s friend, Jane,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as first complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>testimony. Trial judges are faced with myriad complex questions regarding admissibility of evidence. Especially is this so in the context of first complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>456 Mass. 838, 855-856 (2010) (Marshall, C.J., concurring) (noting confusion over application of first complaint doctrine). When, as here, the judge provides a reasoned, sensible, and correct ground for overruling the defendant\u2019s first complaint objection, we ought to affirm that ruling and provide some guidance to trial judges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">There is no dispute that Jane was the first person to whom the victim made her complaint and that the victim\u2019s complaint related to a single incident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he person who was first told of the assault. . . may testify to the details of the alleged victim\u2019s first complaint of sexual assault and the circumstances surrounding that first complaint as part of the prosecution\u2019s casein-chief.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 243 (2005), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287, 294-295 (2009) (testimony from separate first complaint witnesses admissible in judge\u2019s discretion when widely separate incidents at issue). Whether the victim first complained on Saturday (as she recalled) or on Sunday (as Jane remembered) reflected, at most, differing recollections as to when, within a very short span, the first complaint was made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While such discrepancies may have provided fodder for cross-examination and argument as to witness credibility, they did not render Jane something other than a first complaint witness or her testimony something other than first complaint testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 245 (\u201ca defendant will be free to cross-examine both the first complaint witness and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>complainant about the details of the complaint, and draw to the jury\u2019s attention any discrepancies in the complainant\u2019s story that come to light only as a result of this additional information\u201d). \u201c[T]he timing of a complaint is simply one factor the jury may consider in weighing the complainant\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Because the judge did not err in admitting Jane\u2019s testimony, no prejudicial error arises. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 864, 869 (2010) (review for prejudicial error \u201cinvolves a two-part analysis: \u2018[1] was there error; and [2] if so, was that error prejudicial\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-10\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The judge ruled that the discrepancies between the victim\u2019s and Jane\u2019s recounting of the first complaint did not render Jane\u2019s testimony inadmissible but bore on the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial was that Kamil Ostrowsky penetrated the victim while the defendant held her down.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Under the doctrine of first complaint, unlike its fresh complaint predecessor, \u201cthe complainant may also testify to the details of the first complaint (i.e., what the complainant told the first complaint witness) and also why the complaint was made at that particular time.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 245. While it is difficult to ascertain the tactical reasons why defense counsel sought to preclude admission of Jane\u2019s first complaint testimony that the victim reported a rape by Ostrowsky, without mention of the defendant, the first complaint doctrine does not bar that testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Although the absence of error renders further analysis unnecessary, I agree with the majority that even were error to be shown in the admission of Jane\u2019s first complaint testimony, no prejudice inured to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
