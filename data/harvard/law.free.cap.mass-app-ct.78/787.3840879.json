L. c. 274, \u00a7 7. He argues that the allowance of testimony by a DNA analyst violated his constitutional right of confrontation, that insufficient evidence supported both his indictment and conviction, and that the judge wrongly refused to give an accident instruction to the jury. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Grand jury proceeding. </em>A grand jury indicted defendant Keith Taskey and codefendant Kenneth Langlais<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for conspiracy to tamper with a DNA record in violation of G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth presented the following evidence to the grand jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In 2005, the defendant and Langlais resided in the same cell-block during their incarceration at the Hampden County house of correction (Hampden). They were required to provide DNA samples for entry into the State DNA database, or the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) database.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Collection of DNA samples was scheduled for February 25, 2005, for the defendant and April 12, 2005, for Langlais.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">As part of the DNA collection process, CODIS staff, with the help of jail staff, match information on an inmate\u2019s identification bracelet bearing the inmate\u2019s name, date of birth, identification number, and photograph, to inmate identification information on a DNA collection list.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Inmates were able to remove these bracelets. After matching bracelet identification information with the list, CODIS staff complete an inmate DNA identification card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>(DNA card) based upon inmate answers to questions about the inmate\u2019s name, alias, Social Security number, place of residence, race, and gender; the inmate\u2019s identification number, also inscribed onto the DNA card, is taken from the inmate\u2019s bracelet. CODIS staff then take and impress the inmate\u2019s thumbprint on the DNA card and extract a blood sample. The DNA card and blood sample constitute a kit, which carries a unique identification number. An independent laboratory analyzes the DNA profile of each sample for entry into the CODIS database.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">On February 25, 2005, the defendant provided a DNA sample and thumbprint (kit #38184, identification #123470). On April 12, 2005, staff personnel collected a DNA sample and thumbprint purportedly from Tang\u00edais; the DNA card for his sample indicated that he had shown his identification bracelet (kit #41343, identification #136408). Later analysis of the April 12 sample, however, revealed that the DNA sample and thumbprint belonged to the defendant, not Tang\u00edais.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On August 17, 2005, Tang\u00edais provided a DNA sample and thumbprint at the Berkshire County house of correction, which did not match the April 12 sample which he had allegedly provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">2. <em>Trial. </em>At trial the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the sample collections taken on February 25 and April 12 mirrored the information submitted to the grand jury. The following additional evidence developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">When collecting inmate DNA samples, CODIS staff set up tables within a living unit, or pod, within the jail. Inmates enter the pod for DNA sampling and assemble in a line. Jail staff assist CODIS staff by filling out paperwork during the sample collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">On February 25, 2005, Michael Perkins, Hampden classification manager, assisted CODIS staff with the DNA collection. He filled out the DNA card for the defendant, who then resided in cellblock unit Bl.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">On April 12, Perkins filled out the DNA card for the inmate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>who identified himself as Langlais. Both Langlais and the defendant then resided in cellblock unit C5 at Hampden.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Cellblock unit members had access to one another. CODIS staff member Kelly King collected the DNA samples and fingerprints of the individuals scheduled for collection that day, including the inmate professing to be Langlais. As part of the collection process, Perkins entered the inmate\u2019s identification number on the DNA card and asked each inmate identifying questions to ensure that he was speaking to the right individual. King testified that she would match the identification number written on the DNA card with the number on the inmate\u2019s bracelet. She stated that she would refuse a DNA sample from any inmate who lacked photographic identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Debbie McKillop, State police crime laboratory analyst, tested and analyzed the DNA samples belonging to the defendant and ostensibly to Langlais, resulting respectively on February 25 (kit #38184) and April 12 (kit #41343); she created a report and chart based upon the results of her testing and analysis of those samples.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because McKillop was unable to testify at trial,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Sharon Walsh, a crime laboratory \u201ctechnical leader\u201d overseeing the DNA and CODIS units and supervisor of McKillop, testified instead.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She had worked in the field of DNA processing for nine years. On direct examination, Walsh stated that in 2007 Mc-Killop had processed the two samples and had produced a report; the resulting data appeared on a chart exhibited at trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She explained also that she had \u201creviewed all of the data in the file and the report that was created\u201d by McKillop.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">More specifically, Walsh reported that she had examined the worksheets used by McKillop to reach the DNA profile results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>and had reviewed other related data to \u201cmake sure the data was accurate to what was reported on [McKillop\u2019s] chart.\u201d The prosecutor asked Walsh whether she agreed with McKillop\u2019s findings, but the judge sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to that question. Walsh testified further that the DNA profiles of both the February 25 and April 12 samples were identical, which, she elaborated, meant that the samples were taken from identical twins or from the same individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant and Tang\u00edais questioned Walsh about errors attributed to the State police crime laboratory by the United States Department of Justice and a private firm in two separate audits during 2007. Walsh conceded that those audits had revealed two errors. In the first instance, the same DNA profile had entered the CODIS database under two different identification numbers; Walsh explained that the duplicate profile entered because of a typographical error. The second error involved a DNA profile entered into CODIS with fewer identifying DNA variables, or loci, than required; Walsh explained that the national CODIS database requires the matching of at least ten loci for DNA profiles entered into its system, that the State CODIS system requires fewer than ten loci, and that in that instance the profile should not have entered the national database system because of the discrepancy between national and State profiling requirements. She testified further that those errors were irrelevant to her analysis in this case because no typographical error had occurred in the processing of the two samples and because the DNA profile results were based upon sixteen matching loci.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Before and during trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the charges against him and moved for a required finding of not guilty; a motion judge and the trial judge, respectively, denied the motions. The jury found the defendant guilty of conspiracy to tamper. The judge sentenced him to a two-year term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\"><em>Analysis. </em>On appeal, the defendant argues that the allowance of testimony by a DNA analyst other than the one who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>originally processed the DNA samples violated his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He contends also that the evidence was insufficient to establish probable cause for the grand jury\u2019s indictment and insufficient to show his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. Finally, he contends that the judge wrongly refused his request of an accident instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">1. <em>Analyst testimony. </em>According to the defendant, Walsh, who did not conduct the original processing and analysis of the April 12 DNA sample, \u201cmerely read the results of McKillop\u2019s testing and . . . could not testify about the methods and practices employed to achieve the results.\u201d Because Walsh testified to her independent analysis and opinion of the DNA profile results and because the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine her, no constitutional violation occurred in the admission of her opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment prohibits the \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54 (2004). In <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009), the United States Supreme Court held that drug certificates qualified as out-of-court testimonial statements. Consequently their admission in evidence against a criminal defendant triggers his right \u201cto be confronted\u201d with the analyst at trial, unless the analyst is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 2531. The parties here do not dispute that the evidence of the DNA profile results is testimonial, but rather dispute whether the admission of Walsh\u2019s testimony about that evidence offends the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation because Walsh did not conduct the original analysis and testing of the DNA sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">In this case, supervisor Walsh testified that she had reviewed the course of analyst McKillop\u2019s work and had verified its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>compliance with procedural protocols. As a starting point, she had examined the computerized data delivered to the State laboratory from the private testing laboratory which had received the blood samples of the defendant and Langlais. The State laboratory had then conducted a \u201cretest\u201d of the blood samples attributed to the two individuals. Walsh explained the testing process. The repeated test confirmed the match of all sixteen depicted loci of the DNA molecule found in the two separate samples. Walsh had followed the development of the information by McKillop to a DNA profile picture known as an electro-pherogram and then to a chart illustrating the identity of the sixteen loci. Walsh had reviewed all the raw data and all Mc-Killop\u2019s worksheets in the creation of the chart. In separate voir dire testimony during trial, Walsh reported that McKillop had complied with all quality control procedures required by the national accrediting agency for the State laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Defense counsel did not identify any suspected flaws in the collection of the raw blood sample data about which counsel wished to cross-examine McKillop. Nor did defense counsel cross-examine Walsh about her tracking of the testing steps leading from the sample data to the finished chart. Counsel focused instead upon the general subject of audits of the State laboratory by Federal and private agencies in prior years. Although the defendant objected generally to Walsh\u2019s testimony, counsel did not identify any element of the DNA testing, analysis, or judgment, which Walsh had not independently reviewed and about which she could not undergo cross-examination. On those points, the substituted witness was not channeling forward the testimony of an absent witness, but presenting and answering for her own observations. Defense counsel had full opportunity to confront her upon the process of DNA identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">In these circumstances the defendant has not suffered a harmful deprivation of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. Before the decision in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>issued in 2004, Massachusetts evidentiary doctrine permitted an expert witness to offer an opinion based upon inadmissible hearsay information (i) so long as the information possessed customary reliability as a source for the opinion and would be admissible through an appropriate separate witness, and (ii) so long as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>testifying witness did not offer the details of the underlying hearsay on direct examination. The expert would be subject to cross-examination upon his opinion and, at opposing counsel\u2019s choice, upon the hearsay basis for it. See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 527-532 (1986) (psychiatrist\u2019s opinion, resting partially upon reports not in evidence, admissible about mental state and dangerousness of detained juvenile); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 336-339 (2002) (in trial to determine sexually dangerous person status, qualified examiner may offer opinion based in part upon facts and data in police reports and witness statements from a nol pressed case). This standard accommodates the value of expert opinion to the fact finder and the impossibility of courtroom confrontation of the various sources of information contributing to the formation of that opinion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 762 (2009), and cases cited.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">In Massachusetts and in multiple other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this evidentiary principle has proceeded compatibly with the confrontation doctrine of the <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>decisions. Thus far our cases have presented two recurrent situations: the opinion of a substitute medical examiner upon the cause or manner of death based upon the results of an autopsy performed by a different medical examiner<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>; and the opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>a substitute DNA analyst based upon testing procedure and results performed by another analyst.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The circumstances of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773 (2010), resemble our own. The testifying analyst was a supervisor of the absent analyst. <em>Id. </em>at 782. Without objection, a table showing the results of the original analyst\u2019s testing came into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 782-783. The information \u201cwas testimonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>hearsay admitted in violation of the confrontation clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 783. Nonetheless the court found no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. It placed particular emphasis upon the objective reliability of DNA analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-5\">\u201cWe conclude that the balance here [between the probative value of the admissible opinion of the testifying expert and the prejudicial effect of the inadmissible results produced by the absent expert] weighs heavily in favor of the admission of the opinion, and that the objective nature of the science underlying DNA analysis strengthens the opinion\u2019s probative weight and diminishes the risk of unfair prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The risk of mishandling, mislabeling, or manipulation of raw material and data will not justify exclusion of the testifying expert\u2019s opinion because those possibilities inhere in the source material of typical forensic testimony and, as hypotheses, could always prevent the admission of reliable and informative expert assistance essential for education of the fact finder. <em>Id. </em>at 790. For \u201cDNA analysis, the testing techniques are so reliable and the science so sound that fraud and errors in labeling or handling may be the <em>only </em>reasons why an opinion is flawed\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Ibid. </em>The reduction of room for interpretation and judgment by the precision of the science provides exceptional trustworthiness to the witness\u2019s opinion. In sum, the reliability of the opinion, the exposure of it to cross-examination, the speculative nature of any claims about alleged mishandling, mislabeling, and manipulation, and the supportive circumstantial evidence left no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice from the improper admission of the absent analyst\u2019s test results and opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">In our case, although defense counsel did not object to the admission of the results chart of the first analyst, she did object generally to the testimony of the substitute analyst upon confrontation grounds. Consequently we treat any error as one of a preserved constitutional character. The standard of review is whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 whether the reviewing court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>wrongly admitted evidence had little or no effect upon the verdict. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23 (1967). The Commonwealth must show that properly admitted evidence of guilt is \u201coverwhelming, in the sense that it is so powerful as to nullify any effect that the improperly admitted evidence might have had on the fact finder or the findings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 362 (2010) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The properly admitted evidence does leave us with that assurance. It consists of supervisor Walsh\u2019s expert opinion that the two DNA samples in question came from the same person (or from identical twins) and of the exceptional reliability of such an opinion; of the circumstance that during the relevant time period the defendant and Tang\u00edais were in close proximity and had ample opportunity to exchange identification bracelets for the purpose of an impersonation; that the defendant\u2019s thumbprint accompanied both the blood samples in question; and that a subsequent DNA sample from Tang\u00edais differed from the first two. Defense counsel had ample opportunity to cross-examine Walsh. Counsel launched no specific challenge to her opinion. Amid the total evidence, then, the effect of the erroneous admission of the chart of test results from the original analyst was marginal, cumulative, and harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">2. <em>Sufficiency of evidence for the indictment. </em>The defendant contends that the grand jury did not receive sufficient evidence to support the indictment for conspiracy to tamper with a DNA record and that the judge wrongly denied his motion to dismiss the charges against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">A \u201cgrand jury must hear sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused . . . and probable cause to arrest him.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982). The standard of probable cause is \u201cconsiderably less exacting than a requirement of sufficient evidence to warrant a guilty finding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, 392 </em>Mass. 445, 451 (1984). Although G. L. c. <em>274, </em>\u00a7 7, does not define conspiracy, our common law identifies it as a \u201ccombination of two or more persons, by some concerted action, to accomplish some criminal or unlawful purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lonardo, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 568-569 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The grand jury heard sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause. While no direct evidence existed of a conspiracy between the defendant and Langlais, circumstantial evidence powerfully supported the reasonable inference of a conspiracy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 653 (1990) (\u201c[a] conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence, and this is the usual mode of proving it, since it is not often that direct evidence can be had\u201d). The defendant and Langlais lived in the same cellblock at the time of the April 12 collection. They had the ability to remove, and thus exchange, their identification bracelets. The blood and thumbprint on the April 12 sample matched those of the February 25 sample provided by the defendant. The identical DNA profiles from the blood samples could have resulted only from identical twins or a single individual. Compelling evidence pointed to a single individual as the source of both samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">This evidence amply permitted the grand jury to find probable cause that the defendant had conspired with Langlais to provide a sample for him on April 12. The judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">3. <em>Sufficiency of evidence for the conviction. </em>We review the denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty to determine whether, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence would satisfy a rational trier of fact of each element beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). Our inquiry centers upon \u201cwhether the evidence would permit a jury to find guilt, not whether the evidence requires such a finding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>401 Mass. 745, 747 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>supported the inference that the defendant and Langlais agreed that the defendant would impersonate Langlais and provide a blood sample for him on April 12. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2018Amour, </em>428 Mass. 725, 748 (1999), quoting from <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>239 Mass. 458, 493-494 (1921) (\u201cThe heart of conspiracy is the formulation of the unlawful agreement or combination\u201d). The Commonwealth replicated the evidence submitted to the grand jury.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Both classification manager Michael Perkins and CODIS staff member Kelly King testified to their reliance upon the identification information presented to them by inmates \u2014 oral representations of their identities and information taken from their identification bracelets.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">This body of circumstantial evidence supported the inference, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant and Langlais had agreed to carry out the impersonation and DNA tamper. The judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">4. <em>The accident instruction. </em>Finally, the judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s request for a jury instruction upon the defense of accident. That defense requires evidence of accidental conduct or mistaken intent by the <em>defendant. </em>No such evidence developed here. Rather the defendant has mistakenly contended that evidence of prior errors by CODIS or corrections staff in the process of DNA collection entitles him to the instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>395 Mass. 568, 578-579 (1985) (evidence fails to warrant the accident instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction. Testimony by the DNA analyst did not offend his right of confrontation. The erroneous admission of the chart of test results from the original analyst was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Sufficient evidence supported the indictment and his conviction. The judge did not erroneously refuse to give accident instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Codefendant Kenneth Langlais initially appealed from his conviction and subsequently moved to withdraw his appeal.

L. c. 22E, \u00a7 14. The count of tampering with a DNA record was severed, and trial proceeded on the conspiracy count.
