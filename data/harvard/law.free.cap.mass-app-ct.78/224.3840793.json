See <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>130 S. Ct. 721, 724 (2010). We are constrained to agree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 105-106 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The courtroom closure at issue occurred at the commencement of the afternoon session on the second day of jury empanelment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After one and one-half days of painstaking individual voir dire of over 100 potential jurors, the Commonwealth and the defendant agreed on the selection of the sixteenth and last juror to be seated just prior to the luncheon recess.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Before recessing, the prosecutor advised the judge that he had not completed criminal offender record information (CORI) checks on the five jurors chosen that morning and that he wanted the judge to make inquiry of three jurors who had failed to reveal prior arrests or experiences with the law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cousin, </em>449 Mass. 809, 815-816 (2007), cert, denied, 553 U.S. 1007 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>457 Mass. 152, 165 (2010). The judge indicated that he would address the matter at 2 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The afternoon session commenced. The court reporter\u2019s transcript indicates \u201cAFTERNOON SESSION (Courtroom closed).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>At the very outset of the afternoon proceeding, upon the prosecutor\u2019s presentation of CORI records to the judge, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">Defense counsel: \u201cYour Honor, just one objection to the court being closed. . . it\u2019s a public trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">Judge: \u201cI understand that, but the option is to either bring the juror that we\u2019re going to bring down[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] and inquire about their CORI record at sidebar or do it from the witness stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201cIf you want to do it at sidebar, then the people can sit in the back, but they\u2019re not going to be able to hear the juror\u2019s private information and private history.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">Defense counsel: \u201cOkay, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">Judge: \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why I have the public sent out so that we could in open court discuss the potential issues relating to that criminal record.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">Defense counsel: \u201cFine, Your Honor. That\u2019s fine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">The judge then conducted further individual voir dire of two of the selected jurors regarding their CORI records. After voir dire of the first, the judge was satisfied with his responses and declared the juror to remain indifferent. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the judge permitted the Commonwealth to exercise a peremptory challenge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge then proceeded to question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the second juror regarding her CORI records. Both the judge and counsel were satisfied that the juror remained indifferent, and she remained part of the chosen panel. Because one of the two previously selected jurors had been stricken, the panel now numbered fifteen, and an additional juror needed to be chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Before proceeding further, defense counsel asked, \u201cCan the family come back?\u201d The judge replied, \u201cSure. We\u2019ve got one more juror to [ejmpanel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Prior to resuming voir dire to fill the vacant seat, at sidebar but with the new jury venire present in the courtroom, the prosecutor disclosed that one of the venire may have overheard something in the elevator earlier that day. As the discussion proceeded, the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">Defense counsel: \u201cYour Honor, the court should be open now. . . . This is an open trial whether it\u2019s jurors or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">Judge: \u201cBut traditionally when we\u2019re inquiring into jurors\u2019 personal private background, which we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s done at sidebar and not in open court. . . . [After response from counsel] All right, all right. You can \u2014 fine. You want to bring the family in?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">Defense counsel: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">Judge: \u201cIs that what you\u2019re asking?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">Defense counsel: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">Judge: \u201cAll right. They can sit down in the back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-15\">Clerk: \u201cWe\u2019ve been closing the courtroom to all spectators up until now. We\u2019ve been telling people . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-17\">Defense counsel: \u201cThis is a constitutional violation. . . . This is a public trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-18\">Judge: \u201cLet\u2019s not get overly concerned. This is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the first time you\u2019ve brought it to my attention that you wanted to have somebody in here. ... I said that if you want to have his family members come in and sit down, they can sit down. . . .All right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">Defense counsel: \u201cI\u2019m not just raising a frivolous point. The First Circuit last week reversed on this very issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Judge: \u201cThat\u2019s the First Circuit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">Defense counsel: \u201cWell, it\u2019s on a constitutional ground, the right to an open trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Sidebar ended, and the judge and the parties then proceeded to conduct individual voir dire of twenty-one more potential jurors until the final juror was chosen. At no time during the remainder of the voir dire did the judge rescind or modify his order excluding all but the defendant\u2019s family from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>It is no longer open to dispute that the Sixth Amendment \u201cright to a public trial in criminal cases extends to the jury selection phase of trial, and in particular the voir dire of prospective jurors.\u201d <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>130 S. Ct. at 723.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The public trial right applies to jury selection proceedings because they are \u201ca crucial part of any criminal case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. at 106, quoting from <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.3d 48, 63 (1st Cir. 2007). Denial of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial is a structural error that is not susceptible to harmless error analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 105, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, 74 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 256, 296 (2009). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Because we place such value on the right to public trial and because it is virtually impossible to demonstrate concrete harm flowing from a violation of that right, a violation relieves the defendant of the need to show prejudice in order to obtain a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edward, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 173 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u201cIn claiming that his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was violated, \u2018[t]he burden is clearly on the defendant to demonstrate that the public was excluded from his trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), supra </em>at 107-108, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>379 Mass. 874, 875 (1980). Where, as here, the contemporaneous record of the voir dire proceeding establishes what occurred, we exercise our own judgment on the ultimate factual as well as legal conclusions regarding the defendant\u2019s constitutionally based claim that the public was excluded from his trial. See <em>id. </em>at 105. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 492 (1985) (defendant challenging constitutional adequacy of guilty plea may choose to stand on contemporaneous record without extraneous evidence).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">A. <em>Closure of the courtroom. </em>The defendant has satisfied his burden of establishing that the courtroom was closed during jury voir dire. The transcript of the jury empanelment demonstrates that the judge (1) excluded the public from the voir dire questioning regarding CORI records that began on the second afternoon of empanelment, and (2) excluded the public other than the defendant\u2019s family from the ensuing voir dire of twenty-one prospective jurors to fill the newly vacated seat arising from the Commonwealth\u2019s peremptory challenge. In his own words, the judge acknowledges that he excluded the public from the courtroom during the CORI record questioning, that he did so to facilitate questioning from the witness stand rather than at sidebar, and that he continued to exclude members of the public other than the defendant\u2019s family during the remainder of the voir dire to fill the vacant seat. These intentional exclusions cannot qualify as inadvertent, trivial, or de minimis so as to fall outside the range of closure for Sixth Amendment purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), supra </em>at 108-109. We proceed then to consider whether the defendant waived his right to public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">B. <em>Waiver. </em>Although denial of the right to public trial is a structural error, \u201cwe do look to whether the defendant raised [the] issue in a timely manner because \u2018the right to a public trial, like other structural rights, can be waived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105-106 (internal citations omitted). While neither a written waiver nor oral colloquy is required, and the defendant\u2019s assent to waiver need not necessarily appear on the record, the burden is on the Commonwealth to establish that the defendant knowingly waived his right to public trial either personally or through counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adamides, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 340 n.1 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edward, supra </em>at 173-174.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">i. <em>The CORI record inquiry. </em>We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that defense counsel\u2019s assertions \u201cOkay\u201d and \u201cFine\u201d amount to a knowing waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to public trial. As noted earlier, at the very commencement of the afternoon session, defense counsel affirmatively objected on public trial grounds to the closing of the courtroom for the CORI records inquiry. The judge responded that he had done so to facilitate questioning from the witness stand and that even were the inquiry to be conducted at sidebar in an open courtroom, spectators would not be able to hear the juror\u2019s responses. Viewed in that context, defense counsel\u2019s responses \u201cOkay, Your Honor\u201d and \u201cFine, Your Honor\u201d cannot bear the weight of waiver. While counsel\u2019s responses could signify his agreement with the judge\u2019s reasons for closing the courtroom, they could also signify nothing more than counsel\u2019s understanding of the judge\u2019s preference and acceptance of the judge\u2019s preference as a fait accompli. Even more importantly, counsel\u2019s words say nothing about the defendant\u2019s agreement to the waiver of his right to public trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edward, supra </em>at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">We are unable to discern in such equivocal acquiescence a knowing assent to waiver by the defendant of a right to a public trial that had just been invoked. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adamides, supra </em>at 340 n.1; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edward, supra </em>at 173 n.13. On such muddled ground, the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden of establishing the defendant\u2019s waiver of his constitutional right to public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ii. <em>The subsequent voir dire. </em>Even more are we unable to discern any waiver by the defendant to the partial closure of the courtroom during the ensuing voir dire to fill the vacant seat that remained. Although in the face of defense counsel\u2019s objection the judge reluctantly agreed to open the courtroom to the defendant\u2019s family, the judge never reopened the courtroom to the general public. Indeed, when defense counsel emphatically and persistently continued to press the point in reliance on a recent opinion by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the judge continued to demur and express his disagreement with the view that the right to public trial encompasses jury voir dire. Review of the record during the ensuing voir dire of twenty-one prospective jurors fails to reflect any change in the judge\u2019s order excluding the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">C. <em>Permissible limitations on the right to public trial. </em>Although \u201cthe right to an open trial may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests,\u201d such as inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information, \u201c[sjuch circumstances will be rare, . . . and the balance of interests must be struck with special care.\u201d <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 45 (1984). See <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>130 S. Ct. at 724; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. at 111 (closure analysis of <em>Waller </em>extends to partial closure of courtroom in criminal trials). We conclude that neither the complete closure of the courtroom during voir dire of two jurors regarding CORI records nor the partial closure of the courtroom during the ensuing voir dire for a replacement juror met constitutional requirements. Indeed, we are hard pressed to see how even one of the four <em>Waller </em>factors was met in this case. See <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra </em>at 48 (identifying need for [1] overriding public interest, [2] narrowly tailored closure, [3] consideration of reasonable alternatives, and [4] judicial findings supporting closure). See also <em>Watters </em>v. <em>State, </em>328 Md. 38, 45 (1992), cert, denied, 507 U.S. 1024 (1993) (when defendant objects, the public may only be constitutionally excluded from voir dire \u201cpursuant to narrowly tailored order necessary to protect an overriding state interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Insofar as the voir dire questioning of the two jurors is concerned, we discern neither an \u201coverriding interest\u201d nor even a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u201csubstantial reason\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that was likely to be prejudiced by opening the courtroom at that juncture<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; the closure was far broader than necessary; a reasonable alternative to closing was readily available; and the judge made no findings to support closure. As the judge himself noted, the interest in protecting the confidentiality of the CORI records of the two jurors could have been accomplished effectively at sidebar with the public present. The convenience of questioning the jurors from the witness stand rather than at sidebar does not justify overriding the right to public trial. Moreover, we are aware of no justification whatsoever for closing the courtroom to the public at large during the ensuing voir dire for the replacement juror. In sum, violation of the defendant\u2019s right to public trial occurred, and the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"adr-dedup-0\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The trial that is the subject of this appeal is the defendant\u2019s second. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 548-550 (2006), we affirmed an order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial because his right to counsel had been compromised when his trial attorney surreptitiously wore a microphone that recorded privileged conversations that were later broadcast in the media.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The defendant\u2019s broader claim that the trial judge closed the courtroom for a more extensive period cannot be resolved solely from the transcript of voir dire proceedings and must be resolved in the context of a motion for a new trial.

Defense counsel had previously sought to prevent the Commonwealth from accessing the CORI records of potential jurors at all, but the judge had denied that motion.

However, in extolling his preference for conducting the voir dire from the witness stand rather than at sidebar, the judge appears to have mistakenly equated the values protected by the right to public trial with the interests protected when inquiry regarding sensitive matters is done at sidebar in open court. While concerns regarding the disclosure of CORI records and other sensitive matters can be addressed at sidebar in an open courtroom, the values underlying the right to public trial can not be preserved when the courtroom is closed to the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
