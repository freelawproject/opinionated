L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(/z) (statute). He appeals, claiming that (1) the Commonwealth should have been precluded from inquiring into his juvenile probation record; and (2) the statute under which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>was convicted did not proscribe the conduct of which he was accused or, alternatively, the statute is unconstitutional. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><em>Background. </em>The evidence at trial developed as follows. After observing bullet holes in several cars and shell casings on the street, police sought to secure 42 Hanover Street in Lynn while waiting for a search warrant. They were met by Rocky Chan, the defendant\u2019s girlfriend and mother of his two children. Police asked for \u201cTre\u201d and Chan escorted them to a third-floor bedroom, where they saw the defendant. He identified himself as Tre and stated that he lived at that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The police began searching the house pursuant to a search warrant. A piece of paper with the inscription \u201cTre\u201d was taped to the door of a bedroom, and \u201cTre\u201d was written on the mirror inside that room. Police recovered \u201cthree spent shell casings\u201d near the bed and a soda can containing seven spent shell casings outside the bedroom door. In a bureau inside the bedroom, police recovered a gun holster, a spent shell casing, and the defendant\u2019s learner\u2019s permit. In the basement, police discovered \u201can assortment of ammunition\u201d that was \u201cstuffed\u201d in the rafters above a ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">At trial, the defendant claimed he did not know where the items came from. He testified that he frequently visited 42 Hanover Street but did not live there. Chan testified that her younger sister discovered the shell casings on the playground, and that she had taken them from her sister and placed them in the soda can. She also testified that she took the gun holster away from her sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">While testifying, the defendant suggested that at the time of the search, he did not know what a shell casing was.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>to this testimony, the Commonwealth was permitted to question the defendant about whether he had previously been on probation as a juvenile for possession of ammunition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Juvenile probation record. </em>The defendant argues that the Commonwealth should not have been permitted to impeach his credibility with his juvenile probation record because there was no certified record of the conviction as required by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. However, \u201c[tjhis is not a case where the Commonwealth was trying to impeach ... the defendant by proof of [his] commission or conviction of a crime . . . [and thus] G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, does not apply.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>357 Mass. 333, 337 (1970). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderick, </em>429 Mass. 271, 275 (1999) (\u201c[r]ebuttal evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>this nature is introduced to impeach the credibility of the witness, but is of a different sort from evidence of prior convictions introduced to impeach the credibility of the defendant generally\u201d). Instead, the Commonwealth used the defendant\u2019s juvenile probation record to rebut his contention that he did not know what a shell casing was. This method of impeachment by contradiction was proper. See <em>ibid. </em>Further, in these circumstances, when \u201cthe defendant\u2019s credibility was very much in question, and the [probation record] was relevant to credibility [,]\u201d the judge did not abuse her discretion in admitting that evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>416 Mass. 90, 95 (1993) (\u201cthe record admitted here appears to have been the only available one and its exclusion would have deprived the Commonwealth of important impeachment evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">2. <em>The statute, </em>a. <em>Proscribed conduct. </em>The defendant argues, as he did at trial, that the \u201cspent shell casings\u201d which the police recovered are not prohibited by the statute under which he was convicted. That statute provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[w]hoever owns, possesses or transfers a firearm, rifle, shotgun or ammunition without complying with the provisions of section 129C of chapter 140 shall be punished . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(h), inserted by St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 6. The term \u201cammunition\u201d is defined as \u201ccartridges or cartridge cases, primers (igniter), bullets or propellant powder designed for use in any firearm, rifle or shotgun.\u201d G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(o), inserted by St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u201cA \u2018statute is to be interpreted according to the plain and ordinary meaning of its words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 152, 154 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conaghan, </em>433 Mass. 105, 110 (2000). We \u201cwill not engage . . . in an analysis of a statute\u2019s legislative history to seek justification for a particular construction, where the statutory language at issue suggests no ambiguity of meaning.\u201d <em>Thurdin </em>v. <em>SEI Boston, LLC, </em>452 Mass. 436, 449 (2008), quoting from <em>Massachusetts Community College Council MTA/NEA </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>402 Mass. 352, 354 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, \u201c[w]e derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Here, the term \u201ccartridge cases\u201d is not defined by either G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A) or \u00a7 10(o). The dictionary definitions of \u201ccartridge\u201d and \u201cshell\u201d indicate that the terms \u201ccartridge case\u201d and \u201cshell casing\u201d are both used to describe the item that contains the primer and charge for firearms ammunition. See American Heritage Dictionary of the English language 287, 1603 (4th ed. 2006) (defining \u201ccartridge\u201d as \u201c[a] cylindrical, usually metal casing containing the primer and charge of ammunition for firearms\u201d and \u201cshell\u201d as \u201c[a] metal or cardboard case containing the charge and primer for a piece of firearms ammunition\u201d); IX Oxford English Dictionary 674 (1933) (defining shell as \u201c[a] cartridge case of paper or metal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In this case, we discern no ambiguity in the statutory language at issue. Our cases have used the terms \u201ccartridge cases\u201d and \u201cshell casings\u201d synonymously and interchangeably.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beliard, </em>443 Mass. 79, 83, 87 n.7 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caillot, </em>449 Mass. 712, 717, 723 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>455 Mass. 372, 376 (2009). The absence of any identified ambiguity in these terms cuts against the defendant\u2019s position.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A plain reading of the statute further undermines the defendant\u2019s claim. The statute criminalizes possession of cartridges and their component parts, including \u201ccartridge cases, primers (igniter), bullets or propellant powder.\u201d G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(o). We conclude that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the \u201cshell casings\u201d found in the defendant\u2019s room were \u201ccartridge cases\u201d within the meaning of that statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">b. <em>Vagueness. </em>For the first time on appeal, the defendant argues that the statute is void for vagueness based on a perceived ambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ity in the term \u201ccartridge case.\u201d From what we have said above, it follows that we discern no ambiguity which would invalidate the statute under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. That is, the statute is \u201cdefined in terms that are sufficiently clear to permit a person of average intelligence to comprehend what conduct is prohibited.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint </em>C., 430 Mass. 219, 227 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass. 178, 180 (1993).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was no error and accordingly, no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">c. <em>Substantive due process. </em>The defendant argues, in essence, that the statute does not satisfy the rational basis test as applied under the State or Federal Constitution. Because the defendant also failed to preserve his substantive due process claim, we again apply the substantial risk standard of review. See <em>ibid. </em>As we think it is plain that the statute \u201cbears a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective,\u201d namely, the protection of the public from the danger posed by the assemblage and usage of ammunition, we conclude that the statute does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Rushworth </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>413 Mass. 265, 268 (1992), quoting from <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 14 (1971). For the same reason, the statute does not violate the Massachusetts Constitution because it \u201cbears a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or some other phase of the general welfare.\u201d <em>Rushworth, supra </em>at 268-269, quoting from <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. on the Necessaries of Life, </em>307 Mass. 408, 418 (1940). Accordingly, there is no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\">direct examination of the defendant included the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"AZU\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cI place in front of you Exhibit 3; do you know what it is?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Arc\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cDo you know what it is before this incident?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">A.: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\"><em>Q:. </em>\u201cDo you know what it is after the incident?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">A.: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAfter the incident, what do you know it to be?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>A.: \u201cA </em>shell casing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd who told you that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cPolice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Cross-examination of the defendant included the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know what ammunition is until after the police told you what it was?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">A.: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cThen why were you on probation in juvenile court for possession of ammunition?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">A.: \u201cThey told me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">A.: \u201cThey told me I was on probation because of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cFor possession of ammunition?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-17\">A.: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-18\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cThe same ammunition that you don\u2019t recognize there?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-19\">A.: \u201c[No.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-20\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cSo it\u2019s your testimony that you didn\u2019t have any ammunition then either?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-21\">A.: \u201c[Inaudible].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-22\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cBut you were put on probation for it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-23\">A.: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">A different analysis applies when we seek to construe ambiguous statutes.
