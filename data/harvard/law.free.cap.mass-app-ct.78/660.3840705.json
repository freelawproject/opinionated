L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A). The Commonwealth concedes that there were several violations of the first complaint doctrine at trial. The defendant objected to some of the errors but not to others. The question we face is whether the combination of preserved and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>unpreserved errors requires a new trial. We conclude that it does.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant is the father of the young girl who alleges that she was raped. We will refer to her as Becka.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Becka\u2019s parents had separated, and during the relevant period, she lived principally with her mother, her mother\u2019s boyfriend (Elvin), and her two sisters. The defendant lived with his sister\u2019s family, and Becka visited the defendant and her paternal relatives at her aunt\u2019s house on weekends, two to three times per month. Becka\u2019s sisters, who have a different biological father, did not accompany her on those visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Becka testified that when she was eight, the defendant began anally raping her at her aunt\u2019s house, and that he continued to do this over several months\u2019 worth of visits. According to Becka, the rapes occurred either at night while the others in the household were sleeping, or during the day when they were not home. While her testimony was brief, Becka provided some detail about the alleged acts, and she demonstrated to the jury, away from the witness stand, how her body was positioned while the acts occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">At the end of this graphic testimony, the prosecutor asked Becka if the man who raped her was in the courtroom. To the prosecutor\u2019s evident surprise, Becka answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The prosecutor then asked: \u201cYou don\u2019t see your dad in the courtroom today?\u201d Becka again answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The prosecutor pressed her once more: \u201cYour dad is not sitting over there in the courtroom?\u201d At this point, Becka did identify her father, and the prosecutor prompted her to agree that he looked different because he did not \u201cused to have glasses and a beard like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Defense counsel conducted only a limited cross-examination of Becka. Counsel elicited from her that while Becka referred to the defendant by his nickname, \u201cManico,\u201d she and her sisters called her mother\u2019s boyfriend Elvin \u201cDad.\u201d Becka also acknowledged that Elvin moved out \u201cnot very long after this happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The Commonwealth called four additional witnesses, all of whom testified to events that occurred after the alleged incidents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The witness who immediately followed Becka was her older sister, Selena,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who was Becka\u2019s close confidante and \u201csecret keeper.\u201d Selena recounted a series of conversations that took place in March of 2004, while the mother, Becka, and Selena were traveling to school in the family minivan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Selena, Becka became extremely upset when their mother unexpectedly announced that Becka was to spend the upcoming weekend with the defendant. In response to questions from her mother and from Selena as to why she was so upset, Becka initially declined to explain why. After Selena continued to press, Becka, \u201cwhispering\u201d into Selena\u2019s ear, told Selena that the defendant had raped her. While they were all still in the minivan, Selena eventually repeated Becka\u2019s allegations to their mother, and the mother was drawn into what was (at least in part) a three-way conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">After Selena testified, the mother gave her own account of the minivan conversations, over the defendant\u2019s objection that the mother could not serve as a \u201csecond first complaint witness.\u201d The two accounts were consistent, with Selena and the mother each providing some detail absent from the other\u2019s telling. The mother also testified about events that occurred in the aftermath of Becka\u2019s having revealed her allegations: that the mother repeated these allegations to Becka\u2019s great-grandmother, that the mother also passed them along to the State agency then known as the Department of Social Services (DSS),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that DSS directed Becka to come to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The next witness was Dr. Nancy Miller, a pediatrician at the Family Advocacy Center at Bay state Children\u2019s Hospital. At the start of her testimony, Dr. Miller described the Family Advocacy Center as \u201ca child advocacy center where we work with children and families who have been affected by child abuse and/or domestic violence.\u201d She explained the various ways that children are referred to the center, and she noted that she personally had examined \u201c[sjeveral thousand\u201d children there. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question why it was important for children to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>be examined at the Family Advocacy Center rather than at an emergency room, she responded without objection: \u201c[W]e are experts in what we are doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Dr. Miller testified that she had met with Becka on April 26, 2004, a few weeks after Becka had reported the allegations to her sister and her mother. When Dr. Miller began to testify about what Becka had told her and shown her using anatomically correct dolls, the defendant objected. After the judge overruled the objection, Dr. Miller testified that Becka was able to demonstrate with the dolls \u201cwhat happened to her.\u201d Dr. Miller then testified that she proceeded to conduct a physical examination of Becka during which she observed no signs of trauma, such as \u201ctearing, redness, [or] bruising,\u201d in the relevant anatomical areas. Immediately thereafter, the prosecutor asked, \u201c[D]id that surprise you?\u201d Dr. Miller replied, \u201cNo,\u201d and when she started to respond to the prosecutor\u2019s follow-up question, \u201cWhy not?\u201d the defendant objected again. At sidebar, defense counsel stated that the objection was based on the ground that the questioning was beginning to call for expert testimony and Dr. Miller had not been qualified as an expert. Defense counsel added that, regardless of whether Dr. Miller might qualify as an expert, the Commonwealth had not notified the defendant that it intended to call her as one and had not complied with the discovery rules regarding expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">After counsel debated these issues at length, the judge rejected all of the defendant\u2019s arguments and allowed Dr. Miller to testify freely as an expert witness. She proceeded to recount in detail why she was not surprised to observe that Becka did not show any signs of physical abuse, supporting her views with references to unspecified scientific studies. As but one example, she testified, without further objection, that \u201cmost of the time, eighty-five percent or more of the time, when we look at scientific studies of children who have been sexually abused, they will have normal examinations, that is, due to the nature of the alleged acts and the physiology of the issue involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Defense counsel undertook only a brief cross-examination of Dr. Miller, totaling less than six pages of transcript. Counsel did not challenge Dr. Miller\u2019s credentials or conclusions and largely focused on getting clarification that Dr. Miller was not asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>that she had observed physical signs that positively demonstrated a sexual assault but only that the absence of such signs did not rule it out.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">On redirect, the prosecutor returned to the subject of what Becka had communicated to Dr. Miller. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, Dr. Miller repeatedly stated that when Becka had described what had happened to her, she was speaking about the defendant and not Elvin (even though it was Elvin whom Becka called \u201cDad\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s final witness was a social worker at DSS. On direct examination, she testified about the investigatory practices that DSS used both in general and in this case. Although she stated that she had interviewed Becka as part of this process, the social worker did not repeat the substance of those conversations. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited from her that, when Becka had been asked whether she knew the difference between a truth and a he, she had answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The social worker also acknowledged that at the time of the alleged incidents, the mother had an open and \u201csupported\u201d case file at DSS for physical abuse and neglect, and that Elvin \u201capparently\u201d did as well. On redirect, the social worker explained that she had asked Becka a series of follow-up questions designed to determine that she could discern the difference between the troth and a lie, and the social worker indicated that Becka could do so. The social worker also stated that she had not investigated Elvin for any sex-related allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">After the Commonwealth rested, the defendant called only one witness, his niece (Becka\u2019s cousin), who lived in the house where and when the rapes allegedly occurred. The main subject of her testimony was the sleeping arrangements in the house. She testified on direct examination that when Becka stayed at the house, Becka slept with her in her bedroom, while the defendant slept in the living room. On cross-examination, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>niece abandoned that position and acknowledged that the defendant sometimes slept in the bedroom with Becka.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Selena testified as the Commonwealth\u2019s designated first complaint witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 242-245 (2005). The defendant raises no claims of error about Selena\u2019s testimony but challenges instead the additional complaint testimony that came in through the mother, Dr. Miller, and the DSS social worker. Of the seven individual violations of the first complaint doctrine that the defendant alleges, the Commonwealth concedes that five of them were error, and it does not contend that any of this complaint testimony could have been admitted on alternative grounds. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 229 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 494-495 (2009). The Commonwealth nevertheless argues that the various violations do not amount to reversible error, because \u201cthey did not prejudice the defendant (for those [errors] preserved) or give rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice (for the unpreserved).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">We agree with the Commonwealth that many of the errors, including some of the ones the defendant has chosen to highlight, are of little moment (at least when they are viewed individually). For example, the mother\u2019s separate account of the minivan conversation ultimately added minimal, if any, force to the Commonwealth\u2019s case regardless of whether it should have been admitted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the mother\u2019s testimony that she repeated Becka\u2019s allegations to her great-grandmother is more notable for its irrelevancy than its prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>However, other errors are more serious. Of particular concern is the testimony of Dr. Miller about what Becka had told and showed her. As the Commonwealth now concedes, it was error to admit Dr. Miller\u2019s testimony about this, and the defendant raised a timely objection. Therefore, we can affirm only if we are convinced \u201cthat the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). For the reasons that follow, we cannot reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">As is generally true in prosecutions of this sort, the Commonwealth\u2019s case ultimately rested on the credibility of a single eyewitness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendrala, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402 (1985), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass. 664, 667 (1966) (\u201cAs is often the case where there are charges of rape or sexual assault, the question of guilt or innocence rests in large part \u2018upon whether the jury believed the victim\u2019s version of what happened or the defendant\u2019s]\u2019 \u201d). In this context, allowing multiple witnesses to testify that an alleged victim relayed her allegations to them by itself creates potential prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 457 (2008) (\u201cRepetition of the narrative tends to enhance the credibility of the complainant to the prejudice of the defendant\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. at 497 (\u201cIn a case such as this one, which turned on credibility, there is a particularly high probability of prejudice from the admission of duplicative complaint evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Here, the Commonwealth did more than merely elicit that Becka had repeated her allegations to multiple parties. Most importantly, although Dr. Miller never specifically was asked whether she believed Becka, her testimony effectively communicated to the jury that she did. As noted, <em>supra, </em>Dr. Miller was allowed to testify that Becka was able to demonstrate with the dolls \u201cwhat happened to her.\u201d Moreover, directly thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the prosecutor pointedly asked Dr. Miller whether the absence of physical trauma \u201csurprise[d]\u201d her. Dr. Miller\u2019s answering, \u201cNo,\u201d and her explanation of why she was not surprised by the absence of physical trauma necessarily conveyed that she believed Becka\u2019s allegations to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The potential prejudice caused by Dr. Miller\u2019s implicitly vouching for Becka\u2019s allegations was significantly amplified by the fact that Dr. Miller was called to testify as an expert witness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 872 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. 180, 186 (1996) (\u201cThe danger of vouching \u2018is greater where the witness is testifying as both a direct witness and an expert, particularly where the witness offers fresh complaint testimony\u2019 \u201d). This court, and the Supreme Judicial Court, long and frequently have cautioned about the potential dangers of using the same witness as both an expert and a percipient witness in criminal cases, especially in sexual assault cases. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 583, 590-594 (1994), and cases cited.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we said in <em>McCaffrey, id. </em>at 591, \u201c[tjhere appears to be particular risk of undue influence when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>an expert\u2019s testimony can be construed as impliedly supporting the truthfulness of a victim in sexual abuse prosecutions.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Where Dr. Miller had been put before the jury as an expert who had examined \u201c[sjeveral thousand\u201d child abuse victims, her conveying that she believed that Becka was telling the truth bolstered Becka\u2019s credibility to a degree that cannot be overlooked.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We are unable to conclude with confidence that this \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. at 353.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Other errors, which were not preserved, were not of great import, but neither were they trivial. For example, the testimony about the Commonwealth\u2019s investigatory process (which came in through the mother and the DSS social worker) at least to some extent established \u201c[t]he fact that the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>brought its resources to bear on this incident^ which] creates the imprimatur of official belief\u201d in the alleged victim. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. at 457 (concluding that testimony about the government\u2019s sexual assault victim interview process ordinarily should be excluded because such testimony \u201cis unnecessary and irrelevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and is extremely prejudicial\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. at 493-494.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Our conclusion that a new trial is required is reinforced by the volume of the errors present. \u201cEven though not all of the testimony challenged on appeal was the subject of objection at trial, we conclude that appellate relief is warranted based upon the aggregate errors in the case, regardless of the applicable standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Finally, some comments are appropriate regarding the defendant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth failed to disclose that it intended to call Dr. Miller as an expert witness. The full extent to which the defendant can make out such a claim cannot be determined on the record before us.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To the extent that the defendant wanted to rely on this argument, he should have sought to develop the relevant facts in his motion for a new trial. However, regardless of whether any such claim might have provided an independent ground for reversal, we note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>our review of the record leaves us with the unmistakable impression that, for whatever reason, defense counsel was unprepared to engage Dr. Miller as an expert witness, despite the fact that her expert testimony went to the heart of one of the defendant\u2019s principal defenses.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This is one of the considerations that precludes us from concluding that \u201con the whole record we are satisfied the jury could find their way and the defendant was well defended and fairly tried.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>35 Mass. App. 827, 833-834 (1994) (Kaplan, J.) (where \u201c[t]he defense conducted a strong cross-examination of the [child\u2019s treating] psychotherapist,\u201d no reversible error found as to defense claim that, \u201cto preserve clear lines, the prosecution should have brought in an expert other than one who served as therapist to the child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In sum, we conclude that the errors require a new trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-10\">The defendant also challenges the denial of his motion for a new trial that he based on a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b697-11\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Also a pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Without objection, Becka herself testified about the conversation before Selena took the stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Now known as the Department of Children and Families.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">On direct examination, Dr. Miller had stated that after the examination, she followed up with the mother to report that \u201cthe physical examination was normal, that we thought that it was consistent with what the child was saying.\u201d On cross-examination, the defendant prompted Dr. Miller to acknowledge that when she used the term \u201cconsistent,\u201d she really meant that \u201cit doesn\u2019t rule [the alleged rapes] out as a possibility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The Commonwealth does not concede that the mother\u2019s testimony about the minivan conversation was a first complaint violation. Instead, it asserts that where Selena and the mother were told Becka\u2019s allegations so closely in time (and space), that they effectively both were witnesses to Becka\u2019s first complaint. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Revells, ante </em>492, 496 (2010) (finding no first complaint violation from the introduction of both written and oral communications, where \u201cthe victim\u2019s first complaint to her mother consisted of a single, tightly intertwined oral and written communication\u201d). However, even under the Commonwealth\u2019s view that there were two witnesses to the first complaint, there would still need to be a legitimate purpose served by having both witnesses testify. In any event, because we conclude that any prejudice effected by this part of the mother\u2019s testimony was minimal at best, and that reversal is warranted on other grounds, we need not resolve whether the mother\u2019s testimony about the minivan conversations constituted a first complaint violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The parties both treated this as a first complaint issue even though it went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>to the mother\u2019s passing along what Becka had told her to a third party, not Becka herself repeating the allegations. Some of the other alleged errors also were not strictly first complaint issues, even though the parties characterized them as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b702-11\">This observation goes to the nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, not its strength.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We emphasize that \u201cit is well within the province of a medical expert witness to explain that an absence of physical findings does not necessarily indicate an absence of abuse.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 873 (2001), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>425 Mass. 844, 851 n.13 (1997). We also note that while the defendant argued below that the judge qualified Dr. Miller without an adequate review of her qualifications, he does not press this claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>36 Mass.

We note that while the potential danger of an expert vouching for a child victim typically has arisen where the expert has been called to speak to general patterns of behavior exhibited by child sex crime victims, similar problems are created when the vouching arises in a different manner. In fact, the Supreme Judicial Court has instructed that, even where an examining doctor does not testify as a complaint witness, testimony \u201cthat the symptoms and physical condition of the child were consistent with the type of . . . sexual abuse that the child alleged in this case . . .

App. Ct. at 593-594. In a subsequent decision, the Supreme Judicial Court, while reversing a defendant\u2019s adjudication as a youthful offender on other grounds, found no problem caused by the alleged victim\u2019s treating physician serving both as a percipient witness and as the Commonwealth\u2019s expert regarding the extent to which sexual assaults necessarily leave signs of physical trauma. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., 434 </em>Mass. at <em>872. </em>However, in rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim of vouching there, the court emphasized that the physician \u201cdid not provide fresh complaint testimony\u201d and \u201cdid not comment on the complainant\u2019s truthfulness.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">This is not a case where we confidently can state that the testimony was \u201cmore important to the defense than the Commonwealth.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>456 Mass. 838, 851 (2010). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Revells, ante </em>492, 499 (2010). For example, to the extent that Becka\u2019s testimony opened the door <em>to </em>an argument that she meant to indicate that the person who raped her was someone other than the defendant, Dr. Miller\u2019s testimony about her conversation with Becka not only failed to open that door further, but effectively slammed it shut.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\">In so concluding, we do not in any way mean to impugn Becka\u2019s credibility, and we note that the defendant was unable to elicit any reason why she would be lying. But this does not change the fact that it was for the jury to determine whether her testimony was credible, and Dr. Miller\u2019s testimony served to undercut that role. \u201cEvaluations of credibility are, of course, within the exclusive province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 202 (1987), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Although the Commonwealth now refers to the testimony about the DSS investigation as \u201cbenign background information,\u201d the prosecutor highlighted the fact of the investigation in her closing argument: \u201c[The mother] went to DSS, she reported what happened and DSS did their ten-day investigation in conjunction with the police, the Springfield police.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">We note that in the colloquy at sidebar, the prosecutor never claimed that she had informed the defendant that the Commonwealth intended to call Dr. Miller as an expert witness (while arguing essentially that the defendant should have realized that this was the capacity in which Dr. Miller was being called). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 593 (2006) (concluding that under the facts present there, \u201cthe defendant should have known the substance of the [examining] doctor\u2019s testimony in advance\u201d). The prosecutor did, however, concede that she never served on the defendant a copy of Dr. Miller\u2019s curriculum vitae, while suggesting that she had no duty to do so until the defendant first asked for one. Whatever the precise extent of the Commonwealth\u2019s pretrial discovery obligations pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 14(a)(l)(A)(vi), as amended, 444 Mass. 1501 (2005), an issue we do not reach, it is certainly (at a minimum) better practice for the Commonwealth to expressly identify each expert witness it intends to call, and to make such witness\u2019s curriculum vitae and other required documentary material available to the defendant without prior request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">In his opening, the defendant forcefully highlighted the absence of physical signs of trauma as one of the lead defenses, with specific reference to Dr. Miller\u2019s testimony as the examining physician. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the Commonwealth stresses that the defendant switched gears and significantly deemphasized this defense in his closing. While that might have been a wise tactical choice given the strength of Dr. Miller\u2019s unrebutted expert testimony, the record reveals that in his closing, the defendant continued to rely on the absence of physical trauma as one of his main defenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b706-9\">In view of our disposition, we need not reach the issues raised in the motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
