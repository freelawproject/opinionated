Team members were wearing camouflage uniforms clearly indicating that they were police, and the officers were armed. Lieutenant Rupert Daniel, the team leader, was familiar with the defendant and knew that he had a prior arrest for a firearms offense. Other members of the team were also informed of the defendant\u2019s prior firearms offense before executing the warrant. On the basis of this information, the team members planned to fan out to all floors of the house upon their entry to determine whether there was a threat, in accordance with tactical response team protocol. Daniel had also determined that three people, the defendant, his mother (mother), and his mother\u2019s seven year old niece (niece), lived in the house.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Upon arrival at the house, Daniel knocked on the door, and the mother answered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Daniel asked her where the defendant was, and she pointed upstairs. Daniel saw the defendant, who was at the top of the stairs on the second floor, run into a bedroom and close the door. Daniel and about five other officers ran up the stairs, kicked open a door, and secured the defendant. The other team members immediately and simultaneously separated to conduct a protective sweep. As Daniel and his group were moving up the stairs to secure the defendant, two officers went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>into the basement and, finding no one, quick! came back upstairs. Two other officers went into the secor 1-floor bedroom where the niece was sleeping.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They found no ne else. Another group of officers swept by Daniel and procei led to the third floor, an attic area containing a small bedroom In that room, in plain view, one of the officers saw a bag of ms ijuana, what appeared to be \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine, and other dru ; paraphernalia, together with a black safe on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">After speaking with Daniel, Officers Wadle ger and Mazza, part of the group that had gone to the third floe , returned to the police station to prepare an application for &lt; search warrant based on their observations in the attic bedroi m. The officers returned with the warrant at about 8:20 a.m In the ensuing search of the third floor, they seized a safe ontaining three firearms, \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine and marijuana, di| tal scales, currency, and packaging materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">At some point prior to arrival of the search /arrant, an officer asked the mother for her consent to searc the house and told her that he could report her to the Depai ment of Social Services if she did not sign the consent form ' ecause she was the guardian of her niece. The motion judge found that the mother signed the form as a result of this sta :ment, and any consent she may have given was coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">On March 30, 2007, the defendant was ch rged with four counts of possession of a firearm or ammunitio: without a firearm identification (FID) card, possession of \u00a1 large capacity firearm, possession of a firearm in the commis: on of a felony, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, rossession of a Class D substance with intent to distribute, an&lt; two counts of receiving stolen property. On November 14, 2( )7, the defendant filed a motion to suppress, and a judge alloi ed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The motion judge found that the police obtE ned the search warrant based on plain view observations they i tade during the protective sweep of the house, but that they &lt; id not possess specific and articulable facts necessary to sup ort the sweep. The judge also found that the police conducted : search prior to obtaining the warrant. The judge based that find rg on evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>that, although the defendant was taken to a cruiser within ten minutes of his detention, police remained on the third floor for thirty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The judge\u2019s findings do not support the suppression order. While executing an arrest warrant, police may conduct a protective sweep, \u201ca quick and limited search of the premises\u201d to protect the officers\u2019 safety, if they have a reasonable belief based on \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d that the area could harbor a dangerous individual. <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 327, 334 (1990). As we said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 114, 120 (2007), those articulable facts can be found in a defendant\u2019s \u201crecord of violent felonies and firearm possession charges.\u201d Daniel and the other members of the tactical response team knew, prior to executing the arrest, that the defendant had prior arrests related to firearms offenses. On the basis of this information, the tactical response team planned to conduct a protective sweep of the house for possible threats. See <em>id. </em>at 115-116. Thus, contrary to the motion judge\u2019s findings, the police did have the necessary \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d to show that a protective sweep was warranted. Even after the defendant was in custody on the second floor, officers on the third floor could reasonably, continue the protective sweep \u201cto determine whether confederates are present who may pose a danger to the officers.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. 616, 624 n.8 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>370 Mass. 548, 556, cert denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">As noted, the motion judge found that the officers saw contraband items on the third floor in plain view. The plain view doctrine applies to objects the police observe inadvertently if they are lawfully in a position to view the objects, they have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>lawful right of access to the objects, and, in ases concerning contraband, weapons, or other items illegall possessed, the incriminating character of the objects is imme liately apparent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sliech-Brodeur, </em>457 Mass. 300, 306 (2010). Because the officers were lawfully on the tb rd floor, \u201c[t]he admission in evidence of things inadvertently &lt; aserved in plain view during the course of [the protective sweej would ... be justified under the plain view doctrine.\u201d Co<em>mmonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>439 Mass. at 624 n.8. Here the team r embers took the intermediary step of identifying the items that ti \u00a1y had seen during their protective sweep in an affidavit in su] Dort of a search warrant, rather than seizing them immediately. Thus, the items that the officers recovered pursuant to a searcl warrant, which were initially seen inadvertently and in plain v ?w on the third floor during the course of a lawful protect ve sweep, are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The invalidity of the mother\u2019s consent, and ;he defendant\u2019s claims that officers remained on the third floor do long, or that they otherwise exceeded the scope of a protei :ive sweep and searched the second or third floor, are immatet al, because the officers nonetheless obtained the search warran based on plain view observations made during the protective \u00a1weep, and the items were therefore not the fruits of an impel lissible search. See <em>id. </em>at 624-625; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 430, 438-440 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Order allowing m tion to suppress reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Our dissenting colleague says that before entering the house, Daniel \u201chad information\u201d that the defendant, his mother, and her niece were the only \u201coccupants\u201d of the house. The record and the judge\u2019s findings, however, show that Daniel knew who \u201clived\u201d in the house, see <em>post </em>at note 1, but disclose nothing about the critical issue of what Daniel knew or did not know about who was actually in the house at the time he and the other team members were executing the arrest warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Two of the officers testified that upon entering the house they detected a strong odor of marijuana, but Daniel testified that he detected no such odor, and the judge credited Daniel\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The niece saw one of the officers open a closet and iok through some sheets and towels, but there is no evidence that officers dis jvered contraband in this closet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The motion judge found that the officers proceeding to the third floor knew that Daniel had placed the defendant in custody. But those officers passed Daniel as they headed to the third floor and arrived there within \u201cthree to four minutes\u201d of entry and before the defendant was taken downstairs and placed in the cruiser. These facts distinguish this case from the unlawful \u201cprotective sweep\u201d in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nova, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 635 (2000), the case on which our dissenting colleague relies, in which police arrested the defendant, took him to the courthouse from which he had fled, and then returned to the apartment where they had arrested him and discovered contraband as they walked through the apartment looking into each of the rooms it contained.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b196-7\">Graham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcI\">(dissenting). At approximately 6 .m. on January 23, 2007, thirteen Springfield police officers led by police Lieutenant Rupert Daniel, entered the home of he defendant\u2019s mother (mother) and arrested the defendant on <em>\u00ed </em>warrant charging him with distribution of a class D substance As the majority notes, Daniel had information, prior to exe uting the warrant, that the only occupants of the home were ie mother, her seven year old niece, and the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Daniel nocked on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>door, spoke to the mother, and informed her of the warrant for the defendant. The mother pointed up the stairs and stated that the defendant was \u201cup there.\u201d Daniel, at that time, saw the defendant standing on the top of the stairs wearing a T-shirt and boxer shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The defendant ran into a room on the second floor, and Daniel followed the defendant, kicked in the door to the room, ordered the defendant to the floor, and handcuffed him without incident. Approximately ten minutes later, the defendant was taken outside and placed in a cruiser.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Several of the officers went past the second floor of the house to the attic, where they remained for one-half hour, knowing that the defendant had been arrested.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge made implicit findings of bad faith on the part of these officers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Clearly, the safety of police officers executing an arrest warrant is paramount. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 114, 119 (2007). However, as we said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nova, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 635 (2000), quoting from <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 334 (1990), \u201cthe [United States Supreme] Court concluded that in order to conduct even a cursory search of areas beyond the immediate arrest site (the so-called \u2018lunge area,\u2019 which defines the limits of a search incident to arrest, see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1), there must be \u2018articulable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>facts\u2019 that \u2018would warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing that the area to be swept harbors an inc vidual posing a danger to those on the'arrest scene.\u2019 \u201d Here, t\u00ed ; police knocked on the door of the mother\u2019s home, and she ai \u00a1wered the door. After the police entered the home, the mother vas at their side, and the defendant was clearly visible on the se ond floor. Thus, the police were immediately aware of the loca ions of the only adults in the home and had those individuals : i their sight. On this record, there were no \u201carticulable facts\u201d to support an inference that anyone was in the home at the time &lt; : the sweep who posed a danger to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Therefore, I would affirm the order of the m -tion judge, who properly concluded that, to the extent that t ie warrant here ultimately was obtained on the basis of observ tions made during the improper sweep search, all evidence o itained pursuant to that warrant must be suppressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\">In the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision she found that \u201c] aniel also testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>credibly that he had driven past the house prior to the raid and knew the defendant\u2019s mother, a seventeen-and-a half year employee of a communications company, and a small child lived in the house.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\"> \u201cThe credible evidence presented at the hearing supports a finding that the defendant was taken to a cruiser within ten minutes of his detention, and at the time he was barefoot, and wearing only a t-shirt and boxers.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u201cThis court does not credit [Officer] Mazza\u2019s testimony that he was unaware that the defendant had been detained, and thus he went to the third floor to locate the defendant. Daniel was the first officer into the house and up the stairs. All the other officers followed him and knew Daniel had entered the second-floor room and placed the defendant in custody.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b197-11\">\u201c0fficers Wadlegger and Mazza passed Daniel and proceeded to the attic on the third floor. Both officers testified that upon entering the house the police detected a strong odor of marijuana. When asked, however, Daniel credibly testified that he did not detect any odor of marijuana, and, in fact, looked in disbelief at the question. This court credits Daniel\u2019s testimony. . . . The court, however, also credits [the mother\u2019s] testimony that while she was on the second floor, she heard footsteps coming from the attic area and that the police were in that room for thirty minutes. Thus, this court can and does reasonably infer that the police conducted a search prior to obtaining the warrant.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
