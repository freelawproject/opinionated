He appeals from the dismissal by a judge of the Superior Court of his amended complaint, which sought review of a decision issued by the department\u2019s hearing board (board) confirming the imposition of a month\u2019s suspension by the department. The plaintiff contends that the judge erred in holding that the court lacked jurisdiction to review the board\u2019s decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\"><em>Background. </em>Notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s receipt of written notice of the board\u2019s decision, which informed him of his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>to appeal to the Civil Service Commission (commission), the plaintiff filed a complaint in Superior Court, asserting jurisdiction to review the board\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 42.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Statutory terms should be given effect consistent with their ordinary meaning and with regard to the intent of the Legislature, unless doing so \u201cwould achieve an illogical result.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). In addition, it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that no part of a statute \u201cis to be regarded as superfluous, but each is to be given its ordinary meaning . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967), quoting from <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946). Further, \u201c[i]n interpreting a statute, . . . [we] must consider the entire statutory scheme by looking to the language of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Arlington Contributory Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 15 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 437, 442 (2009). The plaintiff invoked three statutory provisions to support his application for relief directly to the Superior Court. We consider them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">1. <em>General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 41. </em>General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 41, permits an appointing authority to suspend an employee for more than five days only if there is \u201cjust cause\u201d or if the authority has secured the employee\u2019s written consent. The statute goes on to state that in order to suspend the employee for just cause, the appointing authority must meet specified procedural requirements, including written notice and a full hearing. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion, \u201cjust cause\u201d does not refer to the requirements imposed on the process; rather it is a separate underlying predicate for the imposition of a penalty. Otherwise stated, an appointing authority\u2019s satisfaction of all the procedural requirements listed in \u00a7 41 cannot support a result that is not also based on just cause. In this case, as an example, if it were demonstrated that another individual\u2019s test result had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>mistakenly substituted for the plaintiff\u2019s, his suspension would not be for \u201cjust cause\u201d regardless of the department\u2019s careful adherence to the notice and hearing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">2. <em>General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 42. </em>General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 42, as amended through St. 1981, c. 767, \u00a7 19, first addresses a claim that the appointing authority failed to follow the \u201crequirements\u201d of \u00a7 41. In such a case the employee is directed to file a complaint with the commission. \u201cRequirements\u201d refers, as we have stated, to the procedural requirements \u2014 time deadlines, notice, and hearing \u2014 of \u00a7 41. This is demonstrated by the second paragraph of \u00a7 42 which, having dealt with the \u201crequirements\u201d of \u00a7 41, goes on to provide that the claimant may <em>\u201cat the same time </em>request a hearing as to whether there was just cause for the action of the appointing authority\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The plaintiff relies on language contained in the third paragraph of \u00a7 42, which confers jurisdiction in the Supreme Judicial Court or the Superior Court \u201cover any civil action for the reinstatement of any person alleged to have been illegally discharged, removed, [or] suspended . . . .\u201d The term \u201cillegally discharged\u201d refers to a failure to meet the legal requirements of \u00a7 41, which, as we have stated, are procedural in nature. These requirements do not refer to the merits of the case; they are imposed for the benefit of the culpable and blameless alike. While this third paragraph arguably provides an alternative avenue to appeal a claim of procedural irregularity, we do not address that issue because the plaintiff makes no such claim. The plaintiff\u2019s claim that he has a valid prescription from his physician for the controlled substance for which he tested positive falls squarely within the category of a challenge for lack of just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">3. <em>General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 43. </em>Turning to section 43 of the statute, as amended by St. 1981, c. 767, \u00a7 20, we conclude that it applies to the plaintiff\u2019s case with precision. He is \u201ca person aggrieved by a decision[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] of an appointing authority made pursuant to section forty-one,\u201d and he must therefore \u201cappeal in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>writing to the commission.\u201d Further resolving any possible doubt, the second paragraph of section 43 specifically refers to the commission\u2019s need to determine whether there was \u201cjust cause for an action taken against such person\u201d in resolving an appeal under that provision. The plaintiff was required to appeal the decision \u201cwithin ten days after receiving written notice of such decision.\u201d He failed to do so even though the decision itself informed him of this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">To the extent that we do not address the defendant\u2019s other contentions, \u201cthey 'have not been overlooked. We find nothing in them that requires discussion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>Ryan R., </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 389 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 78 (1954).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The defendant, the city of Boston (city), filed a motion to dismiss the Superior Court action, maintaining that the court lacked jurisdiction as the plaintiff had failed to exhaust all administrative remedies by forgoing an appeal to the commission. Though the motion judge initially denied the motion, she ultimately granted the motion to dismiss on reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">We note again that the statute deals separately with substance and procedure. A person who achieves a desired result from an appointing authority, even one generated pursuant to a faulty process, is not a person \u201caggrieved by the decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the Boston fire department\u2019s hearing board is a State agency subject to the Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, and that the city\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the denial of the motion to dismiss was subject to the requirements of Mass.R.Civ.P. 59, 365 Mass. 827 (1974), and Mass.R.Civ.P. 60, 365 Mass. 828 (1974), which apply to final judgments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
