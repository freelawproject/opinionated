Clothier (Clothier) appeals from a judgment in favor of the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board (TRB) on claims alleging negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>misrepresentation, and negligent infliction of e notional distress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court concluded tha\u00a1 Clothier\u2019s action was barred by claim preclusion arising from <em>i </em>judgment in an earlier action wherein Clothier unsuccessfully challenged TRB\u2019s reduction of his retirement benefits. We affirr . the judgment in favor of the defendants on grounds different rom those relied on by the Superior Court judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Clothier worked as a teache in the New York State public school system from 1968 until 986. During that time, he earned a pension funded by contribi ions solely from his employer. After relocating to Massachusetts in 1986, Clothier became a public school teacher in the Martha\u2019s ineyard Regional School District and began contributing to tl s Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (MTRS).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In 1992, Clothier applied to the TRB for th \u25a0 purchase of ten years of creditable service in the MTRS pursui nt to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(4), on account of his prior public school :eaching in New York State. In his application, Clothier respcm led \u201cNo\u201d to the question that asked, \u201cDo you have retirement contributions on deposit in another state\u2019s retirement system?\u201d he TRB allowed the application, and Clothier purchased ten yc ars of creditable service in 1993, paying $18,502.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In 2000, Clothier became eligible and beg\u00a1 n to receive his New York State pension. In 2002, Clothier app led for superannuation retirement in Massachusetts and also &gt;egan to receive Massachusetts retirement benefits. During a r &gt;utine audit, the TRB discovered that, in contravention of G. ,. c. 32, \u00a7 3(4), Clothier was collecting a retirement benefit rom New York State and from Massachusetts for the same en-year service period on account of his purchase of credit for New York State service. Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20(5)(c)(2 i, the TRB cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>rected the double payment error, reduced Clothier\u2019s annual benefits, and refunded his service credit purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Clothier\u2019s appeal to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) from the reduction of his pension was unsuccessful, as was his appeal to the Superior Court, which determined that he was receiving all the retirements benefits to which he was entitled. Clothier did not appeal from the Superior Court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In 2006, Clothier instituted these claims under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Clothier\u2019s action, however characterized, is predicated on the contention that the TRB was negligent and misrepresented his eligibility to purchase service credit and his consequent retirement benefits. He asserts that as a result of TRB\u2019s negligence and misrepresentation he retired from Massachusetts earlier than he otherwise would have and that he suffered financial harm and emotional distress. We see no merit to his assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Clothier\u2019s claims rest on fundamentally flawed premises. The application question, \u201cDo you have retirement contributions on deposit in another state\u2019s retirement system?\u201d is neither a statement nor a factual representation as to his eligibility or entitlement to purchase service credit. See <em>Kitner </em>v. <em>CTW Transp., Inc., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 741, 749 (2002). Rather, it is a request for information to assist the TRB in determining his statutory eligibility to purchase credit for years of service in another State. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(4) (having contributions in another State\u2019s retirement system affects an individual\u2019s ability to purchase credit). Beyond failing to represent Clothier\u2019s eligibility to purchase credit, the question is neither false nor misleading. See <em>Gossels </em>v. <em>Fleet Natl. Bank, </em>453 Mass. 366, 372 (2009); <em>Townsends, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beaupre, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 747, 754-755 (1999). The question does not limit itself to <em>employee </em>contributions to the New York State retirement system, but asks whether contributions are \u201con deposit\u201d without differentiation as to source.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>More fundamentally, even if viewed as a stat ment of material fact, the application question is not something tl at Clothier could reasonably rely upon for guidance as to his eligi sility to purchase credit or the amount of his future pension. See <em>Barrington </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Authy., </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 301, 309 1989). Clothier\u2019s entitlement to retirement benefits and the amoun of such benefits is governed entirely by G. L. c. 32. See <em>Macka </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 924-925 (2002). Because the statute defines and limits the benefits o which Clothier and other like retirees are entitled, those ber ;fits are a legal determination that may not be enlarged, even )y an erroneous interpretation by the TRB or any of its emplo; ees. See <em>Phipps Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. </em>A, <em>thy., </em>387 Mass. 687, 693-694 (1982); <em>Bristol County Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 448-449 (2006). Consequently, Clothier can neither clan i entitlement to, nor reasonably rely upon, a retirement benefit w ten the statutory language does not provide for it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 697, 701 (2000); <em>Hollstein </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>47 Mass. <em>A</em>pp. Ct. 109, 111 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\n<em>Judgr ent affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Resolution of Margaret Clothier\u2019s claim for loss of coi sortium is governed in all material respects by our disposition of Clothier\u2019s cl. ims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">We pass over whether principles of claim preclusion or issue preclusion are fatal to Clothier\u2019s claims.

We also need not resolve the Commonwealth\u2019s coni intion that negligent misrepresentation is not a claim for \u201cinjury or loss of { -operty or personal injury\u201d as to which the Commonwealth has waived severe gn immunity under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, inserted by St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15, and C L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Although not necessary to our decision, we note that Clothier knew that his employer had made contributions to the New York State retirement system on his behalf and that he was entitled to a pension from New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">As resolved in his earlier action, Clothier is ineligible fc \u2022 the greater retirement benefits that he initially received.
