More specifically, the issue is whether the Commonwealth\u2019s documentary evidence was sufficient to tie the defendant to an undercover officer posing as a fifteen year old prostitute. The primary documentary evidence against the defendant consisted of (1) a printed copy of an electronic document provided by Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), an Internet service provider, linking him to a Yahoo account; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>(2) electronic mail (e-mail) correspondence allegedly between him and the officer. Fatal to the defendant were the actions he took in conformity with the information contained in those e-mails.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The defendant, Jeremy M. Amaral, was convicted of (1) attempted rape of a child, G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6, and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23; and (2) solicitation of a prostitute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appeals, arguing that the above evidence was wrongfully admitted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\"><em>Facts. </em>During the summer of 2007, State police Trooper Peter A. Cooke<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> began an undercover operation pretending to be a fifteen year old prostitute on Craigslist, an online bulletin board. Trooper Cooke used the screen name \u201cashley01_10_1992@yahoo. com\u201d (Ashley) and posted a message \u2014 \u201cyoung teen looking for a friend . . . email me if u wanna talk\u201d \u2014 in the \u201cerotic services\u201d section of Craigslist.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">On August 30, 2007, rdwmercury2006@yahoo.com (Jeremy) contacted Ashley and stated, \u201cMy name is Jeremy, I\u2019m 27 5\u20197\u201d 152 lbs. . . . [WJanna meet up?\u201d The two thereafter engaged in numerous brief e-mail communications, amounting to thirty-seven pages of text. In one, Ashley told Jeremy, \u201cI am a 15 year old female,\u201d to which Jeremy responded, \u201cHey, I\u2019m ok with it, but can I ask you why you wouldn\u2019t mind being friends with a 27 year old?\u201d Over the course of the communications, Ashley held herself out as a fifteen year old prostitute, and Jeremy sent a picture of himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">On the morning of September 17, 2007, Jeremy sent an e-mail stating that he was interested in meeting with Ashley later that day and sent her his telephone number. In anticipation of the meeting, Trooper Cooke engaged the assistance of a female <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>trooper, Anna Brookes, to pretend to be Ashley and call the telephone number Jeremy had provided to arrange a meeting at a local strip mall, near a convenience store, at 5:00 p.m. Trooper Brookes called the telephone number and addressed the other party as Jeremy, who stated that he wanted oral sex for fifty dollars. The arrangements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Prior to the meeting, Trooper Cooke learned that the telephone number he received from Jeremy was registered to a Jeremy Amaral. He also checked the records of the Registry of Motor Vehicles, which provided photographs of five or six individuals with the name Jeremy Amaral. Trooper Cooke compared the photograph sent from Jeremy to those received from the Registry: \u201cat that point I. . . still wasn\u2019t 100 percent that I. . . kn[e]w exactly who, but I had narrowed it down to a possible two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">At approximately 5:00 p.m. on September 17, 2007, after setting up surveillance, Trooper Cooke observed the defendant arrive in a car and park where Ashley had earlier directed him. The defendant then exited his car and walked in front of the stores in the strip mall, going into a few establishments. Trooper Cooke then asked Trooper Brookes to again call the defendant. When she did, Trooper Cooke observed the defendant answer his telephone. At that point, the defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Exhibit A. </em>At trial, to demonstrate that rdwmercury2006@yahoo.com was the defendant, the Commonwealth introduced, among other exhibits, exhibit A, which was a one-page document provided by Yahoo, labeled an account management tool, that indicated that the login name of rdwmercury2006 was registered to \u201cMr. Jeremy Amaral.\u201d An affidavit from the custodian of records for Yahoo, John P. Hernandez, accompanied the document.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the document is not a business record insofar as Yahoo \u201chas no interest in the truth of the information it stores but simply records whatever the user enters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Little need be said about business records other than that they are a well known exception to the hearsay rule. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 78, 79J; Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(6)(A) (2010). The foundational requirements of \u00a7 78 were met here,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the document was properly admitted. Further, \u201c[a] business record is admissible even when its preparer has relied on the statements of others because the personal knowledge of the entrant or maker affects only the weight of the record, not its admissibility.\u201d Note to Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803, at 271. See <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. 402, 406 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Although exhibit A was properly admitted, the next step is the evaluation of its weight. In this case, standing alone, the weight of exhibit A was relatively weak. \u201cMere identity of name is not sufficient to indicate an identity of person.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, </em>421 Mass. 295, 302 (1995). However, it gained strength when considered in conjunction with the other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">2. <em>Exhibit G. </em>Exhibit G consisted of the thirty-seven pages of e-mail communications between Jeremy and Ashley printed from Trooper Cooke\u2019s computer, in chronological order, starting from August 30, 2007. The defendant argues that they were not properly authenticated and did not conform to the best evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">a. <em>Authentication. </em>\u201cAn item offered in evidence must be what its proponent represents it to be. Authenticity is usually proved by testimony of a witness either (1) that the thing is what its proponent represents it to be, or (2) that circumstances exist which imply that the thing is what its proponent represents it to be.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>456 Mass. 857, 868 (2010) (quotations and citations omitted). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 901(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The actions of the defendant himself served to authenticate the e-mails. One e-mail indicated that Jeremy would be at a certain place at a certain time, and the defendant appeared at that place and time. In other e-mails, Jeremy provided his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>telephone number and photograph. When the trooper called that number, the defendant immediately answered his telephone, and the photograph was a picture of the defendant. These actions served to confirm that the author of the e-mails and the defendant were one and the same. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 901(b)(6).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>involving a MySpace social networking Web site account, is not to the contrary. \u201cAnalogizing a MySpace Web page to a telephone call, a witness\u2019s testimony that he or she has received an incoming call from a person claiming to be \u2018A,\u2019 <em>without more, </em>is insufficient evidence to admit the call as a conversation with \u2018A\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 869. Here, as explained above, there was more.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">b. <em>Best evidence. </em>The best evidence rule provides that \u201c[t]o prove the content of a writing or recording, but not a photograph, the original writing or recording is required, except as otherwise provided in these sections, or by common law or statute.\u201d Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">To the extent that a best evidence objection was even made below, we find the argument unavailing. First, it appears, as before, that the defendant is primarily questioning the authenticity of the e-mails. Second, it is questionable whether the best evidence rule is even applicable here. Trooper Cooke printed copies of communications he received. That somehow the best evidence is found in the Yahoo servers is doubtful, as is the need to bring in the computer drive itself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Third, \u201c[t]he significance of the best evidence rule has declined appreciably in recent decades. The rule predates the invention of photocopy machines and computers, and also the modem discovery rales.\u201d Brodin &amp; Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 10.2, at 603 (8th ed. 2007). Fourth, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79K, inserted by St. 1994, c. 168, \u00a7 1, permits the admission of a duplicate \u201ccomputer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>data file or program file.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 77 (1983) (\u201cbest evidence rule does not apply to photographs\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leneski, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 291, 294 (2006) (best evidence rule inapplicable to \u201cdigital images placed and stored in a computer hard drive and transferred to a compact disc\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>It appears patently clear that in the computer age, one may set up a totally fictitious e-mail account, falsely using the names and photographs of others. One could have set up an account improperly using the name and photograph of the defendant. Here, the Commonwealth painstakingly presented its case, introducing a number of documentary exhibits, many of which used the name of the defendant. It was not, however, in this case at least, until the defendant appeared as planned in the e-mail communications, expecting to meet and have sex with a fifteen year old prostitute, that his guilt was established.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The defendant was found not guilty of a third charge, enticing a child under the age of sixteen to engage in prostitution, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>26C(b).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-10\">The defendant also claims error in the jury instructions. Read in their entirety, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glacken, </em>451 Mass. 163, 168-169 (2008), the instructions adequately conveyed to the jury the need to find that the fictitious female was under the age of sixteen. Additionally, her age was never an issue at trial.
