She also appeals from the judge\u2019s denial of her request for attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\"><em>Background. </em>What follows are the relevant facts on appeal, drawn from the judge\u2019s findings and supported by evidence that the judge deemed credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The husband and wife were married in October of 1995. They are the parents of two sons, the first bom on January 7, 1999, and the second on March 24, 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the first few years of their marriage, the wife worked at a bank, earning around $20,000 annually. After the birth of their first child, the wife stopped working in order to care for the children. At the time of the divorce proceeding, she was once again employed at a bank, earning around $450 per week. The husband has worked throughout the marriage and was earning around $1,900 per week at the time of trial. The marital home has an agreed-upon value of $440,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The judge heard testimony, which he credited, about several unusual incidents that took place in 2006. The wife\u2019s former coworker, Jill Scibelli, testified as to a conversation she had with the wife on February 23, 2006, during which the wife indicated she was unhappy with her husband and asked if Scibelli\u2019s husband could \u201ctake care of a problem\u201d for her by \u201cget[ting] rid of something.\u201d When Scibelli responded that her husband was simply a chef and could not help with that sort of \u201cproblem,\u201d the wife asked Scibelli if her husband was related to someone who could help. The judge found that Scibelli believed the wife was seeking assistance in having the husband killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Both parties testified about an incident that occurred on March 3 and 4, 2006, with the judge largely crediting the husband\u2019s testimony about this and other matters. The husband and wife had traveled to Texas on holiday with their children. They rented a houseboat, where they planned to stay for three days while other family members cared for the children. The husband had been ill for several days and had not consumed much food. Although he had been abstaining from alcohol for several years, the wife made alcoholic beverages for them both to drink on the houseboat, and the husband consumed them willingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">At a certain point, the wife went below deck and the husband was left alone above deck. The husband next remembers standing on the lower deck near the cabin entrance, feeling cold and wet. The husband then found himself in the water, where he had to swim one mile to shore and walk for several hours before he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>found help. Although the husband testified that he felt a hand push him from the boat, the judge found it as likely that he had fallen from both decks, due to his weakened condition. The judge found that the wife bore responsibility for encouraging his unwise consumption of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The husband suffered severe injuries from the fall, including a broken nose, upper jaw, and right wrist; four broken teeth; and a \u201cblown out\u201d knee. He was initially treated in a Texas hospital but returned to Massachusetts on March 9, 2006. Upon return from Texas, but before his corrective surgery, the husband slept on the couch because the sound of his breathing bothered the wife. Shortly thereafter, the wife asked him to move out of the family home altogether. Because the husband was still recovering from his injuries and on pain medication, he had difficulty transporting himself from the family home (where he would spend his days) to his mother\u2019s home (where he slept). The judge credited the husband\u2019s testimony that he would have preferred to stay at the family home during recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The wife\u2019s cousin, John Jamroz, also testified credibly at the divorce proceeding regarding a conversation he had with the wife on March 11, 2006, days after the parties had returned from Texas. Specifically, Jamroz testified that the wife had approached him and told him she did not want to be married and she wanted her husband to \u201cdisappear.\u201d She asked Jamroz if he knew anyone in the \u201cMafia\u201d or anyone who needed money, and said she wanted something done permanently. Jamroz went to the State police and reported this incident, and criminal charges were eventually brought against the wife. On June 29, 2007, a jury convicted the wife of solicitation to commit murder,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and she served three months in a house of correction before being released on parole.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The judge made several other findings that are relevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>parties\u2019 conduct and contribution to the marriage. The judge credited testimony from Guy Dionne, who acknowledged having had a sexual affair with the wife for several weeks in the fall of 2005. The judge also found that the wife had pursued a foolhardy landscaping plan for the marital home in the late 1990s, which violated town regulations and cost the parties $14,000 to remedy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The wife incurred around $24,000 in medical bills for plastic surgery procedures during the marriage, to which the husband acquiesced but which he did not believe were necessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge found that the wife was responsible for the care of the children during the day, as well as the majority of the running of the household (cooking, cleaning, shopping, laundry, lawn care, and bill paying). However, the husband took over child care duties at night when he returned from work, including caring for the children if they woke in the middle of the night. The husband is now solely responsible for child care and maintenance of the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Distribution of assets. </em>When dividing the marital estate, \u201ca judge must make findings indicating that he has considered all factors relevant under [G. L. c. 208,] \u00a7 34, and has not considered any irrelevant factors.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Bowring </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>399 Mass. 265, 267 (1987). In this case, the judge addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>each required \u00a7 34 factor within his 114 findings of fact,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the wife\u2019s argument to the contrary is without merit. However, we do pause to consider the wife\u2019s argument that the judge abused his discretion by giving undue weight to her criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The judge had broad discretion as to the division of property, <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Kittredge, </em>441 Mass. 28, 43-44 (2004), and we will only disturb his rulings if they are plainly wrong and excessive. <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>398 Mass. 102, 107 (1986). In support of her argument that the judge abused his broad discretion, the wife points both to the disproportionate distribution of assets as well as to the judge\u2019s statement that the \u201cconviction of a spouse of the crime of soliciting the murder of the other spouse\u201d was \u201cexceptional\u201d conduct that shocked the conscience of the court and would \u201chave an impact on the \u2018conduct\u2019 factor under [\u00a7 34] irrespective of \u2018economic impact.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\u201c \u2018Conduct\u2019 that has harmed the <em>marriage or the marital estate </em>may be viewed negatively, and considered as a factor that would diminish that spouse\u2019s equitable share of marital property\u201d; however, \u201c[a]n equitable division of marital property\u201d is not intended \u201cto punish \u2018bad\u2019 behavior or enforce the criminal laws\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Kittredge, </em>441 Mass. at 38. In this case, while the judge\u2019s harsh tone regarding the wife\u2019s criminal conviction may have been unnecessary to resolve the division of marital assets, it is nonetheless clear from his award and findings that he gave appropriate weight to each \u00a7 34 factor, including the wife\u2019s egregious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Although this case is highly unusual due to the gravity of the marital misconduct involved, we cannot say the judge erred in considering the effect that the wife\u2019s bad actions had on the emotional health of the marriage and family. Consideration of much less egregious conduct under \u00a7 34 has been approved. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. 30, 36-37 (1982) (argument that \u201cthe judge placed too much emphasis on the husband\u2019s conduct during the marriage,\u201d including his extramarital affair, was not meritorious because weight given each \u00a7 34 factor is \u201cmerely an aspect of the exercise of [the judge\u2019s] broad discretion in the distribution of the property\u201d); <em>Warman </em>v. <em>Warman, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 80, 81 (1985) (rejecting wife\u2019s assertion that \u201cany alleged moral failing on her part was unwarrantably measured\u201d); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 955, 956 (1986) (judge properly considered \u201chusband\u2019s abusive conduct, both physical and mental\u201d); <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 117, 120 (1988) (judgment affirmed where judge considered fact that \u201c[a]t times, early in the marriage, the husband was abusive to the wife\u201d); <em>Handrahan </em>v. <em>Handrahan, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 167, 170 (1989) (appropriate to consider \u201cnegligible contribution of the husband to the marriage on either an emotional or economic level\u201d); <em>Ruml </em>v. <em>Ruml, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 510 &amp; n.16 (2000) (challenge to disproportionate division would have been fruitless where, in part, \u201c[t]he judge concluded . . . that there should be an unequal distribution of assets, because the husband had financially and emotionally abandoned his family\u201d [footnote omitted]).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Moreover, the judge did not consider the wife\u2019s misconduct solely for its negative emotional impact on the marriage. Specifically, the judge noted that the wife\u2019s effort to have her husband murdered \u2014 about which the judge heard live testimony, rather than simply relying on the fact of her conviction \u2014 \u201ccaused [the husband] to take on total responsibility for the children\u2019s care\u201d; \u201cmakes [the husband] totally responsible for maintaining the parties\u2019 home\u201d; and will \u201calways\u201d adversely affect the husband as it \u201cdiminishes his ability to be totally focused on life and work issues.\u201d Along with the wife\u2019s responsibility for the misguided $14,000 land use expenditure, these were the factors that the judge considered \u201cprimary.\u201d The judge explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>that the husband is now the sole caregiver and homemaker because of the wife\u2019s conduct: her murderous impulse made it best \u201cto terminate all future economic and personal dealings between the parties.\u201d (The judge here quoted from Kindregan &amp; Inker, Family Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 40:7, at 26 [3d ed. 2002], citing <em>Rolde </em>v. <em>Rolde, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 [1981]). Thus, this is not a case where the judge has failed \u201cto consider and explain the effect of an important fact.\u201d <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>398 Mass. at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Although the judge did give much weight to the wife\u2019s misconduct, this is also not a case in which the award was based \u201cpurely on the basis of the blameworthy conduct of one of the spouses.\u201d <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 16 (1977). The judge considered \u201c[t]he parties\u2019 respective contributions to the marital partnership,\u201d <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 157 (1996), including the wife\u2019s role as a homemaker during the day and the husband\u2019s responsibility for child care after work. The judge also considered the wife\u2019s responsibility for the husband\u2019s facial injuries, her callousness during his recovery, her plastic surgery expenditures, the cost associated with her poor landscaping decision, the length of the marriage, and the fact that neither spouse had any significant outstanding debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Neither does the disproportionate division of assets necessarily indicate, as the wife argues, that the division is inequitable. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Massa, </em>431 Mass. 619, 632 (2000), quoting from <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 118-119 (\u201c[A]n imbalance in contributions may have an effect on the distribution\u201d). Section 34 allows that the judge \u201cmay assign to either husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other, including but not limited to, . . . rights and funds accrued during the marriage . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, as amended by St. 1990, c. 467. We are mindful that \u201c[a]mong the objectives of a financial award is providing means, to the extent the marital assets allow, which enable the parties to approximate the standard of living enjoyed during marriage.\u201d <em>Denninger </em>v. <em>Denninger, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 429, 430 (1993). However, we have affirmed a division of property which left one spouse unable \u201cto live in totally the same way on his present assets\u201d as he did during the marriage. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Here, the judge recognized that the wife is in \u201can unenviable financial position,\u201d but again explained that her position is a result of her own negative contributions to the marriage (in this case, criminal conduct by which she sought to \u201cunlawfully terminate the marital partnership,\u201d and \u201cwaste relative to the land use issue\u201d). The wife is employed and able to support herself on her salary,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> while the husband must, because of the wife\u2019s egregious acts, meet virtually all the needs of himself and the children. Irrespective of whether we might have applied the same calculus, this disproportionate award does \u201cfollow logically from the judge\u2019s findings,\u201d and therefore we cannot say it is an abuse of the judge\u2019s broad discretion. <em>Denninger </em>v. <em>Denninger, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 434 &amp; n.4 (disproportionate award of assets to wife not equitable where, among other things, the husband\u2019s conduct \u201chardly resemble[s] the abusive conduct given weight in <em>[Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>and <em>Handrahan </em>v. <em>Handrahan, supra]\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Lastly, the judge did not err, as the wife asserts, by failing to award the wife any antique furniture from the home or the jewelry the wife claims is in the husband\u2019s possession (but about which there was no trial testimony). \u201cA judge has broad discretion in dealing with the division of property incident to a divorce, including items of a personal nature,\u201d and the judge\u2019s failure to award the wife any furniture or jewelry here was not \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d <em>Ruml </em>v. <em>Ruml, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 514 (judge was not plainly wrong in failing to award husband \u201chis personal property, including clothes, shoes, and diplomas\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">2. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The wife complains that the judge\u2019s failure to award her additional attorney\u2019s fees was an abuse of his discretion. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 132 (2005) (\u201cWe will not disturb an order awarding attorney\u2019s fees except upon a showing of an abuse of that discretion\u201d). A judge has broad discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38, and, it follows, broad discretion to deny an award. <em>Ross </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. at 39, quoting from <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>361 Mass. 733, 738 (1972) (judge\u2019s award is \u201cpresumed to be right and ordinarily ought not to be disturbed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Here, during the proceedings the wife received some $13,000 from the marital estate for her legal fees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The wife points to no case, and we are aware of none, in which the failure to award attorney\u2019s fees, let alone additional attorney\u2019s fees, under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38, has constituted abuse of discretion. <em>Galluzzo </em>v. <em>Galluzzo, 12 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 890, 891 (1981) (\u201c[T]he wife fails to direct our attention to authority to establish that the failure to award attorney\u2019s fees in a case such as this was an abuse of discretion\u201d). Had the judgment included an additional award of attorney\u2019s fees to the husband or wife, findings as to the reasonableness of that award would be necessary, see <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 538 (1985), but it does not follow that, having established the reasonableness of her attorney\u2019s fees, the wife is entitled to receive an award. See <em>Drapek </em>v. <em>Drapek, </em>399 Mass. 240, 248 (1987) (\u201c[The wife] claims that she should have been awarded attorney\u2019s fee[s]. General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 38, allows the judge, in his discretion, to award counsel fees to either party in a divorce proceeding. ... In the present case the judge acted within his discretion in declining to award the wife attorney\u2019s fees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Tbe wife does not challenge those parts of the divorce judgment awarding the husband sole physical and legal custody of the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">She was also convicted of violating two G.

We conclude that the judge\u2019s findings are largely supported by the evidence and any small discrepancies are harmless. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Massa, </em>431 Mass. 619, 631 (2000) (\u201c[T]he mistakes are not of material significance because they do not alter the larger picture of the marriage\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The wife urges this court to give weight to several out-of-State cases that address criminal conduct within the context of divorce. See, e.g., <em>Mosbarger </em>v. <em>Mosbarger, </em>547 So. 2d 188 (Fla. 1989); <em>D\u2019Arc </em>v. <em>D\u2019Arc, </em>164 N.J. Super. 226 (1978); <em>Brancoveanu </em>v. <em>Brancoveanu, </em>145 A.D.2d 395 (N.Y. 1988). Because these cases construe statutes dissimilar in material respects to G.

Compare <em>Caccia </em>v. <em>Caccia, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 382 (1996). Moreover, the prospect of alimony is not foreclosed to the wife, should she in the future find herself in different circumstances. See <em>Kinosian </em>v. <em>Kinosian, </em>351 Mass. 49, 52 (1966); <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>13 Mass.

How the $13,000 awarded for fees was in fact expended is not explained. In any event, the wife has presented no compelling argument that this discrepancy regarding the source of Attorney Sclafani\u2019s payment renders the judge\u2019s decision not to award additional fees erroneous.
