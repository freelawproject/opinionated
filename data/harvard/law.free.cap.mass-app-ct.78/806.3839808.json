See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, as appearing in St. 2004, c. 125, \u00a7 13 (Tips Act or Act). The matter is before us on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from a summary judgment dismissing all the claims in their (amended) class action complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The plaintiffs are bartenders who prepared and served alcoholic and other beverages for guests at special functions held at the defendants\u2019 hotel, the Cape Codder Resort and Spa, at various times between February 1, 2003, and November 27, 2006. The defendants (hotel) in that period assessed function event customers an additional charge of eighteen or nineteen percent of the amount invoiced for food and beverages. The charge appeared on the invoices below the charge for food and beverages and above the total charged. The hotel identified this charge on the invoices (and also on function contracts and function menus) simply as an \u201cadministrative fee,\u201d without providing further written explanation or description.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The plaintiffs contend that the \u201cadministrative fee\u201d imposed by the hotel was in fact a \u201cservice charge\u201d as defined in the 2004 version of the Tips Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because it was \u201ca fee that a patron or other consumer would reasonably expect to be given to a wait staff employee, service employee, or service bartender.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the \u201cadministrative fee\u201d was such a service charge, then the hotel violated the statute by failing to distribute the proceeds to the plaintiffs.

App. Ct. 665, 669-670 (2010). Given the procedural posture, the motion judge was not in a position to make factual findings to which we need defer, and his legal analysis, while of great interest to us, is not binding upon us. See <em>Clean Harbors, Inc. </em>v. <em>John Hancock Life Ins. Co., </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 347, 357 n.9 (2005). Many of the material facts are undisputed, and for summary judgment purposes, we view the evidence as to any disputed facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as the nonmoving parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Gennari </em>v. <em>Reading Pub.

The 2004 amendment replaced in its entirety the predecessor act, last amended in 1983, and expanded both the scope and the protections afforded by the predecessor act. Both versions, however, share the same basic purpose \u2014 to protect the wages and tips of certain employees who fall within the ambit of the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 492. \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the Act can be plainly discerned from its language and history \u2014 to ensure that service employees receive the tips, gratuities, and service charges that <em>customers intend </em>them to receive\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The 2004 amendment, like the predecessor Act, essentially imposes strict civil liability upon the employer, which, irrespective of its intent, will suffer the consequences<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> if, as the result of its statutory noncompliance, protected employees do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>receive the tips, gratuities, and service charges to which they are entitled. See <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Converged Access, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 582, 591-592 (2009); <em>Cooney </em>v. <em>Compass Group Foodservice, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 638-639 (2007).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition to defining key terms and setting forth what employers may and may not do with respect to tips and service charges, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 152A(g) of the Tips Act,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cdemonstrating] that the Legislature was cognizant, in general, of the risk that employers or other persons may seek to find ways ... to attempt to avoid compliance with the Act, and intended to thwart such schemes.\u201d <em>DiFiore, supra </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The hotel maintains that it is in compliance with the Act, as the \u00a7 152A(&lt;7) safe harbor provision permits an employer to impose on a patron \u201cany house or administrative fee in addition to or instead of a service charge or tip, if the employer provides a designation or written description of that house or administrative fee, which informs the patron that the fee does not represent a tip or service charge for wait staff employees, service employees, or service bartenders.\u201d The hotel argues, and the motion judge agreed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>that mere \u201cdesignation\u201d of the charge as an \u201cadministrative fee,\u201d without more, is enough to bring the charge within the \u00a7 <em>152A(d) </em>safe harbor provision because the statute should be read as permitting an employer <em>either </em>to provide a \u201cdesignation\u201d <em>or </em>to provide a \u201cwritten description\u201d of the fee that expressly informs the patron that the fee is not a tip or service charge for wait staff. On this view, by the very act of identifying the charge as an \u201cadministrative fee,\u201d the hotel was automatically exempted from any statutory requirement to pay to protected employees amounts thereby collected, regardless of whether patrons reasonably believed the charge to be in the nature of a gratuity for such employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The plaintiffs, in contrast, contend that to come within this statutory safe harbor (i.e., to impose upon patrons a fee that categorically cannot be considered a \u201cservice charge\u201d or \u201ctip\u201d as defined in \u00a7 152A[aj), the employer must do more than just label a charge as an \u201cadministrative fee\u201d or a \u201chouse fee.\u201d On this view, whether the employer provides the customer a \u201cdesignation\u201d of such a fee or a \u201cwritten description\u201d of the fee charged, it must in either event do so in a way that informs the patron that the fee so designated or described does not represent a tip or service charge for the protected employees. For the reasons that follow, we think the reading of the statute urged by the plaintiffs is the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">As in DiFiore, \u201cfamiliar principles of statutory construction guide our interpretation. We look to the intent of the Legislature \u2018ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, 361 </em>Mass. 360, 364 (1975), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). In addition, our respect for the Legislature\u2019s considered judgment dictates that we interpret the statute to be sensible, rejecting unreasonable interpretations unless the clear meaning of the language requires such an interpretation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>428 Mass. 860, 865 (1999), quoting <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982) (\u2018we must read the statute in a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>to give it a sensible meaning\u2019). Where possible, we construe the various provisions of a statute in harmony with one another, recognizing that the Legislature did not intend internal contradiction. <em>Locator Servs. Group, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>443 Mass. 837, 859 (2005).\u201d <em>DiFiore, </em>454 Mass. at 490-491.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We engage first with the text of the \u00a7 <em>152A(d) </em>safe harbor provision (see note 8, <em>supra), </em>attending in particular to the grammar and punctuation of the relevant language. The hotel chiefly relies for its proposed reading of the provision on the last antecedent rule, \u201cthe general rule of statutory as well as grammatical construction that a modifying clause is confined to the last antecedent unless there is something in the subject matter or dominant purpose which requires a different interpretation.\u201d <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 133 (1949), quoting from <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>287 Mass. 542, 547 (1934). Citing to this rule, the hotel maintains that the phrase, \u201cwhich informs the patron that the fee does not represent a tip or service charge,\u201d should modify only the last antecedent, \u201cwritten description of that house or administrative fee,\u201d and should not modify the first antecedent, \u201cdesignation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The rule, however, has little ready application here since its common and most powerful use occurs where a list of multiple, distinct antecedents precedes the modifying clause.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Druzik, supra </em>at 132-133; <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Brookline Rent Control Bd., </em>385 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Mass. 228, 230-232 (1982); <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 646 n.2, 650 (2010). See generally 2A Singer &amp; Singer, Statutes &amp; Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:33 (7th ed. 2007), collecting cases. In this case, there is no such list of distinct antecedents preceding the modifying clause, but rather a single phrase (\u201ca designation or written description of that house or administrative fee\u201d) consisting of two terms (\u201cdesignation or written description\u201d) that are not separated by a comma. The absence of a comma suggests that the Legislature intended the words \u201cof that house or administrative fee\u201d to modify both \u201cdesignation\u201d and \u201cwritten description.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 81 (2007) (punctuation, though not determinative of legislative intent, may be considered as indication of purpose of legislation).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">A more pertinent grammatical rule is provided by Justice Brand\u00e9is, writing for the United States Supreme Court in <em>Porto Rico Ry., Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Mor, </em>253 U.S. 345, 348 (1920): \u201cWhen several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.\u201d In keeping with this rule, we read \u00a7 <em>152A(d) </em>as containing a single antecedent clause (\u201ca designation or written description of that house or administrative fee\u201d) followed by a general modifying clause that applies to the entire antecedent clause (\u201cwhich informs the patron that the fee does not represent a tip or service charge for wait staff employees, service employees, or service bartenders\u201d). This reading neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>\u201cadd[s] words to the statute that the Legislature did not see fit to put there,\u201d <em>Cooney, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 638, nor renders superfluous any words that the Legislature did see fit to include, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wellesley Toyota Co., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 733, 735 (1984).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">This reading is buttressed by examining it in the context of the statute as a whole and, especially, in connection with \u00a7 152A(a), which defines the term \u201cservice charge\u201d (see note 6, <em>supra). </em>The definition includes two ways in which an employer-imposed fee to patrons may constitute a service charge that must be remitted to protected employees. First, \u201cany fee designated as a service charge, tip, [or] gratuity\u201d \u2014 regardless of the employer\u2019s, employee\u2019s, or patron\u2019s intent or expectation \u2014 is automatically rendered a \u201cservice charge\u201d under the current Tips Act. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A(a). See <em>Cooney, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 637 (interpreting prior version of Act as meaning that \u201cany fee that the invoicing entity chooses to call a \u2018service charge\u2019 on an invoice for food or beverage service [is] the functional equivalent of a tip or gratuity, thereby subjecting the fee to the statute\u201d). Second, \u201ca fee that a patron or other consumer would reasonably expect to be given to a wait staff employee, service employee, or service bartender in lieu of, or in addition to, a tip\u201d also constitutes a \u201cservice charge.\u201d Section 152A(a) notably does not exclude from this category of \u201cservice charge\u201d a fee designated as an \u201cadministrative\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d fee under \u00a7 <em>152A(d), </em>leaving open the possibility that a patron, depending on the particular cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>cumstances, would reasonably expect such a fee to be given to protected employees.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In support of its reading of the language at issue, the hotel argues that just as any charge designated by an employer as a \u201cservice charge, tip, [or] gratuity\u201d under \u00a7 152A(a) must be automatically remitted to protected employees, so too must any charge designated an \u201cadministrative fee\u201d or \u201chouse fee\u201d automatically fall under the safe harbor provision of \u00a7 152A(d). We discern no such equivalence in the effect of the terms, either as a practical matter or in the context of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The terms \u201ctip\u201d and \u201cservice charge\u201d are defined in the statute and are generally well understood as being in the nature of a gratuity. \u201c[A] customer reasonably would expect a fee \u2018designated as a service charge\u2019 to be given to service employees . . . .\u201d <em>DiFiore, </em>454 Mass. at 494. In contrast, the terms \u201chouse fee\u201d and \u201cadministrative fee,\u201d notably undefined in the statute, are not self-explanatory and do not enjoy a uniform or commonly understood meaning. Depending on the context and absent further explanation, a \u201chouse fee\u201d could as easily be understood to be one imposed for services provided by house staff as it could one imposed in connection with, say, facilities maintenance. Likewise, a fee labeled an \u201cadministrative fee,\u201d particularly one like that at issue here in the eighteen or nineteen percent range, could refer to a service fee collected by the employer for distribution to the service staff, as well as to such things as general overhead and restocking costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The employer\u2019s designation of a fee as a \u201chouse\u201d or \u201cadministrative\u201d fee, then, neither indicates whether all or any part of the fee is in the nature of a gratuity nor necessarily comports with customer expectations. Section <em>152A(d) </em>of the Tips Act requires an employer to do something more than simply label a fee as \u201chouse\u201d or \u201cadministrative,\u201d in order to dispel the possibility that a patron would reasonably believe that the fee is a gratuity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Interpreting \u00a7 <em>152A(d) </em>as we have done renders it consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>with and complementary to \u00a7 152A(a), and preserves the plain patron-centric focus of both \u00a7 152A(a) and \u00a7 152A(&lt;\u00bf) as to the nature of the employer-imposed fee. \u201cWhere two statutory provisions relate to the same subject matter, . . . \u2018they should be construed together so as to constitute an harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>425 Mass. 523, 525 (1997), quoting from <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981). The hotel\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 <em>152A(d), </em>on the other hand, would lead to the untenable result that fees designated, without more, as \u201cadministrative\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d fees would never qualify as service charges under \u00a7 152A(a), despite the fact that patrons might, in some circumstances, reasonably believe them to be service charges. Such an interpretation, shielding potential abuses within the safe harbor of \u00a7 152A(c?), would fly in the face of the \u201cexpress purpose\u201d of the Act: to \u201cprotect gratuity payments given to, or intended for, service employees.\u201d <em>DiFiore, </em>454 Mass. at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that summary judgment was incorrectly entered for the hotel, which did not establish as matter of law that it had satisfied the requirements of the \u00a7 <em>152A(d) </em>safe harbor or that the designated \u201cadministrative fee\u201d it billed and collected within the relevant period was not a \u201cservice charge\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 152A(\u00ab). There are material issues of fact in dispute, including whether the hotel informed relevant patrons that the administrative fee was not in the nature of a tip or gratuity. We accordingly reverse the summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claims<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and remand the matter for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">In addition to bringing a claim pursuant to G.

The plaintiffs proffered evidence, sufficient to raise a material factual issue, that some customers made statements tending to show they had not been so notified, and that some patrons became upset when the wait staff left out \u201ctip jars\u201d or otherwise implied that they would appreciate \u201cadditional\u201d gratuities. The hotel contends on appeal that the statements in the affidavits proffered by the plaintiffs in this regard are beyond our consideration because they contain inadmissible hearsay. The argument is flawed because the hotel has failed to demonstrate that it objected to or moved to strike these statements in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>affidavits. See <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., </em>433 Mass. 323, 324 n.2 (2001); <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>46 Mass.

However, contrary to the hotel\u2019s apparent suggestion, the pay differential is immaterial to our analysis of the issue on appeal. See <em>Somers, </em>454 Mass. at 591-592 (\u201cNor would we be persuaded by a restaurant employer\u2019s argument that, despite the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 152A, it should not be required to pay its wait staff the fee charged customers as a designated service charge because, had it realized that it had this obligation, it would have paid the wait staff a lower hourly wage\u201d), citing <em>Cooney, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 638-639.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 152A(g), provides, \u201cNo employer or person shall by a special contract with an employee or by any other means exempt itself from this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The hotel has not invoked the rule of lenity to argue that it should receive a beneficial interpretation because criminal penalties are available under the statute. That argument would fail in any event, because in our view, the provisions of the Act in question do not possess the requisite ambiguity. See <em>DiFiore, </em>454 Mass. at 497 n.12 (assuming rule of lenity applies in civil action when statutory violation may trigger criminal penalties, rule was not applicable because definition of \u201cservice charge\u201d was not ambiguous in context of entire Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\">As with other canons of construction, the last antecedent rule is not always outcome determinative. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 82 (2007). Indeed, the rule itself states the exception since it will not apply when \u201cthere is something in the subject matter or dominant purpose which requires a different interpretation.\u201d <em>Druzik, </em>324 Mass. at 133, quoting from <em>Hopkins, </em>287 Mass. at 547. See <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>324 Mass. 309, 312-314 (1949) (refusing to apply last antecedent rule when doing so would conflict with dominant purpose of statute); <em>Bynes </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 264, 271 (1991) (same); <em>Taylor, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>81-82 (same). Where the dominant purpose of the Tips Act is to \u201cprotect gratuity payments given to, or intended for, service employees,\u201d <em>DiFiore, </em>454 Mass. at 496, application of the last antecedent rule here would not serve the Act\u2019s dominant purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The hotel\u2019s reading necessarily would leave the term \u201cdesignation\u201d entirely unmodified, an unlikely legislative drafting choice given that the term is not defined or described elsewhere in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Moreover, the presence of a comma prior to the modifying clause (\u201c, which informs . . .\u201d) is some indication that the clause is meant to apply to more than just the immediate predecessor. See 2A Singer &amp; Singer, Statutes &amp; Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:33 (7th ed. 2007) (\u201cEvidence that a qualifying phrase is supposed to apply to all antecedents instead of only to the immediately preceding one may be found in the fact that it is separated from the antecedents by a comma\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The hotel\u2019s contention that the reading we adopt would render superfluous the words \u201cdesignation or\u201d is unpersuasive. The hotel argues, in essence, that the term \u201cdesignation\u201d would lack purpose and be subsumed in the term \u201cwritten description\u201d if an employer choosing the words \u201chouse fee\u201d or \u201cadministrative fee\u201d as its designation of a charge was otherwise required to inform the patron that the fee does not represent a tip or service charge. The Legislature gave employers the option of designating charges or of forgoing labels and instead providing a written description, such as \u201cmiscellaneous charges for overhead, facility upkeep and restocking.\u201d We fail to see how the designation option is made superfluous by requiring that employers who select the designation option, but choose words of designation that fail to inform patrons that the charge is not a gratuity, must provide a written description that does so inform. We also observe that the Act does not explicitly require a \u201cdesignation\u201d to be in writing to be effective, just that it be \u201cprovidefd]\u201d and that it \u201cinform[]\u2019\u2019 the patron in the statutory sense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Here, in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the summary judgment record supports sending the case to the jury on the question of reasonable patron expectation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b851-10\">We note that the Attorney General, charged with administering the Tips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Act, issued an advisory concerning this aspect of \u00a7 152A(&lt;f). Conformably with our reading of the statutory language, the advisory states, \u201cEmployers may propose an additional fee, or a fee in place of a service charge. This fee may be identified as an administrative, house or other fee and may be retained or distributed by the employer at its discretion. It must be evident to customers that this fee is not a gratuity, tip or service charge.\u201d Advisory 2004/3, An Advisory from the Attorney General\u2019s Fair Labor and Business Practices Division on an Act Protecting the Wages and Tips of Certain Employees, at 3-4. Given its applicability to the matter before us, we \u201cgrant [the Attorney General\u2019s] interpretation substantial deference and will not disturb it where the interpretation is reasonable,\u201d as here. <em>DiFiore, </em>454 Mass. at 496 n.11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The summary judgment dismissed all the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, including the common-law claims. Regarding the latter, the judge\u2019s decision and the hotel\u2019s arguments advance no rationale for dismissal other than that these claims derive from the Tips Act claim. Thus, whether or not the common-law claims are in fact derivative, given our decision on the Tips Act claim, we reverse the judgment as to the common-law claims as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
