L. c. 152, \u00a7 7(1), applies to additional assault pay benefits to be awarded to correction officers pursuant to G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A, as amended by St. 1977, c. 1002, and St. 1970, c. 800. Members of AFSCME, Council 93, Local 419 (union), who are employed by the sheriff of Suffolk County (sheriff), sought declaratory and injunctive relief to impose the fourteen-day limitation on the sheriff\u2019s review of their claims for assault pay benefits. A Superior Court judge denied the union\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and entered judgment for the sheriff. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>As provided by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7(1), amended by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 18, correction officers, like other employees injured on the job, are entitled to an initial decision regarding workers\u2019 compensation benefits within fourteen days of their claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Legislature, by separate statutes, also provided for additional benefits to correction officers injured in the line of duty, if the injury is the result of violence by a prisoner or patient. G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and St. 1970, c. 800.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These additional assault pay benefits cover the difference between the weekly amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits the employee is entitled to receive and the employee\u2019s regular salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The union contends that because the assault pay statutes condition assault pay benefits on the employee\u2019s entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the time deadlines in the workers\u2019 compensation statute apply as well. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Neither G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A, nor St. 1970, c. 800, contains an express requirement that the initial determination of eligibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>for assault pay benefits be made within the fourteen-day time frame specified in the workers\u2019 compensation statute. If the Legislature intended to require assault pay benefits to be paid in the same time and manner as workers\u2019 compensation benefits, we would expect the statutes to contain such requirements. See <em>Alves\u2019s </em>Case, 451 Mass. 171, 179-180 (2008) (when interpreting a statute, we presume that the Legislature intended and understood all the consequences of its language). Indeed, the Legislature has precisely described the time and manner of payment of special workplace injury benefits to those in other hazardous public safety occupations, such as fire fighters and police officers under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>407 Mass. 70, 75 (1990) (Legislature\u2019s omission of language in one statute, and inclusion of same language in other statutes, indicates that Legislature in fact intended to omit that language where it is absent). Under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, inserted by St. 1952, c. 419, payments must \u201cbe paid at the same times and in the same manner as, and for all purposes shall be deemed to be, the regular compensation of such police officer or fire fighter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The language the Legislature did include in G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A, and St. 1970, c. 800, does not support application of the fourteen-day rule to assault pay determinations as advocated by the union. Rather, the statutes condition assault pay on the employee being entitled to benefits under G. L. c. 152, a determination that is certainly not conclusively made within fourteen days. The workers\u2019 compensation statute provides for periods of payment without prejudice to challenge liability after the fourteen-day period, and hearings to contest liability thereafter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the timing of the decisions on assault pay is conditioned at a minimum on the entitlement to, not the initial payment of, workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Lemuel Shattuck Hosp., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 211 (1996), this court rejected an argument similar to the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>that the union makes here (i.e., that the assault pay statutes\u2019 timing provisions incorporate the workers\u2019 compensation statute\u2019s timing provisions). In that case, an employee seeking assault pay benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 58,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claimed that the tolling provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41, applied to her c. 30, \u00a7 58, claim. We rejected that argument, concluding that the payments \u201care separate and independent of each other,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 213, quoting from <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Shawprint, Inc., </em>328 Mass. 352, 357 (1952); the statutes must be interpreted on their own terms; and \u201cthe tolling provisions under \u00a7 41 apply only to claims for benefits under c. 152 and not to claims under c. 30.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212. Thus, the decision in <em>Chambers </em>further supports our conclusion that the fourteen-day deadline in the workers\u2019 compensation statute is inapplicable to G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A, and St. 1970, c. 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Applying the strict fourteen-day time constraints found in G. L. c. 152 to G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A, and St. 1970, c. 800, would also ignore the important differences between workers\u2019 compensation and assault pay. Workers\u2019 compensation is designed to compensate employees quickly for workplace injuries regardless of fault. Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 11.3, at 346 (3d ed. 2003). In contrast, the assault pay statutes provide benefits in addition to workers\u2019 compensation for a select group of injured employees due to the violent acts of patients and inmates. Such acts can result in the discipline of prisoners or patients and even criminal liability, thereby presenting complicated collateral consequences to any findings made by the responsible official. Thus, in addition to determining whether a correction officer is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the sheriff must determine whether a patient or inmate has engaged in an act of violence. The latter inquiry, with its associated consequences, may require additional time.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Accordingly, in light of the statutory language, our prior case law, and the important differences between workers\u2019 compensation and assault pay, we conclude that the fourteen-day deadline for an initial decision on workers\u2019 compensation found in G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 7, is inapplicable to assault pay benefits under G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A, and St. 1970, c. 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u201cWithin fourteen days of an insurer\u2019s receipt of an employer\u2019s first report of injury, or an initial written claim for weekly benefits on a form prescribed by the department, whichever is received first, the insurer shall either commence payment of weekly benefits under this chapter or shall notify the division of administration, the employer, and, by certified mail, the employee, of its refusal to commence payment of weekly benefits.\u201d G.
