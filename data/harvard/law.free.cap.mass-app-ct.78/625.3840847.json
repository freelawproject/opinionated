See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A. Viewed properly, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), the evidence supported a conclusion that the defendant drove from Massachusetts to New Hampshire, picked up his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ex-girlfriend, and then drove around for about one and one-half hours, all the while punching her in her face. He appeals, claiming that, for reasons we shall discuss, his waiver of a jury trial was invalid. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On the day the case was called for trial \u2014 the eleventh occasion on which the case had been before the court and the third trial date \u2014 defense counsel objected to going forward and informed the judge that the defendant, who had waived his right to a jury trial in a proceeding two months earlier before a different judge (waiver judge), now wished to withdraw the waiver and proceed with a jury trial. Counsel also informed the judge that the defendant had just informed him of unnamed, unde-scribed alibi witnesses whom he had not had time to subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">At that point, the judge ordered that the defendant be sworn. In response to one of the judge\u2019s ensuing questions, the defendant agreed that he had signed a jury trial waiver form several weeks earlier. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">The court: \u201cWere you in custody [when you signed the waiver form]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">Defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">The court: \u201cAnd [the waiver judge] allowed it. He does a very thorough colloquy. I\u2019m sure he had a conversation with you at that time to ask you if you understood it. Was there something about this that you didn\u2019t understand?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">Defendant: \u201cYes, I was kind of mad that I\u2019ve been coming to Court so much. I wanted to get it over with. I don\u2019t know the fastest way to get it over with, so that\u2019s what I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">The court: \u201cSo . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-12\">Defendant: \u201cI understand . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-13\">Defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cThat answers that, I think.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-14\">Defendant: \u201cHold on, you cut me off.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-15\">The court: \u201cLet him speak.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-16\">Defendant: \u201cI didn\u2019t understand all that about a jury trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>until one of the inmates downstairs explained it to me today that went to trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">After a brief additional colloquy regarding how long the defendant had been held in custody, the judge said as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\u201c[Ajfter you signed this waiver \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt in my mind you understood what you were doing when you signed this. You speak English. [Your lawyer] is an excellent attorney. He\u2019s extremely thorough. [The waiver judge] is extremely thorough in his conversations with people about these issues. There\u2019s no doubt in your mind that you knew what you were doing when you signed it. And then you came back to Court for trial on December 19. You came back to Court again on January 15. And then you\u2019re here today on February 6. There comes a point where we have to move on. If I thought that you couldn\u2019t speak English, or that you had some problem with the English language, that would be an issue. But there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that you knew what you were doing when you waived your right to have a Jury trial. The alibi witness, I\u2019ll start the trial today. We\u2019re not going to finish it today in all actuality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The form to which the judge referred was a standard waiver form containing a section entitled \u201cwaiver of right to be tried by a jury,\u201d which the defendant had signed, a section entitled \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s certificate,\u201d which the defendant\u2019s attorney had signed, and a section entitled \u201cjudge\u2019s certificate,\u201d which was labeled \u201coptional,\u201d and which included the following printed language: \u201cAfter a colloquy with the above-named defendant, I find that the defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to jury trial is knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and is accepted.\u201d That section was unsigned. Whatever colloquy occurred was not recorded or otherwise transcribed, and the record contains no secondary evidence of what transpired at the colloquy, though the record does contain a docket entry in which a box labeled \u201cwaiver of jury found after colloquy\u201d has been checked.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The trial proceeded and the defendant was found guilty. After the conviction and after the appeal had been docketed, he filed a motion for a new trial accompanied by a psychologist\u2019s report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>opining, on the basis of records and interviews with the defendant, that the defendant \u201clacked the substantial capacity to knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his right to a jury trial.\u201d The motion sought a new trial based on the defendant\u2019s lack of competence and what he claimed was ineffective assistance of counsel based on his attorney\u2019s failure to raise the competency question. The motion was not accompanied by an affidavit from trial counsel or from the defendant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">After hearing, the judge denied the motion with an endorsement stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201c7/31/09 Defendant has produced an opinion of a [psychologist] that defendant\u2019s judgment was impaired when he waived his jury trial rights on 11/29/07. However, the defendant appeared in Court on more than ten occasions and competency was never raised as an issue; there were at least two separate dates scheduled for bench trial and one \u2018status\u2019 date after defendant tendered his waiver of jury trial; and defendant was represented by the same attorney from at least 9-4-07 until the conclusion of the bench trial on 2-6-08.1 find there is insufficient evidence to find that counsel\u2019s representation fell below the level of competence demanded of attorneys. Nor is there sufficient evidence to invalidate his jury waiver. The motion is denied.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Dealing first with the trial-day motion for a continuance and request for a jury trial, \u201conce a jury trial has been knowingly and intelligently waived, a defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw or revoke the waiver. . . . Rather, it is within the trial judge\u2019s discretion whether a defendant should be permitted to withdraw his waiver.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kopsala, </em>58 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 387, 391 (2003). A valid waiver, in turn, requires both a signed waiver certificate, see G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A; G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 6; Mass.R.Crim.P. 19(a), 378 Mass. 888 (1979), and a colloquy designed to insure that the waiver is voluntary. <em>Cium-mei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 504, 509 (1979). \u201cSo long as a colloquy occurs, the sole focus of our review is whether the colloquy has provided an evidentiary record upon which the trial judge could find the waiver of a defendant was voluntary and intelligent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Abreu, </em>391 Mass. 777, 779 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Here, the judge had before her the defendant\u2019s signed waiver, his attorney\u2019s certificate that he had explained to the defendant the essential consequences of the waiver decision, and a docket notation indicating that a colloquy had preceded judicial acceptance of the waiver. The colloquy, however, was not recorded, compare <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. at 511 (\u201cthe colloquies by clerk-magistrates would be recorded, just as they will be when conducted by the judges\u201d), and the judge had no basis for using her knowledge about the waiver judge\u2019s colloquy practices to fill that void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In our view, however, the defendant\u2019s admission that he waived his right to a jury, the presence of the properly signed waiver form, and the docket entry stating that a colloquy preceded acceptance of the waiver imposed on the defendant the burden of showing that the waiver was invalid. Wherever the burden may lie under other circumstances, imposing the burden on the defendant in cases like this one gives appropriate recognition both to the importance of the right to trial by jury, see generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>445 Mass. 776, 778-781 (2006) (discussing burdens of proof in various contexts), and to the \u201cnormal presumption of regularity accorded the earlier proceedings,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pingaro, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 49 (1997), particularly proceedings for which no specific rules of conduct have been created. See <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. at 508-510 (although offering suggested guidelines, court declined to \u201cconstitutionaliz[e]\u201d a particular form of jury-waiver colloquy).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>On this record, the defendant completely failed to carry that burden. Represented and accompanied by the lawyer who had signed the certificate and who had been with him during the waiver proceedings, the defendant made no claim that the colloquy was defective, nor did he proffer any such claim during subsequent hearings or filings. The defendant\u2019s articulated reason for the waiver was rational even if it did not represent the choice others might have made in comparable circumstances. Compare, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 933, 933-934 (1997). His claim that he did not understand \u201call that about a jury trial\u201d until he received an explanation earlier in the morning from one of the \u201cinmates downstairs\u201d flies in the face of defense counsel\u2019s signed certificate describing what he had explained at the critical time. Moreover, the record contains no description of what \u201call that\u201d was or why and how \u201call that\u201d differed from the information the defendant\u2019s attorney had provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The defendant\u2019s claims regarding the new trial motion can be quickly resolved. The judge had the benefit of her interaction with the defendant on the day of trial and was not required to accept the psychologist\u2019s conclusion that he was incompetent. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. 101, 106 (2009) (in the context of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, the \u201cjudge may decide the motion based solely on the submitted affidavits, and the weight and credibility to be accorded those affidavits are within the judge\u2019s discretion. . . . \u2018The motion \u201cis addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and. . . will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust, or unless the [proceeding] was infected with prejudicial constitutional error\u201d \u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, the judge\u2019s disbelief of the psychologist\u2019s affidavit would be sufficient basis for denying the motion. Although the judge did not explicitly say that she disbelieved the psychologist, she did say that there was not \u201csufficient evidence to invalidate\u201d the jury waiver, thus signifying that the affidavit was insufficiently persuasive to carry the defendant\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\">During the course of the hearing on the new trial motion, at which no evidence was taken, the assistant district attorney stated, without challenge, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">\u201c[The waiver judge] gave an extensive colloquy, as is his practice, in this court. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been before a judge that gives such an extensive colloquy both upon taking a plea or upon somebody waiving their jury rights. It\u2019s long, it\u2019s slow. He pauses any time that he feels that he\u2019s not getting an understanding coming from the defendant. He reiterates, he repeats. I believe [the waiver judge] takes great pride in that. It is something that is his practice. It certainly was done in this case. I don\u2019t think counsel\u2019s stating that it wasn\u2019t done.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Indeed, in the present context, the judge\u2019s description of those practices embodies the kind of fact-specific information a witness ordinarily provides. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 605 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
