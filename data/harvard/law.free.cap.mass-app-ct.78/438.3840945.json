As to this procedure, see generally <em>Sciaba Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 181 n.2 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rousseau, </em>61 Mass.

At issue is whether the motion judge erred when he concluded, as a matter of law, that the damage to Boazova\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>house was not covered by her homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The pertinent facts are undisputed. In June, 2001, Boazova bought a house in Arlington for which she purchased homeowner\u2019s insurance from the defendant, Safety Insurance Company (Safety). The policy remained in force, modified from time to time, at all times thereafter. In August, 2005, while renovating her kitchen, Boazova discovered that moisture had gotten into the wood sill on top of the foundation at the back of the house, and that the moisture had caused the sill and adjoining floor joists and wall studs to rot.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">According to Boazova\u2019s own expert, \u201c[t]he cause of the rotted sill plate, wall studs, and floor joists is the concrete patio that was poured directly against the house. This permitted moisture to migrate to the top of the foundation, rotting the clapboard siding, the lx exterior, and eventually the sill plate, floor joists, and wall studs.\u201d He further opined that \u201c[t]he current situation is the result of rot and deterioration over an extended period of time,\u201d and that the rot and deterioration were hidden.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He concluded that \u201c[wjere it not for the water, the structure would still be intact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Safety\u2019s expert\u2019s views are consistent, and Boazova does not contest them. Safety\u2019s expert, too, points to the concrete patio, which was installed at a higher grade than the foundation, about one foot above the wood sill, and \u201ctipped towards the rear wall of the house.\u201d In Safety\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion, \u201crotting of the wooden sill and other wooden framing elements of the rear wall of the Insured Property was the result of a moist or wet condition caused by surface water in the form of rain or snow falling onto the concrete patio at the rear of the house, running along the surface of the concrete patio to the rear wall of the house, and then running down into gaps and joints in the patio onto the wood framing of the rear wall which was below the grade of the concrete patio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The concrete patio was built before Boazova purchased the house, as was a concrete cant installed along the edge of the patio, which was designed to direct water away from the house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>There is no suggestion that Boazova knew about the damage to the sill, joists, or studs before its discovery in 2005. She submitted a claim to Safety promptly thereafter, and filed this suit alleging breach of contract and violation of G. L. c. 93A after Safety denied her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">1. <em>Discussion. </em>The interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law for the trial judge, subject to our de novo review. See <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Quane, </em>442 Mass. 704, 707 (2004); <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Theodore, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 471, 472-473 (2006). The policy\u2019s terms are to be interpreted according to the \u201cfair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 174, 179 (2001), quoting from <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 541 (1984). We construe the language in an insurance policy according to its plain meaning if it is unambiguous. See <em>Money Store/Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 298, 300 (1999). \u201cThis is consistent with our long-standing policy that the rules governing the interpretation of insurance contracts are the same as those governing the interpretation of any other contract.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 453 (1985). The insured bears the burden of establishing coverage. <em>Tumblin </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>344 Mass. 318, 320 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The interpretation of an exclusion in an insurance contract also presents a question of law, see <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>First Fin. Ins. Co., </em>448 Mass. 1, 5 (2006), but here the burden shifts to the insurer to establish the exclusion\u2019s applicability, see <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Talhouni, </em>413 Mass. 781,785 (1992). \u201cAlthough an exclusionary clause is construed narrowly, . . . \u2018[w]e are not free to revise it or change the order of the words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Finn </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., </em>452 Mass. 690, 695 (2008), quoting from <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 147 (1984). \u201cA policy of insurance whose provisions are plainly and definitely expressed in appropriate language must be enforced in accordance with its terms.\u201d <em>Hyfer </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>318 Mass. 175, 179 (1945), quoting from <em>Stankus </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>312 Mass. 366, 369 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the policy at issue in this case. Boazova contends that she is entitled to coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>because her loss was caused by undiscovered water seepage, which is covered by section I(A)(2)(e)(9) of the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That section of the policy (which for the sake of convenience we refer to as the \u201chidden seepage provision\u201d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201cSECTION I \u2014 PERILS INSURED AGAINST</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cCOVERAGE A \u2014 DWELLING and COVERAGE B \u2014 OTHER STRUCTURES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201cWe insure against risk of direct loss to property described in coverages A and B only if that loss is a physical loss to property. We do not insure, however, for loss:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201c2. Caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201c(9) Constant or repeated seepage or leakage of water or the presence or condensation of humidity, moisture or vapor, over a period of weeks, months or years unless such seepage or leakage of water or the presence or condensation of humidity, moisture or vapor and the resulting damage is unknown to all \u2018insureds\u2019 and is hidden within the walls or ceilings or beneath the floors or above the ceilings of a structure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Were we to look only at this single provision, disregarding the remainder of the policy, we would agree with Boazova that the policy covers losses caused by undetected water seepage. But such is not our task. <em>J. A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 789, 795 (1986) (\u201cA contract is to be construed to give reasonable effect to each of its provisions\u201d). The policy clearly states that the hidden seepage provision does not stand in isolation, but provides coverage only to the extent not otherwise excluded or excepted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the paragraph immediately following the hidden seepage provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201c3. Excluded under Section I \u2014 Exclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cUnder items 1. and 2. [which includes the hidden seepage provision], any ensuing loss to property described in Coverages A and B not excluded or excepted in this policy is covered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We turn, therefore, to the Exclusions section of the policy. It provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cSECTION I \u2014 EXCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">\u201c1. We do not insure for loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following. <em>Such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">\u201cc. Water Damage, meaning:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">\u201c(1) Flood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of a body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not driven by wind.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">(Emphasis added.) The Supreme Judicial Court has construed the precise language emphasized above and has held that it \u201cplainly\u201d forecloses an insured \u201cfrom invoking the train of events rule.\u201d <em>Jussim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 24, 31 (1993). Put another way, if an excluded event occurs anywhere in the chain of causation, then the insured is not entitled to coverage. Thus, if surface water occurred anywhere in the chain of events leading to Boazova\u2019s loss, she is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>entitled to coverage under the policy. Loss caused, in whole or part, by surface water is excluded \u201cregardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Boazova does not dispute Safety\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion that the water that ultimately seeped into the structure of her house came from snow and rain that landed on the patio and then migrated to the sill.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 711 (1991), quoting from <em>Godbout </em>v. <em>Cousens, </em>396 Mass. 254, 261 (1985) (the party opposing summary judgment has a burden \u201cto show with admissible evidence the existence of a dispute as to material facts\u201d). Our law defines surface water as \u201cwaters from rain, melting snow, springs, or seepage, or floods that lie or flow on the surface of the earth and naturally spread over the ground but do not form a part of a natural watercourse or lake.\u201d <em>DeSanctis </em>v. <em>Lynn Water &amp; Sewer Commn., </em>423 Mass. 112, 115 n.6 (1996). Applying this definition to the undisputed facts, it is clear that Boazova\u2019s loss originated from surface water.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Like the motion judge, therefore, we conclude that Boazova is not entitled to coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Ignoring the critical language of the exclusion, and the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s construction of it, Boazova argues that seepage, not surface water, is the \u201cactive efficient\u201d cause of her loss. As we have noted above, she is foreclosed \u201cfrom invoking the train of events rule.\u201d <em>Jussim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. at 30-31. Even were we inclined (which we are not) to disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>(as she does) the holding of <em>Jussim, </em>Boazova\u2019s argument would nonetheless fail because it is based on the mistaken premise that the \u201cactive efficient\u201d cause is the one nearest in time or place to the loss. We have repeatedly rejected this notion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cWhen it is said that the cause to be sought is the direct and proximate cause, it is not meant that the cause or agency which is nearest in time or place to the result is necessarily to be chosen. . . . The active efficient cause that sets in motion a train of events which brings about a result without the intervention of any force started and working actively from a new and independent source is the direct and proximate cause . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Solimine </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Assn., </em>65 Mass. App. 782, 785-786 (2006), quoting from <em>Jussim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., supra </em>at 27 (water was the cause of loss, regardless of how it entered the insured\u2019s house). Here, it is undisputed that snow and rain set in motion the train of events. The means by which the water entered the plaintiff\u2019s house, whether seeping, leaking, or some other form of aquatic migration, is not a separate cause of loss, nor does it transform the water into something other than surface water.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Deciding as we do, we need not reach Boazova\u2019s argument that the motion judge erred in ruling that she had failed to establish that the loss occurred during the policy period. Nor need we reach Safety\u2019s argument that the loss falls under the \u201cWet and Dry Rot\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Although this portion of her expert\u2019s opinion might suggest otherwise, Boazova expressly disavows on appeal that rot is a cause of her loss: \u201c \u2018Rot,\u2019 wet or otherwise, was the result not the cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Section I(A)(2)(e)(9) was added to the policy through an endorsement entitled \u201cLimited Fungi, Wet or Dry Rot, or Bacteria Coverage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b477-12\">The dissent rests on the faulty premise that an exclusion limiting coverage creates a conflict or ambiguity that must be construed against the insurer. By definition, all exclusions limit coverage. To conclude, as the dissent does, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>from that fact alone the exclusion must be disregarded would mean that no exclusion could ever be given force. Such a result is not permitted by our law. See <em>Finn </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., </em>452 Mass. at 695. To be sure, there are instances where exclusions can be ambiguous. But an exclusion is neither ambiguous nor illusory simply because it limits coverage. <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Allamerica Ins. Co., </em>449 Mass. 400, 404-405 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b478-17\">Also excluded is loss caused by \u201c[w]ater below the surface of the ground, including water which exerts pressure on or seeps or leaks through a building, sidewalk, driveway, foundation, swimming pool or other structure.\u201d Safety does not rely on this provision as the basis for denying coverage, and there is no evidence in the record that the water here was beneath the surface of the ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Indeed, Boazova presented no evidence at all, let alone any conflicting evidence, as to the source of the water that seeped into the sill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, the term \u201csurface water\u201d is not defined in the policy. Instead, the term is part of the definition of \u201cwater damage.\u201d Specifically, exclusion 1(c)(1) provides that water damage means \u201c[f]lood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of a body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not driven by wind.\u201d Ordinary principles of contract interpretation require that each item in this list be given its own ordinary and separate meaning. \u201cEvery word in an insurance contract \u2018must be presumed to have been employed with a purpose and must be given meaning and effect whenever practicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., </em>454 Mass. 337, 355 (2009), quoting from <em>Allmerica Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, </em>449 Mass. 621, 628 (2007). We cannot, as the dissent proposes, conflate the meaning of \u201csurface water\u201d with that of \u201coverflow of a body of water\u201d so that the two mean the same thing and render one or the other superfluous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b480-11\">See, e.g., <em>T.H.E.

I dissent from the majority\u2019s reading of the insurance policy, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>disregards an endorsement amending the policy that provides for the precise coverage here at issue. Alternatively, and at best, the majority opinion is inconsistent with Massachusetts law, which construes conflicting terms in a policy against the insurer. In addition, the majority result relies on the statement that \u201c[t]he pertinent facts are undisputed.\u201d To the contrary, there is a genuine and material disputed factual issue concerning the manner and means by which water caused damage to the plaintiff\u2019s house, a question central to the existence of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">1. <em>The policy and \u201cadditional coverage\u201d endorsement. </em>I turn first to the policy provisions and principles of Massachusetts law applied in construing conflicting provisions against an insurer. The insurer issued an endorsement covering the damage at issue: it provided \u201cadditional coverage\u201d for \u201c \u2018Fungi\u2019, Wet or Dry Rot, or Bacteria.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is precisely a type of damage resulting from seepage of water over a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Notwithstanding that, Safety asserts that this endorsement was limited by a \u201cPerils Insured Against\u201d reservation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>reservation \u2014 according to Safety \u2014 was designed to exclude damage caused by water seepage unless the seepage was hidden. Additionally, Safety cites another conflicting provision to negate the ostensibly provided \u201cadditional coverage.\u201d This is the exclusion for surface water<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 an exclusion on which the majority relies. In order to create an exclusion, the insurer must use language that is clear to the policy holder. Here, the surface water exclusion, notwithstanding the catchphrase \u201cdirectly or indirectly,\u201d simply cannot reasonably be interpreted to negate coverage for rot caused by (hidden) seepage. Interlacing these confusingly drafted paragraphs, Safety\u2019s reading, and the majority construction, would negate the very existence of the additional coverage. This is incomprehensible doublespeak. Such a reading is contrary to the principle that \u201c[ljanguage in an insurance policy must be given its ordinary meaning, however, and construed in the sense that the insured will reasonably understand to be the scope of his coverage.\u201d <em>Slater </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>379 Mass. 801, 803 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">While it may be theoretically possible to find damage caused by hidden seepage that does not proximately involve surface water, the majority approach effectively allows the insurer to look to any phase of the water cycle and thereby deny coverage. This proves too much by far. In the instant case the plaintiff alleged, and provided expert evidence, that water fell to the surface as rain, then seeped into the plaintiff\u2019s dwelling, causing damage. It borders on sharp practice for Safety to deny coverage for seepage by claiming that this constitutes damage indirectly caused by surface water. \u201cSurface water,\u201d defined by the policy in the context of \u201cwater damage,\u201d refers to \u201ctidal water\u201d and \u201coverflow of a body of water\u201d (see note 4, <em>infra) </em>and is properly read as meaning a body of water that migrates beyond its usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>bounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cAn interpretation which gives a reasonable meaning to all of the provisions of a contract is to be preferred to one which leaves a part useless or inexplicable.\u201d <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp. Ltd., </em>343 Mass. 354, 357 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">A proper reading of the policy requires recognition that damage caused by water which has become seepage, whatever the source to which it might be originally traced, is covered by the contract between the parties. When a consumer pays for insurance under a policy, which by its language covers damage caused by seepage of water, that is what the insured consumer should receive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Even were we to assume that these policy provisions cannot be reconciled, it would not avail Safety. \u201cIf there are two rational interpretations of policy language, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it.\u201d <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990). An insurer may not deploy ambiguous language and conflicting cross provisions in a policy to deny coverage. In cases of ambiguity, \u201cMassachusetts construes insurance policies against the insurer.\u201d <em>City Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co. of Harford, </em>446 Mass. 638, 643 n.5 (2006). Here, the \u201cadditional coverage\u201d added by paragraph 12.a appears to do just that \u2014 provide additional coverage. An insurance policy is to \u201cbe construed to give reasonable effect to each of its provisions.\u201d <em>J. A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 789, 795 (1986). \u201cIt is also appropriate, in construing an insurance policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>to consider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u201d <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., supra </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">2. <em>Genuine issue of material fact. </em>The record below does not support summary judgment. Rather, it includes substantial evidence that there was hidden seepage and leakage that caused the resulting rot damage \u2014 which would thereby be rendered a covered loss. With respect to this evidence, the judge noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cIt is undisputed that the water emanated from the outside and seeped or leaked in through the gap between the concrete patio and the rear wall of the house. The inspectors report that it was this gap and the placement of the patio, built sometime before Boazova purchased the property, that ultimately caused the damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201cThe reports are clear, especially when read with the affidavits of the inspectors, that the water that caused the damage was rain and melting snow that essentially \u2018sat\u2019 on the foundation wall and ran along the surface of the patio on the outside of the house until it seeped into the sill and beyond. There is no other possible source of water that can be gleaned from the facts . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Not surprisingly, the parties differ in the language they use to describe what occurred; these semantic disputes track the language of the various ostensibly conflicting provisions of the policy. On this point, the report in the summary judgment record submitted by Safety\u2019s expert does not use the term surface water to describe the passage of water into the interior of the house. Rather, Safety\u2019s expert\u2019s report refers to surface water on top of the patio, \u201cin the form of rain or snow falling onto the concrete patio at the rear of the house, running along the surface of the concrete patio to the rear wall of the house, and then running down into gaps and joints in the patio.\u201d Even if, as described by Safety\u2019s expert, water may have collected on the patio, and then moved as surface water above the patio and within patio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>gaps, that does not demonstrate that the water met the policy\u2019s definition of surface water as it entered the house. Rather, as noted, from all that appears of record, the water leaked and seeped into the house interior. As the judge found, the water \u201cseeped into the sill and beyond. There is no other possible source of water that can be gleaned from the facts . . . .\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s report does not speak of surface water moving into the house, but rather describes moisture \u201cmigrating] down to the foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">At best, there is a genuine dispute whether the damage at issue was caused by water that \u201cflowed,\u201d or \u201cleaked,\u201d or \u201cmigrated,\u201d or \u201cseeped.\u201d When the court considers the materials accompanying a motion for summary judgment, \u201cthe inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in such materials must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Hub Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>357 Mass. 449, 451 (1970), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diebold, </em>369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The grant of summary judgment was improper and should be vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The full endorsement to the policy, as in effect during the filing of the subject claim, added paragraph 12 to the \u201cSection 1 \u2014 Property Coverages\u201d of the policy, to provide additional coverage for wet or dry rot as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">\u201cThe following Additional Coverage is added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">\u201c12. \u2018Fungi\u2019, <em>Wet or Dry Rot, </em>or Bacteria</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">\u201ca.

This case has nothing to do with the ecosystem of natural bodies of water, such as natural watercourses or lakes. We note as well that the definition of surface water chosen by the judge includes \u201cseepage,\u201d rendering it useless in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Massachusetts law certainly does not require a consumer to understand, much less formulate independently, the five pages of legal interpretation and analysis employed by the majority to justify Safety\u2019s denial of coverage. <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar.
