Meyer, and the town of Nantucket over plumbing Meyer installed himself in his Nantucket home. The town plumbing inspector ordered Meyer to remove the plumbing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>grounds that Meyer failed to obtain a permit prior to installation and that Meyer is not a licensed plumber. The issue is whether G. L. c. 142, which regulates the practice of plumbing in the Commonwealth, exempts homeowners who perform plumbing work in their own homes from its licensing requirements. A related question is whether the plumbing inspector exceeded his authority by issuing the removal order without first inspecting the plumbing for compliance with the State plumbing code.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. In 1968, Meyer purchased an undeveloped parcel of land located on Red Barn Road in the town of Nantucket (town) with the intention of building a family home. He eventually began construction, performing most of the work himself. On or about March 19, 2007, Meyer submitted an application to the Nantucket building commissioner for a permit to personally install the plumbing for four bathrooms, a kitchen, and a laundry facility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Meyer, a retired opthamologist, is not a plumber by trade and holds no plumbing license.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By letter dated April 5, 2007, the building commissioner rejected Meyer\u2019s permit application, stating, \u201cThe only person that is allowed to do plumbing work in [Massachusetts] is a [Massachusetts] Licensed Plumber with the proper permit.\u201d The letter specifically referenced a State regulation governing the conduct of plumbing in the Commonwealth, which provides in relevant part, \u201cPermits [to perform plumbing work] shall be issued to licensed plumbers only.\u201d 248 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.05(l)(b)(7)(a) (2005). A copy of the regulation was appended to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Meyer did not appeal the denial of his request for a permit. Rather, taking the position that neither the statute nor the regulations prohibited unlicensed homeowners from installing plumbing in their own homes, Meyer proceeded to install the plumbing without a permit. By September of 2008, Meyer had substantially completed the rough plumbing in his house and had installed one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>toilet, one shower, and a hot water heater for his personal use during continued construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On November 25, 2008, the Nantucket plumbing inspector (inspector) issued an \u201cOrder to Cease and Desist and Abate,\u201d instructing Meyer to immediately stop the installation, cease using the plumbing he had installed, and to have the plumbing removed by a licensed plumber. Meyer appealed the order to the Board of State Examiners of Plumbers and Gas Fitters (board), claiming that homeowners like himself were not within the scope of G. L. c. 142, \u00a7 3, which, Meyer contended, only requires the licensing of master plumbers, journeyman plumbers, and apprentice plumbers. Meyer also challenged the inspector\u2019s authority to order the removal of the plumbing without first inspecting it for compliance with code requirements, and requested to have the plumbing inspected. During the pendency of his appeal before the board, Meyer stopped using the plumbing, but did not remove it. The inspector has never inspected the installed plumbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">After a hearing, the board issued a final decision and order upholding the order requiring Meyer to cease performing plumbing work and to remove the plumbing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board concluded that by doing \u201cwork in plumbing\u201d under G. L. c. 142, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1977, c. 843, \u00a7 3, Meyer was operating as a journeyman plumber within the meaning of the statute and was, therefore, subject to its licensing requirements. The board further found that the statute contains no homeowner\u2019s exemption. Finally, the board found that, although the removal of the plumbing may be burdensome on Meyer, the removal order was within the scope of the inspector\u2019s authority under section 10.04 of the State plumbing code, 248 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04 (2005), and reasonable \u201cin light of the fair warning [given] to . . . Meyer.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">On Meyer\u2019s complaint for judicial review before the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Court, acting on cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, a judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. The judge rejected Meyer\u2019s claims that the licensing requirements contained in G. L. c. 142 only apply to individuals in the business of plumbing and that it would be unreasonable to read the statute as prohibiting unlicensed persons from engaging in \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d plumbing in their own homes. The judge also rejected Meyer\u2019s constitutional and procedural arguments. The judge entered a judgment dismissing Meyer\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, Meyer continues to press his argument that the licensing requirements contained in G. L. c. 142, \u00a7 3, do not apply to homeowners like himself and, consequently, that the board\u2019s decision upholding the inspector\u2019s order was based on a error of law. The crux of Meyer\u2019s argument is that by promulgating and enforcing regulations which effectively prohibit any unlicensed person from performing plumbing work regardless of circumstance,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the board exceeded its authority under G. L. c. 142, which, according to Meyer, evinces no intent on the part of the Legislature to prohibit unlicensed individuals from installing plumbing in their own homes. In the alternative, Meyer argues that such a prohibition violates due process. We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">1. <em>Validity of the board\u2019s regulations. </em>To determine the validity of a duly promulgated administrative agency regulation, we follow the familiar two-step framework established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-844 (1984). See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, 444 </em>Mass. 627, 632-633 (2005). First, using conventional tools of statutory interpretation, we determine \u201cwhether the Legislature has spoken with certainty on the topic in question, and if we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>elude that the statute is unambiguous, we give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If, however, there is ambiguity in the statute or the Legislature has not directly addressed the issue, we must proceed to step two and \u201cdetermine whether the agency\u2019s resolution of that issue may \u2018be reconciled with the governing legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, quoting from <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgmt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Under step two, we are required to give substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute within its charge, and regulations \u201care not to be declared void unless their provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 633, quoting from <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595-596 (1992). In conducting our analysis, \u201cit is unimportant whether we would have come to the same interpretation of the statute as the agency.\u201d <em>Goldberg, supra. </em>See <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>454 Mass. 174, 187 (2009). \u201cA party challenging a regulation bears the burden of proving that the regulation is \u2018illegal, arbitrary, or capricious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ciampi </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>452 Mass. 162, 166 (2008), quoting from <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 722, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S. 936 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Informed by these principles, we begin with the statutory text itself. General Laws c. 142 does not specifically address the issue of homeowner installation of plumbing. Section 3 provides that \u201c[n]o person shall engage in the business as a master plumber ... or work as a journeyman plumber . . . or as an apprentice plumber . . . unless he is lawfully registered, or has been licensed by the [board] as provided in this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 142, \u00a7 3, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 843, \u00a7 4. In turn, \u00a7 1 defines \u201cjourneyman plumber\u201d broadly as \u201ca person who himself does any work in plumbing and gas fitting, subject to inspection under any law, rule or regulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Meyer urges us to construe these provisions as unambiguously exclusive of homeowners like himself. He argues that because the Legislature specifically defined \u201cjourneyman plumber\u201d as a person who does work in plumbing <em>and </em>gas fitting, doing \u201cwork in plumbing\u201d alone does not meet the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tory definition. More broadly, he argues that the Legislature\u2019s use of the terms \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cjourneyman\u201d implies that it intended to require licensure only for paid work performed by professionals, not by a lay or unlicensed do-it-yourself plumber.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The town advances the opposite contention, that the plain language of the statute is unambiguously inclusive of homeowners. It argues that the broad definition of \u201c[jjourneyman plumber\u201d contained in \u00a7 1 demonstrates that all persons who themselves do \u201cany work in plumbing\u201d are subject to the licensing requirements set forth in \u00a7 3. It further contends that the Legislature\u2019s failure to include an express exemption for homeowners or for persons not engaged in the business of plumbing demonstrates that no exception for do-it-yourself plumbing was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u201cWhen a statute is \u2018capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses,\u2019 it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Falmouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>447 Mass. 814, 818 (2006), quoting from <em>AT&amp;T </em>v. <em>Automatic Sprinkler Appeals Bd., </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 11, 14 (2001). Having considered the parties\u2019 positions, neither of which we find to be patently implausible, we conclude that G. L. c. 142 does not evince the unambiguous meaning that either of the parties would assign to it. Because the Legislature has not \u201cspoken with certainty\u201d to the precise question at issue, we consider whether the board\u2019s resolution of the issue may reasonably be harmonized with the legislative mandate. <em>Goldberg, </em>444 Mass. at 633. We conclude that it can.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Meyer essentially claims that the primary purpose of the statute is to protect the public, as consumers of services, from unqualified plumbers, a goal to which the prohibition of do-it-yourself plumbing bears no reasonable relationship. We disagree. It is well established that the principal aim of the Legislature in enacting G. L. c. 142 was to protect the health and safety of the public by providing for safe plumbing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>213 Mass. 138, 141-142 (1912); <em>Barriere </em>v. <em>Depatie, </em>219 Mass. 33, 36 (1914) (the \u201cprimary object [of G. L. c. 142] is the conservation of the public health from the deleterious effects which experience has shown arise from unsanitary and insufficient plumbing work due to the lack of technical knowledge and skill of those who perform it\u201d); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Plumbing Co., </em>301 Mass. 86, 89 (1938) (purpose of the statute \u201cis to secure sanitary plumbing for the protection of the public health\u201d); <em>Springfield Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Board of State Examiners of Plumbers, </em>329 Mass. 664, 665 (1953); <em>Mercado </em>v. <em>Manny\u2019s T.V. &amp; Appliance, Inc., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 135, 139 (2010) (\u201cThere can be no question that the intent of the electrical and plumbing code is to protect public health, safety, and welfare\u201d). Regulations prohibiting unlicensed individuals \u2014 even nonprofessionals working in their own homes \u2014 from performing plumbing work are clearly consonant with this prophylactic purpose. Accordingly, Meyer has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the contested regulations are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In reaching our decision, we are not unsympathetic to Meyer\u2019s practical arguments regarding the rise of the do-it-yourself industry in recent years and the proliferation of home improvement stores within the Commonwealth which, by their advertisements, would appear to encourage homeowners to engage in unlicensed plumbing work. Nor are we unmindful of the fact that the regulations, as promulgated, make it more difficult for a resourceful homeowner to minimize the financial burden of installing plumbing. We are also cognizant of the fact that the Legislatures of many States have seen fit to expressly include in their plumbing laws the type of homeowner\u2019s exception which Meyer is advancing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the relevant question is not whether we would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>come to the same interpretation of the statute as the agency (a matter on which we express no view), or even whether a viable alternative exists. \u201cThe ultimate question is whether the policy embodied by the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc., </em>454 Mass. at 187. Here, it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">For similar reasons we also reject Meyer\u2019s contention that the board\u2019s prohibition of unlicensed do-it-yourself plumbing violates his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the cognate provisions of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. \u201cSubstantive due process prohibits the government from engaging in conduct that \u2018shocks the conscience,\u2019 ... or interferes with rights \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Registry of Motor Vehicles, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 55 (2009), quoting from <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952), and <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 324-326 (1937). Where, as here, the interest at stake is not a fundamental right, a challenger has the burden of establishing that the statute lacks a rational basis, that it is not reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin Fruit Co., </em>388 Mass. 228, 235 (1983) (noting that the standard of review is the same under the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions); <em>Gordon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>There can be no question that the Commonwealth has a valid legislative interest in protecting the health and safety of the public by providing for safe plumbing. It is equally beyond question that regulating the installation of plumbing is rationally related to this interest. Accordingly, Meyer\u2019s constitutional claim lacks merit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">2. <em>Validity of the removal order. </em>Meyer\u2019s second argument before the board was that the inspector exceeded his statutory and regulatory authority by issuing a removal order without first conducting an inspection of the installed plumbing. The board rejected this argument, reasoning (1) that the issuance of removal orders is generally within the scope of an inspector\u2019s duties under G. L. c. 142, \u00a7 11; (2) that 248 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04(5) (2005) expressly requires inspectors to issue removal and correction orders \u201c[i]f at the time of testing and Inspection. . . evidence of unskilled or inferior workmanship is found\u201d; and (3) that because Meyer did not hold a plumbing license, unskilled or inferior workmanship could be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Although we give considerable weight to an agency\u2019s experience and authority, \u201cwe must overturn agency decisions that are not consistent with governing law.\u201d <em>Bulger </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>447 Mass. 651, 657 (2006). The term \u201cgoverning law\u201d in this context implies not only statutes but also an agency\u2019s own properly promulgated regulations. See <em>Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks, Lodge No. 65 </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Lawrence, </em>403 Mass. 531, 550 (1988) (\u201cPromulgated regulations have the force of law, and bind the agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Here, the regulations at issue, 248 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.05(3)(g) and 10.04(5), plainly envision that an order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>removal will be predicated on a finding by the inspector that there is \u201cevidence of unskilled or inferior workmanship\u201d and that any such finding will be made <em>\u201cat the time of </em>Inspection\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Based on this plain language, we conclude that an inspection and appropriate findings are conditions precedent to the issuance of a removal order under the regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, it is undisputed that the inspector has not conducted an inspection of the plumbing in Meyer\u2019s home. Indeed, the record is clear that he refuses to do so. Accordingly, the inspector\u2019s removal order is not in accordance with governing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Furthermore, we reject the board\u2019s conclusory determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>that Meyer\u2019s lack of a plumbing license obviated the need for specific evidence of unskilled or inferior workmanship.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is no question that by engaging in plumbing work with neither a permit nor a license Meyer violated the statute (as reasonably interpreted by the board) and the plumbing code. However, the removal remedy available to inspectors under 248 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.05(3)(g) and 10.04(5) is not directed at all defects or violations of law, but specifically at \u201cDefective Materials and Poor Workmanship.\u201d Cf. G. L. c. 142, \u00a7 16 (imposing fine upon persons who engage in unlicensed plumbing work); 248 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04(2)(b)(4)(a) (2005) (providing that where there are \u201cany defects or violations of [Title 248 Code Mass. Regs.], the plumber shall be required to remedy the violations and defects, without delay, and notify the Inspector for a repeat Inspection of the installation\u201d). Here, the board explicitly declined to make any findings \u201cregarding the scope of . . . Meyer\u2019s work, nor whether that work was done per the plumbing code.\u201d Its determination to uphold the order of removal, therefore, was premature and unsupported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)fy).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Conclusion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We affirm so much of the judgment entered in the Superior Court as affirms the board\u2019s decision to uphold the inspector\u2019s order requiring Meyer to cease all plumbing work. We reverse so much of the judgment as affirms the board\u2019s decision to uphold the order requiring Meyer to remove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>uninspected plumbing. The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The letter also addressed Meyer\u2019s request for an electrical permit, but that application is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">In his initial correspondence with the Nantucket building commissioner, which sought information as to whether a homeowner may perform electrical and plumbing work, Meyer stated, \u201cI have extensive experience both in wiring and in plumbing, both of which I consider my hobbies; but I have neither an electrician\u2019s nor a plumber\u2019s license.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The board also voted unanimously \u201cto open a complaint to determine if . . .

In determining whether a statute has a rational basis we do not consider the individual claims; rather, we evaluate the State\u2019s reasons for enacting the law. See <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>528 F.3d 42, 55 (1st Cir. 2008), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Pietrangelo </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>129 S. Ct. 2763 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">In the present circumstance, the Legislature and the State and local agencies could rationally conclude that the do-it-yourself homeowner could be installing plumbing not only for himself but also for all subsequent buyers, renters, or other occupants of the structure. In that long view, enforcement of the building code is a legitimate police power concern of public health, safety, and welfare.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Title 248 Code Mass.

L. c. 142, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 13, provide authorization for the regulations as written. However, contrary to the board\u2019s apparent position, the language of G. L. c. 142, \u00a7 11, mandating that plumbing inspectors \u201cperform such other appropriate duties as may be required,\u201d does not authorize a removal order in the absence of a specific implementing regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The board expressed the view in its decision that because inspection may not uncover every defect, an order of removal merely for unlicensed installation is a reasonable prophylactic measure. We have no occasion here to decide whether the board may, consistent with G. L. c. 142, amend its regulations to empower plumbing inspectors to order the removal of plumbing solely on the basis of installation by the unlicensed. Our decision simply applies the current regulations as written.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The inspection of Meyer\u2019s work must be one of integrity and fairness. A report of any deficiencies must have the substantiation of specific and detailed findings and reasoning. Any decision resting upon the inspection will remain subject to review by the Superior Court and appellate courts under the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(o)-(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">To the extent we have not discussed other arguments made by Meyer, they \u201chave not been overlooked.
