Fogg and George P. Fogg, HI, the town of Brookline (town) zoning board of appeals (board) revoked a building permit that had issued to the developer, 81 Spooner Road, LLC (LLC). That permit had authorized LLC to construct a new single-family home on a lot (71 Spooner Road) it owned in the Chestnut Hill section of the town. The board rejected the Foggs\u2019 claims respecting an adjacent property (81 Spooner Road) and its vintage home, which LLC had by then sold to third persons, who were not summonsed as parties in this action. The Foggs are abutters to 71 Spooner and 81 Spooner Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">In the Land Court, LLC and the Foggs filed cross appeals from the board\u2019s decision. The companion actions were tried jointly to a judge, who affirmed the board\u2019s revocation of the building permit. The judge found no merit to the claims of error advanced by LLC. The judge, however, agreed with the Foggs that LLC\u2019s development scheme had caused the 81 Spooner Road home to be nonconforming with the town\u2019s zoning bylaw (bylaw), a flaw which affected 71 Spooner Road also, rendering it an invalid building lot. From the separate judgments entered in each action, LLC filed a timely appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts found by the Land Court judge, supplemented by undisputed facts of record. When LLC acquired it in June of 2004, 81 Spooner Road was then comprised of 22,400 square feet of land, on which stood a 1910 colonial revival home with six bedrooms and 3,812 square feet of living space. By all accounts, 81 Spooner Road conformed with local zoning. The home was (and remains) situated in a S-10 residential zoning district.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">In February of 2005, at the behest of LLC, the town\u2019s planning board endorsed the developer\u2019s approval-not-required (ANR) subdivision plan. G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8 IP. The plan allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>LLC to divide 81 Spooner Road into two separate lots: a smaller 81 Spooner Road lot, comprised of 10,893 square feet of land, with the vintage home; and a larger land lot, known as 71 Spooner Road, with 11,648 square feet of area.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In March, 2005, LLC sold 81 Spooner Road,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> retaining 71 Spooner Road for development. A sketch made in the Land Court is attached hereto as an Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Subsequently, on April 8, 2005, LLC obtained a building permit, from the town\u2019s building commissioner, authorizing its construction of a single-family home at 71 Spooner Road. The building department did not provide any notice to the Foggs. LLC posted no notice of the permit on its property; nor did LLC begin construction within the thirty-day appeal period. After learning of the permit, as a result of repeated inquiries of the town\u2019s building department, the Foggs made demand of the commissioner to enforce the local bylaw against LLC, for reasons cited in a letter to him, dated May 16, 2005. The commissioner refused; in his reply to the Foggs, of May 31, 2005, he held to the view that 71 and 81 Spooner Road conformed to requirements of the bylaw. From his denial, the Foggs appealed to the board, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 8, seeking relief from the alleged violations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">b. <em>Foggs\u2019 appeal filed with the board. </em>The Foggs alleged that 71 and 81 Spooner Road violated local zoning requirements, for different reasons, which they set forth in detail in a written submission filed with the board. In large part, the Foggs asserted each of the homes, in its own way, exceeded the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) allowed under the bylaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">A floor area ratio measures the gross floor space of a building in comparison to the area of its underlying lot.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>351 Mass. 98, 102 (1966) (purpose or \u201cessential scheme\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>FAR ordinance is to maintain a certain ratio between lot area and bulk size of a structure on said lot); <em>81 Spooner Rd. LLC </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>452 Mass. 109, 115 (2008) (regulating a building\u2019s \u201cbulk,\u201d by way of floor area ratio, \u201cis a generally recognized and accepted principle of zoning\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this way, the bylaw\u2019s FAR requirement protects against undue building density, and promotes the bylaw\u2019s overarching policy to advance the health, safety, and welfare of the town\u2019s residents. To that end, the bylaw, among other things, seeks to foster the most appropriate use of land, prevent overcrowding of land, and encourage the preservation of historic and architecturally significant structures.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">For 71 Spooner Road, the Foggs noted the \u201ccurrent\u201d plans described the proposed \u201cliving area\u201d as 3,511 square feet. That gross floor area number, divided by the lot area (i.e., 11,648 square feet), yields a .30 FAR, the maximum allowed under the bylaw. The Foggs argued the FAR figure was inaccurate because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>LLC did not account for nearly 1,000 square feet of \u201cunfinished\u201d space located on the second floor of this three-story home. Though left unfinished, this disputed space, the Foggs claimed, had been designed and intended for use as living quarters, namely, a master bedroom and master bath suite. They said this could be reasonably inferred from the fact that LLC\u2019s house plans had identified bedrooms \u201c2,\u201d \u201c3,\u201d \u201c4,\u201d and \u201c5\u201d in the home, but failed to disclose bedroom no. 1. On plans drawn up by LLC\u2019s architect, the disputed space was described as a \u201cmaster bedroom,\u201d \u201cmaster bath,\u201d with two walk-in closets (WIC). LLC approved these plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">More generally,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Foggs argued that LLC\u2019s over-all plan to divide 81 Spooner Road, creating two separate lots, led to a dense development project for their residential neighborhood.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Originally, 81 Spooner Road had a .17 FAR; after being divided, the property had a .36 FAR.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> From this, the Foggs argued to the board that 71 Spooner Road was an invalid lot because its creation, as a result of LLC\u2019s ANR plan, had rendered 81 Spooner Road nonconforming as to the bylaw\u2019s FAR requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In his decision (May 31, 2005 letter), the building commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>sioner answered this contention, indicating a permit had been issued to Fredrik and Rebecca Verlanders, the owners of 81 Spooner Road, authorizing the removal of interior attic finish from their home so it would comply with the FAR. The board took this same tack, rejecting the Foggs\u2019 claim as to 81 Spooner Road, on the \u201cassumption\u201d the Verlanders would remove finish from their third-floor attic space.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">2. <em>Land Court </em>judgments,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Apart from affirming the board\u2019s decision to rescind the building permit for 71 Spooner Road in the action commenced by LLC (see Land Court case no. 315582), the judge decided (as alleged by the Foggs) that, as a result of LLC\u2019s development plan, 81 Spooner Road \u201cwas rendered nonconforming\u201d as to its FAR (see Land Court case no. 315662).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">From this, the judge ruled that the \u201cconstruction of a single-family dwelling on 71 Spooner Road would require that 81 Spooner Road be brought into compliance with the floor-to-area [ratio] requirement of the [z]oning [b]y-[l]aw, either by sufficiently reducing the floor-to-area ratio of [81 Spooner Road] or obtaining relief from [this bylaw] requirement.\u201d His ruling formed the basis for the judgment entered in the Foggs\u2019 own action. The judgment declared the board had properly ruled a building permit \u201cwould be allowable\u201d on 71 Spooner Road on the condition that all interior finish be removed from 81 Spooner Road\u2019s third-floor attic. The Foggs did not appeal from or quarrel with that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In this appeal, LLC challenges the Land Court\u2019s judgments, arguing that: the judge erred and abused his discretion in upholding the board\u2019s decision to revoke the permit; the Foggs failed timely to appeal to the board within thirty days from the issuance of the building permit; they did not have standing to obtain zoning relief before the board or Land Court; and the judge erred in applying the common-law doctrine of infectious invalidity to this zoning dispute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>We defer addressing the parties\u2019 legal contentions in order that we may describe briefly the framework of the bylaw pertinent to this appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">3. <em>Zoning bylaw. </em>In 2008, prior to the entry of the challenged judgments here, the Supreme Judicial Court declared the bylaw to be legally valid, to the extent it employed a maximum \u201cfloor area ratio,\u201d to regulate the bulk size of single-family homes in the town. <em>81 Spooner Road, LLC </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>452 Mass. 109 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Addressing a prior appeal by LLC,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> from a different Land Court decision, the Supreme Judicial Court declared the bylaw did not violate the Legislature\u2019s directive in G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 3, second par., which commands: \u201c[n]o zoning ordinance or bylaw shall regulate or restrict the interior area of a single-family residential building. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Construing the statutory language, for purposes of reviewing LLC\u2019s bylaw challenge, the court determined that the FAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>regulation had only an \u201cincidental\u201d effect, as opposed to an impermissible \u201cdirect\u201d impact, on the interior area of single-family homes, and, as such, was a lawful exercise by the town of its delegated zoning power. <em>81 Spooner Road, LLC, supra </em>at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Section 5.20 of the bylaw forms the core of its FAR requirement. That provision mandates: \u201cFor any building or group of buildings on a lot the ratio of gross floor area to lot area shall not exceed the maximum specified\u201d in the bylaw\u2019s dimensional requirements table. 71 Spooner Road and 81 Spooner Road are situated in a residential S-10 district of the town, which allows a maximum .30 FAR for all single-family dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The area of the 71 Spooner Road lot is 11,648 square feet. LLC admits the gross floor area of a new single-family residence on the lot must not exceed 3,494 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">a. <em>Gross floor area. </em>\u201cGross floor area\u201d is defined by \u00a7 2.07 of the bylaw as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">\u201cThe sum of the areas of the several floors of a building, including areas used for human occupancy in basements, attics, and penthouses, as measured from the exterior faces of the walls.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">There is an express exemption under \u00a7 2.07 of the bylaw for \u201ccellars, unenclosed porches, or attics <em>not used for human oc</em>cupancy,\u201d which, if applicable, shall be excluded from the gross floor area count of a given single-family dwelling.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">b. <em>Attic. </em>LLC claims (as it did below) that the disputed \u201cunfinished\u201d space in the 71 Spooner Road home fell within the bylaw\u2019s definition of an attic \u201cnot used for human occupancy,\u201d and therefore, must not be included in that home\u2019s gross floor area count. Section 2.01(3) of the bylaw defines an \u201cattic\u201d as the \u201c[s]pace in a building between the roof framing and the ceiling beams of the rooms below and not considered habitable space.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">c. <em>Habitable space. </em>\u201cHabitable space\u201d is defined by \u00a7 2.08.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>of the bylaw as \u201c[s]pace in a structure for living, sleeping, eating, or cooking or otherwise <em>used </em>for human habitation\u201d (emphasis supplied). It is noteworthy that the bylaw provision, \u00a7 2.21(2), defines \u201cuse\u201d as follows: \u201c[t]he purpose for which land or a building is arranged, designed, or intended, or for which either land or a building is or may be occupied or maintained.\u201d Reading these two related terms together, so as to make a harmonious whole of the bylaw, habitable space is meant to encompass that space, in a building or part thereof, which is designed or intended for human habitation. <em>Foxborough </em>v. <em>Bay State Harness Horse Racing &amp; Breeding Assn., Inc., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 618 (1977) (\u201cbylaw should be interpreted as a harmonious whole\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">4. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standing. </em>Only a person \u201caggrieved\u201d may obtain zoning relief through the administrative and judicial appeal process. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 17. <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 721 (1996). <em>Chon-gris </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Andover, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 999, 1000 (1984).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To fit this characterization, a party must offer evidence demonstrating a \u201cplausible claim of a definite violation of a private right, a private property interest, or a private legal interest.\u201d <em>Harvard Square Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Cambridge, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 493 (1989). A person aggrieved must offer proof to show his or her injury is \u201c \u2018special and different\u2019 \u201d from concerns of the community at large. <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham </em>v. <em>Hingham Campus, LLC, </em>438 Mass. 364, 369 (2003), quoting from <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>429 Mass. 551, 554 (1999). <em>Barvenik </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 132 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">An abutter to property on which another is allegedly acting in violation of a local bylaw or ordinance is presumed to be an \u201caggrieved\u201d person with standing to contest a claimed violation. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11. Pursuant to \u00a7 11, Frances Fogg, as a direct abutter to the building lot in question \u2014 71 Spooner Road \u2014 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>presumed to have legal standing to challenge LLC\u2019s alleged noncompliance with the local bylaw. <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation Assn., </em>421 Mass. 106, 111 (1995). LLC concedes George Fogg shared that presumptive status; however, LLC contends it offered evidence rebutting George Fogg\u2019s presumed legal status. The judge did not see it that way, and we concur in his determination. \u201c[A] judge\u2019s finding that a person is or is not aggrieved will not be set aside unless the finding is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 440 (2005). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">To effectively rebut the Foggs\u2019 presumptive standing, LLC was obliged to offer evidence \u201c \u2018warranting a finding contrary to the presumed fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 34 (2006), quoting from <em>Marinelli </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stoughton, </em>440 Mass. 255, 258 (2003). It must be of a type that is credible and sufficient to rebut the particular claims of injury advanced by an abutter. LLC does not identify any expert or independent forensic evidence in the record to show it met its burden. <em>Sweenie </em>v. <em>A.L. Prime Energy Consultants, </em>451 Mass. 539, 543 n.11 (2008). <em>Denneny </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Seekonk, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 208, 212 n.6 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Before the judge, LLC offered excerpts from a deposition of George Fogg, in an effort to rebut his presumptive legal status. LLC misapprehends its burden of production and persuasion. While it is true a party\u2019s unsubstantiated opinions are not adequate to confer standing,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> LLC cannot claim shelter under this rule and cause the burden to shift to George Fogg, simply by offering his opinion testimony and by drawing speculative conclusions from that testimony.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The judge correctly declined LLC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>invitation to require the Foggs to prove their own standing, in the absence of a sufficient rebuttal. The board had jurisdiction to entertain the Foggs\u2019 zoning appeal, as did the Land Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">b. <em>Timeliness of Foggs\u2019 appeal to board. </em>Nor is there merit to LLC\u2019s claim that the Foggs\u2019 appeal was untimely filed with the board. In making this jurisdictional argument, LLC had asserted the Foggs had \u201cknowledge of the commissioner\u2019s issuance of the building permit within\u201d the thirty-day appeal period. The judge rejected LLC\u2019s contention along this line and denied its corresponding summary judgment motion, filed more than eight months after trial had concluded.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The judge found there was \u201cnothing\u201d in the record to show that the Foggs had any notice at all, actual or constructive, of the building permit\u2019s existence, authorizing construction on 71 Spooner Road, during the thirty-day period, from April 8, when the permit had issued to LLC. No such showing has been made here, consistent with our opinion in <em>Gallivan </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 850 (2008), where it had been conclusively established, by uncontroverted proof, that an abutter, who had belatedly challenged a building permit\u2019s issuance, did in fact have both \u201cadequate\u201d notice of the permit\u2019s issuance and a \u201cfair opportunity\u201d to bring a timely appeal within the thirty-day appeal period. <em>Id. </em>at 855, 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">A zoning enforcement appeal procedure has been held to be necessary to protect a person aggrieved by a violation of the zoning law, under circumstances where he or she has not had notice of, and a fair opportunity to challenge, the permit within the thirty-day appeal period, running from its issuance.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westport, </em>348 Mass. 515, 520 (1965). <em>Yokes </em>v. <em>Avery W. Lovell, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 471, 480-483 (1984). <em>Elio </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 429-430 (2002). <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Concord, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 748, 751 (2002). Without a right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>appeal under c. 40A, an aggrieved party who lacks notice of a local zoning decision would be left without a remedy to prevent further overcrowding or dense building lot coverage, in his or her immediate neighborhood. See <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 296 (2008); <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeal of Boston, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 8, 11-12 (2009). That is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The permit\u2019s issuance did not, within the following thirty-day appeal period, \u201ccome to the attention\u201d of the Foggs. The town provided no written notice to the Foggs. Nor did LLC commence construction, under its permit, during the appeal period. This appeal is quite unlike <em>Gallivan </em>and the judge correctly rejected LLC\u2019s characterizations to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">c. <em>Validity of board\u2019s decision. </em>On appeal from a decision of a local zoning board, a judge of the Land Court (or Superior Court) shall hear the dispute de novo and determine the legal validity of a board\u2019s decision, on the facts as found by the court. <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 295 (1972). <em>Lobisser Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Belling-ham, </em>454 Mass. 123, 126 (2009). Mindful of the settled standard,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the judge properly upheld the board\u2019s decision to revoke the building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The crux of the dispute as to 71 Spooner Road boils down to a narrow issue: whether \u201cunfinished\u201d space, nearly 1,000 square feet, located on the second floor of the home, must be added to its <em>gross floor area </em>count, for determining FAR compliance. If so, it is accepted 71 Spooner Road (as presently designed and constructed) exceeds the .30 FAR maximum. LLC\u2019s principals, Timothy Kefleher and Dennis Cronin, admitted as much at trial.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Drawing from the bylaw definitions of \u201cattic\u201d and \u201chabitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>space\u201d and related FAR provisions,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> its study of building plans filed with the town, and its inspection of the partially-built 71 Spooner Road dwelling, the board concluded LLC had designed and built the unfinished second-floor space with the intention of using it as living quarters. What was \u201creadily apparent\u201d to the board members, who heard this matter, was that the disputed space was not only \u201caccessible\u201d by a stairwell that provided code compliant access to other space on the home\u2019s second floor, but also that the disputed space had more than the minimum ceiling height to be suitable for human occupancy.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The board thus found the disputed unfinished second-floor space was not an exempt \u201cattic\u201d as defined by \u00a7 2.01(3) of the bylaw.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The judge determined that the board\u2019s interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the bylaw was reasonable and entitled to deference. <em>Wendy\u2019s Old Fashioned Hamburgers of New York, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Billerica, </em>454 Mass. at 381. The judge also shared the board\u2019s conclusion that the disputed unfinished space at 71 Spooner Road was not an \u201cattic\u201d as defined by the bylaw and, as such, was required to be included in the gross floor area enumeration for that structure. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">d. <em>Infectious invalidity. </em>As for the 81 Spooner Road home, the board pointed out it had been advised by the building commissioner\u2019s office that the new owners (Fredrik and Rebecca Verlander) had \u201capplied\u201d for a building permit to remove \u201call interior finish\u201d from their third-floor attic, to make it nonhabitable, and, thus, exempt from the gross floor area and FAR calculation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On this \u201cassumption,\u201d and given that the local bylaw then made provision for a homeowner to \u201cconvert\u201d an attic into habitable space, the board inferred a homeowner could do the opposite: namely, convert a habitable attic into a nonhab-itable exempt attic, a practice that the board had, on at least one prior occasion, acknowledged to be permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The Foggs had argued because 81 Spooner Road was caused to be nonconforming with the bylaw\u2019s FAR requirement, this flaw, they said, \u201cinfected\u201d 71 Spooner Road, rendering it an invalid lot. The board rejected this argument. The judge overturned this aspect of the board\u2019s decision, ruling that 71 Spooner Road was an invalid building lot, based on the common-law infectious invalidity doctrine as applied to the facts found by him pursuant to his de novo review.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The judge found that Frederik and Rebecca Verlander (owners of 81 Spooner Road) had not removed interior finish from their third-floor attic. The judge determined the third-floor attic of 81 Spooner Road must be included in the home\u2019s gross floor area count. LLC, as a result of its ANR plan and development scheme, caused 81 Spooner Road to be nonconforming with the bylaw. Relying on <em>Alley </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Danvers, </em>354 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Mass. 6, 8 (1968),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the judge ruled that 81 Spooner Road\u2019s nonconformity, which was a product of LLC\u2019s ANR plan, \u201cinfected\u201d 71 Spooner Road, rendering it an invalid lot. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Seventy-one Spooner Road admittedly conforms to dimensional limits of the bylaw. That is insufficient, however, where, as here, LLC\u2019s division of an existing conforming lot \u2014 81 Spooner Road \u2014 not only created a new lot but also left the remainder of 81 Spooner Road nonconforming. The judge correctly held 71 Spooner Road was infected by the resulting violation on the contiguous 81 Spooner Road parcel. See <em>Alley </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Danvers, supra. </em>Compare <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Nantucket, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 733, 737-738 (1983), with <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Kotlik, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 414 &amp; n.7 (1993). LCC may not form a new building lot by dividing an existing conforming lot if as a result the latter is rendered nonconforming by such a division.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In short, the Land Court judge correctly ruled the board\u2019s decision to revoke the permit was based on legally tenable and justifiable grounds, and also correctly ruled that the 71 Spooner Road lot was an invalid lot because it had been created by LLC\u2019s division of 81 Spooner Road, pursuant to an endorsed ANR plan, which consequently rendered the property at 81 Spooner Road nonconforming with local zoning. It follows that the Land Court\u2019s judgments must be affirmed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-12\">LLC\u2019s appeals were consolidated by an order of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\">An ANR endorsement is \u201cessentially preliminary to the issuance of a building permit,\u201d <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dracut, </em>453 Mass. 888, 893 (2009), and \u201cis not an attestation of compliance with zoning requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\">On March 25, 2005, LLC sold the 81 Spooner Road property to Fredrik Verlander and Rebecca Verlander.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\">They did so on June 27, 2005, some twenty-seven days from the building commissioner\u2019s written reply denying their enforcement request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\">This is not a new zoning or land use device used by local permit granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>authorities in our Commonwealth, or the town of Brookline, specifically.

Off-street parking for 81 Spooner Road, prior to the ANR plan division, was provided for by a driveway and associated space on the westerly side of the lot, which is now a part of 71 Spooner Road. LLC obtained a permit to build a new driveway on the east section of the then single parcel (prior to the planning board\u2019s ANR endorsement). This work required extensive excavation into a hillside area, close to Mr. Fogg\u2019s property. The Foggs challenged this permit, with no success, before the building commissioner, and eventually, the board. In its June, 2005 appeal, the Foggs invoked its earlier claim that the grade, or slope, of the driveway did not satisfy the bylaw requirement, \u00a7 6.04.4(e), for a \u201cgrade of [ten percent] or less in the first [twenty] feet from the property line.\u201d Based on the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine, see <em>DiCicco </em>v. <em>Berwick, </em>27 Mass.
