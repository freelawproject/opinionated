(Electrolux), the plaintiff suffered severe injuries in 2001. In 2005, he obtained a jury verdict against Electrolux of $550,000 in the Federal District Court, and thereafter brought this action against Electrolux and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>its captive insurer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Equinox Insurance Company (Equinox). He claimed that both corporations engaged in claim settlement practices in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3, and G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On cross motions for summary judgment, a judge of the Superior Court, citing <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Assn., </em>417 Mass. 48 (1994), and <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., </em>441 Mass. 451, 454 n.1 (2004), determined that neither company was engaged in the business of insurance. He allowed the defendants\u2019 motions and denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">1. <em>Facts and provisions of policy issued by Equinox. </em>At the relevant time of the negotiations concerning the plaintiff\u2019s claim, Electrolux, the manufacturer of the lawnmower involved in the plaintiff\u2019s accident, was the parent and sole shareholder of several wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Equinox. Organized as a captive insurance company in Vermont, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>Equinox issued policy number G.L.040101-03<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> insuring \u201cElectrolux North America, Inc. (as per Broad Named Insured Endorsement)\u201d for the policy period April 1, 2001 to April 1, 2004. The annual premium was $16,600,000<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for \u201cCommercial General Liability Coverage Part.\u201d The limits of insurance were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201cGeneral Aggregate Limit (Other than Products \u2014 Completed Operations) $15,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">\u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations Aggregate Limit $15,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">\u201cPersonal and Advertising Injury Limit $2,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201cEach Occurrence Limit $2,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">\u201cFire Damage Limit \u2014 Any One Fire $2,000,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201cMedical Expense Limit \u2014 Any One Person $5,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The policy insured (with the addition of endorsement no. 1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">\u201cElectrolux North America, Inc. and AB Electrolux and all their affiliated, subsidiary, controlled or associated companies, corporations or other legal entities now existing or subsequently formed (including subsidiaries thereof).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In addition \u201cWho is an insured\u201d included \u201cexecutive officers and directors\u201d when acting in \u201cyour behalf,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the policy was also amended to include any vendor \u201cwith respect to the distribution or sale in the regular course of the vendor\u2019s business of [Electrolux] products\u201d (with certain exceptions). The policy had some eighty-five endorsements adding owners, lessees, or contractors as insured with respect to liability arising out of \u201c \u2018your work\u2019 for that insured by or for you.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Coverages included \u201cCoverage A. Bodily injury and property damage liability\u201d; \u201cCoverage B. Personal and advertising injury liability\u201d; \u201cCoverage C. Medical payments\u201d; and \u201cSupplementary payments \u2014 coverages A and B.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AtD\">With respect to the coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability the policy provided in relevant part: \u201cWe will indemnify the insured for those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies. No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>covered unless explicitly provided for under SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS \u2014 COVERAGES A AND B. . . .[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] You have the right and duty to defend any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages. But ... we may investigate and settle any claim or \u2018suit\u2019 at our discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Coverage C provides for medical payments. It contains a clause specifying that \u201c[t]he injured person submit[ ] to examination, at our expense, by physician of our choice as often as we reasonably require.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The policy sets forth \u201cDuties in The Event of Occurrence, Claim or Suit.\u201d Those provisions include the requirement that \u201cyou must notify your Director of Risk Management as soon as practicable and arrange for the defense of such claim or \u2018suit.\u2019 \u201d That section also provides that \u201c[n]o insureds will, except at their own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent.\u201d The policy thus does not explicitly give the insured (Electrolux) the right unilaterally to settle claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Gene Heskett, the director of risk management at Electrolux and the president of Equinox, claimed in an affidavit that Equinox has no employees, only a board of directors, and that since it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>never had any employees, no Equinox personnel played a role in the investigation or negotiation of the plaintiff\u2019s underlying claim. He averred that Equinox had no involvement in the investigation, negotiation or litigation of a claim. Its role is purely that of a funding vehicle for the reimbursement of Electrolux for claims that are paid by Electrolux.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">As revealed in the minutes of a meeting of the board of directors of Equinox held on November 30, 2001, Heskett reported to the board that \u201cover the last 2 years results have been moving from break-even to profitability\u201d and that \u201cyear-end income will be less than we made last year, but still substantially profitable.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In answers to interrogatories addressed to Equinox, Heskett stated that premiums to be paid to Equinox are calculated on the basis of loss experience to which are added anticipated costs for administration, data processing, taxes, and other related expenses for the upcoming policy year.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In reviewing the allowance of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, we examine de novo the judge\u2019s legal conclusion that Electrolux and Equinox were not engaged in the business of insurance. See <em>Maffei </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, </em>449 Mass. 235, 243 (2007), cert, denied, 552 U.S. 1099 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">a. <em>Equinox. </em>That company is registered as a captive insurance company in Vermont. The record shows that it is a for-profit entity, calculates the premiums it charges based on loss experience and costs, calls itself an insurance company, and has issued a policy that states it provides commercial general liability and other coverage. As a captive company, it provides Elec-trolux certain advantages over a self-insurer, see note 2, <em>supra. </em>See also note 11, <em>supra. </em>Equinox does not claim that the policy provisions are unlike those of other insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">What it claims is that since Equinox is a captive company, Electrolux is in effect a self-insurer, and therefore Equinox is not engaged in the business of insurance. Equinox argues that it falls within the ambit of <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., </em>441 Mass. 451 (2004) <em>(Morrison). </em>It also claims that since it has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>employees and merely reimburses Electrolux, it did not engage in any unfair practices. We reject both arguments. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us (Toys) was a self-insurer, that is, it did not have insurance against certain losses. <em>Id. </em>at 456. Toys had no contract with any other entity. As pointed out in Morrison, the prohibitions set forth in G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), were \u201cdesigned to remedy a host of possible violations in the insurance industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, quoting from <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 562 (2001). Those concerns, the <em>Morrison </em>court held, \u201ccannot legitimately be extended to a self-insurer such as Toys, which had no contractual obligation to settle the plaintiff\u2019s claim and is not otherwise regulated by the Commonwealth for insurance activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455. The court also noted that the plaintiff \u201cappears to concede that Toys is not \u2018engaged in the business of insurance\u2019 and, thus, not directly subject to G. L. c. 176D\u2019s regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Here, in contrast, Equinox is a separate corporation regulated by the State of its incorporation, and is engaged in the business of issuing insurance policies. One of the \u201cbedrock principles of corporate common law\u201d is that \u201ccorporations \u2014 notwithstanding relationships between or among them \u2014 ordinarily are regarded as separate and distinct entities. See, e.g., <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C. K., Inc., </em>432 Mass. 546, 555 (2000); <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 614, 618 (1968).\u201d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>NG US 1, Inc., </em>450 Mass. 760, 766 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The case of <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Assn., </em>417 Mass. at 52, is of no assistance to Equinox. Not only has that case been weakened by the 1996 amendment to G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 1(a), St. 1996, c. 313, see <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594, 608 (2010), but unlike the entity in that case, which was government-created and controlled, here Equinox was formed for business reasons, see <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>412 Mass. 774, 775-776 (1992), and has, as we have indicated, provided economic advantages to Electrolux, its parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">In view of its separate corporate identity and the financial benefits to Electrolux of having a captive insurer rather than being a self-insurer, i.e., having no insurance, we consider Equinox, a distinct corporation issuing documents that have all the indicia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>of insurance policies, to be in the business of insurance. <em>Morrison </em>is not apposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">More pertinent is <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Risk Mgt. Foundation of the Harvard Med. Insts., Inc., 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 411 (1994) <em>(Miller). </em>The facts in that case were as follows: Beth Israel Hospital and other Harvard-affiliated hospitals and certain of their respective staffs were provided with medical malpractice insurance by the Controlled Risk Insurance Company (CRICO), an entity organized in the Cayman Islands. Risk Management, incorporated in Massachusetts as a charitable corporation, investigated claims asserted against the hospitals, negotiated settlements, and appointed counsel when the claims proceeded to trial. As characterized in <em>Miller, </em>it sought \u201cto control or minimize the ultimate exposure of CRICO and thus of the hospitals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. Both CRICO and Risk Management were owned by Harvard University and the affiliated hospitals, <em>ibid.; </em>thus CRICO was a captive insurer. When Miller brought suit against Risk Management for failure to effectuate a fair settlement of the Millers\u2019 claims, Risk Management argued that because it was not an insurer, no direct action could be brought against it under G. L. c. 93A, which authorizes an action against an insurance company that violates G. L. c. 176D.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Justice Kaplan, writing for the panel, held that \u201cRisk Management, as claims negotiator and potential settler, has been interposed between the insurer CRICO and the claimant, and nothing seems more appropriate than to apply to it the standards of fair dealing expressed in c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418. The Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Morrison, </em>441 Mass. at 455, considered this a \u201cproper[ ]\u201d conclusion. Implicit in the <em>Miller </em>case, which applied the standards of c. 176D to Risk Management, is that had CRICO itself been a defendant, c. 176D would certainly have applied to it. While the court was not specifically directed to the argument made here that captive insurers should be treated as self-insurers, both this court and the Supreme Judicial Court were clearly aware that CRICO was a captive insurer and Risk Management was a wholly-owned subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We note that the matter of the applicability of unfair trade practices to captive insurers has often been addressed by State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>statutes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Massachusetts and a number of other States do not have a special captive insurer act. The only places captive insurance companies are discussed in the Massachusetts insurance law are in the \u201cBusiness Transacted with Broker-Controlled Insurer Act,\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 174F, inserted by St. 1993, c. 47, and in the \u201cpollution liability reinsurance corporation\u201d statute, G. L. c. 175G, \u00a7 4, inserted by St. 1987, c. 650, \u00a7 2. The following definition appears in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 174G: \u201cAll captive insurers, for the purposes of these sections one hundred and seventy-four F to one hundred and seventy-four K, inclusive, captive insurers are insurance companies owned by another organization whose exclusive purpose is to insure risks of the parent organization and affiliated companies or, in the case of groups and associations, insurance organizations, owned by the insureds, whose exclusive purpose is to insure risks to member organizations and group members and their affiliates.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The insurance industry is subject to extensive legislative provisions. In view of the legislative silence on the subject of the applicability of c. 176D to captive insurers, we see no reason to except Equinox from the provisions of the general insurance law. If the Legislature considers they should be treated differently, it may, of course, so provide. Since we hold that Equinox is engaged in the business of insurance, it is subject to the provisions of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Equinox also argues that it did not participate in the defense or settlement of the underlying lawsuit and therefore did not perform any actions that could constitute unfair settlement practices. In view of its extensive power to control settlements \u2014 \u201cNo insureds will, except at their own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent\u201d \u2014 we question Equinox\u2019s attempt to escape liability on this ground. Nor do we think that Equinox, by interposing what appears to be its agent, in this case its parent, between the claimant and itself can evade liability. As pointed out in <em>Morrison, </em>441 Mass. at 455-456, \u201cThe significance of the holding of the Appeals Court in the <em>Miller </em>case is that an insurance company cannot evade its statutory duties imposed by G. L. c. 176D by delegating its work.\u201d In any event, the motion judge did not reach these questions, and they may be informed by additional facts. Equinox\u2019s argument that the investigation of the claim was reasonable and did not violate c. 176D is a disputed matter and hence is not subject to summary judgment. Accordingly, the judgment in favor of Equinox is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">b. <em>Electrolux. </em>Although under the insurance policy Electrolux has a duty to defend (and perhaps, a duty to settle, a matter not clear under the policy), under the <em>Morrison </em>decision, Electrolux is not in the business of insurance. It is therefore not subject to c. 176D. Accordingly, judgment in its favor is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">To summarize, the judgment in favor of Equinox is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The judgment in favor of Electrolux is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Captive insurance companies are separate insurance companies formed to bear the risks of the parent company. Equinox bore the risks of the parent, its subsidiaries, and to some extent its vendors and others. Premiums paid to a captive may be tax-deductible, and a captive has the potential to produce lower insurance costs for the parent than coverage purchased from a commercial insurer.

Some of them provide that only the provisions in the special acts apply to these companies (thus in these States captives are usually not subject to unfair practices provisions applicable to other insurers). See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a7 27-31B-18 (LexisNexis 2007); Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 23-63-1616 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2009); Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 38a-91oo (2009); Del.
