L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, he argues that the trial judge erred in permitting the Commonwealth to introduce testimony about his failed efforts to take a breathalyzer test. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Background. </em>The jury could have found the Dllowing: police Officer Craig Perry saw the defendant make an Ilegal right turn through a red light on Main Street in the tov n of Hudson at approximately 3:00 p.m. on September 18, 2C )8. When Perry activated the blue lights on his cruiser, the d&lt; endant accelerated and drove away; he stopped a short time 1 ter in a parking lot. The defendant told the officer that he was coming from a local bar, but he initially denied having any hing to drink.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Perry observed the defendant with red and glass <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>eyes; he could smell an odor of alcohol, and the defendant\u2019s spi ;ch was slurred. The officer called for assistance, and he asked he defendant to perform certain field sobriety tests. The defen ant agreed but, according to Perry, his performance was \u201cno too good\u201d; in fact, the officer opined that the defendant failei all of the tests and that he was too impaired by alcohol to drivi . The defendant was then arrested and taken by another officer. John Donovan, to the police station.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">At the police station, the defendant was givei an opportunity to take a breathalyzer test. Sergeant Christopher Shea, the patrol supervisor, testified that, when asked to take the est, the defendant responded with questions about the effects of Icohol, whether they depended on a person\u2019s body weight an l when he had eaten, and the \u201ctiming of first and last drinks.\u201d Sergeant Shea did not answer the questions; he offered the deft idant a consent form for the test, and the defendant continued 1 &gt; question him. Eventually, the defendant said that he wanted to i ike the test, but he wanted a drink of water first. Shea explain <em>i </em>that the procedure did not permit him to take anything by m 'Uth before taking the test. The defendant then agreed to take i and he signed the consent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Donovan instructed the defendant \u201cto blow ito the mouthpiece with a deep breath with his lips sealed ; ound ... the edge of . . . the mouthpiece so that the sampl could go into the machine, and he [the defendant] kept bit wing with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>mouth open so the air would not go into the machine.\u201d Donovan told the jury that, if the machine does not get enough of a breath sample, it will not give a reading. Both Donovan and Shea testified that the defendant went through the process four times, each time blowing in the same way, and never producing a reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">After the test process, the defendant began to complain that he was going \u201cto be going into a diabetic shock.\u201d The arresting officer, Perry, who had been trained as a fire fighter and an emergency medical technician, did not see any of the symptoms that he had been trained to look for, nor did Shea. Nevertheless, an ambulance was called; paramedics arrived, and the defendant told them that his complaint was \u201cdehydration.\u201d He was transported to a local hospital at approximately 4:30 p.m.; Perry accompanied him to the hospital because he was still in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">At the hospital, the defendant reiterated that he had low blood sugar; however, it was the opinion of the paramedics that \u201chis blood sugar was fine,\u201d and the hospital staff then \u201cdid a test for dehydration\u201d and gave him \u201cone bag of intravenous fluid.\u201d During the hour that the defendant was at the hospital, he made a telephone call to his brother. Perry overheard the defendant\u2019s side of the conversation and testified he heard him say \u201che\u2019s in the hospital, he got nervous \u2014 he got pulled over by the police, he was nervous to take the test so he pulled a fast one, and then he laughed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">When the defendant was returned to the station, he demanded to take a breathalyzer test. Shea told him that the time for the test was over but he again advised the defendant of his rights under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 5A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response, the defendant became argumentative, threatening, the sergeant testified, to \u201cdrive a car drunk again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The defendant testified that he had gone to see his dentist in the afternoon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He then went for lunch by himself at a Chinese <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>restaurant and had a \u201cMai Tai.\u201d After lunch, he drove to leave a check with his attorney.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He then drove to me it his brother at \u201ca bar called Yours and Mine.\u201d He had a dril k called a \u201cSea Breeze\u201d and left after ten minutes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Perry st pped him soon afterwards, and he acknowledged making an legal right turn on a red light.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The defendant testified that he was nervous during the field sobriety tests but he believed that he performs 1 them well. At the police station, he told the police officers tl at his lips were cracked and dry and he would need \u201ca drink of vater or at least some Chapstick ... if they wanted me to blov on that thing.\u201d He denied making any complaint about his t ood sugar. His request for water was refused and, eventually, he was transported to a hospital and given intravenous fluids. He a&lt; rnitted speaking to his brother from the hospital and telling 1 .m that he had pulled \u201ca fast one,\u201d an expression he testified r ferred to his illegal right turn on a red light. He did not disag ee with the officer\u2019s description of him as laughing, saying, \u201c did not feel in any way that I was impaired to a point where i was going to, what happened happened, so I . . . probably w: ;n\u2019t taking it as serious as I should have. I was in a good mood, . . . like I say, I had a coupla drinks in me, uh, I wasn\u2019t worrii i, I just wasn\u2019t worried, you know.\u201d Other than saying that he vas dehydrated and his lips were chapped, the defendant ne- er specifically described what happened when he tried to take \u00ede test.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant argues that admitt ng evidence of his failed breathalyzer attempts violated his rig it against self-incrimination because the failed attempts were intamount to a refusal, citing <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>412 Mass. 1201, 1210-1211 (1992).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">It is well settled that evidence of a defendant\u2019 refusal to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>a chemical breath test offered by a police officer is not admissible against him in a trial for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>412 Mass, at 1211, where the court reasoned that \u201csuch refusal evidence is both compelled and furnishes evidence against oneself . . . [and] therefore would violate the privilege against self-incrimination of art. 12\u201d of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See also G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(e)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>452 Mass. 510, 513 (2008) (\u201cIt is well settled in Massachusetts that a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood alcohol or field sobriety test is inadmissible at trial\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ranieri, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 366, 370-371 (2006).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The underlying rationale for this holding is that \u201ca defendant\u2019s refusal is the equivalent of his statement, T have had so much to drink that I know or at least suspect that I am unable to pass the test.\u2019 . . . Based on this analysis, evidence of a refusal to submit to a requested breathalyzer test is testimonial in nature.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>412 Mass, at 1209. Such a statement is compelled, the court reasoned, by the choice ordinarily facing such a defendant. \u201cThe accused is thus placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>in a \u2018Catch-22\u2019 situation: take the test and perhi ps produce potentially incriminating real evidence; refuse and have adverse testimonial evidence used against him at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In this case, the defendant did <em>not </em>refuse tc take the breathalyzer test; had he done so, evidence of that re fusal would have been inadmissible against him. Instead, he sign ;d a form indicating that he <em>consented </em>to take the test.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> What followed \u2014 a series of physical actions \u2014 was properly t \u00ede subject of the observing police officer\u2019s testimony. This is net the \u201cCatch 22\u201d situation that gave rise to the court\u2019s concern ,n <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>\u2014 one in which a criminal defendant has no choice but to provide incriminating evidence against himself. This defendant had a choice that would not 1 ave incriminated him, that is, he could have refused to take the breathalyzer test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Instead, he chose to sign the consent form. Thereafter, the jury could have inferred from his actions, as th &gt; Commonwealth argued, that he was trying to avoid giving a ; ample while appearing to try to take the test. Accordingly we conclude that the evidence was properly admitted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\n<em>Judg nent affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-16\">In a subsequent, jury-waived trial, the defendant was found guilty of operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor, third offense. He was also found responsible for a civil motor vehicle infraction of failure to stop or yield, G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 8; this infraction was placed on file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">EventualIy, he told Officer Perry that he had had two c cktails \u2014 a \u201cMai Tai\u201d and a \u201cSea Breeze\u201d \u2014 at two different locations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Donovan also noticed an odor of alcohol, slurred spec h, red and glassy eyes, and an unsteady gait. The defendant told him tilt he had had two drinks, including a glass of wine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">General Laws c. 263, \u00a7 5A, provides an operator with the right to be examined immediately by a physician selected by him, including the right to obtain a blood test at his own expense to determine his blood alcohol level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b201-10\">The dentist testified that he knew the defendant, that he had filled a tooth for him that afternoon, that he had no odor of alcohol on his breath, and that he did not appear to be intoxicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The attorney testified that he saw the defendant brief. \u2022 at 3:00 p.m. and exchanged pleasantries. He did not notice anything unusual <em>i </em>out the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The bartender at Yours and Mine, who went to school /ith the defendant and has known him for thirty years, testified that she s rved him a \u201cSea Breeze\u201d and that she believed that he was \u201cperfectly fine when he walked in. She said that he stayed perhaps fifteen minutes and was fine when he left.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant did not ob ot to the evidence when it was offered and, therefore, that the standard of rev ;w is whether any \u201csupposed error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage c justice.\u201d Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>we find no error, it is not necessary to determine whether the standard of review is substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice or harmless error. However, we note that the defendant <em>did </em>object to this evidence. He filed a motion in limine, seeking to have it excluded, as the Commonwealth concedes, and the motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied the motion. The defendant objected at that time, and he objected twice during the trial when the evidence was offered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(e), as amended through St. 2003, c. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, provides, in pertinent part, \u201cIn any prosecution for a violation of paragraph (a), evidence of the percentage, by weight, of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood at the time of the alleged offense, ... as indicated by a chemical test or analysis of his breath, shall be admissible and deemed relevant to the determination of the question of whether such defendant was at such time under the influence of intoxicating liquor; provided, however, that if such test or analysis was made by or at the direction of a police officer, it was made with the consent of the defendant.... <em>Evidence that the defendant failed or refused to consent to such test or analysis shall not be admissible against him in a civil or criminal proceeding </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The court has extended the same analysis to a refusal to perform field sobriety tests. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrail, </em>419 Mass. <em>774, </em>779-780 (1995) (\u201cWe see very little difference between evidence of refusal to take a breathalyzer test and refusal to take a field sobriety test\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 58, 61-62 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ranieri, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. at 371-373.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In another context, this court has held that \u201c[t]he co sent to take the test impliedly contemplates the taking of a valid test (one tl at would be admissible in court).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sabourin, </em>48 Mass App. Ct. 505, 506 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">This case is also distinguishable from cases where tl e defendant\u2019s <em>statements </em>about his ability to do field sobriety tests were deemed testimonial evidence revealing his own assessment of his sobriety. S( e <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 61-62 (\u201cAlthough he offert d the excuse that he was not trained to do the test, the jury would have been vi arranted in inferring that he thought he could not do the test because he <em>hi </em>d had too much to drink\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\">We decline to address the defendant\u2019s remaining am unsupported arguments, that admission of his \u201cattempts\u201d to take the bret halyzer test forced him to testify and that, because he also suffered driver\u2019s 1: ense consequences with the registrar for not completing the test, it was some low unfair that the evidence was used against him in his criminal trial. See IV ss.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\">There was no objection to this testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
