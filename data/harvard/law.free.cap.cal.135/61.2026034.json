Post, Assistant Attorney-General, for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b98-6\">SMITH, C.</author>\n<p id=\"A3TU\">The defendant was accused, by information, \u201cof the crime of receiving stolen property, committed\u201d as stated in the information, which, with necessary additions, follows the language of the statute. (Pen. Code, sec. 496.) The verdict of the jury was: \u201cWe, the jury in the above-entitled case, find the defendant, Chas. H. Tilley, guilty of receiving stolen property,\u201d which was received and recorded, and judgment of conviction entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">It is urged on behalf of the appellant that neither the information nor the verdict is sufficient to sustain the judgment, and that the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to be discharged after the verdict was received and recorded. The first point, we think, is untenable. The information follows the language of the statute, which is sufficient. The last point is well taken, if the verdict be in fact insufficient. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arnett, </em>129 Cal. 306.) The only point to be considered, therefore, is as to the sufficiency of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">We do not regard this as a special verdict. It was evidently intended as a general verdict; and the question is as to its sufficiency as such. In considering this, it is to be borne in mind that the verdict is to be construed in connection with the plea of the defendant and the information. Otherwise, the ordinary forms of verdict, \u201cGuilty,\u201d \u201cGuilty of manslaughter,\u201d etc., (Pen. Code, secs. 1157, 1159; <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>87 Cal. 281,) would be entirely without meaning; while, in connection with the information, they cannot be understood otherwise than as referring to the defendant and to the crime named in the information or indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Further, the form of the verdict is to be regarded as immaterial, provided the intention to convict of the crime charged be unmistakably expressed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>48 Cal. 559; <em>People </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>49 Cal. 390, 391; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>118 Cal. 448.) On the other' hand, it is expressly provided that \u201c No judgment of conviction can be given, unless the jury expressly find against the defendant upon the issue.\u201d (Pen. Code, sec. 1162.) Hence there is no room for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>inference outside the words of the verdict. These must express the intention unequivocally; otherwise, the verdict must be regarded as insufficient. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ah Gow, </em>53 Cal. 628.) And, <em>a fortiori, </em>it must be so regarded, if it be susceptible of a different construction than that of guilty of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Applying these principles to the present case, we think it clear that the verdict must be regarded as insufficient. The general issue before the jury was whether the defendant was guilty of the particular crime charged, which, again, involved three specific issues,\u2014namely, as to the receiving the stolen money by the defendant, as to his knowledge of the fact that it was stolen, and as to the intent of personal gain. It devolved upon the jury, therefore, to find on all of these issues, which it could have done by the general verdict of \u201c Guilty.\u201d But the actual verdict is \u201c Guilty of receiving stolen property,\u201d which is not, according to any received meaning of the terms, equivalent to the verdict of <em>\u201c </em>Guilty \u201d or <em>\u201c </em>Guilty as charged. \u2019 \u2019 Hence such intent is not expressed in the verdict; and, under the statutory rule (Pen. Code, sec. 1162), we are not at liberty to ascribe to the jury any intention beyond what is thus expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The argument urged on behalf of the respondent serves simply, we think, to illustrate and confirm this view. It may be admitted that it would be absurd to suppose that the jury intended to acquit the defendant, yet it does not follow that it was the intent of the jury to convict him of the crime charged, \u25a0\u2014which is the actual question to be determined; or still less, that such an intent is expressed in the verdict. It may be admitted, also, for the purposes of this case, that the words \u201c receiving stolen property \u201d are to be construed as denoting the crime that goes by that name, and, further, that it was used by the jury as referring to the crime as described in section 496 of the Penal Code, and with the intent of finding the defendant guilty of \u201c the <em>crime of receiving stolen property,\u201d </em>as determined by that statute,\u2014yet the verdict still fails to express the intent of finding him guilty of the crime charged in the information. Under the laws of this state there are two species of the crime of receiving stolen property,\u2014\u2022 namely, that of receiving such property,\u2014knowing it to be stolen,\u2014for one\u2019s \u201c own gain \u201d (as is charged in the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>tion), and that of receiving it with intent \u201c to prevent the owner from again possessing his property. \u2019 \u2019 And there is nothing in the verdict from which it can be determined of which of these crimes, if either, it was the intent of the jury to convict the defendant. It may be that they were satisfied that the defendant received the goods knowing them to be stolen, but received them, not for his own use, but for that of the thief, and with a view of preserving them for him, and thus preventing the owner from again possessing them; in which case he would be guilty under the statute of the crime of receiving stolen goods, but not of the particular crime charged in the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">But we have, we think, ascribed more force to this argument than it is entitled to. The term <em>\u201c </em>receiving stolen property \u201d is, for brevity of expression, often used to denote the crime that goes by that name, but it is not always so used; nor when used does it necessarily express this intent. According to the proper use of the terms, it would mean simply what it says. Used, as it is here, in conjunction with the word \u201c Guilty,\u201d the expression denotes the receiving of the property under circumstances that rendered the receiving culpable, and will be equally appropriate whether the culpability intended was criminal, or illegal without being criminal, or merely immoral. Thus, it may be that the jury were satisfied from the evidence that the defendant was guilty of the receiving of the stolen goods, but were not satisfied either of his knowledge of their being stolen of as to the intent of personal gain; and that they accordingly found the fact of which they were satisfied, and omitted to find the others of which they were not satisfied; which, under the familiar maxim, <em>Expressio unius exclusio alterius, </em>is the most natural construction. Or other intents in the minds of the jury might be imagined, all equally congruent with the verdict as the intent to find the defendant guilty of the particular crime charged against him. It cannot be said, therefore, that the verdict unequivocally finds the defendant guilty of the offense charged, or that it expresses an intent to do so. Nor do we think (assuming that we could go outside the verdict) that there is ground for the inference that such was their intent,\u2014though, were it otherwise, the fact would be immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The case, therefore, comes, within the authority of the decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>117 Cal. 499, in which an essentially similar verdict was considered and adjudged to be insufficient. In that case \u201cthe indictment charged the obtaining of the property of C. Schnelle by means of false and fraudulent representations,\u201d and the verdict was that \u201c the defendant is guilty of defrauding C. S. Schnelle of the note of one hundred and seventy-five dollars in the indictment mentioned.\u201d This was held to be insufficient, on the ground that it failed to find, \u201c either in itself or by reference to the indictment, all the elements of the crime.\u201d It was doubtless recognized by the court, in the case cited, that the verdict, in effect, found that the note referred to was obtained from Schnelle by fraud; but the defect was that it did not respond to the issue as to the particular fraud charged, and hence it could not be determined \u201c by what means the fraud was consummated,\u201d or that \u201c it was consummated as charged in the indictment.\u201d -\"\u00a1i</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">We advise that the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to discharge the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Haynes, C., and Cooper, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to discharge the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Garoutte, J., Van Dyke, J., Harrison, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
