FISHER AMES, Appellant.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b282-7\">Street Assessments\u2014Vrooman Act\u2014Constitutional Law.\u2014The act regulating assessments for street improvements, known as the \u201cVrooman Act,\u201d is constitutional and valid. The prior decisions of this court, distinguishing the case of <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Balcer, </em>172 U. S. 269, and upholding the constitutionality of the Vrooman Act, are affirmed.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b282-8\">APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County and from an order denying a new trial.

S. 269, to sustain his contention. Since the appeal was taken and the briefs filed in this case, the case of <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>172 U. S. 269, has been twice considered by this court in cases not distinguishable from the one now before us, and the constitutionality of the Vrooman Act was in both cases sustained. (See <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Dague, </em>130 Cal. 207, 217, and <em>San Francisco Paving Co. </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>134 Cal. 39, and cases there cited.) In the latter ease, referring to the case of <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Dague, </em>130 Cal. 207, 217, it was said: \u201cAlthough invited by appellants to overrule that case, we decline to do so, as we are satisfied with it as a final declaration of the law on the subject.\u201d A careful examination of appellant\u2019s very able brief discloses no ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>upon which those cases should be overruled or distinguished, and I therefore advise that the judgment and order appealed from be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Smith, C., and Cooper, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Henshaw, J., McFarland, J., Temple, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
