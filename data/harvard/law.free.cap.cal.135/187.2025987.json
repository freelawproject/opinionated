Appellant\u2019s cause of action rests upon the alleged fact that, on January 28, 1894, the parties verbally contracted that during that year appellant was to receive the same salary which he had been receiving during the previous year,\u2014namely, five hundred dollars per month; but the court found that no such contract had been made, and this finding is determinative of the case against the appellant. Counsel for appellant argues, with a good deal of plausibility and force, that the preponderance of evidence is against the correctness of this finding; but he fails to show that the evidence on the issue was not fairly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>flicting. The record shows that there was such conflicting evidence; and it cannot be rightly said that there was no substantial evidence pointing to the conclusion at which the court below arrived. Therefore, under the well-settled rule, the finding cannot be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The judgment and order denying a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Temple, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
