These it found to be untrue. Afterwards an order was made granting the plaintiff a new trial, from which the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In this we think there was no error. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence consisted of the warrant, assessment, engineer\u2019s certificate, and diagram, with the affidavit of demand and nonpayment,\u2014all of which, it appeared, had been duly recorded in the office of the street superintendent; and no other evidence was introduced. This, under the express provisions of the statute, established the plaintiff\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case, and hence established, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, all the facts constituting his cause of action, including the fact that the width and grade of the streets in question had been officially established. (Street Improvement Act, sec. 12 (Stats. 1889, p. 168); <em>Fanning </em>v. <em>Bohme, </em>76 Cal. 151; <em>Fanning </em>v. <em>Leviston, </em>93 Cal. 187; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Conniff, </em>99 Cal. 391; <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>102 Cal. 519; <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Conniff, </em>103 Cal. 78.) The cases cited by the appellant\u2019s attorney are not in conflict with this position. In <em>Dorland </em>v. <em>Bergson, </em>78 Cal. 637, evidence was introduced by the defendant \u201ctending to show that the grade [of the street in question] had never been officially or otherwise established.\u201d In <em>Witter </em>v. <em>Bachman, </em>117 Cal. 323, it appeared affirmatively that the return of the warrant had not been recorded; and it was said by the court: \u201cNone of the cases cited by plaintiff presented facts as exist here. There was nothing in these cases to show any defect in this <em>prima facie </em>evidence. But here the return of the warrant is self-impeached by showing on its face the fatal defect.\u201d In this case it affirmatively appears that the return and other documents were duly recorded; and it is therefore unnecessary to determine what, in the absence of direct proof, the presumption as to record would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">I advise that the order appealed from be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Gray, C., and Chipman, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">McFarland, J., Temple, J., Henshaw, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
