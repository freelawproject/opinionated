Mrs. Moore\u2019s suit for accidental death benefits under the Unum policy provided by her employer is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>We vacate the district court\u2019s award of judgment to Mrs. Moore because the court misapplied the standard for determining whether her husband\u2019s death was accidental. The district court was correct, however, in concluding that the evidence in the administrative record was insufficient to establish that the policy\u2019s controlled substances provision applies. Because the judgment in favor of Mrs. Moore is being vacated, we also vacate her award of attorney\u2019s fees. The case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On October 22, 1998, between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m., William E. Moore (Moore) entered the home of his girlfriend, Lisa McFerrin, without permission. Moore, who was carrying a pistol, went to McFerrin\u2019s bedroom where he found her and her invited guest, Jerry Sayles. An altercation between Moore and Sayles ensued, and Sayles wrested the gun from Moore and beat him with it. Moore died from cardiac arrhythmia due to the stress of the beating. A toxicology report revealed that Moore was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Moore\u2019s wife, Rosanne Moore (Mrs. Moore), had insurance coverage for accidental injury or death under a policy maintained by her employer. Moore, her husband, was a covered spouse under the policy. The policy covered losses, including loss of life, that \u201cresult directly and independently of all other causes from accidental bodily injury.\u201d J.A. 62. A rider excluded coverage for \u201cinjury caused by or contributed to directly or indirectly by: the Insured being under the influence of a \u2018controlled substance.\u2019 \u201d J.A. 91. Moore\u2019s death prompted Mrs. Moore to file a claim for accidental death benefits under the policy. Unum (the insurance company) denied the claim on two separate grounds: (1) that Moore\u2019s death was not accidental because he was the \u201caggressor in an altercation that led to his death,\u201d J.A. 112, and (2) that coverage was excluded because Moore was under the influence of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, which either caused or contributed to his death. Mrs. Moore pursued an internal appeal with Unum, and the company\u2019s ERISA appeals committee confirmed the denial of her claim. Mrs. Moore then filed an action to recover under the policy in South Carolina state court, and Unum removed the case (on grounds of complete preemption under ERISA) to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. Thereafter, the parties stipulated that the district court \u201cshould decide the case based on the record before the Court.\u201d J.A. 351 n. 2. After conducting a <em>de novo </em>review of the administrative record, the district court awarded judgment to Mrs. Moore, concluding that she was entitled to death benefits under the policy. The court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Mrs. Moore. Unum appeals, raising three issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Unum first argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard when it concluded that Moore\u2019s death was an accident within the meaning of the insurance policy. We review this issue of policy (or contract) interpretation <em>de novo. Johannssen v. Dist. No. 1-Pac. Coast Dist, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>292 F.3d 159, 171 (4th Cir.2002). Because the policy in this case is regulated by ERISA, we are \u201cguided by federal substantive law.\u201d <em>Baker v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>171 F.3d 939, 942 (4th Cir.1999). In determining the principles of federal law that govern contract interpretation under ERISA, we may, of course, look to state law for guidance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">When an insured dies as a result of the intentional act of another, the death is considered accidental \u201cif the insured is innocent of aggression, or wrongdoing, or even if he is the aggressor, if he could not reasonably anticipate bodily injury resulting in death to himself at the hands of another.\u201d <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Murdaugh, </em>94 F.2d 104, 107 (4th Cir.1938) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court concluded that Moore\u2019s death was accidental because, even if Moore was the aggressor, he would not have anticipated \u201cthe cardiac arrhythmia which resulted in death as highly likely to occur under the circumstances.\u201d J.A. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The district court misapplied the standard. When an altercation ends in the death of the aggressor, the death is not an accident if the aggressor could reasonably anticipate that he might die at the hands of his opponent. The aggressor does not have to anticipate the exact cause of his death. The question, in other words, is whether it is <em>reasonably foreseeable </em>to the aggressor that he is triggering a chain of events that could result in his death, regardless of the exact cause. A case cited by Mrs. Moore, <em>Rooney v. Mutual Benefit Health and Accident Association, </em>74 Cal.App.2d 885, 170 P.2d 72 (Ca.App.1946), illustrates the role that the aggressor\u2019s foreseeability plays in determining whether his death resulting from an altercation is accidental. In <em>Rooney </em>the insured got into an argument with a stranger in a restaurant, and the insured invited the stranger outside to settle the matter. A fistfight ensued, and no deadly weapons were involved. The insured, who was the aggressor, died after hitting his head on a concrete sidewalk during the fight. The insured\u2019s death was accidental, the California Court of Appeals held, because he did not have reason to believe his \u201cfistic encounter would result in death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74. Thus, under <em>Rooney, </em>when the aggressor can reasonably expect that his death could be the result of the altercation he initiates, his death is <em>not </em>accidental. <em>Id. </em>In sum, the aggressor\u2019s death does not fit the accidental category if he can reasonably anticipate that his death could result from the altercation. The aggressor does not have to forsee the exact cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Here, Moore\u2019s death was not an accident simply because he would not have reasonably anticipated the exact cause, cardiac arrhythmia. Moore entered his girlfriend\u2019s house uninvited at about 4:00 a.m., and carrying his handgun, he went into her bedroom where she was with another man who was her guest. Moore\u2019s resulting death was not an accident \u201cif he could [have] reasonably anticipate^] bodily injury resulting in death to himself at the hands of another.\u201d <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Murdaugh, </em>94 F.2d 104. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s determination that Moore\u2019s death was an accident, and we remand for the proper application of the standard set forth in <em>New York Life Insurance Company v. Murdaugh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Unum argues second that the district court erred in concluding that Moore\u2019s death was not directly or indirectly caused by his use of methamphetamine. This meant that Unum was not excused from the payment of death benefits because of the policy\u2019s controlled substances exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The toxicology tests of Moore\u2019s blood showed he had between 2.1 mg/L and 3.9 mg/L of methamphetamine in his system at the time of his death. A forensic review by Dr. Kristin G. Sweeney provides the only medical analysis in the administrative record of the relationship between Moore\u2019s methamphetamine use and his death. Dr. Sweeney\u2019s report discusses in general terms the link between the use of stimulants and cardiac arrhythmia. She concludes that \u201cchronic cocaine and/or methamphetamine abuse could contribute to a cardiomyopathy\u2019 and that the \u201cknown pharmacologic effects of methamphetamine, particularly at this toxic level, could be expected to acutely exacerbate any preexisting cardiovascular disease.\u201d J.A. 126-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In the district court proceedings, Unum sought to bolster Dr. Sweeney\u2019s report by tendering the deposition of Dr. Joel Sexton; Dr. Sexton was deposed in a separate proceeding after the administrative record in this case had closed. Dr. Sexton had already submitted a report in this case; however, his original conclusions, which were in the administrative record and which were made without an examination of the toxicology results, did not mention methamphetamine. In the tendered deposition, Dr. Sexton testified that after considering the toxicology report, he had concluded methamphetamine was a cause of Moore\u2019s death. Mrs. Moore objected to the submission of the Sexton deposition, and the district court excluded it, holding that it was \u201cimproper supplemental evidence.\u201d J.A. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In <em>Quesinberry v. Life Insurance Company of North America, </em>987 F.2d 1017 (4th Cir.1993), we discussed when it is proper for a district court, in conducting a <em>de novo </em>review of an ERISA benefits claim, to consider evidence that was not part of the record before the plan administrator. As a general rule, the court should consider only the administrative record that was before the administrator. \u201cExceptional circumstances,\u201d however, \u201cmay warrant an exercise of the [district] court\u2019s discretion\u201d to consider additional evidence when it is \u201cnecessary for resolution of a benefit claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1026-27. Unum argues that two of the exceptional circumstances mentioned in <em>Quesinberry </em>required the district court to consider Dr. Sexton\u2019s testimony: (1) the analysis in Dr. Sexton\u2019s deposition could not have been presented during the administrative process and (2) the controlled substances exception in the policy requires the consideration of a complex medical question that should be resolved with the assistance of actual testimony. Dr. Sexton\u2019s deposition does not fall within either of these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">First, although Dr. Sexton was deposed after Unum, the plan administrator, reached its decision, the toxicology report showing that Moore was under the influence of methamphetamine was available before the administrative record was closed. As the district court found, Unum could have submitted the toxicology report to Dr. Sexton, or another expert, for an opinion before the administrative record closed. For whatever reason, Unum failed to take this step. As we observed in <em>Quesinberry, </em>there is a difference between evidence that could have been mustered during the administrative process and evidence that simply could not have been developed in time. In other words, \u201cif the evidence ... is simply better evidence than the [party] mustered for the claim review, then its admission is not necessary\u201d in the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 1027. Dr. Sexton\u2019s analysis of the toxicology report is simply better evidence than could have been, but was not, developed and included in the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Second, the role of methamphetamine in Moore\u2019s death is a medical question, but it is not so complex that it cannot be resolved by review of the administrative record. This is not a situation where additional information in the form of actual testimony is necessary to \u201cfacilitate the understanding of complex medical [issues] through an exchange of questions and answers between experts, counsel, and the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If Unum had submitted for the administrative record a report from Dr. Sexton analyzing the toxicology data on Moore, we are confident that the doctor\u2019s report would have been sufficiently understandable on judicial review. In short, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Sexton\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Finally, we turn to the district court\u2019s decision that the controlled substance exclusion does not apply, a decision that we review <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1022. The district court concluded that the evidence in the administrative record is insufficient to permit a finding that Moore\u2019s death was a direct or indirect result of methamphetamine use. Dr. Sweeney\u2019s opinion about the effects of chronic use of methamphetamine or cocaine is not relevant because there is no evidence that Moore was a chronic user of such drugs. In addition, Dr. Sweeney\u2019s opinion \u2014 that the level of methamphetamine in Moore\u2019s system <em>could </em>have contributed to his death by exacerbating a pre-existing cardiovascular disease \u2014 is too indefinite to support a finding that Moore\u2019s death was a result of methamphetamine use. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s determination that there was not sufficient evidence to trigger the controlled substances exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Finally, Unum appeals the award of attorney\u2019s fees to Mrs. Moore. After the district court granted judgment to Mrs. Moore awarding her death benefits under the policy, the court entered an order granting her motion for attorney\u2019s fees under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g). Because we are vacating the judgment awarded to Mrs. Moore, we also vacate the order allowing her attorney\u2019s fees. The attorney\u2019s fees issue may be reconsidered on remand should that become appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">In sum, we vacate the district court\u2019s orders awarding judgment and attorney\u2019s fees to Rosanne Moore. We affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that coverage cannot be denied under the policy\u2019s controlled substances exclusion. We remand for reconsideration of whether or not William E. Moore\u2019s death was an accident under the standard discussed in part II of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">\n<em>VACATED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
