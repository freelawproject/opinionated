Broadie appeals from his jury conviction and sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). Upon the jury\u2019s finding of guilt, the district court sentenced Broadie to seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment, two years of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $100 special assessment. On appeal, Broadie claims insufficiency of the evidence and claims the district court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a downward departure based on over-representation of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">In evaluating a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, the jury verdict must be upheld if there exists substantial evidence, including circumstantial and direct evidence, to support the verdict, viewing the evidence most favorable to the government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). In resolving issues of substantial evidence, we do not weigh evidence or review witness credibility, <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989), rather, the credibility of witnesses is within the sole province of the jury. <em>United States v. Lamarr, </em>75 F.3d 964, 973 (4th Cir.1996). We may reverse a jury verdict only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the jury\u2019s conclusions. <em>Sherrill White Constr., Inc. v. South Carolina Natl Bank, </em>713 F.2d 1047, 1050 (4th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">Here, there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, including Broadie\u2019s own trial testimony in which he admitted the shotgun was in his apartment and further admitted that he moved it. While he further claimed he did not put it there and did not possess it, asserting that it was left there by a prior tenant, the jury apparently found that portion of his testimony not to be credible. Broadie further testified that he asked his landlord to remove the shotgun from Broadie\u2019s apartment, but the landlord\u2019s testimony contradicted this testimony. There was testimony by police that when they responded to the call that a gun had been discharged, Broadie initially denied that he had any firearms in his apartment. In addition, the government presented evidence that the police found six .25-caliber unspent rounds on the floor in Broadie\u2019s bedroom, which rounds were the same brand and caliber as the freshly-fired round discovered on the sidewalk leading to Broadie\u2019s apartment. Additional evidence established that Broadie was a convicted felon. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>We find this evidence sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Broadie further asserts that the district court erred in refusing to grant his motion for downward departure. A district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure is not reviewable unless the court based its decision on the mistaken belief that it lacked authority to do so. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>209 F.3d 338, 352-53 (4th Cir.2000). In this case, because the district court explicitly recognized its authority to depart, yet refused to do so, we decline to review Broadie\u2019s claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Broadie\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
