He contends that his firearm conviction is invalid under <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-29\">The district court correctly construed the petition as a successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because Barrera has filed a previous motion and again attacks his conviction and sentence. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). The district court also correctly determined that Barrera\u2019s petition is not permitted by the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because Barrera was able to assert his <em>Bailey </em>claim in a prior motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>lacked jurisdiction over Barrera\u2019s successive motion because it could be filed only if authorized by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and only in the Southern District of Florida, where Barrera was convicted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The appeal is frivolous, and it is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Further frivolous filings will subject Barrera to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
