Lingle first challenges the sufficiency of the factual basis for his conspiracy and aiding and abetting the making of counterfeit money convictions. Specifically, he contends that there was insufficient evidence that he participated in manufacturing the counterfeit $100 bills. Because Lingle did not lodge objections at rearraignment to the factual basis for his guilty pleas, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-20\">In the factual basis, Lingle stipulated that he and his mother agreed that she would make counterfeit $100 bills, which they both would spend. These facts were sufficient to support Lingle\u2019s conspiracy conviction. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>264 F.3d 561, 577 (5th Cir.2001). Similarly, the factual basis was sufficient to support Lingle\u2019s conviction of aiding and abetting the manufacture of counterfeit obligations since Lingle stipulated that he shared in the criminal intent and because he engaged in passing the counterfeit $100 bills. <em>See United States v. Sorrells, </em>145 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>F.3d 744, 753 (5th Cir.1998). Lingle\u2019s deficient factual basis arguments fail to survive plain error review. <em>See Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 58-59,122 S.Ct. 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Lingle next contends that the two-level counterfeiting enhancement he received pursuant to U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(2) was improperly applied since he \u201chad no involvement in the making of the counterfeit $100 bills.\u201d Under a similar rationale, Lingle also challenges the four-level loss enhancement that was assessed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Based on Lingle\u2019s guilty plea stipulations, the manufacturing of the $100 bills was a reasonably foreseeable act undertaken in furtherance of the counterfeiting conspiracy. Furthermore, the district court\u2019s intended loss calculation is supported by record. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in overruling Lingle\u2019s objections to both sentencing enhancements. <em>See United States v. Maseratti, </em>1 F.3d 330, 340 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and for purposes of preserving the issue for further review, Lingle asserts that his challenged sentencing enhancements are unconstitutional since they were based upon findings that were neither found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt nor agreed to by Lingle. Lingle correctly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 03-30437).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b557-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
