We dismiss in part and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-23\">In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); see <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582 proceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). These time periods are mandatory and jurisdictional. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>United States v. Raynor, </em>989 F.2d 191, 196 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The district court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 3582 relief was entered on the docket on January 30, 2002, and the notice of appeal was filed on February 25, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). The district court\u2019s order denying as moot Miller\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability was entered on the docket on March 19, 2004, and the notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on May 10, 2004. Because Miller failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss his appeal from these orders for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Turning to the remaining portion of this appeal, the district court entered its order denying the motion to reconsider the denial of \u00a7 3582 relief on January 30, 2004; the ten-day appeal period expired on February 13, 2004. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2). Miller filed his notice of appeal on February 25, 2004 \u2014 after the ten-day period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period that expired on March 15, 2004.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Miller has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period applicable to the order denying reconsideration. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration of Miller\u2019s appeal from the denial of the motion to reconsider. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">. Miller styled his filing as a motion for a certificate of appealability. We find that the motion should have been construed as a notice of appeal from the orders denying Miller's \u00a7 3582 motion and motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-23\">. The thirtieth day fell on Sunday, March 14, 2004. Thus, the excusable neglect period expired on Monday, March 15. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
