He appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application as time-barred. The district court granted a certificate of appealability as to: (1) whether the initial filing of Edwards\u2019s state habeas corpus application constituted a \u201cproperly filed\u201d application for purposes of the statutory tolling provision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); and (2) whether Edwards was entitled to equitable tolling. This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 application based upon procedural grounds. <em>Grillette v. Warden, Winn Corr. Ctr., </em>372 F.3d 765, 769 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">The initial filing of Edwards\u2019s state habeas corpus application did not constitute a \u201cproperly filed\u201d application for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals determined that the application failed to comply with Tex.R.App. P. 73.2. <em>See Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361,148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000); <em>Larry v. Dretke, </em>361 F.3d 890, 895 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, Edwards has failed to allege circumstances warranting equitable tolling from the time he initially filed his state habeas corpus application to the time that application was returned to him for noncompliance. <em>See Felder v. Johnson, </em>204 F.3d 168, 170-71 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, because the district court properly dismissed Edwards\u2019s instant application as barred by limitations, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
