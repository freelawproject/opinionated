He argues that the condition of supervised release prohibiting him from possessing \u201cany other dangerous weapon\u201d must be vacated because it is impermissibly vague and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-28\">We interpret Mata-Ramirez\u2019s \u201cover-breadth\u201d argument to mean that the \u201cany other dangerous weapon\u201d condition violates the requirement that a condition of supervised release involve \u201cno greater de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>privation of liberty than is reasonably necessary ... to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d <em>See United States v. Paul, </em>274 F.3d 155, 165 n. 12 (5th Cir.2001); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) <em>&amp; </em>(C). Mata-Ramirez was convicted of illegal reentry after deportation and while on supervised release is prohibited from committing both federal and state crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Under these circumstances, the \u201cany other dangerous weapon\u201d condition is not over-broad because it does not involve a greater deprivation of liberty than is necessary to afford adequate deterrence of criminal conduct and to protect the public form further crimes by him. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) &amp; (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">As to Mata-Ramirez\u2019s vagueness challenge, this court has held that \u201cConditions of probation \u2018may afford fair warning even if they are not precise to the point of pedantry. In short, conditions of probation can be written \u2014 and must be read \u2014 in a <em>commonsense way.\u2019 \u201d See Paul, </em>274 F.3d at 167 (citation omitted; emphasis added). When the definition of a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is read in the requisite commonsense manner, this definition reflects that intent to cause harm is required in order to characterize as a dangerous weapon an instrument which is not dangerous when used in its customary manner. <em>Id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment, (n.l(d)) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Mata-Ramirez also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Mata-Ramirez raises an issue that he concedes is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). We must follow the precedent in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Accordingly, Mata-Ramirez\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
