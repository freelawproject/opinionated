He was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment, three years supervised release, a total payment of $191,215.37 in restitution, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Olivari argues on appeal that the district court violated the Speedy Trial Act (SPA) when it granted the government\u2019s motion for a continuance of the trial beyond the SPA\u2019s time constraints. He contends that the court did not conduct a proper \u201cends of justice\u201d analysis when granting the government\u2019s motion for a continuance and that the court\u2019s reasons for granting that motion were inappropriate under the SPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">There is no indication in the record that the district court did not conduct a proper \u201cends of justice\u201d analysis. The record also reflects that the district court did provide written reasons for its finding as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A). The district court did not clearly err in granting the continuance. In fact, had the court not done so, the government would not have had the time reasonably needed to debrief Olivari\u2019s co-defendants (who had agreed to plead guilty on the eve of trial) and to reconstruct the presentation that the government relied on to show its numerous exhibits throughout the trial. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv); <em>United States v. Rojas-Contreras, </em>474 U.S. 231, 236, 106 S.Ct. 555, 88 L.Ed.2d 537 (1985) (district court has broad discretion under Speedy Trial Act to grant a continuance if needed to allow further preparation for trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">Olivari also argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction. <em>See United States v. Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d 907, 910 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>975 F.2d 159, 160-61 (5th Cir.1992). Olivari\u2019s conviction and the sentence imposed by the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
