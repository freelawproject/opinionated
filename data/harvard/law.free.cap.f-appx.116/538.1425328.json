He argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-25\">Earnest, however, was not entitled to a self-defense instruction given that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find in his favor. <em>See United States v. Branch, </em>91 F.3d 699, 711-12 (5th Cir.1996). The evidence supports a conclusion that Earnest resorted to excessive force in response to a use of force that was not excessive, and, therefore, the affirmative defense of self defense was unavailable. <em>See Branch, </em>91 F.3d at 714-15; <em>United States v. Ochoa, </em>526 F.2d 1278, 1282 (5th Cir.1976). Earnest\u2019s testimony that he submitted to restraints is but a \u201csingle item of evidence overwhelmed by other evidence in the record\u201d and is therefore insufficient to create a factual issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>for the jury entitling him to the requested instruction. <em>See Branch, </em>91 F.3d at 712-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
