Moore moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that his detention in administrative segregation for five and a half months prior to his indictment violated his due pi'ocess and speedy trial rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The district court denied the motion. Following a bench trial, the district court found Moore guilty and sentenced him to four months in prison to run consecutively to his undischarged sentence. Moore appealed, asserting that the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the indictment. Finding no merit to his claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-19\">Regarding Moore\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim, a defendant \u201cmay invoke due process to challenge delay both before and after official accusation.\u201d <em>Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 655 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992). To determine whether preindictment delay violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, we examine: (1) whether the defendant can show that he has suffered any actual substantial prejudice; and (2) if so, whether the reasons for the delay justify the prejudice to the defendant. <em>United States v. Automated Med. Labs., Inc., </em>770 F.2d 399, 403-04 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see Jones v. Angelone, </em>94 F.3d 900, 907 (4th Cir.1996) (noting that defendant\u2019s burden is a heavy one). Because Moore failed to demonstrate any actual prejudice in this case, we conclude that he failed to establish a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-20\">Turning to Moore\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim, he argues that his placement in administrative segregation deprived him of his right to a speedy trial. However, \u201c[t]he speedy trial right does not apply to ... preindictment delay because that right does not attach until the defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>been arrested or indicted.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>94 F.3d at 906 n. 6. Confinement in administrative segregation is not equivalent to an arrest or accusation for Sixth Amendment purposes. <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>698 F.2d 221, 223 (4th Cir.1983). Therefore, Moore\u2019s placement in administrative segregation did not trigger his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Moore\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
