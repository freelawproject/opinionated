R8777, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) following the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 federal habeas application as untimely. Davis is serving four life terms of imprisonment for burglary of a dwelling, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-22\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), Davis was required to file his habeas application on or before November 17, 2003. The record supports Davis\u2019s contention that he filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition sometime between November 7, 2003 and November 18, 2003. Because the petition was received in the district court less than two days after the expiration of the limitation period, it is presumed timely filed. <em>See Sonnier v. Johnson, </em>161 F.3d 941, 945 (5th Cir.1998). Jurists of reason would thus find that the district court was incorrect in its procedural ruling. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-23\">Davis\u2019s request for a COA is granted, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-24\">COA GRANTED; JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b564-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
