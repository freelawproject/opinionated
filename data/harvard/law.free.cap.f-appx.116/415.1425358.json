The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-69 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that appeal from the denial of a Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion in a habeas action requires a certificate of appealability). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 </em>U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Murph has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">To the extent Murph\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny such authorization. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
