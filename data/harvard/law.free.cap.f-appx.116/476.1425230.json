The district court denied Chapa\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Chapa challenges the district court\u2019s certification decision pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-24\">Chapa first argues that he should not be considered a citizen of Texas, the state where he lived prior to his incarceration, because he does not intend to reside there once he has served his sentence. Chapa\u2019s conclusional assertions on this issue are insufficient to rebut the presumption that he is a citizen of Texas. <em>See Polakoff v. Henderson, </em>370 F.Supp. 690, 693 (N.D.Ga.1973), <em>aff'd, </em>488 F.2d 977 (5th Cir.1974) (adopting district court\u2019s reasoning).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Chapa\u2019s argument that he raised a viable RICO claim is likewise unavailing. Chapa\u2019s assertions are insufficient to show a continuing enterprise, which is a necessary element of a RICO claim. <em>See Montesano v. Seafirst Commercial Corp., </em>818 F.2d 423, 425-26 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Chapa has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal or that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Chapa\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
