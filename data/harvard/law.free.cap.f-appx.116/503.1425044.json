They contend that the summary judgment evidence did not show that Martinez had caused injuries to Roche\u2019s wrists by placing metal handcuffs on them too tightly. They contend that the summary judgment evidence showed that Roche was visibly intoxicated and they reasonably believed that he was in violation of the law against public intoxication under the circumstances of the arrest. These arguments go to the question whether there were genuine issues of fact for trial and to the reasonableness of Jay\u2019s and Martinez\u2019s actions, under their own version of the facts. Because the court lacks jurisdiction to consider these issues in an interlocutory appeal, <em>see Reyes v. City of Richmond, Tex., </em>287 F.3d 346, 350-51 (5th Cir.2002), the appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"A_F\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
