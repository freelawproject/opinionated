The district court sentenced him to six months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. Rafiq\u2019s counsel filed an appeal brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising for the court\u2019s consideration the sufficiency of the evidence to establish that offense but stating that, in his view, there were no meritorious grounds for appeal. Rafiq has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. We affirm Rafiq\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for acquittal. <em>United States v. Ryan-Webster, </em>353 F.3d 353, 359 (4th Cir.2003). Where, as here, the motion was based on insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This court \u201cha[s] defined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In order to sustain a conviction for marriage fraud under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(c), the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the alien knowingly entered into a marriage; (2) the marriage was entered into for the purpose of evading a provision of the immigration law; and (3) the alien knew or had reason to know of the immigration laws. <em>United States v. Chowdhury, </em>169 F.3d 402, 405-06 (6th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Ali, </em>2004 WL 1557357, at *3 (D.Kan. July 9, 2004). A review of the evidence presented at trial convinces us that the Government established these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Rafiq\u2019s conviction and sentence. The court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
