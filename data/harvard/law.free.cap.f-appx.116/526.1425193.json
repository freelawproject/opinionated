Citing \u201cfraud on the court,\u201d they sought to challenge criminal and civil judgments entered against them in the 1990s.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-25\">The appellants now argue that them case was improperly assigned to United States District Judge Lee Rosenthal. They emphasize that they had \u201caddressed\u201d their petition to either District Judge Kenneth Hoyt or to Chief Judge Norman Black, but they do not suggest that the random assignment to Judge Rosenthal was violative of the district court\u2019s \u201cGeneral Order No. 75-2.\u201d \u201cThe business of a court having more than one judge shall be divided among the judges as provided by the rules and orders of the court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 137. Inherent in this statutory directive is the notion that a party may not have his case heard by a judge of his choosing. <em>See, e.g., McCuin v. Texas Power &amp; Light Co., </em>714 F.2d 1255, 1262 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-26\">The appellants had the burden of proving that federal subject-matter jurisdiction existed. <em>Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of U.S., </em>362 F.3d 333, 336 (5th Cir.2004). The All Writs Act did not confer subject-matter jurisdiction upon the appellants\u2019 Petition for Review, because that Act does not create an independent basis of jurisdiction. <em>See Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>322 F.3d 804, 811 (5th Cir.2002). The appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>lants\u2019 action was in the nature of an independent action to set aside a judgment for \u201cfraud on the court.\u201d See Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) (third sentence); <em>Fierro v. Johnson, </em>197 F.3d 147, 152 (5th Cir.1999). To establish fraud on the court, the petitioners were required to show an \u201cunconscionable scheme or plan which is designed to improperly influence the court in its discretion.\u201d <em>Fierro, </em>197 F.3d at 154. Generally, \u201conly the most egregious conduct, such as the bribery of a judge, or the fabrication of evidence by a party in which an attorney is implicated,\u201d will satisfy this standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The appellants have argued that \u201cnew evidence,\u201d in the form of deposition testimony, proves that in the early 1990s they were entrapped and falsely incriminated by the FBI agent in charge of a sting operation targeting them. Although the deposition testimony may support a finding of improper investigatory conduct on the part of that agent, <em>see Brown v. Nationsbank Corp., </em>188 F.3d 579, 583-85, 592 (5th Cir.1999), the \u201cnew evidence\u201d does not reflect the \u201cmost egregious conduct\u201d required to establish \u201cfraud on the court,\u201d and it does not, contrary to the appellants\u2019 contentions, show that Assistant United States Attorneys were complicit in the alleged efforts to prosecute them falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In light of the foregoing, the district court did not err in concluding that subject-matter jurisdiction was lacking. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
