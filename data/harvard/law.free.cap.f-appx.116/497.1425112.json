(Avondale) and Jefferson Pilot Financial Insurance Company (Jefferson Pilot). Gerhold argues that the Summary Plan Description is the document which governs eligibility for disability benefits and that it granted exclusive discretion to the Avondale Committee as Plan Administrator to determine eligibility for benefits. The Summary Plan Description expressly provides that it is not the plan and that in the event of a conflict, the plan document controls. This language is clear and unambiguous and establishes that it is not the plan governing eligibility for benefits. Gerhold has not shown that the district court erred in determining that the long-term disability insurance policy issued by Jefferson Pilot is the plan that governs an employee\u2019s eligibility for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">Gerhold has not shown that the district court erred in determining that Jefferson Pilot was a fiduciary under the terms of the plan and that its decision should be reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. The insurance policy gives Jefferson Pilot discretionary authority over the management of the plan and discretionary authority to grant, deny, or review denied claims, and, therefore, the district court did not err in determining that Jefferson Pilot was a fiduciary. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A); <em>Reich v. Lancaster, </em>55 F.3d 1034, 1047 (5th Cir.1995). Because Jefferson Pilot is the plan fiduciary, the district court did not err in reviewing its decision under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Meditrust Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Sterling Chems. Inc., </em>168 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">Gerhold argues that the medical evidence in the administrative record established that she is totally disabled and is entitled to disability benefits. A review of the administrative record indicates that Jefferson Pilot considered all of the evidence submitted by Gerhold and that its determination is supported by substantial evidence and should be affirmed. <em>See id. </em>at 214-15. Jefferson Pilot was not required to give special deference to the opinion of Gerhold\u2019s treating physicians. <em>See Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 831-34,123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003). The medical evidence indicates that Gerhold\u2019s Crohn\u2019s Disease improved from October 2001 to December 2001 and that by the end of December 2001, her condition was stable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Although Dr. Herbert Mayer stated that he believed Gerhold was disabled, Ger-hold\u2019s two other treating physicians, Dr. William Meyers and Dr. Roger Anatasio, stated that they believed Gerhold could work as a computer technician for a different employer under low to moderate stress conditions. Jefferson Pilot\u2019s denial of disability benefits is supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. <em>See Meditrust, </em>168 F.3d at 214-15. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting the motion for summary judgment filed by Avondale and Jefferson Pilot. <em>See Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of America, </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
