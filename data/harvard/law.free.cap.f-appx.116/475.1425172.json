Duvall, </em>747 So.2d 793, 795 (La.Ct.App.1999). The district court denied and dismissed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition but granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on Du-val\u2019s claims that the state trial court improperly admitted an inculpatory statement and improperly admitted expert opinion testimony. This court denied Du-val\u2019s request for a COA on the remainder of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">With respect to Duval\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly admitted expert opinion testimony from an investigating officer and a forensic pathologist, the district court dismissed that claim as procedurally barred. On appeal, Duval argues only the merits of his claim and does not address the district court\u2019s procedural ruling. The issue has thus been abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Duval argues that the trial court improperly admitted an inculpatory <em>res gestae </em>statement and then improperly denied his motions for a mistrial and for a new trial. Although Duval\u2019s arguments are based solely on state law, we liberally construe his argument as one that the trial court\u2019s alleged error constituted a due process violation. Duval contends that the statement was unduly prejudicial because, without it, the jury could not have found the specific intent required for a second-degree murder conviction in Louisiana. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:30.1(A)(1). But our review of the record, and of Duval\u2019s trial testimony in particular, leads us to conclude that there was overwhelming evidence that the -victim was killed during Duval\u2019s commission of an aggravated burglary. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 14:2(4), 14:36, 14:37.4(A), (C), and 14:60. Therefore, the evidence supports the jury verdict of second-degree murder under the felony-murder provision of La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:30.1(A)(2)(a). Duval does not argue to the contrary. Accordingly, to the extent that Duval\u2019s argument on appeal can be construed as an argument that the trial court\u2019s denial of his mistrial motion and his post-verdict motion for a new trial constituted a due process violation, it is without merit. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The judgment of the district court denying and dismissing Duval\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition is AFFIRMED. Duval\u2019s motions for oral argument and for appointment of counsel to argue on his behalf are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
