He argues that his Texas felony conviction for indecency with a child was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d warranting the 16-level increase under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2. The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 16-level increase when the defendant has a prior felony conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (Nov. 2002). A crime of violence is defined to include \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment, n. l(B)(ii)(II). The Texas crime of indecency with a child constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 607 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 316 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1095, 123 S.Ct. 694, 154 L.Ed.2d 645 (2002). Bautista\u2019s 16-level increase was warranted by his prior conviction for indecency with a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">Bautista also contends that the district court erred at sentencing by assigning him criminal history points for his prior driving while intoxicated (DWI) conviction. Bautista contests his signed waiver of counsel and contends that his DWI conviction was uncounseled and, thus, in violation of the Sixth Amendment. After reviewing the briefs, the record, and applicable authorities, we hold that there is no constitutional violation because Bautista validly waived his right to counsel in connection with his 2002 DWI conviction proceedings. <em>See Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 373-74, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979). The district court did not err in assessing criminal history points for Bautista\u2019s prior uncounseled misdemeanor DWI conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">Bautista further asserts that the \u201caggravated felony\u201d provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional. As Bautista concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>preme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
