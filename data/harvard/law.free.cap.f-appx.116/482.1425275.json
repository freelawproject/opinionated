Altschul was convicted by a jury of one count of assaulting a federal officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. The district court sentenced him to serve 120 months in prison and a three-year term of supervised release. The court imposed this term of imprisonment to run consecutively to several undischarged terms of incarceration that Altschul had been sentenced to serve. Altschul now appeals his conviction and sentence. He also seeks appointment of new counsel. Altsehul\u2019s motion for new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Altschul asserts that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support his conviction because this evidence showed that the victim was a contract guard, not a federal employee. As Altschul did not move for a judgment of acquittal, review of this issue is \u201climited to determining whether the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>318 F.3d 882, 885 (5th Cir.2002) <em>(en </em>banc) (internal quotation and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1242, 123 S.Ct. 1375, 155 L.Ed.2d 213 (2003). The evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to establish that the victim should be considered a federal employee for \u00a7 111 purposes. <em>See United States v. Jacquez-Beltran, </em>326 F.3d 661, 663 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5. (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 922, 124 S.Ct. 320, 157 L.Ed.2d 221 (2003); <em>United States v. Hooker, </em>997 F.2d 67, 74 (5th Cir.1993). Consequently, the evidence is likewise sufficient to support Altsehul\u2019s conviction. <em>See Herrera, </em>313 F.3d at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Altschul contends that the district court improperly instructed the jury concerning whether the victim was a federal employee. Altschul has not shown that the district court\u2019s instructions, which tracked this circuit\u2019s pattern instruction for a \u00a7 111 offense, amount to plain error. <em>See United States v. McClatchy, </em>249 F.3d 348, 357 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Tomblin, </em>46 F.3d 1369, 1379 n. 16 (5th Cir.1995). Altschul has not shown error in connection with his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Altschul likewise has not shown error in connection with his sentence. He contends that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 when it directed that his term of imprisonment run consecutively to several other undischarged terms of incarceration. This argument is inapposite, as the record shows that the court\u2019s decision to require that Altshcul\u2019s prison sentence run consecutively to other prison sentences was not based on this Guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Altschul also insists that the district court impermissibly double-counted when it imposed a sentencing adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4. This argument is likewise inapposite. The district court sentenced Altschul as a career offender, and the proposed \u00a7 2A2.4 enhancement had no bearing on Altschul\u2019s sentence. Altschul has not shown error in connection with his conviction and sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF NEW COUNSEL DENIED; JUDGMENT OF DISTRICT COURT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
