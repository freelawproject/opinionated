The motion places first reliance on lack of jurisdiction in the court of chancery to issue the writ of <em>certiorari. </em>The cause was dismissed and the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">The remedy which the plaintiffs seek in a court of equity is of ancient common law origin. In Vermont it first receives specific statutory recognition in Section 2, Chapter 19 of the Publick Acts of 1824. The enactment provided that the Supreme Court of Judicature, our predecessor, \u201cshall have original and conclusive jurisdiction of all suits in chancery, and such petitions not triable by jury, as may now be brought before said court; and shall have the same powers now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>given by law, to issue and determine all writs of error, <em>habeas corpus, mandamus, scire facias </em>and certiorari.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In the revision of 1839 the provisions of this statute, as it relates to the court of chancery, was included in Chapter XXIV dealing generally with equity jurisprudence. The statutory authority to issue judicial writs of error, <em>certiorari, mandamus, </em>prohibition and <em>quo warranto </em>is set forth at Chapter XXV. R.S. 2536.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">It is now contained in our present 4 V.S.A. \u00a72. \u201cThe supreme court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of such petitions, not triable by jury, as are by law brought before it. It may determine and issue to courts of inferior jurisdiction, corporations, associations \u00e1nd individuals, writs of error, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and quo warranto and other writs and processes that may be necessary to the furtherance of justice and the regular execution of the law. Such court may try and determine questions removed thereto pursuant to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The jurisdiction thus conferred was inherited by the Supreme Court from the power exercised by the King\u2019s Bench in England. The writ issued in the name of the king from the King\u2019s Chancery, as did all judicial writs, but principally to review the record in criminal causes. <em>Woodstock </em>v. <em>Gallup, </em>28 Vt. 587, 591 (Redfield, C.J.); see also Harman, Vermont Court Procedure, 339, 2 Blackstone Commentaries \u00a7 360, p. 2551 (Jones\u2019 Ed.); 1 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence 321 (4th Ed.); <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>New Jersey Highway Authority, </em>19 N.J. 270, 116 A.2d, 29, 31; 14 Am. Jur. 2d, Certiorari \u00a71.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The \u201coriginal and conclusive jurisdiction of all suits in chancery\u201d originally assigned to this Court has been removed elsewhere; \u2022\u2014 first to circuit judges in 1849, then to the judges of the Supreme Court in 1857 and finally to the superior judges, sitting as chancellors, in 1906. No. 40 of 1849; No. 1 of 1857; No. 63 of 1906. But the statutory authority to issue the judicial writs specified in the 1839 revision, including <em>certiorari, </em>did not follow these changes. It has resided continuously in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">The plaintiffs refer to several English equity cases, some as early as the 17th century, where the writ issued from the courts of chancery. But the dangers which would attend the extensive application of the remedy according to the practice of the English courts of chancery, King\u2019s Bench and common pleas were pointed out by Judge Redfield in <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Leicester, </em>22 Vt. 44, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">In any event, the Vermont Regislature has not seen fit to transfer this traditional comriion law remedy to. our courts of chancery. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ingly, the authority to grant certiorari to review the proceedings of inferior tribunals remains exclusively in the Supreme Court where the statute first imposed it. The chancellor correctly dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
