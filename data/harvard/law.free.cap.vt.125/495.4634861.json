Amended 1961, No. 273, eff. Aug. 1, 1961.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The States Attorney and the defendant requested the Windham County Court to pass the cause to this Court for determination of certain questions of law, before final judgment, upon a stipulated statement of facts, in accordance with the provisions of 12 V.S.A. \u00a72386. The request was granted and four questions have been certified to this Court by the Windham County Court for our determination before the entry of judgment below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201c(1) Is VSA 3301 (a) (3), excepting the sale of locally made products from the provisions of the act, null, void, and unconstitutional by reason of imposing an undue burden on Interstate Commerce in violation of Article I, Sec. 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">(2) Does 12 VSA 3301 (a) (3) deny the Defendant equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States in permitting the sale of locally made goods?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">(3) Does 13 VSA 3301 (a) (5) deny the Defendant the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment creating preferred classifications and discriminating as to one group of retailers to the detriment of others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">(4) Are provisions of 13 VSA 3301 (b) essentially religious in character, thereby constituting a law respecting an establishment of religion in violation of Article I of the United States Constitution made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Before considering any of the questions of law certified to us for our determination we must first determine what question, or questions, are raised by the substance of the proceedings below that are pertinent and inevitable in the disposition of the case presented.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">\u201cThe statute providing for appeals before final judgment does not contemplate that abstract or formulated questions should be passed upon by us.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>State Highway </em>Board, 123 Vt. 1, 5, 178 A.2d 390; <em>In re Constitutionality of House Bill </em>88, 115 Vt. 524, 64 A.2d 169.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">\u201cNor does this Court ordinarily consider the constitutionality of an act unless the disposition of the case in hand requires it. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Billings et </em>al, 106 Vt. 149, 155, 170 Atl. 903; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>96 Vt. 379, 119 Atl. 884.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">The information charges the defendant with selling one nightgown in that period of time between midnight on Saturday and midnight on Sunday. The agreed statement of facts states that the defendant sells \u201cnonlocally manufactured products consisting of dry goods including wearing apparel.\u201d These facts, as well as the briefs of the parties, make it abundantly clear that defendant is charged with selling a nonlocally made product, but which product could legally have been sold if it had been made locally by virtue of 13 V.S.A. \u00a73301 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">The defendant asserts that this provision of 13 V.S.A. \u00a73301 is unconstitutional by reason of imposing an undue burden on Interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Commerce in violation of Article I, Sec. 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">This part of 13 V.S.A. \u00a73301 allows the sale of locally made products on one day of the week, but forbids the sale of similar products made elsewhere. We think it evident that \u201clocally made\u201d as used in the statute was intended by the Legislature to apply to products of Vermont manufacture only. The enactments of the General Assembly are applicable to only this State, and it is the welfare of the inhabitants of Vermont which is the concern of the state legislative body, and not that of other states or localities.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">This section of the Sunday Business and Entertainment law is not stated to be necessary for the health and safety of the people of Vermont, or their morals or necessary welfare, nor has the State so argued here. The plain purport of this section of the statute is to allow products of any nature, which are of local manufacture, to be sold exclusively on one day of the week within this State, but the sale of similar products, manufactured elsewhere than locally, is forbidden to be made. Whether or not so intended by the Legislature, the result is a protection of local manufacture against lawful competition from other states for one day out of every seven.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201cProtection of domestic laborers, manufacturers or merchants against the lawful competition from other states by means of discriminatory regulations upon goods manufactured in other states, is an immediate interference with interstate commerce.\u201d <em>In re Opinion of the Justices, </em>211 Mass. 605 ; 98 N.E. 334, 335. <em>Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Co. </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>375 U.S. 361; 11 L. Ed. 2d 289; 84 S. Ct. 378. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Donald, </em>165 U.S. 58, 41 L. ed. 2d 632, 17 S. Ct. 265.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">We, therefore, find that that part of 13 V.S.A. Sec. 3301 (a) (3) reading \u201cand locally made products may be sold and delivered,\u201d is in conflict with Article 1, Sec. 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States and of no force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">It is apparent that our disposition of Question No. 1 which necessitates dismissal of the information, disposes of the case in hand. The other three questions certified, therefore, become abstract questions and need not be passed upon by us. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>State Highway Board, </em>supra. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Billings et al, </em>supra.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
