Cain, a clerk of' the defendant (employed, as defendant claimed, in the business of plaintiffs), had embezzled the amount sought to be recovered, and consequently defendant was not liable. That the plaintiffs had acted in the premises, and in their dealings with defendant, upon this theory, and were estopped from denying the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b734-12\">The referee found in favor of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b734-13\">The defendant appealed from the judgment entered upon the report of the referee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b734-14\"><em>Mr. Amos G. Hull </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b734-15\"><em>Mr. John L.

This fact clearly appears from the evidence, and does not seem to be contested, \u201c That the defendant mixed the money and funds of the plaintiffs with moneys and funds of his own and of third parties, at the office and the bank, and that the money embezzled by the clerk was taken from these moneys and funds, which were so mixed and commingled that it is impossible to determine to whom the money embezzled actually belonged at the time.\u201d This action on the part of defendant made him liable to account to the plaintiffs for their moneys received by him, even admitting that a loss had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">By the act of defendant the identity of plaintiffs\u2019 moneys was lost, and the loss should fall upon the defendant, as Story justly remarks, \u201c as a sort of penalty \u201d for the agent\u2019s negligence in not keeping his principal\u2019s money separate from his own and that of others. When he chose to mingle these funds of the plaintiff with his own, etc., he made the same substantially <em>his own, </em>and incurred the liability and duty of answering to the plaintiffs for the full amount of the same. A loss of a part of these joint and mixed funds must be sustained wholly by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
