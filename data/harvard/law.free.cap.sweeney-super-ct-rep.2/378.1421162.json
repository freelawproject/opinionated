The answer of the defendant contained a series of specific denials, putting in issue every material allegation of the complaint, and also a counterclaim for the recovery of $350\u2014damages alleged to have been sustained by the defendant in the following manner:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-11\">That in pursuance of a certain agreement made between the parties in relation to the hiring of certain premises, a certain chattel mortgage upon the goods and chattels described in the complaint was duly executed and delivered by the plaintiffs to the defendant; that default was made in the performance of the condition contained in the mortgage; that the defendant thereupon took possession, as he lawfully might, of so much of said property as he could find, but that the plaintiffs had, before the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>taking, secreted and removed a part thereof, which could not be found; that it was subsequently discovered that the plaintiffs had no title to a part of the property taken by the defendant, although included in the mortgage, and that the same was replevied and taken from the possession of the defendant by the true owners thereof, whereby the defendant sustained loss to the amount of $350, for which amount he demanded judgment against the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">The plaintiffs demurred to the counter-claim contained in the answer for insufficiency in not stating facts sufficient to constitute a counter-claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">The demurrer was sustained at Special Term, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-7\"><em>Mr. Elias J.

It is broader and more comprehensive than either (Vassar <em>v. </em>Livingston, 3 Kernan, 256; Beardsley <em>v. </em>Stover, 7 How., 294).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-11\">It secures to the defendant the full relief which a separate action at law or a bill in chancery would have secured him on the same state of facts (Gleason <em>v. </em>Moen, 2 Duer, 642).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-12\">It may be for either liquidated or unliquidated damages (Schubart <em>v. </em>Harteau, 34 Barb., 447).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-13\">And of an equitable or legal nature (Currie <em>v. </em>Cowles, 6 Bosw., 453).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-14\">The counter-claim set up by the defendant in his answer, is one of those authorized by subdivision 1, \u00a7 150 of the Code.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>It is a cause of action which arises out of the <em>transaction </em>set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and is also connected with the subject of the action (Code, \u00a7 150, subdiv. 1).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">A counter-claim to be available to a party must afford him protection in some way against the plaintiff\u2019s demand for judgment, either in whole dr in part. It must, therefore, consist of a set-off or claim by way of a recoupment, <em>or be i/n some way connected with the subject of the action stated in the comflcmd </em>(Mattoon <em>v. </em>Baker, 24 How., 329).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">A counter-claim cannot be rejected on account of its being imperfectly stated in the answer. The remedy in such a case is a motion to make it more definite and certain (Currie <em>v. </em>Cowles, 6 Bosw., p. 453).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-8\"><em>Mr. J. A. Davenport </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-9\">The Code authorizes no counter-claim <em>to </em>be set up in an action on tort (Code, \u00a7 150; Patteson <em>v. </em>Richards, 22 Barb., 143; Donohue <em>v. </em>Henry, 4 E. D. Smith, 162).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-10\">The Code of Procedure provides expressly in section 150 for certain exceptions to this rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-11\">The first subdivision of section 150 provides that the plaintiff may set up as a counter-claim <em>\u201c </em>a cause of action arising out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint, as the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, or connected with the subject of the action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-12\">The second subdivision extends the provisions of the first, by providing, that <em>\u201c </em>in an action on contract, any other cause of action arising also on contract, and existing at the commencement of the action,\u201d may be made a subject of counter-claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-13\">These are the only exceptions provided for, and the statute nowhere enacts that a counter-claim shall be allowed in an action on <em>tort. </em>Such actions must therefore follow the general rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-14\">If counter-claims be allowed in actions for tort, the one demurred to is still bad, as it arises neither \u201c on a cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>arising out of the transaction set forth in the complaint as the fomidation of the plaintiffs claim,\u201d nor \u201c on a cause of action connected with the subject of the action \u201d (Code, \u00a7 150, subdiv. 1).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-5\">The transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiffs claim, is the seizure of plaintiffs\u2019 furniture, clothes, and jewelry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">The cause of action attempted to be set up as a counter-claim is founded on the alleged fact that plaintiffs had rendered defendant\u2019s security for rent insufficient: <em>first, </em>by concealing a part of plaintiffs\u2019 furniture, so that it could not be seized by defendant ; and, <em>secondly, </em>by having represented certain furniture to be theirs, when in fact it belonged to others..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-7\">It cannot be said that plaintiffs\u2019 rendering defendant\u2019s security for rent insufficient, by transactions which must have taken place, if at all, before defendant\u2019s seizure could have arisen out of that seizure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-8\">The right of the plaintiffs to claim, and of the defendant to counter-claim, must be reciprocal. Should the defendant in the present case bring an action setting up his present counter-claim in the form of a complaint, the plaintiffs in this case could not then, as defendants, interpose their present complaint as a counter-claim (Mayor of New York <em>v. </em>Parker Vein S. S. Co., 12 Abb., 300; 21 How. Pr. Rep., 289; Piser <em>v. </em>Stearns, 1 Hilton, 86).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b381-10\">Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXF\">The facts pleaded and relied upon by the defendant as a counter-claim constitute a good cause of action in favor of the defendant against the plaintiffs. If greater certainty and definiteness are desired, plaintiffs\u2019 remedy is by motion and not by demurrer. The real question, therefore, to be determined is, whether these facts can be pleaded as a counter-claim in <em>this </em>action, or whether the defendant is to be driven to a separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">The counter-claim is a creation of the Code, and since 1852 includes the defenses of set-off and recoupment as they were un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>derstood prior to that time (Pattison <em>v. </em>Richards, 22 Barb., 146), but is broader and more comprehensive than either. In Boston Mills v. Eull (6 Abb. Pr., N. S., 319; S. C., 37 How. Pr., 299), I discussed this question fully, citing many authorities, and pointed out the distinction between a set-off, recoupment, and the counter-claim introduced by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The first essential of every counter-claim is that it shall, of itself, be a distinct cause of action in favor of the defendant pleading it and against a plaintiff in the action, between whom a several judgment might be had as provided by section 274. If it falls short of this, it cannot be treated as a counter-claim within the meaning of the Code (Vassar <em>v. </em>Livingston, 13 N. Y., 248), although it may constitute a good defense as a set-off (Ferreira <em>v. </em>Depew, 4 Abb. Pr., 131; Duncan <em>v. </em>Stanton, 30 Barb., 533; Spencer <em>v. </em>Babcock, 22 Barb., 326). A counter-claim differs from new matter which may be set up in the answer in this: the new matter can only be used to defeat an action; a counter-claim may be used to sustain an action. It is simply a cross action to enforce a legal or equitable set-off against the plaintiff in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">There are two species of counter-claims authorized by the Code: one which can be pleaded only in an action arising upon contract, and another which may be set up in <em>amy </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">I. In an action arising on contract the defendant may set up as a counter-claim any other cause of action arising also on contract, express or implied (Andrews <em>v. </em>The Artisans\u2019 Bank, 26 N. Y., 301, and Lignot <em>v. </em>Redding, 4 E. D. Smith, 285), and existing at the commencement of the action, against a plaintiff between whom and such defendant a several judgment might be had in the action according to the provisions of section 274, and owned by such defendant at the time of the commencement of the action (Chambers <em>v. </em>Lewis, 11 Abb., 210; Van Valen <em>v. </em>Lapham, 13 How., 240) and due at said time (Rice <em>v. </em>O\u2019Connor, 10 Abb., 362; Code, sec. 150, subd. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">II. In <em>any other </em>action any defendant may set up as a counterclaim against any one^ of the plaintiffs, between whom and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>himself a separate judgment might be had in the action as aforesaid (sec. 274; Briggs <em>v. </em>Briggs, 20 Barb., 477; Newell <em>v. </em>Salmons, 22 Barb., 647), any claim existing in favor of such defendant against such plaintiff at the time of the commencement of the action (see Chambers <em>v. </em>Lewis and Van Valen <em>v. </em>Lapham, <em>supra), </em>and of which such defendant is the owner (Lafarge <em>v. </em>Kelsey, 1 Bosw., 171), <em>provided, </em>however, such claim is founded upon a cause of action arising out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint, oe is connected with the subject of the action (Code, sec. 150, subd. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Formerly the rule was that in an action for a tort a counterclaim, no matter whether arising on contract or based upon another tort, cannot be allowed; but this rule, it will be observed, has now been so far modified as to allow the interposition of a counter-claim in the full sense of the Code, whether arising on contract or based upon a tort, in an action for a tort, whenever such counter-claim is founded upon a cause of action arising out of the transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s claim, oe whenever it is connected with the subject of the action. As soon as a defendant does bring himself within one or the other of these exceptions made to the general rule, his right to counter-claim is perfect, irrespective of the form of plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action as set out in the complaint. This point has been expressly decided by this court, at General Term, in Xenia Bank <em>v. </em>Lee (2 Bosw., 694; 7 Abb., 372). See, also, to same effect, Brown <em>v. </em>Buckingham (11 Abb., 387; 21 How., 190).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The authorities relied upon by the appellants in the case at bar do not establish a contrary doctrine. Hpon a careful examination and analysis of them I found that every case so cited has been correctly decided, although with different result, for the reason that the defendant had failed to bring himself within at least one of the exceptions established by the Code as aforesaid. Pattison <em>v. </em>Richards (22 Barb., 143) was an action for a tort; defendant counter-claimed for breach of a contract made four years prior to the commission of the alleged tort and having- no connection with the subject of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Donahue <em>v. </em>Henry (4 E. D. Smith, 162) was an action for a tort, and a proposed set-off was held inadmissible because it related to other property than the one forming the subject of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Barhyte <em>v. </em>Hughes (33 Barb., 320) was an action for an assault and batteiy. The defendant set up, by way of counter-claim, an assault and battery committed upon him by the plaintiff <em>jprior </em>to the one described in the complaint. The court very properly held that the two occurrences were so independent of each other that they could not be disposed of in one action.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In Mayor, etc., <em>v. </em>The Parker Vein Steamship Company (12 How., 289; 12 Abb., 300; 8 Bosw., 300) the action was on a <em>contract </em>for the payment of rent. The counter-claim was for a wrongful conversion of certain fixtures. It neither arose out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint, nor could it be connected with the subject of the action. To obviate this difficulty the defendants made an attempt to sustain it under the second subdivision of section 150, which provides that in an action arising on contract any other cause of action arising also on contract may be set up as a counter-claim, and argued that they had a right to waive the tort and proceed upon the legal fiction of an implied contract to pay the value. But the court held that this could not be done under the subdivision referred to; that the counter-claim, as pleaded, was simply and purely a claim to recover damages for a tort, upon which, according to the rule laid down by the Court of Appeals in Walker <em>v. </em>Bennett (16 N. Y. R., 250), no recovery could be had as upon contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">' The only remaining question therefore is, whether the defendant has brought himself within the letter and spirit of the first subdivision of section 150 of the Code. I have not been able to find that the precise meaning of the words \u201c subject of the action,\u201d as used in that subdivision, has ever been judicially determined. In Borst <em>v. </em>Corey (15 N. Y. R., 509), the Court of Appeals held that the term <em>\u201c </em>subject-matter \u201d of suits, as used in section 49 (of 2 R. S., 301), is synonymous with the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>\u201c </em>cause of action \u201d used elsewhere in the same statute. Analogy as well as sound reasoning call for a similar construction of the words \u201c subject of the action.\u201d These words, must be deemed to mean the subject-matter in dispute, or, to be still more explicit, the facts constituting the cause of action. In the case at bar plaintiffs brought the action for a trespass upon their property. The object of the action is to recover damages, but the subject thereof is the trespass committed by the defendant. The counter-claim interposed by the defendant is based partly upon plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent concealment of property not taken by the defendant, and partly upon the failure of plaintiffs\u2019 title to property which was taken. But it is not connected with the trespass upon which plaintiffs rely, nor can it be claimed that it arose out of the transaction set forth in the complaint. I concede that section 150 of the Code was enacted to simplify and expedite the administration of justice; that it is a remedial and beneficial provision, which should, at all times, receive a liberal construction, and from the start I felt strongly inclined to uphold the counter-claim. Subsequent reflection, however, has convinced me that it cannot be done without a great stretch of the meaning of the words \u201c subject of the action\u201d beyond their true and. proper significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
