Pr. R., 193; Batchelor <em>v. </em>Albany City Ins. Co., 6 Abb., N. S., 240; Turner <em>v. </em>Taylor, 2 Daly, 278).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-13\">The cause of action alleged in the complaint is not one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the court can compulsorily refer. Its gravamen is fraud, the plaintiff seeking to recover, as damages, the several amounts of money which he alleges he was induced to part with and pay to the defendants, by reason of their alleged false and fraudulent statements and representations. The answer, while admitting the receipt by the defendants of the respective amounts of moneys alleged by the plaintiff to have been paid, denies each and every of the allegations of the complaint charging, or purporting to charge, the defendants with any fraud, or attempt at fraud; and then, as a further defense, sets up the true and exact statement of the transactions had between the parties. It is clear, therefore, that such an issue is not one which it is in the power of the court compulsorily to refer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-5\">It is true that the defendants\u2019 answer also sets up a counterclaim, and which is put at issue by the reply; and the learned justice held that such an issue required the examination of a long account; and it was, therefore, within the power of the court to compulsorily refer <em>all </em>the issues in the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-6\">It is respectfully submitted that in this the learned court below erred, for the reasons stated in the following .points, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-7\">Ho issue involving any accounting is framed by the answer and reply, for the plaintiff, in his complaint, avers that during the pendency of the transactions the defendants delivered to the plaintiff several statements of account, which are alleged to be untrue, false, and fraudulent, and made with intent to deceive the plaintiff, and to induce him to pay the moneys he did to the defendants. The answer avers that the several statements of account rendered were just and true, and <em>accepted </em>by the plaintiff. The reply avers that the statements of account referred to and mentioned in the answer are the identical statements of account mentioned in the complaint, and that they are made up of false, fictitious, and usurious charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-8\">The accounts thus rendered are either:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-9\">Accounts stated, and therefore conclusive (Lockwood <em>v. </em>Thorn, 1 Kernan, 170; ibid., 18 N. Y., 285; Smith <em>v. </em>Marvin, 27 N. Y., 137).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Or are fraudulent, and part and parcel of the alleged scheme of fraud, which, if the plaintiff succeeds in establishing his alleged cause of action, will fall by themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-5\">Should.it be suggested that the counter-claim of the defendants, put at issue by the reply, involves an accounting as to the balance claimed, it will be sufficient to answer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-6\">That it does not involve a long accounting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-7\">That the court has no power to determine, or to presume, as the court below did, whether or not, if the plaintiff is defeated in his alleged cause of action, the defendants will <em>then </em>proceed with, or abandon their counter-claim. It is an affirmative cause of action on their part, and its prosecution or abandonment is entirely within their own control and option.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-8\">But even if the issue raised by the defendants\u2019 counter-claim involves the examination of a long account, no accounting can by any possibility be necessary until the plaintiff has either abandoned or been defeated in his alleged cause of action; and, <em>until then, </em>the court has no power to order a compulsory reference (Draper <em>v. </em>Day, 11 How. Pr. R., 439; McCulloch <em>v. </em>Brodie, 13 How. Pr. R., 347; Sharp <em>v. </em>The Mayor, 14 How. Pr. R., 213; affirmed on appeal, 31 Barb., 578; Cameron <em>v. </em>Freeman, 18 How. Pr. R., 353; Ross <em>v. </em>The Mayor, 2 Abb., N. S., 266; Goodyear <em>v. </em>Brooks, 4 Rob., 682; ibid., 2 Abb., N. S., 296; Bushnell <em>v. </em>Eastman, 2 Abb. N. S., 411).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-9\">If the 271st section of the Code be construed to authorize the compulsory reference of <em>all the issues </em>in <em>all </em>cases in which any one of the issues does, or by possibility may, involve the examination of a long account, then it is submitted that such section is, <em>quoad hoe, </em>unconstitutional and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-10\">Section 2 of article 1 of the Constitution of this State provides : 5\u2018 That the trial by jury, in all cases in which it has been heretofore used, shall remain inviolate forever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-11\">At the time of the adoption of such Constitution, the Revised Statutes (2 R. S., 383), as amended by chapter 163 of the Laws of 1845, were in force; and they authorized a compulsory reference in <em>\u201ca ccmse founded wpon contract\u201d </em>when it should appear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u201c <em>the trial of the same </em>\u201d would involve the examination of a long account; <em>and i/n no other ease in which an issue was joined </em>did the statute authorize a compulsory reference. In other words, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1846, actions <em>ex eontraetu, involving the examination of a long </em>aceowit, could <em>alone </em>be compulsorily referred; <em>all other actions, whether ex contractu or ex </em>delicto, could <em>not </em>be so referred; and the trial by jury of the latter was, therefore, by the terms of the above cited section of the Constitution, preserved <em>\u201c inviolate </em>forever,\u201d unless waived by both parties to the action, in the manner herein provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-5\">The cause of action in the complaint alleged, being clearly one <em>ex </em>delicto, the defendants have a right to insist upon their constitutional right of a trial by jury of the same, even though the court might, <em>after they had succeeded on such trial, </em>have the right to order a compulsory reference of the affirmative cause of action pleaded by them in their counter-claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-6\">The right of trial by jury is a constitutional right, and cannot be too faithfully preserved; and any legislative tampering with it should at least be strictly construed (Sharp <em>v. </em>The Mayor, 18 How. Pr. R., 213; Bushnell <em>v. </em>Eastman, 2 Abb., N. S., 411).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-7\">Mor are the views above suggested at all in conflict with the case of Batchelor <em>v. </em>The Albany City Ins. Co. (6 Abb., N. S., 240). The action there was one <em>ex </em>contractu\u2014viz.: on a policy of insurance. The policy provided for the furnishing of the usual preliminary proofs before any right of action under the policy could accrue. The plaintiff furnished the required preliminary proofs, which consisted of one hundred and forty-five items of the aggregate value exceeding eleven thousand dollars. The answer not merely contained a denial, but attempted to raise an issue of fraud. The court held:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-8\">That the answer was insufficient to raise an issue of fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-9\">That by the terms of the policy the account (viz., the preliminary proofs rendered), was a pre-essential to the cause of action, and formed part of the basis of the action, and that by it the recovery was to be controlled and limited; and that hence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, <em>arising ex contractu, and involving the examination of a long account, </em>could be compulsorily referred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-5\">That it being a case in which a compulsory reference could be ordered, the Appellate Court could not disturb such order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-6\">But if all the foregoing views be erroneous, it is apparent from the pleadings (and so sworn to by one of the defendants, under and by advice of his counsel) that the decision of difficult questions of law will be required on the trial of the issues. The exception contained in the 271st section of the Code therefore applies ; and hence the court cannot order a compulsory reference (Goodyear <em>v. </em>Brooks, 4 Rob., 682; 2 Abb., N. S., 296-301, and cases there cited).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-7\"><em>Mr. John L. Hill </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-8\">The <em>contract </em>made between the parties is the gist or gravamen of this complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-9\">The complaint now, as a declaration before the Code, consists of three distinct parts: (1) The <em>gist </em>or <em>substance; </em>(2) matter of <em>inducement, </em>and (3) matter of <em>aggravation </em>(Gould\u2019s Pleadings, chap. 3, sec. 7).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-10\">The <em>gist </em>is the <em>essential ground, </em>without which there can be no legal cause of complaint. The <em>inducement </em>is \u25a0 introductory, without which this essential ground cannot well or forcibly appear. Matter of <em>aggravation </em>consists of the various circumstances of <em>enormity </em>under which the principal act was committed. Aggravation and inducement sometimes perform the same office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-11\">The Code has introduced a change which has an important <em>bearing </em>upon these distinctions. While it has not <em>abolished </em>this framework in pleading, it permits, more than formerly, a simple inartificial narration of the facts and circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-12\">It was not the object, but it has been the <em>result </em>of this change to make the discovery of this old-fashioned framework extremely difficult in many cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>This complaint certainly sets forth a contract, and assigns breaches upon it. </em>It presents an agreement in several different parts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-5\">It alleges a simple <em>reguest </em>to parchase copper for the plaintiff, and an undertaking to perform.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-6\">It next alleges that plaintiff paid the defendants $2,000 (two bonds taken as cash), in consideration of which they agree <em>\u201c to take up, pay for, deposit and heep the same (the copper), and would adnance </em>\u201d the money necessary for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-7\">It then alleges a series of such payments and agreements in the order with the circumstances, and at the time when each was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-8\">It then assigns the breaches of these several agreements: \u201cThey did not <em>tahe up, </em>they did not <em>pay for, </em>* * they did <em>not put </em>and <em>heep </em>in store, they did not incur the expenses, etc.,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>they did not advance the money as they had agreed to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-9\">This contract and the breaches so assigned comprise the <em>gist </em>of this complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-10\">It is obvious that <em>if the defendants shall show that they have hept and performed this contract, no matter how corrupt thei/r purposes may have been, </em>the plaintiff <em>cannot </em>succeed. It is equally clear that if the plaintiff shall show <em>nonperformance, </em>he will be entitled to recover <em>something. </em>In other words, this <em>contract and its regui/rements is the thing \u201c without which the pla/intiffwould have no legal cause of complaint\u201d </em>This exactly defines the gist or gravamen of the pleading, as we have seen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-11\">It matters not what the defendants <em>said, </em>what they <em>represented, </em>or what plaintiff may have <em>believed. </em>The sole question is this: <em>Has this contract beenperformed ?</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-12\">The defendants were the plaintiff\u2019s agents to purchase the copper. <em>He hnew nothing about the purchase, except what they represented to him. </em>It is not pretended that he was present at the purchase, or that he ever saw the property or the evidence of its ownership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-13\">The allegations of the falsity of these representations does not affect the main issue. It was proper to state them. <em>They were </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>a part of the story, </em>strictly matter of inducement to the contract. If proper to state them it was proper, also, upon two grounds, to state their falsity:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-5\">It was simply <em>matter of aggravation </em>under the old system.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-6\">It was a part of the story which we are required, at least permitted, to spread upon the record, under the new one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-7\">But it is said the representations were made with intent to deceive! True, but-what of that? There are two answers to this suggestion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-8\">The same as to the allegation of falsity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-9\">It was impossible truthfully to tell this story, as we understand it, and conceal or avoid showing the court that w\u00e9 had been cheated. '\u25a0 The character of the representations, and the circumstances under which they were made, were such that an allegation of their falsity necessarily implied an intent to cheat. We might have omitted these words, but the fact would, nevertheless, have appeared.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-10\">We submit that a fraudulent act with a fraudulent intent may be used simply as matter of aggravation without changing the nature of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">It is said that the prayer discloses the character of the action. We submit that the prayer of a complaint has no such office to perform.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-12\">It is apparent from the foregoing analysis that the <em>contract is the gist of this complaint. </em>Strike out the contract, and the backbone of the pleading is gone. Concede its performance, and the plaintiff has no legal cause of complaint</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-13\">All the allegations which are said to be distinctive of fraud might be stricken out, and leave a perfectly valid cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-14\">Try a similar experiment with the allegations about contract, and the complaint is destroyed. Ho cause of action could be imagined based upon the remaining facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-15\">We therefore submit that the gravamen of this complaint is <em>contract.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-16\">In this view of the complaint the reference of the cause did not violate any principle of the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The only constitutional restriction applicable to the case is found in section 2, article 1:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">\u201c The trial by jury, in all cases in which it has been heretofore used, shall remain inviolate forever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-6\">The restriction is not to such as were referable by law <em>at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of </em>1846. It does not say \u201c in all cases in which it is <em>now </em>used.\u201d It is <em>\u201c </em>in all cases in which it <em>has leen heretofore used\u201d </em>Hence, <em>if actions of tort even had ever leen </em>referable, <em>although the laws under vbhich the power was exercised might have leen abrogated or expressly re</em>pealed, <em>the restriction of this article would not prevent the reenactment of simila/r provisions.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-7\">We submit that even actions of tort were allowed to be referred prior to 1846 (1 Dunlap\u2019s Practice, ed. of 1821, 533, citing 1 Revised Laws, 516).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">Various cases are referred to, showing what the practice was at this time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">It is worthy of note that it was common practice under the Constitution of 1820, to refer actions of assumpsit, and there was no provision against referring actions <em>ex delicto.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-10\">\u201c The statute, so far from restricting the power of referees to matters of account alone, does not even confine it to actions arising <em>ex </em>contractu\u201c It is a satisfactory answer, however, that references as broad as that now contended for by the plaintiff were sanctioned by statute and practised by the courts long before the adoption of the Constitution\u201d (Lee <em>v. </em>Tillotson, 24 Wend., 338).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-11\">From these authorities it will appear that prior to the Constitution of 1846, it was common practice to refer an action of <em>assumpsit </em>or any action arising on contract which involved a long account; and at the same time there was no constitutional provision against referring any cause, in the discretion of the court, in which a long account was <em>prolally </em>involved (see act April 5, 1813, \u00a7 2, and 1 Rev. Laws, 516).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-12\">The long account was not, as seems to have been supposed by some, the old action of account where there were mutual charges with items on each side. The act of 1813 gave a reference at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>discretion where the account was composed of items <em>all on one side.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">We have seen that this action is on contract, and referable within common practice prior to 1820.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">But again, if the action is for fraud, it is still referable at discretion. The act of 1813 would <em>hapermitted </em>it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">A statute just prior to 1846 (Act of May 1,1845, ch. 163, sec. 2, amending Bevised Statutes) gave references in actions <em>founded on contract. </em>The act of 1813 was not then inoperative. The Code contains no restriction of this kind. It is as broad as the act of 1813. The omission of the limitation to actions <em>on contract </em>is significant, showing that the prolixity of the account was the only test.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\">The issue requires the examination of a long account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">The plaintiff cannot develop his case without an examination of long accounts. The plaintiff swears expressly that various books will have to be examined, and the defendant does not deny it. Ho difficult question of law is involved</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-10\">The court can see, from the bill of particulars, that a long account is involved. We dispute every item of this bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-11\">The issue formed by the answer and reply is solely one on contract, and involves the examination of an account. Both issues are to be tried at once; hence the <em>trial </em>requires the examination of this account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-12\">The granting of this motion was matter of discretion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-13\">The Code intended to revive the practice under the .act of 1813. It was then discretionary by express provision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-14\">Common experience shows that it must be discretionary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-15\">Take the case of a trial at circuit, where the judge, discovering the character t of the action, refers it on his own motion.

Plaintiff prays judgment for the return of the $25,000 paid by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The defendants, by their answer, deny the fraud and misrepresentations charged, and set up full performance on their part (an agreement by plaintiff to maintain in their hands a margin of four cents per pound), non-performance on the part of the plaintiff, a sale of the copper for plaintiff\u2019s account upon due notice to him, and, as a counter-claim, a balance of $1,031.07 due from plaintiff to defendants on account of moneys advanced, expenses incurred, commissions, insurance, and interest, for which they demand an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The plaintiff, by his reply, puts in issue all the material facts relied upon as constituting the said counter-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Upon the hearing of the motion for a reference, founded upon affidavits, the pleadings, and the defendants\u2019 bill of particulars, the learned judge at Special Term found, as matter of fact, that the trial of the issues necessarily raised by the pleadings involved the examination of a long account within the meaning of section 271 of the Code, and thereupon granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for a reference of all the issues to hear and determine the same. According to the decision of the case of Batchelor <em>v. </em>The Albany City Insurance Company (6 Abb., N. S., 241; 37 How., 399), this determination of the Special Term will be held final and conclusive, especially as it has been the law of this court almost since the adoption of the Code that a reference may be ordered in an action sounding in tort, where the trial of the issues of fact will require the examination of a long account (Sheldon <em>v. </em>Wood, 3 Sandf., 739). The case last cited was decided with the concurrence of the entire court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The appellants have argued, however, that even if section 271 of the Code can be construed to authorize the compulsory reference of all the issues in an action sounding in tort, in which any one of the issues does involve the examination of a long account, such construction would render the said section unconstitutional and void, as contravening article 1, section 2 of the Constitution of 1846, which provides : \u201c The trial by jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>in all cases in which, it has been heretofore used, shall remain inviolate forever. But a jury trial may be waived by the parties in all civil cases, in the manner to be prescribed by law.\u201d This point was not raised in the cases above named. It is now advanced, as I believe, for the first time in this court, but in my judgment does not necessarily enter into the decision of this case. The complaint is not a complaint for a mere naked tort in an action in which damages for the wrong are sought to be recovered, but it contains a statement of facts which show that plaintiff\u2019s payments were not voluntary ones with knowledge of the facts, and that, for this reason, he is entitled to recover back the amount paid. This state of facts, according to the decision of the Court of Appeals in Byxbie v.Wood (24 N. Y., 610), does not necessarily require an action to be brought for the tort, even if it allows one to be so brought. Such facts always raise in law the implied promise which was the contract cause of action in <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money had and received. Under the Code this implied, promise is treated as a fiction, and the facts (out of which the prior law raised the promise) are to be stated without any designation of a form of action, and the law gives such judgment as, being asked for, is appropriate to the facts. If the plaintiff in the case at bar shall show, as he may do under his complaint, that the defendants never entered upon a performance, and that in consequence he demanded back his money, which was refused, the allegations of fraud, pleaded as matter of aggravation, do not affect the main issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">It will also be seen that the issue, the trial of which requires the examination of a long account, has been raised and''forced into the case by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The case, therefore, is not one which calls upon this court to adjudge an act of the legislature void in which the bench and bar have acquiesced for over twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b514-8\">Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnH\">(dissenting). My associates at this General Term .have'.decided to sustain this order of reference appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>I agree with them as to the <em>convenience and policy </em>of compelling parties to take a reference in cases where the examination of a long account is necessary. I believe it to be greatly for the interest of the courts and of suitors that a reference should be ordered in all such cases. I differ with my associates in regard to the power of the court to make a compulsory reference in cases sounding in tort or (according to old divisions) in an action \u201c <em>ex </em>delicto,\u201d and upon due consideration of this case I conclude that it is an action of that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In a like case before me at Special Term, I held that I had no power to order a reference without consent of parties: that a party objecting had the constitutional right to a trial by jury, and that it must be preserved to him; and upon further consideration of the same constitutional point in this case, I hold that a compulsory order of reference should not have been made, and the order of the Special Term should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
