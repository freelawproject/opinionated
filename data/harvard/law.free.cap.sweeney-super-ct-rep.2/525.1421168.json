W. Ten F\u2019kins Butter. 1211 To be delivered to</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">Messrs.

The defendants gave notice to the plaintiff of such abandonment, and requested him to send for the butter. Subsequently the plaintiff made a demand for the butter, without tendering or offering to return the bills of lading, or to indemnify the defendants against such bills. The defendants declined to deliver the butter, except upon the return of their bills of lading or of an indemnity against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-10\">There was conflicting evidence as to whether the defendants were the agents only or the owners of the New Y ork and Virginia Steamship Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-11\">A verdict was directed for the defendants, the court refusing to submit to the jury any question of fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-12\">The plaintiff excepted and appealed from the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-13\"><em>Mr. S. W. Judson </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-14\"><em>The defendants </em>having held themselves out to the plaintiff, and dealt with the plaintiff in their own names, as principals, from the beginning of the transaction until about twenty days after the commencement of this suit, without ever disclosing or hinting at any agency, and without the knowledge of the plaintiff that they were, or pretended to be, agents, <em>are liable im, their individual capacity as principals to the plaintiff.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-15\">The defendants undertook the duty of carrying twenty firkins of butter from New York to New Orleans, and no other person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>or party .did expressly undertake that duty; and it is immaterial whether or not any other person or party, when discovered, would be hable or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">Even if the defendants were agents, and were known to be such, yet if they undertook the duty, or assumed any obligation, or were a contracting party, or had any interest in, or were to derive any benefit from, the transaction, <em>they would be liable </em>(Considerant <em>v. </em>Brisbane, 22 N. Y. R., <em>389; </em>Nelson <em>v. </em>Nixon, 13 Abb. Pr. R., 104).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-6\">The bills of lading not being signed by the master of the ship, nor by any one on board, nor at the ship, but being signed in the office of the defendants, in their presence, under their supervision, and delivered by them to the plaintiff in exchange for the receipt for the butter, were adopted by the defendants as their act; and in judgment of law the defendants made and delivered the said bills, as their bills, to the plaintiff, to all intents and purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-7\">A bill of lading as between the original parties thereto, is not to be strictly construed, but is open for explanation and construction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-8\">The duty of the defendants in this case did not rest entirely on contract, or the bills of- lading, but on a higher duty of common carriers (29 N. Y. R., 115, Merritt <em>v. </em>Earle).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-9\">A carrier is obliged to know the possibilities of transportation before making a contract, or provide another vessel or conveyance (2 Hilton, 19, Place <em>v. </em>Union Express Co.).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-10\"><em>Mr. Morris S. Miller </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-11\">The bills of lading showed the goods shipped to the \u201c consignees or their assigns,\u201d which \u201c conveyed notice to the master that he could not safely deliver the goods to any person except the holder thereof\u201d (Abbott on Shipping, 7th ed., p. 435).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-12\">And in cases where the shipper demands the goods, \"it is the master\u2019s duty to retain, and he cannot safely deliver unless they are claimed by the holder of the bills indorsed by the shipper to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>whose order he had engaged to deliver \u201d (Abbott on Shipping, p. 435).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-5\">Nor is he liable in trover on a demand of them, unless the bills of lading are surrendered or fully indemnified against, nor are the shipowners liable on such a state of facts (Keyser <em>v. </em>Harbeck, 3 Duer, p. 373, 9 C. B., 297).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-6\">Because a bill of lading is a negotiable instrument, and in the hands of a <em>Iona, fide </em>holder for value transfers the title (Downs <em>v. </em>Greene, 24 N. Y., 638, 28 Barb., 157).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b529-8\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARC\">Without expressing an opinion upon the other questions raised in this case, I think the judgment can be sustained on the ground that no conversion of the property by the defendants, or other liability, had been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The bills of lading required the property to be delivered to consignees therein named, or to their assigns, and without a surrender of the bills or the consent of the consignees the defendants were not bound to deliver; and they had a right to require such surrender or consent, or, what they did require, an indemnity, against the bills. The cases in support of this position are Downs <em>v. </em>Greene (24 N. Y. R., 638); Keyser <em>v. </em>Harbeck (3 Duer, 373); Abbott on Shipping (7th ed., 435).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">There was no dispute at the trial that the bills of lading were not surrendered; nor was it disputed that the plaintiff refused to furnish any indemnity against them. There was therefore no question for the jury. The plaintiff had failed to lay the foundation for a recovery upon either cause of action, and a verdict was properly directed for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
