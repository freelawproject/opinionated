There is no proof that the court or a judge thereof ever acquired jurisdiction over the person of the appellant. The original order requiring the appellant to appear, to make discovery on oath concerning his property, was not served upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>him during the time the order had any vitality, but three days after the return day specified therein, and so far as there has been any appearance on the part of the appellant afterwards, it has been solely for the purpose of making his objections, by which no jurisdiction was conferred. The objection that there is a total want of jurisdiction may be taken at any stage in the case. The order appealed from must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
