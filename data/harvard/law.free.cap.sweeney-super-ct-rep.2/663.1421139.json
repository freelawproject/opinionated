HENNION, Defendant.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b663-9\"><em>[Decided December </em>31, 1870.]</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b663-5\">A trustee of a corporation, created under the general act for the incorporation of manufacturing and mining companies, being made liable, upon the default of the company to file an annual report, for the existing debts of the company, is liable for such debts, although they were contracted <em>before </em>he became a trustee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b663-6\">The meaning of \u201c existing debts,\u201d in the statute, is such debts as were <em>due </em>at the time of the default of the company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b663-7\">Therefore, where the company had. given its promissory note, which, by its terms, was not due or payable until <em>after </em>the default of the company to file its <em>report\u2014held, </em>not to be an existing debt for which a trustee then in office would be made liable.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b663-8\">Before Monell, McCunn, and Spencer, JJ.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-10\">The action was against the defendant to enforce his joint and several liability, as one of the trustees of th\u00e9 Montana Mill Company, a corporation formed under the laws of this State, arising from the omission of such company to file its annual report, pursuant to the provisions of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-11\">The pleadings and the facts established at the trial were substantially the same as in the case of these plaintiffs against Tap-pan, another of the trustees of such company, decided at this term. The defendant was elected a trustee on the <em>ninth of January, </em>1866, and was in office when the company made default in that month, and the defendant claimed that his liability attached to the omission to file the report in the first twenty days in January, 1866, and as the action was not commenced until the nineteenth of January, 1870, the statute of limitations was a bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-12\">It, however, appeared that the defendant continued in office as a trustee until and during January, 1867, and that the company in that year also omitted to file an annual report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The same objections to a recovery as were taken in the Tappan case were taken in this; and also the further objection, that the liability of a trustee extended only to such debts as were contracted while he was in office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-5\">The objections were overruled, and the jury were directed to find a verdict for the plaintiffs for the amount claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-6\">The defendant excepted, and the exceptions were sent to the General Term, to be there heard in the first instance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b664-7\"><em>Mr. A. B. Capwell </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-8\">The liability of a trustee for omission to make, file, and publish an annual report, as required by the twelfth section of the manufacturing act of 1848, is in the nature of a penalty, and an action thereon must be commenced within three years after the cause of action shall have accrued (Code, sections 74 and 92, subdivision 2; Merchants\u2019 Bank of New Haven <em>v. </em>Bliss, 1 Robertson, 391; same case, 35 New York, 412).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-9\">The cause of action in this case arose, if at all, by reason of the failure to make and publish an annual report in January, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-10\">The indebtedness of the corporation arose by contracting the debt for which their note was given November 27,1865, and was an existing debt on the 1st day of January, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-11\">As defendant was made trustee January 9, 1866, he became liable, if liable at all, for this debt by reason of the non-filing and publishing an annual report in January, 1866; and this statute of limitations of three years began to run January 21, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-12\">This action was commenced January 19, 1870, more than three years after the default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-13\">The court erred in not dismissing the complaint for this reason, the defense having been specially set up in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b664-14\">But if the court was right in denying the motion to dismiss the complaint for the reason above stated, it erred in directing the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiffs, because the debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>sought to be collected from the defendant was contracted before the defendant became a trustee. Debt contracted on or before November 27, 1865. Defendant first elected trustee January 9, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-5\">The liability of trustees under the manufacturing act, for failure to file and publish annual reports, should be confined to debts contracted while they are trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b665-6\">\u201c The twelfth section of the statute must be construed as if it read for all debts then existing (contracted by them), and for all that shall be contracted (by them) before such report shall be filed \u201d (McHarg <em>v. </em>Eastman, 4 Robertson, 635; same case, General Term, 7 Robertson, 137).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b665-7\"><em>Mr. Albert Stickney </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-8\">The defendant admits, by his pleading, that the company existed, and that he was a trustee, in January, 1867. The proof showed the same state of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-9\">On the pleadings, too, it is not disputed that the note was still an \u201cexisting debt\u201d of the company in January, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-10\">There being a default in January, 1867, and the note being then, in the language of the statute, \u201c an existing debt of the company,\u201d the defendant became liable as a trustee for the statutory penalty, when the default took place, <em>i. </em>&lt;?., 20th January, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-11\">The company\u2019s debt and the penalty are entirely distinct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-12\">The debt is merely the basis of computation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-13\">No suit could be brought against the defendant at all if there was no default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-14\">The suit cannot, then, be brought until the default takes place. The default on which this suit is brought is the default in January, 1867, which was complete on the 20th January, 1867, and not before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-15\">The default is not destroyed by the fact that there has been a previous default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>And whether the previous default has been of the same or other trustees is completely immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-5\">\u201c A single case may occur where successive boards may be liable for the same debts : and that is, where there are <em>successive defaults in January. </em>By the express terms of the statute the trustees omitting to file their statement within the first twenty days of that month are <em>liable for all debts then existing. Wow the debts then existing may be wholly or partly the very debts for which their predecessors became liable </em>by reason of a default in January of the previous year. But from this liability there is a chance of escape by a simple <em>performance of the duty required </em>\u201d (Boughton <em>v. </em>Otis, 21 N. Y., 264).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-6\">\u201c The liability of the defendants does not arise from any act connected with the creation of the debt due the plaintiff \u201d (Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Bliss, 13 Abb. Pr., 237).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-7\">\u201cBesides these considerations, the period of limitations is made to run from the time the cause of action accrued, not from the time the debt was incurred \u201d (same case, p. 238, affirmed, 35 N Y., 412; Peck <em>v. </em>Hurlburt, 46 Barb., 559; Corning <em>v. </em>Southland, 3 Hill, 554; Brick <em>v. </em>Campbell, 15 Johns., 456).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-8\">The defendant insists very strongly that this is a penalty. Otherwise the plaintiffs have, on his own position, six years from 29th January, 1866, instead of three, to bring this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-9\">The penalty is not the debt, and is entirely distinct from it in every way.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b666-10\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b666-11\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJF\">All the questions which are presented by the exceptions in this case, except one, have been determined by the decision at this term in the case of these plaintiffs against Tappan, another of the trustees of the Montana Mill Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">The question not decided by the Tappan case is, whether the defendant is liable for the debts of the' company contracted before he became a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">1 The question arising upon the statute of limitations is the same as arose in Tappan\u2019s case, except that to make the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>available in this case, it was and had to be claimed that the debt prosecuted in the action was an \u201c existing debt\u201d in January, 1866, although the note had not then become due.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">But I think that this was not an existing debt, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">There was no default of the company until after twenty days from the first day of January, 1866, and the note of the company did not fall due until after such default had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The obligation to pay was made in the previous November, when the company gave its promissory note, and it may, perhaps, be said that a debt was then created. But there was no obligation to pay until sixty days afterwards, and when the payment of a debt is imposed as a penalty, it must be construed to mean a present obligation which is capable of being immediately enforced. Otherwise the penalty would be nugatory, as it could not be prosecuted or collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Debt, it is true, is ordinarily understood to mean any obligation to pay, either <em>in present\u00ed </em>or <em>in futuro, </em>and it is commonly understood to be equivalent with liability. Bouvier says, \u201c debt is a sum of money <em>due </em>by certain and express agreement;\u201d in a more enlarged sense, any kind of a just demand, and he describes the <em>liquid </em>debt to be one the payment of which may be immediately enforced, and not one which is due at a future time.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">At the time of the company\u2019s default, in January, 1866, an action was not maintainable against it upon this obligation or promise to pay. It therefore follows, it appears to me, that an action against a trustee would also have failed! And this furnishes a proper test of what the legislature are supposed to have meant by \u201cexisting debts;\u201d and it is, therefore, to be presumed that they intended to create a liability for such debts only as were due and payable at the time the penalty was affixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">In Garrison <em>v. </em>Howe (17 N. Y. R., 458) the plaintiff contracted to deliver, and the corporation to receive and pay for, a large quantity of lumber at a future day; and it was held not to be a \u201cdebt\u201d within the meaning of the statute, nor until the delivery of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>And in Oviatt <em>v. </em>Hughes (41 Barb., 541) a trustee was sued for a claim of the plaintiff against the company. The former was employed by the latter as its general agent at a per annum salary. As the salary was not due at the time of the company\u2019s default, it was held not to be a debt within the meaning of the statute. The court says, the statute speaks of debts <em>existing </em>or contracted, not of <em>liabilities </em>which may ultimately ripen into debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">If, therefore, the decision of this case depended upon bringing it within the intended meaning' of \u201c existing debt,\u201d I think it might be correctly disposed of by holding that this was not such a debt as attached to the default of January, 1866.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The remaining objection is, that the debt was contracted before the defendant became a trustee, and that he is liable for such debts only as were contracted while he was trustee. But I think the defendant\u2019s counsel has misunderstood or overlooked that part of the statute which creates a liability for the <em>\u201cexisting </em>debts\u201d of the corporation. That is one liability, and is apart from the other liability, which is for debts \u201c <em>afterwards contractedP </em>The meaning' of the statute is, that the trustees of a corporation which shall omit to make its annual report, who are in office at the time of such omission, shall be liable for all debts <em>existi/ng at that time whenever contracted, </em>and shall also be further liable for all debts which may be contracted <em>after </em>such time, and until such report is filed. That is the plain letter and intent of the statute, and is recognized in the following cases: Garrison <em>v. </em>Howe <em>(ubi supra), </em>Shaler and Hall Quarry Co. <em>v. </em>Bliss <em>(ubi supra), </em>Boughton <em>v. </em>Otis <em>(ubi supra), </em>and McHarg <em>v. </em>Eastman (7 Robt., 137).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">If these views are correct there was no error in overruling the defense, and is none in overruling the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The plaintiff should have judgment on the verdict with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
