B. Hill, <em>Agent?</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\">The defense, as set up in the answer, was that the merchandise was deliverable at New York \u201cto order.\u201d That upon its arrival in New York it remained in the possession of the defendant for about two weeks uncalled for and without any demand being made therefor, when it was placed in store. That, subsequently, and before any demand by the plaintiff, the merchandise was taken and removed by the sheriff in actions against the defendant instituted by one Sternbergerand one Worsley to recover the possession thereof, in which actions judgments were subsequently obtained for the delivery of said merchandise to the plaintiffs respectively in said actions. That the defendant was not able to find the plaintiff to notify him of said actions, but after the judgments were obtained therein, upon the plaintiff\u2019s applying for the merchandise, the defendant informed him of said actions and judgments and offered to take proceedings to open the judgments, if the plaintiff desired him so to do. The offer was declined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-7\">On the trial the plaintiff proved that his agent came to New York and called at the defendant\u2019s office within two or three days after the goods had been shipped at Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>more. The agent testified that he saw a person who acknowledged himself to be the defendant; that he informed such person that he was the agent of the owner and shipper ; asked if \"the goods had arrived, was informed they had not, gave his name and address or \"place of business to such person, who wrote the same on a piece of paper, and that such person promised- to inform him, the agent, when the goods arrived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-5\">There was other evidence given by this witness tending to show that the person with whom he had the interview was the defendant; among other parts the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-6\"><em>\u201c </em>I could not state positively that that is Mr. Hope, but I believe the gentleman looks much like the gentleman I saw four years ago. I mean to swear that I gave that gentleman my name and that he took it down, and that he agreed to give me notice when the goods came; I am not positive that that is the gentleman; he looks very much like him; I can\u2019t swear positively. I went to the office of the Hope Dispatch Company when this conversation occurred, on Broadway. I inquired for the goods; the gentleman who said that he was Mr. Hope took my name and address ; I haven\u2019t seen him since; I couldn\u2019t swear whether he was Mi*. Hope or not; he might have another name for all that I know; I asked in the front before you get to the private office. There was a counter in front, and I inquired there, and he said, There is Mr. Hope, inquire of him, and then I saw him, but I never knew Mr. Hope befor\u00e9 and I have never seen him since. It is the same gentleman who afterwards talked with Mr. Topping and \u25a0 represented himself as being Mr. Hope; I won\u2019t say that is the man; it might be, but I don\u2019t recollect him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-7\">\u201c This is the gentleman that I saw in the private office of the Hope Dispatch Company; on the right-hand side as you entered there was an office where a clerk was, and in the middle was a table something a little broader than this; Mr. Hope was sitting with his back to the window, and had his eye towards the store \u2014towards Broadway ; outside in the office they told me that Mr. Hope was in there, but I didn\u2019t know that it was Mr. Hope; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the next time, when I went with Hr. Topping, the gentleman I had seen there presented himself as Hr. Hope; the clerks in the front office packing goods told me to go in and see Hr. Hope <em>(i. </em>&lt;?., the first time he was there). When I went with Hr. Topping to inquire about these goods, I had nothing to say. Hr. Topping went up to the office and saw Hr. Hope in my presence and Hr.. Hierson\u2019s; Hr. Topping asked for the goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">Huch of this testimony was contradicted. The defendant testified that he was not the person whom the agent saw. But it was in part corroborated by one or more of the defendant\u2019s witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">The defendant introduced the pleadings and proceedings in the two actions for the recovery of the possession of the property, and the court held there was no question of fact for the jury, and refused to submit any to the jury, although specifically requested to do so. The court also refused to charge that the defendant was bound to give notice of the replevin suits to the plaintiff, and directed a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-7\">A motion was made at Special Term for a new trial, and denied. Judgment was thereupon entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-8\">The plaintiff appealed from the judgment and order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-9\"><em>Mr. Robert E. Topping </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-10\">The evidence of witness Richter shows that he was the agent of plaintiff to receive the goods in Mew York; he called twice to see if the goods had arrived, with the receipts the last <em>time; </em>saw the defendant, gave him his address and place of business, who promised to give him notice of arrival of goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-11\">Mo notice of the arrival of goods was ever given to Richter, plaintiff\u2019s agent, or to plaintiff in Baltimore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-12\">The liability of defendant was not discharged by the storage of goods, for the reason that they were not stored for or on account of the owner, but on account of O. H. Webb, agent of defendant\u2019s dispatch company, and deliverable upon his order only; besides no effort was made by defendant to find owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the goods or his agent and notify him of arrival (Fisk <em>v. </em>Newton, 1 Denio, 45).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-5\">The property in question was subsequently taken in two replevin suits against the defendant, Aaron D. Hope, by Solomon Steinberger and Thomas Worsley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-6\">Before the arrival of the plaintiff in Mew York to claim his property, judgment had been entered in those suits and property delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-7\">Mo notice of these suits was ever given either to plaintiff in Baltimore or to his agent in Mew York, Morris Bichter, nor was any attempt made to find plaintiff or his agent, to give him notice of said suits; the defendant claimed \u201c he was not bound to give notice to anybody.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-8\">There was no proof in the case that the property in question belonged to Solomon Steinberger or Thomas Worsley, or to any other person than the plaintiff; the judgment rolls were only admitted to show that the property was taken by legal process, valid on its face; they were admitted under exception of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and could not, as against the defendant\u2019s receipts to plaintiff, be any evidence of title in Worsley and Steinberger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-9\">The ease was taken from the jury upon the sole ground that the property had been taken from the carrier by legal process, without regard to ownership of parties instituting the proceeding ; the court excluded evidence of such ownership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-10\">It was not sufficient for the carrier to show that property was taken by legal process, but that he must go further and show that the party in whose favor it was issued was the real owner of the property (37 Barbour, <em>122; </em>Van Winkle <em>v. </em>The United States Mail Steamship Company).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-11\"><em>Mr. Charles M. Da Costa </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-12\">The defendant having proved that the cases of goods were taken from him by due process of law, to wit, by the sheriff, under and pursuant of the replevin proceedings, the court was bound to direct, as it did, a verdict in his favor. For the rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>well settled that if goods are taken from a bailee by process of law, exercised through regular and valid proceedings, it will be a defense in a suit by the bailor against the bailee (Edson <em>v. </em>Weston, 7 Cowen, 278; The Stanford Boat Co. <em>v. </em>Gibben, 9 Wend., 327; Betts <em>v. </em>Stanton, 1 Duer, 85, 36 N. Y., 403; Van Winkle <em>v. </em>U. S. Mail S.S. Co., 37 Barb., 122; Barton <em>v. </em>Wilkinson, 18 Vermont, 186).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-5\">The goods arrived in the city of New York on the 27th and 28th of January, and remained on the dock, waiting to be claimed by the consignee or consignor, until the 2d of February, when they were stored for the risk and account of the consignor or consignee, in a proper storehouse for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-6\">It was the duty of the carrier to so store the goods, after waiting a reasonable time for the goods to be claimed; and his so storing the same discharged the carrier from all further liability as carrier, or under any contract under which he had received the goods (Fisk <em>v. </em>Newton, 1 Denio, 45; Rowland <em>v. </em>Mill, 2 Hilton, 150; Williams <em>v. </em>The American Express Co., 27 How. Pr. R., 137; Gould <em>v. </em>Chapin, 20 N. Y., 259, 264).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-7\">The defendant fulfilled all his duties in the premises. No party appearing to claim the goods, he duly stored the same-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-8\">While in such storehouse the goods were seized by the sheriff, under and pursuant to replevin proceedings, and taken out of the custody of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-9\">As soon as the plaintiff appeared in New York he notified him of such proceedings, and offered to take proceedings to open the judgment if the plaintiff would furnish him with the necessary affidavits in that respect. This offer was declined by the plaintiff herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-10\">The date of the plaintiff\u2019s so calling on the defendant was, as it appears in evidence, the 22d March, 1864, weeks after the goods had been taken by the sheriff, and actually one day after final judgment had been entered in the replevin proceedings. Before that time it was utterly out of the power of the defendant to notify either the plaintiff as consignor, or the consignee, if there was any such person.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b568-5\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1S\">The rule in respect to the duties and liabilities of common carriers is, that their responsibilities cease with delivery. In the absence of any established usage or special contract to the contrary, the delivery must be to the bailor, or as the bailor may direct. If the consignee is known to the carrier, or with reasonable diligence can be ascertained, it is the duty of the latter to make actual delivery to such consignee either at-his residence or place of business. This rule is more especially applicable to carriers by land. But if the consignee is unknown to the carrier, or with reasonable exertions cannot be found, the carrier will be absolved from actual delivery, and his responsibility will then be confined to putting the property in a place of safety, when the warehouse-keeper will become the bailee of the owner, and the carrier\u2019s liability will cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Usage will sometimes relieve the carrier from actual delivery at the residence of the consignee, as where it is the common custom to place goods in a warehouse or a railroad station. But such usage must be of so long continuance, uniformity, and notoriety as to justify the belief that it was known to the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In all cases, however, whether the carriage be by land or water, and whatever may be the duty of the carrier to make delivery to the consignee, either in person or at his residence or place of business, it is well settled, that in no case will a carrier be excused from giving <em>notice </em>to the consignee of the.arrival of the goods at their destination, to enable him to take them into his possession (1 Pars. on Con., 668; Story on Bail., sec. 543; Ostrander <em>v. </em>Brown, 15 J. R., 39; Fisk <em>v. </em>Newton, 1 Denio, 45). Of course this must be qualified by the remark that the carrier must know, or have the means of knowing, the consignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">In this case I am of the opinion that it was the duty of the defendant to have delivered the property to the consignee of the plaintiff, either at his residence or place of business, if he knew, or with reasonable exertions could have ascertained, who such consignee was.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>The receipt given by the defendant on receiving the goods for transportation, and which contained the contract of the carrier, had no unusual stipulations. It was an agreement to carry the goods from Baltimore to Hew York, deliverable to order. They were to be carried by the \u201c Hope Dispatch fast freight line,\u201d through by rail. The defendant was the proprietor of the <em>\u201c </em>dispatch,\u201d which seems to have been an express for the transportation of goods by rail, but was in no way connected with any railroad company, except as the hirer of one or' more of its cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The contract, therefore, was the ordinary engagement of a common carrier by land, and was subject to all the rules governing such carriers. Such rules required the defendant in this case to deliver the property to the consignee, if he was known or could be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The rule as stated by Judge Story <em>(supra) </em>is, that if there is no special contract or local custom to govern in cases of transportation by land, the carrier is bound to make a personal delivery to the consignee; and he refers to numerous cases in support of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In the case of Haslam <em>v. </em>The Adams Express Co. (6 Bosw., 235), a package transported by the company was left inside of the outer door of the first story of the building of which the consignee occupied the fourth story, and notice was given to a person (not authorized, however, to receive it) of the deposit of the package. That was held not to have been a delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In this case the goods were deliverable \u201c to order.\u201d There were no written marks or designations upon the packages, directing to or indicating the consignee in Hew Y ork. Ho duty, therefore, in respect to the delivery of the property rested upon the defendant until the consignee or other person authorized to receive the goods was made known to him. Upon being apprised of such consignee or person, it became the duty of the defendant to deliver to him. The facts, as disclosed on the trial, may have furnished an excuse for not making an actual, delivery to the plaintiff\u2019s agent or consignee; and as it is not necessary to place the decision entirely upon that ground, I will pass to and examine another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Hr. Justice Story, in Ms treatise already cited, in speaking of the duty to make personal delivery, says: However that may be, it seems clear that carriers are bound <em>to gime notice of the arrival of the goods </em>to the person to whom they are directed, if they are known to them. So in Ostrander <em>v. </em>Brown <em>(supra), </em>where goods were unladen upon a wharf and lost, an action of trover was sustained, on the ground that no notice had been given to the consignees that the goods were unladen, <em>or that they had a/rrimed. </em>And in Fisk <em>v. </em>Newton <em>(supra), </em>in a case of transportation by water, it was held, that notice of the arrival and place of deposit of the goods to the consignee, if he was known, or could with reasonable efforts be found, was sufficient, and took the place of a personal delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The question then recurs, Was the defendant excused from giving notice of the arrival of the goods, and if not, is he responsible for their subsequent loss ?</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">It seems the goods were received for transportation on the 21st of January, and arrived in Hew York on the 27th or 28th of the same month. Richter, one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, testified that he was the plaintiff\u2019s agent and authorized to receive the goods; that, within three or four days after the goods were delivered to the defendant, in Baltimore, he went to the defendant\u2019s office in Hew York, and there made known his agency and authority to receive the goods; inquired if they had arrived, and being informed that they had not, left his name and place of business, <em>which were taken down </em>and a <em>promise </em>made to notify Mm of their arrival. The goods, upon their arrival in Hew York, were put upon the dock, where they remained until the 2d of February, when they were placed in the warehouse, whence they were taken by the sheriff on the 19th of February.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">If the evidence of the witness, Richter, was to be believed, the defendant was fully apprised of his existence as the agent or consignee of the plaintiff, and of his authority to receive the goods. It is true much of his evidence was contradicted, and there was some doubt whether he was not mistaken in the person with whom he had the interview in the defendant\u2019s office; but I think there was sufficient evidence to have gone to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>jury, and that upon it the jury might and would have been authorized to have found, that before the arrival of the goods the defendant knew of the agent and of his authority to receive the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Upon such finding, and that notice had not been given of the arrival of the goods, the defendant <em>should have been held responsible for amy loss that happened to the plaintiff from any cause whatever.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In the view, however, of the learned justice at the trial, this evidence was deemed wholly immaterial. He was of the opinion that the subsequent taking of the property by the sheriff in the two actions by persons claiming to be the owners was a complete defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Without doing any violence to what is denominated the \u201c authority of law,\u201d it may be sufficient to content ourselves with holding, that whatever protection such taking by the authority of law may afford carriers or bailees in general, who have been deprived of property by legal process either during its transit or before a delivery could be made, it is no protection where, before such taking, the carrier or bailee has incurred a liability by his neglect to deliver, or to give the notice which shall take the place of a delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">When these goods arrived in Hew York it was the defendant\u2019s duty immediately to deliver them or to give notice of their arrival, and in default of doing either (assuming that he knew to whom to deliver or give notice) he at once became liable for any loss, the result of such neglect, which might afterward occur. And it would be opposed to the principles of equity to allow the subsequent taking, although under process of law, to excuse the prior neglect of duty and relieve the carrier from the previously attached liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">In the several eases to which we were referred in support, as is supposed, of the conclusiveness of the taking by legal process, and to which I shall refer again, the property was taken from the carrier either before it had reached its destination or before it could be delivered, and consequently before the carrier had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>incurred any liability for Ms neglect. It seems to me, therefore, that a distinction may very properly be made between those cases and one where the carrier had rendered himself liable to the owner before legal process was interposed to deprive him of the power to deliver. And it is enough to rest the case upon , that distinction, and to shut out what otherwise might give effect to the legal proceedings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">But without any other or further proof than the mere production of the record of the proceedings in the actions against the defendant, the learned justice held such record to be conclusive, without any proof whatever of any title to the goods in the plaintiffs in those actions, and without any proof of notice to the plaintiff that he might come forward and defend or protect Ms title.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">However unsettled the law may be, and it may be said to be quite unsettled, in regard, to the right of .a carrier to dispute the title of the person who delivers the goods to him, or to set up an adverse title to defeat the right of action upon Ms contract, it nevertheless cannot be denied that where the carrier is allowed to do so the onus is upon him to establish such paramount title.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">. On the trial an offer was made by the defendant to prove that .the plaintiffs in the replevin suits were the owners of the goods, but the evidence was excluded by the court, on the ground that the judgments in those actions were a bar to a recovery here. It may not be out of place to see whether this proposition, under the facts of the case, can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">I do not think that.it can be claimed that the rule is well established that the mere taking of goods from a bailee or carrier by process of law is by itself a complete justification for not delivering. If such a rule was to be established, and the bare production of the legal process under which the property had been taken should be deemed conclusive, <em>without any proof of title </em>in the person asserting a paramount title, it would, in almost every case, place it out of the power of the bailor to .ever reclaim Ms property, and until some authoritative decision to that effect is rendered I am unwilling to adopt any such proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>I think the true rule is, that a bailee or carrier who attempts to shield himself behind a <em>\u201c </em>process of law,\u201d by which he has been deprived of the property, should be required to show that the person claiming the paramount title was the true owner. Mr. Justice Story (Story on Bail., \u00a7 582) says that a bailee may excuse himself by showing that the goods were demanded and taken from his possession by a person <em>having </em>a superior title to the property. That in general a carrier is not permitted to dispute the shipper\u2019s title, or to set up an.adverse title to defeat the former\u2019s right of action. But if he delivers them to a third party, he may <em>show, </em>in an action against him, <em>that such third party was the actual and lawful owner, </em>and, as Mr. Parsons says (1 Pars. on Con., 678), <em>that the person who delivered the goods to the carrier had no right to them whatever, </em>and the current and weight of authority, I think, fully supports the rule (King <em>v. </em>Richards, 6 Whart., 418; Bates v. Stanton, 1 Duer, 79; 1 Pars. on Con., \u00a7 679). Yet this rule, it would seem, is somewhat qualified, and requires notice to be given (where it can be) to the person who delivered the goods to the earner, of such adverse claim of title (Story on Bail., \u00a7 582).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The rule I have stated may be said to be confined to cases where property is taken without process of law or given up by the carrier without suit, and, in that case only, is he required to establish the superior title of the person claiming.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Perhaps two or three of the cases which were cited to us by the respondent\u2019s counsel may seem to favor this latter view. In one of them (Edson <em>v. </em>Weston, 7 Cow., 278) the property had been taken from the defendant under an execution, and it was held to constitute a defense. The court said the property had been taken by paramount <em>authority\u2014the authority of law. </em>But the defendant in that case was amere depository, and answerable for gross neglect only, besides the offer was to prove that <em>before </em>the property was delivered to the defendant it had been levied upon, although the constable did not take possession until after-wards. As the property was in the custody of the law immediately upon the levy, there was a paramount right in the constable as against the plaintiff, who was a mere bailee without hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>In another of the cases (Van Winkle <em>v. </em>The U. S. Mail S. S. Co., 37 Barb., 122) the defense was that the property belonged to Mygatt <em>&amp; </em>Co., and was taken from the carrier under process against them. The defense was overruled. The court, in granting a new trial, say that if goods are taken from a bailee or carrier by authority of law, it is a defense against the claims of the bailee. But it will be seen that the offer of evidence, which was excluded in that case, was to prove that the property <em>did not belong to this shipper, but to the firm of Mygatt db Go., </em>and was taken, etc., and it was the exclusion of this evidence that was held to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Another of the cases (Blivin <em>v. </em>The Hudson R. R. R. Co., 35 Barb., 188) was claimed to be almost identical with the case at bar. The learned justice in that case says, that if goods are taken from the bailee by the authority of the law, it will be a defense to an action 1 by the bailor; that he is not bound to litigate for the bailor, <em>u or to show that the judgment or decision of </em>the tribunal issuing the process, or seizing the goods, was correct in law <em>or vn fact? </em>This last proposition is not supported by the learned justice, by any cited case or authority whatever, and in my judgment is not sound; And it appears, moreover, that the title to the property in that case was litigated, and such litigation tended to show that the shipper had no right whatever to the property, which is all that it is necessary to claim should have been shown in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">So it will be seen that one only of these cases holds that mere process of law in favor of an adverse claimant is by itself, and unaccompanied by proof of such adverse title, a sufficient defense, and the others do not support the position that proof of adverse title is confined to cases of delivery by the bailee without suit. Bor have 1 been able to find any case, except that of Blivin <em>v. </em>Hudson R. R. R. Co. <em>(supra), </em>where such a distinction is taken, and the reason against any such distinction is too strong to be easily overthrown.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">While the case of Bates <em>v. </em>Stanton <em>(ubi supra) </em>is an authority that the carrier may show title out of, or in other words may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>dispute the title of the shipper, it does not sustain the position that where the property is taken by authority of law it is not necessary to prove the adverse or superior title of the claimant. In that case the judgment, which the court held to be conclusive against the shipper without further proof of title in the claimants, was a judgment in favor of such claimants <em>agaimt the shipper, </em>in which they had recovered in trover the value of the goods, and the court held the judgment conclusive, on the doctrine of estoppel, the shipper being a party to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In the absence of any case except the one referred to, holding the conclusiveness of a judgment in a case like this, and there being no difference in principle as regards the requisite proof between cases of taking property with or without process of law, we should adopt, I think, what seems to be the most just and reasonable rule, and place the two cases upon a level.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">But without committing ourselves to the proposition last discussed, the court is of opinion that a new trial ought to be granted, on the ground that the question arising under the evidence of the witness Richter was a proper one for the jury, and that it was erroneous to withhold such question from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Of course it follows, and such is the opinion we intend to express, that in submitting such question to the jury they should be instructed that, if they believe the defendant knew the plaintiff\u2019s agent, and his authority to receive the goods, and neglected to give him notice of their arrival, the defendant was liable for their value, notwithstanding they had been taken in the replevin suits, and their verdict should then be for the plaintiff for such value.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Judgment and order reversed and new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
