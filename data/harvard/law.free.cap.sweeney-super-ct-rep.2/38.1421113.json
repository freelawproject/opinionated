Such admission was erroneous, as was also the refusal of the court to find that defendants had no knowledge of this transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-15\">The request to find that Foxwell acted as a broker was clearly proven. Foxwell was a broker, and as such sold the coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The refusal to find that the cheek was not delivered by defendants to Foxwell till a day after he gave them the shipping receipt was error. It was material to the plaintiffs\u2019 case that the fact should be found whether Foxwell made and delivered the bill to defendants without the knowledge or authority of plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-5\">Also the refusal to find that the plaintiffs never accepted defendants\u2019 checks. This was material to show that no payment was actually made to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">So the refusal of the court to find that the indorsement of the check was a forgery, and that the indorsement was made without their knowledge, and that Foxwell had no authority to collect bills for the plaintiffs, or to make out or receipt their bills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-7\">The court refused to find that Foxwell had no connection with the plaintiffs except as broker; the fact was clearly proven, and the only question was whether the court should have found that fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-8\">The court was requested to find that the delivery of the check to Foxwell was not a delivery to the plaintiffs so as to entitle them to recover of the bank. The court was bound to find that fact affirmatively in order to sustain its finding of law that the defendants had paid the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. There is no proof that the check was ever paid by the bank, even to Foxwell, and the court refused to find that there was no such evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-9\">The defendants proved that the purchase was made of the plaintiffs. The receipt produced by them shows the same fact. It can make no difference that the defendants gave a check to the order of plaintiffs. B\"o authority is shown in Foxwell to receive it. On the contrary, it is distinctly disproved by plaintiffs\u2019 evidence. The money was due from the defendants to the plaintiffs. The only question, therefore, is, has the debt been paid? The only claim of payment is, that the payment was in the check given to Fox-well. A broker has no authority to receive payment for property so sold; his duty ends when he has made the bargain (Story on Agency, \u00a7 109; Higgins <em>v. </em>Moore, 34 N. Y., 417, 424; Easton <em>v. </em>Clark, 35 N. Y., 225).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-10\">The principal was known to the defendants, who received a bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>in the plaintiffs\u2019 name and gave a check to plaintiffs\u2019 order. They dealt with an unauthorized person at their own peril.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-5\">It is claimed that Foxwell had authority to collect the bill on the ground that he had the muniments of title. The delivery of the check to Foxwell was not a delivery to the plaintiffs. He was not their agent for that purpose. They have not ratified or adopted his action, and it never came to their possession, or to the possession of any agent of theirs. A principal is bound by the acts of his agent only so far as the agent is acting in the course of his employment (Weisser <em>v. </em>Denison, 10 N. Y., 6 Seld., 68).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-6\">The taking of the note or promise of the defendants to pay is not a discharge of the debt, unless the plaintiffs agreed to take it as such (Fobey <em>v. </em>Barker, 5 Johns., 68; Murray <em>v. </em>Gouverneur, 1 Johns. Cases, 440).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-7\">The giving of a check, even to the plaintiffs themselves (much less to an unauthorized person), is no payment of a debt, unless the check be paid (People v. Howell, 4 Johns., 296, 304).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-8\">The defendants have their right of action against the bank, and it is undoubted. They directed the bank to pay Wm. H. Talmage &amp; Co., or order; the bank paid on a forged indorsement; and that this is no defense to an action by the defendants (Weisser <em>v. </em>Denison, 10 N. Y., 68).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-9\"><em>Mr. John E. Burrill </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-10\">The findings of the court on the questions of fact involved are not only warranted by the evidence, but, like the verdict of a jury, are conclusive upon this appeal. Should the court on this appeal examine the evidence, it will see that the findings of the court are fully warranted by the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-11\">The contract for the sale of the coal was made at the office of the plaintiffs by Foxwell, who was there present and in charge, and acting as one of the firm. Foxwell held the shipping receipt of the coal, which was delivered on board the Florence, and a bill and receipt. Foxwell was in fact acting in behalf of the plaintiffs, and kept their books at the time of the transaction. He oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>cupied a desk behind the railing the same as a partner; made sale of coal and collected the bills therefor, used the billheads of the plaintiffs, and received checks payable to the order of the plaintiffs, which were indorsed by Foxwell in the name of the plaintiffs and deposited to their account. When the check in question was given to Foxwell, he delivered the bill, shipping bill, and receipt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">The principal is liable for the acts of the agent even in excess of the actual authority conferred upon the agent, provided such acts be within the scope of the apparent authority, and be such as an innocent third party, from the recognized acts of such agent, had a right to infer such agent was authorized to do (Dunny <em>v. </em>Roberts, 35 Barb., 463; Brindenbecker <em>v. </em>Lowell, <em>32 </em>Barb., 9).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-6\">The principle contended for by plaintiffs, that a mere broker has no implied authority to collect, has no application to this case, because here Foxwell was not a mere broker, but was intrusted with the possession of the evidences of title to the property and to the money to be paid, and also because it is shown that the acts of Foxwell in collecting and receiving payment of bills were known to be recognized by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-7\">The cases referred to, that a check does not operate as payment unless expressly agreed to be received as payment, have no bearing, because in this instance the check, was paid at bank by defendants, and they have parted with their money. And again, the check is not in the possession of the plaintiffs, but has been by their agent disposed of.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b44-9\">Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmC\">The general doctrine undoubtedly is, that a broker employed to sell has no authority as such to receive payment, for the reason that he has no authority to sell in his own name. The duty of a broker, in general, is ended when he has found a purchaser and has brought the parties together, and evidence of a local usage, allowing mere brokers to receive payment in certain cases, is not admissible for the purpose of. establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>authority in such brokers to receive such payment. But the plaintiff's in this case cannot, in my judgment, invoke the application of these general rules for their benefit. The evidence shows that Foxwell was more than a mere broker. He seems to have had general charge of the office of the plaintiffs at the time the clerk of the defendants purchased the coal there; he was behind the railing in plaintiff's\u2019 office in the same manner, as a member or clerk of plaintiffs\u2019 firm, and one of the plaintiffs testified that he had that privilege; he effected the sale in plaintiffs\u2019 name without disclosing that he acted as a broker merely, and the sale was made openly in a business manner and in the presence of other persons; the next day Foxwell called at the office of the defendants and procured the name of the vessel, on board of which the coal was to be delivered; the coal was delivered accordingly ; after that he brought the company\u2019s receipt for it, the bill of lading, and the bill for the price made out on one of the blanks with a printed billhead usually used by plaintiffs\u2019 firm for that purpose, to the office of the defendants and finally demanded and received the money. Up to this moment the defendants neither knew nor suspected that they were dealing with a broker; they had had no previous acquaintance or previous dealings either with the plaintiffs or with Foxwell; they, therefore, had every reason to believe, and I cannot doubt that they did believe, that Foxwell was either a member of plaintiffs\u2019 firm, or at any rate an agent clothed with general authority, and consequently did not hesitate to give him their check payable to the order of the plaintiffs, for which he signed a receipt in plaintiffs\u2019 name. Thus it will be perceived that Foxwell not only negotiated the sale behind the railing in plaintiffs\u2019 office, but that subsequently he had the possession of the evidences of the title to the property as well as to the money to be paid, and as his acts up to the time of payment including the presentation of the bill for the price had apparently been ratified by the plaintiffs in every particular, the defendants were justified in dealing with him as if he was authorized to collect bills and receive payment, and after having done so as innocent parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>they have a right to invoke the protection of the rule, which holds the principal liable for acts of the agent done even in excess of the actual authority conferred upon the agent, provided such acts be within the scope of the apparent authority, and be such as an innocent third party, from the recognized acts of such agent, had a right to infer such agent was authorized to do. In cases of this description, the real question ip not what power was intended to be given to the agent, but what power a third person, who dealt with him, had a right to infer he possessed, from his own acts and those of Ms principal (Dunning <em>v. </em>Roberts, 35 Barb., 463; Bridenbecker <em>v. </em>Lowell, 32 Barb., 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In the cases relied upon by the plaintiffs in this action a different state of facts existed. In Higgins <em>v. </em>Moore (34 N. Y., 417), the referee found as matter of fact, that the sole authority of the agent was to <em>sell, </em>and that simply as <em>broker, </em>and he rested his judgment upon a custom or usage which he found to exist in the City of Hew York, that when grain is sold by a broker for the broker to have the bill for grain sold by him made out in Ms own name, and for Mm to collect the money from the purchaser, where the seller resides out of the city of Hew York; and on further examination, it will be found that at the time of making the sale, the defendant in that case did not know who was the owner of the rye, but before any part of the same was delivered, he knew that the plaintiffs were the owners thereof; and, in fact, the rye was delivered directly to the defendant by the plaintiff\u2019s bargemen from the barge in which it was brought to the city. In Easton <em>v. </em>Clark (35 N. Y., 225) there was an unauthorized sale of the property, by wMch, if the plaintiff had so elected, no title passed. In the case of the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company <em>v. </em>Beebe (7 N. Y., 364) the agent was employed to obtain a loan for the respondent from the appellants, but Ms alleged declarations, wMch were relied upon, were entirely without the scope of such or any other agency. Instead of acting as the respondent\u2019s agent he represented himself as acting in Ms own name and right, and on his own account, in effect denying any agency whatever, and the respondent did nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>to mislead the appellants. These cases, therefore, do not help the plaintiffs. On the other hand it seems to be well settled, as a rule, based on principles of policy, propriety, and justice, that if a principal puts his agent in \u00e1 position to impose on innocent third persons by apparently pursuing his authority, he shall be bound by the agent\u2019s acts, for the reason that he, by his own acts and conduct furnishes the opportunity to the agent to deceive, and because such innocent third persons should not be made to suffer for the positive carelessness of the principal. The evidence in this case shows that the arrangements between Foxwell and the plaintiffs were generally very loose, indeed. Shortly before the sale to the defendants, Foxwell made some sales to other parties; he used plaintiffs\u2019 billheads, presented the bills, received the checks to plaintiffs\u2019 order, indorsed the latter in plaintiffs\u2019 name, deposited them, thus indorsed, to plaintiffs\u2019 credit, and plaintiffs ratified his acts. This evidence was not received for the purpose of showing that the defendants were in any wise influenced thereby, for they had no knowledge thereof, and had already rested their defence upon other testimony, but in rebuttal of statements made by plaintiffs upon the stand, to the effect that Foxwell never acted otherwise than as a broker for them, and in part refutation of the claim set up by plaintiffs generally, that because Foxwell was in point of fact a broker, and as such also sold for other houses, he must have acted as such in the particular transaction which plaintiffs had with the defendants. Ho error was committed by the admission of this evidence. It also appears that shortly after the sale to the defendants, Foxwell, at plaintiffs\u2019 request, kept plaintiffs\u2019 books for a short time, and collected bills for them. There is some evidence tending to show that during that time the bill of defendants was marked or crossed off plaintiffs\u2019 books, and the fact that plaintiffs, although the sale was for cash, made no demand for the money upon the defendants until after the expiration of about two months from the time of the delivery by the defendants of their check to Foxwell, is not disputed at all. Upon the whole evidence there can be no doubt that the plaintiffs are alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>to blame, and that it would be highly inequitable to compel the defendants to pay a second time, upon the sole ground that plaintiffs\u2019 agent, who to all appearances had full authority to receive payment, had none in point of fact. The defendants having thus been induced to part with their check, and the bank having paid the same, and charged the defendants therewith, it becomes immaterial to inquire by what means Foxwell got hold of the proceeds of the same, and for the same reason an examination of the cases cited by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, for the purpose of demonstrating that a check does not operate as a payment, unless expressly agreed to be received as payment, is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">I am of opinion that the findings of \"the court below are fully warranted by the evidence ; that no error was committed by the refusal of the court to find as requested by the counsel for the plaintiffs, and that, therefore, the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
