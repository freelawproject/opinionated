In the early evening the plaintiff was passing through Fourth street. As he approached the Second avenue he saw a street-car coming up. It partly stopped at the lower crossing, when the defendants\u2019 servant, driving a horse attached to a cart, behind the car, turned out to pass the car. The plaintiff attempted to cross the avenue in front of the car. He crossed beyond the railroad track, when he was struck by the defendants\u2019 cart and injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-10\">The case was tried before Chief-Justice Barbour and a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-11\">The defendants requested the court to submit the question of the defendants\u2019 negligence to the jury, which was refused ; and the chief-justice charged the jury that \u201c as matter of law there was negligence on the part of the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-12\">A motion was made at Special Term for a new trial, on the ground of surprise and of newly discovered evidence, which was denied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-13\"><em>Mr. George W.

The fact of viciousness was stated by defendants\u2019 own witness at the trial-That defendants themselves did not know it, is a mere immaterial negative. They were in court, and if. thought necessary, could have testified to their ignorance upon the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-8\">Hewly discovered evidence must be such as ordinary vigilance would not have disclosed.

When they got in the neighborhood of the lower crossing of Fourth street the railroad car slackened its speed, and there the defendants\u2019 driver turned his horse, he says, slowly out of the track. He had been driving in the track immediately behind the car. From that place (the lower crossing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of Fourth street) to the upper crossing, or a few feet beyond it, he had made such speed that his horse\u2019s head was about even with the heads of the horses of the railroad car. Judging from all the circumstances\u2014considering that it was about the time of the lamps being lighted, that it was at the crossing of the streets, that the horse was skittish, hard-mouthed, and was controlled by only a common single bit (the driver testifying that it afterwards became necessary to put on a United States cavalry bit), and that the driver, by turning out to the east side of the railroad car, was in a position where he could not so well see parties coming from the west side\u2014considering all these circumstances, the court'decides, as matter of law, that there was negligence on the part of the defendants. That question, therefore, is withdrawn from the consideration of the jury. It will be your duty to assume that the defendants were negligent in this act, which caused the accident\u2014that the accident was caused, primarily, by their negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">It must have been assumed by the chief-justice in this case that the evidence in support of the facts which he held to be conclusive of the defendants\u2019 negligence was wholly uncontradicted. If that were indeed so, and such evidence was sufficient to convict the defendants of negligence causing the injury, there was no error in withdrawing that question from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">But I think the chief-justice was mistaken in assuming that there was no conflict in the evidence. The only fact which tended to establish the defendants\u2019 negligence was the <em>rate of speed </em>at which the defendants\u2019 servant was driving at the time of the collision. The other and only other fact stated, namely, \u201cthat the horse was skittish, hard-mouthed, and was controlled only by a common single bit,\u201d was not supported by any evidence of knowledge in the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">In regard to the speed of the defendants\u2019 horse the plaintiff testified, <em>\u201c </em>It was going so fast I could not get in front of the cart; the cart was going so fast I could not get on my feet.\u201d Again, \u201c I don\u2019t know that I can state how fast defendants\u2019 horse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>was going; he was going considerably faster than the car horses; he must have been, to keep up with them. When I crossed the railroad the car was going faster than usual, and the cart was going faster than the car.\u201d One of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that when the plaintiff was being dragged, \u201c the cart was going pretty fast\u2014faster than a railroad car usually runs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On the defense, however, the driver of the defendants\u2019 cart, in answer to the question at what rate he was going at the time, said, <em>\u201c A </em>very good fast walking horse could go as fast as I did then.\u201d He also testified, <em>\u201c </em>When my cart struck the plaintiff, I was going between four and five miles an horn\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The chief-justice must have overlooked this evidence in assuming that the negligence of the defendants was established as a matter of law; for it seems to me that if the jury had found (had the question been submitted to them) that the rate of speed of the defendants\u2019horse was such as was testified to by the driver, it would have negatived the only piece of evidence having any tendency whatever to convict the defendants, and they would have been entitled to a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">I am clearly of opinion, therefore, that the withdrawal from the jury of the question of the defendants\u2019 negligence was erroneous, and for that reason the judgment should be reversed and a new trial had.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">We do not, as it is not necessary, express any opinion as to the sufficiency of the proof of the defendants\u2019 negligence, nor in regard to any concurring negligence there may have been on the part of the plaintiff. These are left open questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
