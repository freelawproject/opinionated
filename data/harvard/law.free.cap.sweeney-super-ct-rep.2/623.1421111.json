McAndrew, who was their agent in the city of New York, and the bill of lading, duly indorsed in blank, was transmitted to the consignee, who was ready, on the arrival of the ship at the port of New York, to receive the goods and pay therefor the freight and primage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-6\">That the ship, having the licorice on board, arrived at New York on the 25th day of August, 1860, and soon thereafter, and before the second day of September, the agent and consignee of the plaintiffs had notice of such arrival of the ship with the licorice on board; the agent paid the duties upon one hundred and eighty-one cases, parcel of the licorice, on the first day of September, 1860, and entered the remaining two hundred cases for warehousing, and received permission to cart the same in carts provided by himself, and a direction to place them in the United States Bonded Warehouses, Nos. 6, 8, and 10 Bridge street, in the city of New York, and duly delivered on board the ship a permit from the Collector of the Port of New York for the discharge of the goods from the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-7\">That on the 2d day of September, 1860, and on various days between the 2d of September and the 19th of the same month, the consignee, on the behalf of the plaintiffs, applied to the agents of the defendant on board the ship, to learn when the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>or Ms agents wouM be in readiness to land the licorice, but received no other or further information than that the licorice was in the lower hold of the ship and would not be put out until they got ready.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-5\">That the licorice was, in fact, near the bottom of the ship, other goods were on board which must be discharged before the licorice was reached, and no want of diligence on the part of the defendant in not landing the licorice earlier than the 20th day of September was proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-6\">That when the custom-house permit was delivered, the agent of the defendant in charge of and on board the ship was expressly notified by the agent of the consignee, on behalf of the plaintiffs, that the licorice was perishable, and was requested not to put it out in rainy weather, for the reason that, if he did, the plaintiffs could not take care of it, it had to be carted so far, and he was requested to be very particular, and let the day be clear, if possible, and such agent of the defendant promised to do so; on the 19th of September, the plaintiffs, by their agent, requested the defendant through Ms agent in charge and on board of the vessel to land the licorice on that day, but he declined; the- plaintiffs-then further requested that if the next day should not be fine he would not land the licorice, and the agent of the defendant then-informed the plaintiffs\u2019 agent that, if the weather was fine on the 20th, he would discharge the licorice from the ship on that day ; on the 20th day of September (1860), in the morning it rained and continued to rain until and at 9 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, with thunder and lightning at 4, 7:50, and 8 o\u2019clock; at 10 o\u2019clock it was clear and continued clear for one hour, when it became cloudy (light clouds for two hours and denser clouds thereafter), and so continued till 2 o\u2019clock and 37 minutes p.m., when it rained; at 3 p.m. it was still cloudy, but without rain.

That at 9 o\u2019clock, on the 20th of September, 1860, the master of the vessel consulted the barometer, and found it to be rising.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-10\">2. That at 12 m. the master again consulted the barometer, and found it to be still rising.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-11\">3. That the rain at 2:37 o\u2019clock p.m. was merely a slight shower, lasting about five minutes, and doing no damage to the licorice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-12\">4.

That the licorice, as it was landed, was placed by itself on the wharf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-14\">6. That no steps were taken by the consignee\u2019s agent to protect or provide covering for the licorice from the rain, either on the wharf or during the transit to the warehouses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The referee refused to find upon any of said requests otherwise than as he had already found.

Such as were disputed had enough evidence to support them, and we cannot, upon this appeal, disturb the referee\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">The defendant, on the trial, requested the referee to find certain other and additional facts, which had been established by uncontradicted evidence, and which it was claimed exonerated from liability. But the referee refused to make such additional findings, not because they had not been proven, but because, in his judgment, they were immaterial. The rule on this subject is, that a referee is required to make such findings of fact as are necessary to sustain his conclusions of law. He is not required to find other facts which are merely of a negative character (Nelson <em>v. </em>Ingersoll, 27 How. Pr. R., 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">I had occasion recently, in the case of Mierson <em>v. </em>Hope (decided December 3, 1870), to examine at some length into the duties and obligations of common carriers both upon land and by water. The result of such examination and of the authorities, most of which have been cited by the respondent\u2019s counsel in this case, was, that such duty and obligation ceased only with a proper delivery to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the consignee. In the case of carriage by land, such delivery, except where otherwise controlled by contract or usage, and except, perhaps, in the single instance of carriage by railroad companies, must be to the consignee in person, or at his residence or place of business. In respect, however, to carriage by water, custom or common usage has relieved the carrier from the duty of actual delivery, and a landing upon a wharf, or a deposit in a storehouse, after notice to the consignee, is such a delivery as will terminate the responsibility of the carrier (1 Pars. on Con., 668; Story on Bail., \u00a7 545; Ostrander <em>v. </em>Brown, 15 J. R., 39; Fisk <em>v. </em>Newton, 1 Denio, 45).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The notice which it is required shall be given to the consignee, must be such as will afford him a fair opportunity of providing suitable means to take care of the goods, or to carry them away. And if such notice is not suitable in point of time or other circumstance, the carrier and not the owner takes the responsibility, if they are landed and left exposed to danger or loss (Mayell <em>v. </em>Potter, 2 J. C., 371).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Upon these general principles of law, the liability of a carrier by water depends, therefore, upon the character of the notice to the consignee, and the manner of discharging the goods intrusted to his care; and where the fact is found, that the notice was not sufficient in point of time or otherwise; or that the attempted delivery was not made in a suitable place or manner, or at a suitable time; or that it was done while being exposed to the elements, or was left exposed to the elements, without a justifiable reason, the law adjudges the carrier responsible for all such damages as may thereby happen to the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The referee, as a concluding fact from all the evidence, found that the defendant was guilty of negligence and breach of his obligation and duty as the carrier of the goods, in landing the licorice on the dock, with knowledge of its perishable character, on a day unsuitable to the landing and transportation of such goods, without reasonable notice to the consignee sufficient to enable him to cause the same t\u00f3 be weighed, transported, and protected against injury by the weather. We are not called upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>to review these findings, upon any allegation that they were not supported by sufficient evidence, but it is claimed, assuming the facts to be as found, that when they are coupled with such other facts as the defendant says ought to have been found, they show a complete discharge of his duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">It appeared that on the 19th of September, the plaintiffs\u2019 agent requested the defendant to land the licorice on that day, but he declined. He was then requested that if the next day should not be fine not to land it; and the defendant then said if the weather was fine on the next day he would discharge the licorice from the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">On the 20th of September (the next day) in the morning it rained and continued to rain until and at 9 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, with thunder and lightning at 4, 7:50, and 8 o\u2019clock. At 10 o\u2019clock it was clear, and continued clear for one hour, when it became cloudy (light clouds for two hours and denser clouds thereafter),-and so continued till 2 o\u2019clock and 37 minutes p.m., when it rained. At 3 p.m. it was still cloudy, but without rain. At 4 o\u2019clock 25 minutes p.m. the rain again commenced, with thunder and lightning, and continued with increasing violence during the rest of the day and ensuing night.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Without further notice to the plaintiffs or their agent and consignee, the defendant, at or about 9 o\u2019clock in the morning of that day (20th) commenced landing the licorice in good order upon the wharf, and continued landing the same until about J before 12 o\u2019clock (noon), at which time verbal information from the defendant that the landing was in progress was given to the clerk of the consignee, and at 12 o\u2019clock (noon) only about forty eases remained in the ship to be landed, all of which residue was landed in good order between 1 and 2 o\u2019clock of that day on the wharf.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">It will be seen that the rain on the morning of the 20th continued until 9 o\u2019clock, after which time it was clear for a couple of hours, then became cloudy, then rained again a little after 2, and finally set in at 4, and continued a heavy rain during the afternoon and evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">In such a state of the weather, and after the implied promise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>not to land the licorice if the weather was not fine, and without any further notice to the consignee, the defendant commenced discharging the licorice upon the wharf, where, by exposure to the elements, it was damaged. And although notice was conveyed to the consignee at about 12 o\u2019clock of the same day, there was not, for sufficient reasons, enough time for him to remove or shelter the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The reasons for the consignee\u2019s inability to remove the goods were, that by the laws of the United States goods of foreign importation could not be removed from the wharf until weighed by a government weigher. A weigher could not be procured until 2 o\u2019clock. He continued to weigh, and finished at 5 o\u2019clock. The plaintiffs with great diligence removed the goods, but could not, although they made extraordinary efforts, secure them from the rain which fell during the afternoon and evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Under these facts the delivery on the wharf was not of a character to exonerate the defendant, and unless there was other evidence which ought to have controlled the referee\u2019s conclusions, his judgment must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">An officer of customs testified that he was present, officially, while the cargo was being discharged, and took an account of it; that his duties required him to take such account, and he had a right to not permit working before sunrise or after sundown, and to stop working if it stormed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The, duty of the custom-house official was simply to protect the interests of the government, and in the discharge of that duty he had a right to exercise a certain kind of authority over the cargo, and to prescribe, to a certain extent, the time and manner of discharging it. But the superintendence of such officer in no respect affected or changed the obligations of the defendant. The officer could have prevented the landing the goods in the night-time, and might have stopped their being discharged during a rain. But if he omitted to exercise his authority, he certainly would not be liable; and I cannot see how the defendant can seek shelter behind the officer\u2019s neglect of duty, and claim immunity for his own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The only additional fact which it was claimed ought to have influenced the referee\u2019s decision, was that the master of the vessel upon examining his barometer found it was rising, and thereupon commenced unlading his cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">It is undoubtedly true that a common carrier is not responsible for injury to property, which, without his fault, has been caused by the elements, after it has been placed upon a wharf. In such case the liability, if any, is that of a warehouseman and not of a common carrier. But, be that as it may, the circumstance that the master discovered that the barometer indicated a clearing away of the rain, was not sufficient to justify a discharge of cargo at the late hour of the day and with the limited notice to the consignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We therefore think that the conclusions of fact reached by the referee were all that it was necessary for him to find; and that those he was requested to find, and refused to find, were wholly immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Upon these facts, under the principles of law which we have stated, it follows that the decision of the referee was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The attempt to prove a custom or usage regulating the time - for landing goods on a wharf, to determine when the carrier\u2019s responsibility ceases, was properly defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">And the further offer to show what constitutes a delivery of goods was an attempt to settle as a fact what is commonly considered a difficult question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b636-11\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6e\">(dissenting). I cannot concur in affirming the judgment. I think the plaintiff had ample notice that the goods would be delivered on the day in question if the weather was suitable. The weather at the time the discharge commenced was fine and suitable, with every indication that it would remain so.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">If the carman and weigher had been on hand, the great portion of the goods could have been safely housed. That they were not on hand arises from the fact that in consequence of it having rained in the morning they judged the weather would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>suitable during the day. In this they were mistaken. The defendant cannot be held for a damage occurring through their mistake. But I think the carrier, after the weather became threatening, was not justified in continuing to discharge. For the damage to such of the goods as were discharged after the weather became threatening, I think the plaintiff may recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Judgment shall be reversed and new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
