DAVIS, Plaintiff and Respondent, <em>v. </em>ELIZA A. BANKS, Defendant and Appellant.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b184-10\"><em>[Decided December </em>31, 1869.]</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b184-5\">It is no defense to an action to recover rent, either that the premises were unfit for occupancy or became out of repair after the commencement of the term.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b184-6\">A tenant may recoup damages for a breach of the landlord\u2019s <em>covenant </em>to repair.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b184-7\">There being no covenant by the landlord to repair, a parol promise to repair, being without consideration, is void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b184-8\">Where a tenant, to secure the payment of the rent\u00bb gave a chattel mortgage upon <em>furniture\u2014held, </em>no ground for an injunction to restrain a foreclosure of the mortgage, that the premises were out of repair, and therefore no rent due.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b184-9\">Before Babboub, C.J., Monell and Fbeedman, JJ.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">This was an appeal from an order granting an injunction, made at Special Term, by Mr. Justice McOunn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-12\">The defendant, by indenture, leased to the plaintiff certain premises in this city, for one year from the 1st of May, 1869, at a rent payable monthly, in advance. The lease contained no covenant on the part of the defendant (the lessor) to repair, but a covenant on the part of the plaintiff (the tenant) to keep the interior of the house and the plumbing and gas-pipes in repair, at her own expense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-13\">To secure the payment of the rent, the plaintiff gave to the defendant a mortgage on certain household furniture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-14\">A month\u2019s rent became due on the 1st day of June, and another month\u2019s on the 1st day of July. Both remaining unpaid, the plaintiff, on the 6th of July, was dispossessed of the premises under the landlord and tenant act, and the defendant seized the mortgaged furniture, and was proceeding to sell, when this action was brought to restrain the sale and to recover damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-15\">The allegations of the plaintiff were, that in taking possession of the house she discovered that it was not in a tenantable condition, although it had been expressly represented to be so by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the defendant. That the defendant agreed to fix the premises, and make them suitable for domestic purposes. That, failing to do so, and finding the defendant did not intend to keep her promise, and the premises being utterly untenantable and unfit for occupancy, the plaintiff surrendered the possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">Upon these facts, an order was made, at Special Term, for an injunction restraining the foreclosure of the mortgage, from which the defendant has appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-6\"><em>Mr. O. L. Stewart </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">The justice erred in granting a perpetual injunction in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">His authority could extend no further than to grant a <em>temporary </em>injunction, to hold during the continuance of the action (Code, sec. 219, parts 1 and 2).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-9\">One of the objects for which this action was brought, was to obtain a permanent injunction restraining the defendant from disposing of or interfering with the personal property conveyed by the chattel mortgage. Until the hearing and determination of the suit, therefore, and certainly before answer, the court had no right to grant a permanent injunction. Whether or not the relief prayed for in the complaint should be granted, is to be determined only by the decision of the action itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-10\">Upon the facts, as submitted to the court below, the plaintiff was not entitled to <em>any </em>relief in the nature of an injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-11\">The acts sought to be restrained are not unlawful. The mortgage under which the defendant claimed the property sought to be sold is valid, was given upon valuable consideration, and vests the title to the property in the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-12\">No litigation is necessary to ascertain how much is due the defendant under the mortgage. The terms of the lease demising the premises to secure the rent of which the mortgage was given, sufficiently determine that question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-13\">It does not appear by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the final relief demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Upon her own showing, no cause of action exists in her favor against the defendant. She rented premises for which she agreed to pay $250 per month in advance. She occupied the premises for the period of two months and six days. The rent for one month only, that of May, 1869, was paid; the rent due on the 1st day of June, and that due on the 1st day of July, was not paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-5\">It is no defense to the claim for rent that the premises were unfit for occupancy (Edgarton <em>v. </em>Page, 10 Abb. Pr., 119; Moffat <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 Comst., 126; Tibbits <em>v. </em>Percy and an., 24 Barb., 39).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">If the premises were out of repair, it was the fault of the plaintiff, for she had covenanted to keep them in repair at her own expense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-7\">The act of April 13, 1860, chap. 345, has no application to this case. Under any circumstances, it does not relieve against rent due up to the time of surrender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-8\">In this case the plaintiff was compelled by legal process to surrender the premises in question. And if there had been a voluntary surrender and acceptance, it would not release the tenant from payment, of' the rent previously due (McKenzie <em>v. </em>Farrell, 4 Bosw., 192).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">In Bloomer <em>v. </em>Merrill (1 Daly, 485), it was held that the statute of 1860, chap. 345, applies only to injuries occurring after lessee\u2019s entry, and not to those existing at the time of the lease.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-13\"><em>Mr. John R. Dos Passos </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-14\">It is alleged, and not denied, that on the 6th day of July, the date of their abandonment by plaintiff, the premises were <em>\u201c </em>utterly <em>mtencmtdble and unfit for </em>occupancy.\u201d \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-15\">This brings the case directly within the purview of the act of April, 1860, which provides in substance that the lessees of any building which shall without their fault be so injured by the elements \u201c <em>or amry other cause,\u201d </em>as to be <em>\u201c </em>untenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u201d shall not be liable to pay rent <em>\u201c after </em>such destruction or injury,\u201d and may thereupon quit the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Conceding that the defendant, under the circumstances stated, had any claim whatever against the plaintiff, it could not at the utmost exceed the sum of $250\u2014the rent for the month of June.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">The plaintiff averred, that a few days after occupying the house she complained of its untenantable condition to defendant, who promised and agreed to put the same in good order, and that upon the faith of this agreement plaintiff continued to occupy the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">It is true that plaintiff covenanted to make all repairs, but that obligation only applied to <em>ordmia/ry </em>repairs, and not to such as are within the meaning of the statute of 1860 ; and therefore the law will not consider the subsequent agreement of defendant, by which the burden of making the repairs was transferred to the latter, a <em>nudum pactum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\">The original lease was altered and modified by parol, and agreements of a similar character have frequently been upheld by the courts (Monroe <em>v. </em>Perkins, 1 Pickering, 298, and cases cited; Lattimore <em>v. </em>Horsen, 14 Johnson, 380; Dearborn <em>v. </em>Cross, 7 Cowen, 48; 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, page 439).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">The defendant was not justified in attempting to sell the property mentioned in the mortgage upon a summary notice of <em>three days.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-9\">The mortgage stipulates that upon default in the payment of the rent, the property shall be sold according to \u201c statute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-10\">There being no statute in existence regulating sales of this character, it is insisted that the phraseology must have been used to indicate and embrace the law governing sales of personal property by execution, which provides for a notice of <em>six </em>days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-11\">The policy of the law does not favor the summary sale of a debtor\u2019s property, and where the terms of the instrument are ambiguous, all the time will be'given to prevent the same, that a reasonable construction will admit.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b187-12\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b187-13\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">There was no covenant on the part of the defendant to keep the premises in repair, nor that the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>should he tenantable, or should continue so during the term. There was a covenant on the part of the plaintiff to do the repairs required inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">It is no defense to an action for rent, either that the premises were unfit for occupancy, or had become out of repair after the commencement of the term (Howard <em>v. </em>Doolittle, 3 Duer, 464; Cleves <em>v. </em>Willoughby, 7 Hill, 83; Sherwood <em>v. </em>Seaman, 2 Bosw., 127; Post <em>v. </em>Vetter, 2 E. D. Smith, 284).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Had there been a covenant by the landlord to keep the house in repair, a breach of such covenant would have authorized a recoupment of damages by the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The parol promise, which it was alleged the defendant made, to put the premises in good repair, cannot be sustained for the want of a consideration. She was under no obligation to do any repairs, and her promise was a mere <em>nudum \u00a1pactum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">It is possible that the condition of the premises would have justified the plaintiff in abandoning them under the statute of 1860 (Sess. Laws, p. 592, ch. 345). Had she done so, it may be that she would have been relieved from the payment of rent after such abandonment. But she would have remained hable for all rent due or accruing up to the time of surrender (McKenzie <em>v. </em>Farrell, 4 Bosw., 192).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">It is entirely clear, I think, that the plaintiff is liable to the defendant for all rent due at the time she was dispossessed. She has not stated any fact which would constitute a defense to an action for its recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Such rent having remained unpaid, there was a default in the chattel mortgage, and the title to the property passed absolutely to the defendant, and she had an undoubted right to sell it to pay the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">I am unable to perceive any ground upon which the injunction can be sustained. The order should, therefore, be reversed and the injunction dissolved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
