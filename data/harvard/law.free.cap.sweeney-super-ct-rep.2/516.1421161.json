Subsequently the jury rendered a verdict for $698.35, and the defendant moved before said justice to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial upon the exceptions and for insufficient evidence, and that the verdict was against the evidence, which motion was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-7\">\u25a0 The appeal is from the judgment entered upon said verdict, and the order denying the motion of defendant for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-8\"><em>Mr. Henry L.

The court refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>to allow this examination to be given in evidence on the ground that the witness had been examined on the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-5\">There may be good reasons for holding that the plaintiff could not read in evidence in his own behalf his own examination taken before trial, and at the same time testify orally for himself; but there can be no good reason for holding that the plaintiff by testifying orally can deprive the defendant of his right to introduce in evidence against him (plaintiff) his examination taken before trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-6\"><em>Mr. Du Bois Smith </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-7\">The examination of a party taken at the instance of his adversary is not admissible to contradict his testimony given on the trial, and, when he is present thereon, cannot be read.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-8\">This examination is authorized by section 391 of the Code, which provides that a party to an action may be examined at the instance of the adverse .party, subject to the same rules of examination as any other witness, to testify either at the trial, or conditionally, or upon commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-9\">The examination offered to contradict the witness did not substantially vary from his evidence given on the trial.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b522-11\">Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdS\">The verdict of the jury upon this conflict of testimony should not be disturbed or set aside, as against the weight of evidence, nor do I think the court erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested by defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">There are two other rulings or points in this case claimed as error by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">First.\u2014That the court erred in refusing to allow this question to be answered (after defendant\u2019s counsel had read a portion of the examination or deposition of the witness taken before the trial on the part of the defendant): Did you testify to that in this case ?</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">Although I cannot agree with the learned judge who presided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>at the trial in the grounds of his refusal to allow this question to be answered (after objection), I hold that his ruling was correct, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">That the contents of every writing are (according to the ordinary and well established rules of evidence) to be proved <em>by the yya/per itself a/nd by that </em>alone, if the paper be in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">That in cross-examining a witness a party should not be allowed to represent in a question the contents of a written deposition or examination, and to ask the witness if he testified thus.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">A party may exhibit the writing to the witness, and by pertinent questions call his attention specifically to the same or any part thereof, and inquire as to his signature or his execution of the same, etc. (So far as defendant\u2019s counsel pursued this course he was not objected to or interrupted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">If the witness admits its execution, the party, at a proper time, may read the same in evidence, or if the witness denies its execution, etc., the party may, at a proper time, prove and read the same in evidence for the purpose of contradicting the testimony of the witness given on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The proper time for reading the paper in evidence or proving the same is, as a general rule, at a time when the party offering the same is conducting the case, and not upon cross-examination, although circumstances may often justify the direction of the court for its introduction at other times.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">But after the preliminary questions are asked, as above stated (and whether the witness admits the execution or not), a party cannot compel a witness to answer a question, nor, upon objection, will he be permitted to have one answered which contains or sets forth substantially any portion of the subject-matter of the writing. The examination itself was higher and better evidence of the facts or of the statements made by the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">In support of the foregoing positions, see Phillips on Ev. (6 Am. ed.) vol. 2, page 437; Starkie on Ev. (old ed.) vol. 1, 102; 2 Broderip <em>&amp; </em>Bingham, 113, 115, 117; Bellinger <em>v. </em>The People (8 Wend., 596); Newcomb <em>v. </em>Griswold (24 N. Y. Rep., 298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Second.\u2014Did the court err in refusing to allow the <em>entire </em>examination of Abraham Speyer to be read in evidence when offered ?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">It does not appear from the case, as to the purpose or object of defendant\u2019s counsel in offering this examination as evidence, nor does it appear that it was proved or identified, and as no copy appears in the case we are unable to judge whether the paper was, in itself, as certified by the judge who took the same, or by the clerk who filed it in this court, entitled to be admitted and read in evidence, so far as authenticity or identity was concerned, and we cannot presume anything for or against it, or decide as to its materiality or importance to the case of defendant, if admitted. But there is another (and as I hold), a fatal objection to its reception for any reason at that stage of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">It appears from the case that the plaintiff had rested and the defendant had likewise rested, and the plaintiff had resumed the case and recalled and re-examined some witnesses in rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s case, and had finally rested. At this stage of the trial defendant\u2019s counsel recalled defendant as a witness and asked him a question, which most clearly indicated a reopening or resumption of the defense on his part, instead of answering his the plaintiff\u2019s rebuttal. On obj eetion, the court refused to allow the defendant to answer that question, and, as I hold, ruled very properly in the case. Then the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201c offered in evidence the entire examination of the plaintiff, Abraham Speyer, taken before trial, on behalf of defendant.\u201d On objection, the court refused to receive the same, and defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The defendant, to avail himself of an exception to the refusal of the court to allow this examination to be read in evidence, should have offered the same before he rested the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs of the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
