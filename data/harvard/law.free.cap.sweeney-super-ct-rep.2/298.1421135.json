He could not maintain his action by showing a violation of a private act in the absence of any allegations referring to such act, or setting up a special restriction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">The acts given in evidence are private acts (Bretz <em>v. </em>Mayor, etc., 3 Abb., N.

R., 505, the question arose upon a demurrer, which admitted that the defendant had received a greater rate of fare than that allowed by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-8\">There is no averment or proof that the defendants were incorporated under the act of 1846, nor what rate of fare they were allowed to receive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-9\">Notwithstanding the limitations of fare in the acts of May 12, 1846, and February 5,1850, the defendants were, by the general railroad law, passed April 2, 1850, authorized to collect fare up to three cents per mile (act of April 2,1850, sec. 28, sub. 9; ib., sec. 49).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-10\">The learned referee has entirely misapprehended the grounds upon which this claim was urged before him. They were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-11\">That the effect of sec. 49 of the general railroad act of 1850 was to confer upon existing railroad companies <em>all </em>the <em>powers </em>and <em>privileges </em>of companies formed under that act, without any reservation or exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-12\">That among <em>th% powers said, privileges </em>enumerated and granted to companies formed under the act was that contained in sub. 9 of sec. 28, of regulating the rate of fare up to three cents a mile.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-13\">That, therefore, in so far as and in all cases where sub. 9 of sec. 28 conferred a <em>power or privilege, </em>it was applicable to existing railroad companies, and empowered them to charge up to three cents a mile.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-14\">That in all cases where said sub. 9 operated as a <em>restriction}, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that is to say, in respect to those existing companies which were by their charters authorized to charge more than three cents a mile, the provisions of sub. 9 should not apply, but they should retain the privilege of charging greater rates contained in their special charters, and that the sole object of the exception in the second paragraph of sec. 49 was to preserve that chartered privilege.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-4\">This construction relieves sec. 49 of all incongruity, and gives effect both to the general provision contained in the first or <em>granting </em>paragraph, and to the exception contained in the second or <em>subjecting </em>paragraph of the section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-5\">The citations, in the opinion of the referee, conclusively show the reason for the exception contained in sec. 49 to be as above stated, viz., that at the time of the passage of the general railroad law there were railroads in operation authorized by their charters to charge more than three cents per mile, and that the legislature did not intend to subject them to the provisions of subd. 9, which <em>as to them </em>would operate as a <em>restriction </em>instead of a grant of power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-6\">The <em>exception </em>in sec. 49, having been inserted for the protection of companies authorized to charge <em>more </em>than three cents a mile, it would be a manifest perversion to construe it into a qualification or withdrawal of the preceding general grant of power to existing companies to charge <em>up to </em>three cents a mile. Such a construction is inconsistent not only with the language, but the evident intention of the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">As before stated, the first or <em>grcmting </em>paragraph of sec. 49 confers upon existing companies <em>all </em>the <em>powers </em>and <em>privileges </em>contained in the act, without qualification. The succeeding or <em>subjecting </em>paragraph exempts existing companies not only from the operation of subd. 9, as a restriction, but also from various other sections of the railroad act, which are omitted in the enumeration of sections applied, and generally from all provisions inconsistent with their charters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-8\">All these exceptions and exemptions are manifestly intended for the <em>benefit </em>of the existing companies\u2014not for the purpose of <em>abridging </em>the powers granted to them in the first paragraph.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The power of regulating the rate of fare is one of the most important powers and privileges of a railroad corporation, and must be deemed to have been embraced in the grant of <em>powers and privileges </em>to existing corporations contained in section 49.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-4\">The restriction of the fare of the Central Railroad below three cents was by special act passed subsequent to the general railroad law of 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\">The omission of the words \u201c not inconsistent with their charters \u201d in the <em>grcmting </em>paragraph of sec. 49, and the insertion of them in the <em>subjecting </em>paragraph, show clearly that the intent was to confer the additional <em>powers and privileges </em>absolutely, even if they involved a modification of the existing charters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-6\">That this peculiar frame of the section was not accidental but intentional is clearly shown by a comparison with the provisions of the general railroad law of 1848. The 46th section of that act (laws of 1848, page 237) declares that \u201c all existing railroad corporations within this State shall respectively have and possess all the powers and privileges, and be subject to all the duties, liabilities, and provisions contained in this act, so far as they shall be applicable to their present condition, <em>and not inconsistent with thei/r several </em>charters.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-7\">There the qualification, \u201cnot inconsistent with their several charters,\u201d was applied as well to the <em>grafting </em>part as to the <em>subjecting </em>part of the section. By the amendment in 1850 it is applied exclusively to the subjecting part, a clear manifestation of intention that the grant of power was intended to be absolute, even if inconsistent with the existing charters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-8\">The argument that the act of February 5, 1850, recognizes the limitation of fare to less than three cents as then subsisting, and is, therefore, inconsistent with the claim now made, falls to the ground as soon as the difference between the language of the railroad act of 1848 and that of the act of April 2, 1850, is pointed out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-9\">It is conceded that by the act of 1848 the power to charge three cents a mile was not conferred upon existing corporations whose charters fixed a lower limit, for the reason that the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>was inconsistent with such charters, and therefore not granted by the act of 1848, which excepted from its grant such inconsistent powers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-4\">But that concession is perfectly consistent with and fortifies the claim, that when in the subsequent act of April 2,1850, that exception or condition was purposely omitted, and all the powers and privileges of railroad companies formed under this act were unconditionally and without reservation conferred upon existing companies, they could claim that most important privilege.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-5\">The general intent of the railroad law of 1850 manifestly was to give to companies formed under that act <em>no ad/oantage </em>of any kind over <em>existing corporations; </em>to extend to existing corporations all the power\u2019s and privileges of corporations formed under the act, whether inconsistent with their charters or not, and further, to preserve to such <em>existing </em>corporations all special privileges which they enjoyed under their respective charters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\">Even if the plaintiff were entitled to recover, the act of 1857 limits his recovery to fifty dollars and the excessive fare (Laws of 1857, ch. 185).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-7\">The act prohibits the charging of illegal <em>rates. </em>It does not in terms point to separate offences or occasions of overcharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-8\">It does not provide a recovery for each., and every time an overcharge is made, or for <em>\u201c </em>each and every offence,\u201d as in some statutes, but simply that any party subjected to the overcharge may recover fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-9\">This gives but one penalty to each passenger, and does not j ustify a recovery by one party in one action of twenty-six thous- and dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-10\">The act says <em>\u201c which sum </em>\u201d (fifty dollars) may be recovered by the party overcharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-11\">The amount of the recovery is not regulated by the degree of excessive rate, or the length of time or number of times it has been exacted, but is arbitrarily fixed at fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-12\">It is a penal statute, and must be construed strictly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-13\">In the People against the N. Y. Central R. R. Co. (13 N. Y. R., 78), the act provided that the company should pay a penalty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u201c <em>twenty dollars for' every neglect\" </em>of the duty required; to be sued for by the District Attorney. Act of 1850, sec. 39. (Repealed 1854.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-4\">This language was relied upon by the Court of Appeals to justify a recovery of several penalties in one action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-5\">In the Supreme Court the authorities are conflicting. In Washburn <em>v. </em>McInroy, 7 Johns., 134; Tiffany <em>v. </em>Driggs, 13 Johns., 253; and Bigelow <em>v. </em>Johnson, 13 Johns., 428, it was held that but one penalty could be recovered when the act did not in terms give several penalties. In Deyo <em>v. </em>Rood, 3 Hill, 527, the court held the other way; but this is the only case to be found to that effect. In the latter case it may be observed, however, that the statute contained a provision that the <em>\u201cpenalties </em>\u201d imposed by the title might be sued for, etc. (1 R. S., 681, sec. 19), and there was no limitation in terms of <em>the sum, which might he recovered </em>in any such action, as in the present case (see, also, People <em>v. </em>Koll, 3 Keyes, N. Y. R., 236; Ingersoll <em>v. </em>Skinner, 1 Denio, 540).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">It is not conceded that various actions for <em>various </em>penalties could be brought, under the act of 1857, at one time, by the same party. Ho party can, at any one time, have a right of action for more than fifty dollars, for that is the limit imposed by the statute upon the recovery of the party complaining.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">The concession was, that if, after an action had been brought, and the rights of the parties in that action fixed, a subsequent offence was committed, another action might be brought for the subsequent offence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-8\">But however this may be, if a penal statute limits the recovery in an action to fifty dollars, a recovery in that action for a greater sum cannot be justified, on the ground that if the plaintiff had brought several actions he could have recovered in each of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-9\">He cannot be allowed in the action brought that which he might have recovered in actions which he did not bring.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>Mr. James R. Whiting </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\">The defendants were limited by their charter to the rate of fare therein prescribed, and neither the general railroad act of 1843, nor the general railroad act of 1850, authorized the defendants to ask or receive any greater fare than authorized by their charter (Chase <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central, 26 N. Y, 524; Nellis <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central, 30 N. Y., 518).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">This is purely a question of construction, and the defendants endeavor to construe the act of 1850 so as to entirely nullify the important exception contained therein (Clarkson <em>v. </em>H. R. R. R., 12 N. Y., 30).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">The defendants are liable, under the act of 1857, entitled \u201cAn act to prevent extortion by railroad companies,\u201d to a forfeiture of fifty dollars for each offence against that law, together with excess (Laws of 1857, ch. 185, p. 432).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">The act is not penal, but remedial. It was intended to introduce a new remedy for an offence known to the law and not sufficiently guarded against.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-8\">Before the statute the plaintiff could have recovered the excess by action, and damages such as he had sustained. But the rule of damages was uncertain. This act made certain what was before uncertain, giving the forfeiture <em>to the party </em>as liquidated damages\u2014the first object of the act being to remedy the evil and prevent the extortion, and at the same time fix an exact rule of damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-9\">The defendants\u2019 act of incorporation <em>prohibits </em>from charging more than a certain amount; any excess would be unlawful (Laws of 1846, ch. 216, \u00a7 17; Griffith <em>v. </em>Wells, 3 Denio, 226).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-10\">The intent of the legislature in enacting the statute was plainly the prevention of extortion by fixing a forfeiture of fifty dollars, which sum, etc., may be recovered by the party paying the same. There is no limitation in the act itself, and the offence under the statute fixes the liability or the right in the party paying the excess to recover the fixed sum of fifty dollars for his damages for that one extortionate charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>It would not otherwise he \u201c an act <em>to prevent </em>extortion,\u201d for if the plaintiff can recover but one penalty, the corporation may soon make up the amount in extortionate rates, and be the gainers in the end.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-4\">Both points are treated exhaustively in the opinion of the referee in-this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">These several distinct liabilities of the defendants to the plaintiff can be joined in one suit (City of Brooklyn <em>v. </em>Cleves, Lalor\u2019s Supp. to Hill and Denio, p. 231; Deyo <em>v. </em>Rood, 3 Hill, 527; Cowan\u2019s Treatise, 2d edit., p. 561; 1 Chitty Pl., 181; Langworthy <em>v. </em>Knapp, 4 Abb., 115; Clark <em>v. </em>Met.

Stat., 600, sec. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The power to demand fare or compensation of a passenger on a railroad is not an implied or incidental power, but one derived from the statute, and can be exercised only under the authority of the statute, and is necessarily subjected to all such restrictions and limitations as are imposed by the statute (Head <em>&amp; </em>Amory <em>v. </em>Providence Insurance Company, 2 Cranch, 127; Bentley <em>v. </em>Knowles, 4 Pet., 152; People <em>v. </em>Utica Insurance Company, 18 John. Rep., 358; Halstead <em>v. </em>The Mayor, 3 N. Y. Rep., 430; Perrine <em>v. </em>Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Company, 9 How., 172). In the last case the question was whether the Canal Company could demand toll from passengers passing through the canal, or from vessels on account of the passengers on board; and it was decided that, as no power was given to the corporation to demand toll from passengers, no such power could be exercised or such toll lawfully taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">In every special charter for a railroad corporation granted in this State, as well as in all the general acts, the power to demand toll or fare from passengers is given in express terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Inasmuch, therefore, as no power to demand fare can be implied, and as the power given to the defendants by its charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>was limited, it is necessary to examine the forty-ninth section of the general act before referred to, to see whether the construction of it, by the defendants, is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">If the section conld be separated so as to be read in detached parts, giving to each part a separate effect, it is possible it could be understood as a grant of all the powers contained in the general act; that is, if the section could be so separated as to make the granting part and the subjecting part each complete in itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The first part of the section provides that <em>\u201c </em>all existing railroad corporations shall have and possess all the powers and privileges <em>contamed </em>m <em>this act.\u201d </em>Should we stop here, there could be no doubt that not only the power contained in the ninth subdivision of the twenty-eighth section, to regulate and fix the rate of fare at not exceeding <em>three </em>cents, was granted to all existing railroads, but that the legislature intended it should be so; and more than that, that the legislature intended to confer upon such existing companies <em>all </em>the powers and privileges contained in the general act, in addition to the powers and privileges expressly given to them by their charters, even although such additional powers and privileges were wholly inconsistent with the provisions of their charters.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">But such a reading of the section would necessarily be to give to the existing companies two, in some respects, wholly inconsistent powers. Thus, all the provisions of the first eight sections, and of the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, twenty-second, twenty-ninth, forty-seventh, and forty-eighth sections, would apply to all railroads existing under special charters in 1850, when the general act was passed. A comparison of the defendants\u2019 charter with the sections of the general act above mentioned will exhibit palpable differences\u2014in the number of officers, manner of electing directors, of filling vacancies, acquiring land, and in other respects\u2014which, if applied to existing companies, would be violations of their charters. It must, therefore, be presumed that the legislature could not have intended to give these incongruous and inconsistent powers to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>But to follow the section, \u201c and they shall be <em>subject </em>to all the duties, liabilities, and provisions not <em>inconsistent </em>with the provisions of their charters, contained in sections\u2014\u201d etc. The several sections enumerated respectively confer <em>powers, </em>or impose <em>duties </em>or <em>liabilities, </em>either or both of which the legislature may do. But it would be a novelty in legislation to \u201c subject \u201d to a power, as it would be to \u201c grant \u201d a duty or liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">It is not probable, therefore, that in enumerating the several sections which should be applicable to existing companies, it was intended to \u201c subject \u201d such companies to any <em>powers </em>or <em>privileges </em>contained in or granted by them, but to subject them only to the duties and liabilities specified; first giving them all the powers and privileges, and then subjecting them to all the duties and liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">If it had been intended to grant more <em>power </em>to existing com-' parties, than it was to subject them to new duties and liabilities, the latter or <em>subjecting </em>part of the section would not have included sections nine, thirteen to twenty-one inclusive, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-eight, and thirty-five, all of which contain grants of important <em>powers </em>and <em>privileges, </em>but do not impose any <em>duty </em>or liability whatever, especially section twenty-eight, which is the general enabling section, and includes the power to regulate the fare of passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">It is quite evident, therefore, that the legislature intended merely to grant the powers and impose the duties contained' in the specified sections, so that the whole section should read together, as if it read, \u201c Existing railroad companies shall have and possess all the powers and privileges, and shall be subject to all the duties, etc., contained in sections nine\",\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Such a construction of the section will give an intelligible and altogether consistent effect to the exception of subdivision nine of the twenty-eighth section of the general act, by preventing its application to companies existing at that time under special charters, and excluding them from the privileges therein contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">It may be further said, in aid of this construction, that the legislature probably had in view that prior to the passage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>general act a large number of railroad corporations had received special charters, in many of which the rate of fare was limited, but in some cases exceeding the limit put in the general act. Even the defendants, who by their charter are limited to two and two and a half cents a mile for way travel, are allowed to demand ten cents for any distance under five miles (Laws of 1848, p. 44, sec. 8), \u00e1 privilege of which their construction of the law would necessarily deprive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">It is, therefore, proper to assume that the legislature did not intend to disturb or interfere with any of the powers or rights which had before been specially conferred on existing corporations, or to grant any new powers or privileges inconsistent with their charters.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Although, perhaps, no reason can be assigned for the change in the forty-ninth section from the language and purport of the somewhat corresponding forty-sixth section of the act of 1848, which latter section granted the powers and subjected to the duties, only so far as they were applicable and were not inconsistent with their charters, had the forty-ninth section been a transcript of the forty-sixth section, all difficulty in its interpretation would have been removed; but I do not think a reason for a different \u2022 construction is to be found in the fact that the legislature which enacted the law of 1850 did not employ as clear language, or frame as connected and lucid sentences to express their intention, as a previous legislature had. Ho doubt the forty-ninth section is illy adapted to fairly express the intention of the lawmakers. It is faulty in construction, and capable of a literal interpretation quite at variance with its probable design. But construing it by the rules applicable to all written law, and getting at its meaning from what must be supposed to have been the intention of its framers, it is quite clear, I think, that it was not intended that any limitation as to fare contained in the charters of existing railroad companies should be removed, and that to effect this the ninth subdivision was excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">My conclusion on this branch of the case is, that the fare demanded of the plaintiff was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>It is insisted, however, that no more than the excess of fare paid by the plaintiff and one snm of fifty dollars can be recovered in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The section of the statute under which the action is brought is, that <em>\u201c </em>any railroad company which shall ask and receive a greater rate of fare than that allowed by law, shall forfeit fifty dollars, which sum may be recovered, together with the excess so received, by the party paying the same\u201d (Laws 1857, chap. 185).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">There cannot be a doubt that the sum which a railroad corporation shall \u201c forfeit,\u201d for overcharging a passenger, is a penalty, or at least in the nature of a penalty, and is governed by all the rules applicable to penalties. It is not necessary that a statute, in the language imposing it, should denominate it a penalty. When a statute subjects a person, artificial or otherwise, to a liability to pay money, either for omitting to perform a duty enjoined or for doing an act prohibited, where no liability would arise at common law, he is subjected to a <em>forfeiture </em>of the sum, and it is a penalty for disobeying the statute (Corning <em>v. </em>McCullough, 1 N. Y. Rep., 47; Bird <em>v. </em>Hayden, 1 Robt., 383; Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Bliss, id., 291). In these cases it was held that a personal liability for the debts of a corporation, imposed upon its trustees, was a penalty; yet neither of the words, penalty or forfeiture, are used in the statute. So these words, it has been said, meaning the same, might be used interchangeably (Commissioners of Excise <em>v. </em>Doherty, 16 How. Pr. R., 46).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Similar words are used in many penal statutes. Thus, a tenant for unlawfully removing his goods \u201c <em>shall forfeit </em>to the landlord \u201d (2 R. S., 503, sec. 17); and a supervisor, for certain neglect of duty, shall \u201c forfeit,\u201d etc. (1 R. S., 368, sec. 16). In each of these cases they were held to be penalties (Morris <em>v. </em>The People, 3 Denio, 381; Palmer <em>v. </em>Conly, 4 id., 374 ; 2 <em>N. </em>Y. R., 182). In the last ease it is said that a statute giving the penalty to the aggrieved party is in the nature of a satisfaction for the wrong done.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">It is entirely clear, therefore, that this is a penalty imposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>a statute upon railroad corporations for doing a prohibited act, and for doing which no common-law liability would attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The next inquiry then is, can more than one penalty of fifty dollars be recovered in the action <em>% </em>Unless there is something in the statute which expressly or by necessary inference limits a recovery, and therefore removes the case from the effect of numerous decisions, the question must be deemed settled by authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">There is no doubt that, as a general rule, as many causes of action of the same nature as a party may have can be united in the same action. This was the rule before the Code as well as since (Graham\u2019s Pr., 2d ed., 95); and where a separate action is brought for each cause of action, the court will require all to be consolidated into one.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">If, therefore, the plaintiff in this case had several causes of action of the same nature, it was proper to unite them.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Although the statute of 1857 does not say there shall be a forfeiture of fifty dollars <em>for each </em>offence, or for each time a company shall demand unlawful fare, yet such result necessarily follows. Any other construction would defeat, or certainly very nearly defeat, the purpose of the statute, which is to \u201cprevent extortion by railroad companies.\u201d For if a single penalty only is incurred, corporations could practise extortion with little fear of consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">I cannot entertain a doubt that the legislature intended the statute should be a continuous one, and meant to provide a remedy for each and for <em>every time </em>unlawful fare was demanded ; and the defendants\u2019 counsel was understood to admit that the plaintiff on each occasion, when the penalty was incurred, could have maintained an action for its recovery. But he claims that the penalties cannot be aggregated, as was done in this case, and that the plaintiff in one action can recover only a single sum of fifty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The Excise Law of 1813 declared that the offender <em>\u201cfor each offence </em>\u201d should forfeit twenty-five dollars; and the eighteenth section of the act provided that, if a recovery was had, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>recovery should be a <em>har </em>to all prosecutions for like offences committed before such recovery. Under that statute the court held, in Washburn <em>v. </em>McInroy, (7 Johns. R., 134), that the legislature intended that there should be a recovery for a single penalty only. But in the Bevised Statutes the eighteenth section of the act of <em>1813 </em>was omitted, and the court came to a different corn elusion in Deyo <em>v. </em>Reed (3 Hill, 527).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The Bevised Statutes provide (1 R. S., 680, \u00a7 15) that whoever shall sell, etc., without having a license therefor, <em>\u201c shall forfeit twenty-five dollars? </em>Under that statute the decision was made in Deyo <em>v. </em>Beed. It was an action by overseers of the poor, and it appeared that the defendant had been guilty of <em>three </em>several violations of the statute. On the trial the court charged the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover \u201c for as many penalties as the proof showed the defendant to have incurred.\u201d The charge was sustained. The cases of Washburn <em>v. </em>McInroy, <em>supra, </em>and Tiffany <em>v. </em>Driggs (13 Johns. Rep., 252), were explained as resting wholly upon the eighteenth section of the act of 1813, which not having been incorporated with the Bevised Statutes left the question to be settled upon ordinary principles (see also Blatchly <em>v. </em>Moses, 15 Wend., 215). These decisions are supported by Young <em>v. </em>The King (3 T. R., 98), and Holland <em>v. </em>Bothmar (4 id., 228).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In my judgment, the case under consideration is not distinguishable from the cases cited which arose under th'e excise law. That law and the one under which this action was brought are in phraseology almost identical. Beither have the words <em>for eaeh offence, </em>and each declares that the offender shall \u201cforfeit,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">But the defendants claim that the amount which may be recovered is controlled by the words \u201c <em>which sum mazy he </em>recovered,\u201d following the amount of the penalty fixed at fifty dollars. It is, perhaps, sufficient to say, that all statutes which impose penalties provide the manner of prosecuting for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The Excise Act in the Revised Statutes (sec. 19) provides that the <em>penalties </em>imposed by the act shall be sued for and recovered by the overseers of the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>There is nothing nnusual in the statute, nor is there anything in the construction contended for, which prevents a separate action for each offence. The question, therefore, must be determined upon the ordinary rules governing and regulating the joinder of several causes of action. And I can see no reason why, if the defendants have incurred the penalty on several and different occasions, they may not all be recovered in one action.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The case of The People <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central R. R. Co. (13 N. Y. Rep., 78) was an action to recover <em>numerous </em>penalties, of twenty dollars each, incurred under section 39 of General Eailroad Act, which provides that a bell shall be rung on locomotives when crossing highways, under a penalty of twenty dollars for every neglect. It was objected in that case that the act provided for only a single ringing of the bell, and that if once rung there was no penalty for any other omission. But the court held that, by the fair construction of the act, the penalty was incurred every time the ringing was omitted, and a judgment for <em>twenty-seven </em>penalties in one action was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">I am unable to discover any difference between an act which affixes a specific penalty for <em>each offence ox for each t\u00farne </em>a prohibited thing is done, and an act, like the one under examination, which omits those words. The latter, equally with the former, attaches to each violation, and affixes the penalty to each offence. Besides, no such distinction is taken in The People <em>v. </em>The N. Y. Central R. R. Co. <em>(supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In City of Brooklyn <em>v. </em>Cleves, Hill <em>&amp; </em>Denio (Lalor\u2019s Sup., 231), the action was to recover <em>several </em>penalties for violation of a city ordinance. Kelson, C.J., says: \u201c It is well settled that several penalties may be included in and recovered on one suit at common law, and there is no statute restriction.\u201d And in Long-worthy <em>v. </em>Knapp (4 Abb., 115), a complaint under an act imposing a penalty of three dollars <em>for every day's </em>neglect, setting forth violations of the statutes on <em>one thousand and ninety-five days, </em>and claiming to recover all the penalties in one action, was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The cases to which I have referred are sufficient to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>this case. They determine, heyond doubt; that the several causes of action arising or accruing to the plaintiff under the statute may be united in a single action.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">After a careful examination and consideration of the two questions in the case, 1 am unable to discover any error in the judgment of the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The action and the result of it are important, and its consequences to the defendants much greater than the trifling excess of fare received from the plaintiff; but they are conseqtiences which result from one statute, for an erroneous construction of another statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">McCunn, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
