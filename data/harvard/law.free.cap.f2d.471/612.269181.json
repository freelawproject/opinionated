No. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-19\">Respondent failed to answer the unfair labor practice charge filed before the Board as required by Section 102.20 of the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, Series 8, as amended. Respondent likewise failed to file a response to the Board\u2019s notice to show cause why the General Counsel\u2019s motion for summary judgment should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-20\">Upon the record before us we find that there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings. It is therefore ordered that the Board\u2019s application for the entry of summary judgment be and is hereby granted and the Board\u2019s order be and is hereby enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
