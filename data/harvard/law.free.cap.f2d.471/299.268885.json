The Board decision and order are reported at 195 NLRB No. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">We have the case on the Board\u2019s petition to enforce and on the briefs of the parties, followed by oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">We are of the opinion that substantial evidence supports the Board findings of \u00a7 8(a)(1) violations in the following respects, <em>and no </em>others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">1. A supervisor interrogated an employee about the identity of a union organizer and about the employee\u2019s desires with reference to the union coming into the plant. Further, this supervisor told the employee that he knew she would vote right and if she did not there would be no bread on the table;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-15\">2. A supervisor interrogated an employee as to why she did not wear a \u201cVote No\u201d button;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-16\">3. A supervisor coerced and intimidated employees by obviously avoiding inclusion of employees for holiday work if they wore union buttons, even though this tactic was soon abandoned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-17\">4. A supervisor told an employee to go around and ask employees how they were going - to vote in the NLRB election and to report back after recording his findings on a paper pad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-18\">To the extent stated, the Board order will be</p>\n<p id=\"b362-19\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
