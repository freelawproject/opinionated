(NAWCAS), an organization previously denied certification by the Board on conflict of interest grounds. We also hold that the Board\u2019s reasons for disqualifying NAWCAS also disqualify District 65; it is not sufficiently independent of NAWCAS to insure good faith representation of the employees in the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-17\">District 65 is a long established labor union presently representing almost 30,000 members under more than 2,000 individual collective bargaining agreements. Prior to its affiliation with NAWCAS, however, it had never represented traveling apparel salesmen who participate in trade shows organized and conducted by NAWCAS and its affiliate members. The majority of NAWCAS\u2019 members are independent contractors and are not entitled to union representation under \u00a7 2(3) of the Act. The rest are protected by the Act as employee traveling salesmen for individual apparel manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-18\">Starting in 1965, NAWCAS sought to achieve union status with the help of District 65. The two organizations originally operated under an informal working arrangement; a formal affiliation agreement was signed on July 20, 1967. Under the agreement, District 65 carries on essentially all the \u201cunion\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>functions of NAWCAS. NAWCAS, on its part, collects dues for District 65 from its members, continues to carry on its trade association activities, and retains the right \u201cto make all decisions affecting the interests of its members in accordance with its constitution and bylaws.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The first attempts by the NAWCASDistrict 65 combination to organize employee traveling salesmen were frustrated by the Board\u2019s decision in Bambury Fashions, Inc., 179 NLRB 447, 72 LRRM 1350 (1969). There, a joint NAWCASDistrict 65 certification petition was denied on the ground that NAWCAS was disqualified by its conflict of interest. The Board properly recognized that NAWCAS might subordinate the interests of the employee traveling sale-men (who composed the units in question) to those of the independent contractors. Similarly, NAWCAS, whose primary activity is the operation of trade shows, might oppose joint manufacturer-employee salesmen interests in manufacturer operated trade shows. Disqualification because of such conflicting interests is a necessary measure to assure good faith representation in collective bargaining.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither this principle nor the holding of <em>Bambury </em>is questioned in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">NAWCAS and District 65 jointly conducted the Kaufmann organizing campaign during the pendency of <em>Bambury </em>in 1969. Kaufmann\u2019s employee-salesmen were asked to sign two different representation cards \u2014 one designating \u201cNAWCAS-District 65\u201d as the bargaining agent (apparently following the <em>Bambury </em>pattern) and the other designating only \u201cDistrict 65.\u201d The stated reason for the use of two cards was to avoid \u201centanglements\u201d at the Labor Board. J.A. 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">On March 26, 1969, NAWCAS-District 65 jointly requested a meeting with management. On April 18, Kaufmann responded that in view of the <em>Bambury </em>proceeding, it doubted whether NAWCAS-District 65 could represent the unit. The joint campaign continued until May 22, when NAWCAS-District 65 withdrew its request for recognition. At the same time, District 65 individually sought recognition, relying on the alternate representation cards. This change in form was not accompanied by any change in substance. NAWCAS and District 65 remained affiliated, and NAWCAS officers still were capable of influencing if not controlling District 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">In the subsequent certification proceeding, Kaufmann argued that the union\u2019s close ties with NAWCAS barred certification. The Board rejected the defense and ordered an election which District 65 won. Following Kaufmann\u2019s renewed refusal to bargain, the Board again rejected Kaufmann\u2019s arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and ordered it to bargain with District 65. Kaufmann then petitioned for review in this court, and the Board cross petitioned for enforcement of its bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The Board argues that District 65\u2019s established history as an independent labor union and its expressed intent to act independently in representing the bargaining unit are controlling in a certification proceeding. If these arguments were sufficient, potential conflicts of interest would seldom, if ever, be disqualifying.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board suggests, however, that ample protection is afforded by the availability of decertification. If District 65 \u201crefuses to maintain an independent course in representing unit employees, or if in bargaining the Employer has grounds for believing that District 65 is acting as an agent for another organization, the Board, pursuant to its authority to police its certifications, may examine Petitioner\u2019s conduct when the Board\u2019s established procedures are appropriately invoked for such purpose.\u201d 187 NLRB No. 20 (J.A. 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Under the Board\u2019s suggested procedure, the employer would have to challenge the union in a decertification context with proof of actual misconduct by the bargaining representative. Postponing any protection against the risk that conflicting interests may infect the bargaining process until actual damage has been done is inconsistent with the Board\u2019s proper evaluation of the potential for harm evidenced by its decision in <em>Bambury. </em>Disqualification of a bargaining representative whose independence and loyalty are properly drawn into question should not await proof of actual misconduct. Rather, the Board must focus on the potential for such misconduct before the union is certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">We agree with Judge Coffin\u2019s criticism of the test applied by the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\u201cThe principles attaching to the concept of conflicts of interest' in the fiduciary field generally, and also in the field of collective bargaining, look to the prevention and forestalling of conditions which are likely to divide loyalties. Were proof of union \u2018betrayal\u2019 required to trigger the application of sanctions, this constructive operation of the law would be largely nullified. We therefore take issue, not with the interpretation of the testimony, nor, of course, with the facts as revealed by the documentary evidence, but rather with the test or standard applied and the application of the undisputed facts to such standard.\u201d N.L. R.B. v. David Buttrick Co., 361 F.2d 300, 304-305 (1st Cir. 1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">As the Board recognized in <em>Bambury, </em>\u201cwhat disqualifies a union from acting is the latent danger that it may bargain, not for the benefit of unit employees, but for the protection and enhancement of [other interests].\u201d 179 NLRB at 451, 72 LRRM at 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">The record is replete with proof of the close relationship between NAWCAS and District 65. Mere assertions that they have acted or will act in-independently are not material even if believable; their continued close relationship in and of itself creates the danger that District 65 \u201cmay bargain, not for the benefit of unit employees, but for the protection and enhancement of\u201d NAWCAS. <em>Ibid. </em>We conclude that the same conflict of interest which disqualified NAWCAS in <em>Bambury </em>also disqual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ifies District 65, which owes loyalties both to NAWCAS and to the employees in the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Employer\u2019s petition for review is granted; the Board\u2019s cross petition for enforcement is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-13\">.

The Board lias not explained the underlying reason for any continued formal affiliation between NAWCAS and District 65. There is reason to believe that NAWCAS originally hoped that recognition as a labor organization might exempt certain of its activities from scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission. See National Association of Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Apparel Salesmen, Inc., F.T.C. Docket No. 8691, CCH Trade Reg.Rep. \u00b6 19,538 (Initial Order) (July 30, 1970); Bambury Fashions, Inc., 179 NLRB 447, 72 LRRM 1350 (1969). It is possible that NAWCAS\u2019 present affiliation with District 65 has the same or a related purpose. In any event, the potential threat to free competition inherent in arrangements between trade associations and unions makes it imperative that the Board thoroughly understand the reason for such an alliance before certifying a union which is formally affiliated with an association already disqualified on conflict of interest grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b365-14\">.

District 65\u2019s established history as a labor union representing employees in entirely separate areas of the economy is not material to the question whether its affiliation with NAWCAS disqualifies it from representing Ivnufmann\u2019s employees. The Board has not previously granted such deference to the fact that a union is well established. See, e. g., General Teamsters, Local 249, 139 NLRB 605 (1962) ; Oregon Teamsters\u2019 Security Plan Office, 119 NLRB 207 (1957) ; Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co., 108 NLRB 1555 (1954). Likewise, if a party\u2019s expressed intent to act independently were adequate to avoid the conflict of interest objection, the objection would have little, if any, force.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
