We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-16\">The following facts were stipulated: Appellant drew 48 checks against her Bank account in the period between May 12 and October 10, 1970. The account held insufficient funds for payment of the checks. Her mother, the Bank\u2019s cashier, paid the cheeks from Bank funds, as a result of which the Bank lost $100,671.51. The Bank Board of Directors, upon learning of the mother\u2019s misapplication, deferred action against her upon her promises that money would be forthcoming to repay the \u201cloans\u201d from the Bank. The promises were not kept, the Bank demanded her resignation, and the indictments, trial and convictions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-22\">The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the district court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motions for acquittal made at the close of all the evidence and after the jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-23\"> In ruling upon appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of all the evidence, the question for the district judge was whether all reasonable men, on all the evidence presented, would of necessity find that the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was sane in the relevant period, in that she was capable of forming the intent to commit the alleged crime. United States v. Westerhausen, 283 F.2d 844, 852 (7th Cir. 1960). And once the jury had returned a guilty verdict, the trial court would be bound to apply the same standard established in <em>Westerhausen </em>in order to grant a motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-24\">In anticipation of an insanity defense the government moved before trial, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244, that appellant be examined to determine her competency to stand trial. Appellant objected, but the government\u2019s motion was granted. Appellant\u2019s sole defense at trial was that she was insane at the time the offenses occurred and therefore incapable of forming the intent necessary to commit the crimes charged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>As in <em>Westerhausen, supra, </em>at 852, once the government established a prima facie case there was a presumption of the appellant\u2019s sanity. Appellant presented evidence to rebut the presumption of sanity and to require submission of the issue to the jury. Several lay witnesses testified concerning appellant\u2019s eccentric behavior commencing in 1965 and extending to 1970: her mental breakdown in January, 1968, her delusions of grandeur, her assumption of the role of Ann Drury, a fictional wealthy Chicago businesswoman, appellant\u2019s fictional businesses, her falsehoods, her profligacy with money, her fears and attempted suicide. In addition there was testimony in her behalf by three expert psychiatric witnesses, Doctors Radcliffe, Smith and Schuster, who examined her after the time of the alleged offenses. All three testified that she suffered from mental illness or defect from May 12 to October 10, 1970, the relevant period of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The foregoing testimony having rebutted the presumption of sanity, the presumption \u201cdisappeared\u201d (see United States v. Bohle, 445 F.2d 54, 70 (7th Cir. 1971)) and the\u2019government had the burden, under <em>Westerhausen, </em>of going forward with its evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellant was sane and capable of forming the intent required to aid and abet her mother in committing the alleged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The substance of the expert opinion testimony for appellant is that she was psychotic during the relevant period, suffering from \u201cthought disorder\u201d rendering her incapable of guiding her conduct in a \u201clogical and thoughtful manner,\u201d causing her to swing between moods of depression and euphoria and that she was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong and of conforming her conduct to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The government produced two expert witnesses, Doctors Fain and Groder. Their opinions, in response to the government\u2019s hypothetical questions, did not \u201crule in\u201d a \u201cseparation from reality.\u201d Their diagnostic opinions differed from those of appellant\u2019s experts. In substance they found that the person described in the government\u2019s hypothetical questions was neurotic rather than psychotic, and that she suffered from \u201chysterical personality disorder\u201d and that such a person could distinguish between right and wrong and conform her conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">It is unlikely that the jury was persuaded one way or another by the contradictory technical terms used and conclusions reached by the experts. Nor do we think that the experts\u2019 opposing testimony, in less technical terms \u201cthought disorder\u201d and \u201chysterical personality disorder,\u201d would mean very much to the jury. In our view it is the expert testimony of the symptoms of the diagnosed diseases that would be the guiding light toward the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Each expert witness testified to the usual symptoms displayed by a victim of the disease diagnosed by each. Appellant\u2019s experts stated that the symptoms of a psychotic separated from reality were: delusions of grandeur, as in appellant\u2019s case the euphoric delusion that she was Ann Drury, an extremely wealthy businesswoman; and the other extreme, her attempted and threatened suicide and fears of physical illness; and also \u201cattention seeking\u201d and \u201cpathological lying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The expert testimony for the government of symptoms of \u201chysterical personality disorder\u201d overlaps to a considerable extent the symptoms attributed by defense experts to a psychotic suffering from \u201cthought disorder.\u201d The relevant overlap is in the symptoms of \u201cattention seeking,\u201d \u201cpathological lying,\u201d \u201cdishonesty,\u201d \u201cdelusions of\u201d and \u201cfantasies of\u201d great wealth. It was those constants, among the symptoms, that we think could cause reasonable doubt in the minds of reasonable men as to whether appellant was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong and incapable of conforming her conduct to the law during the period when she wrote the worthless checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>In deciding whether the trial court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motions for acquittal we must take the evidence in the aspect most favorable to the government. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We see no merit in several arguments aimed by appellant at the lack of lay testimony by government witnesses to meet the lay testimony of appellant\u2019s witnesses. The determination of the credibility of appellant\u2019s lay witnesses, as well as experts, was for the jury. United States v. Cooks, 359 F.2d 772, 773 (7th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The testimony of appellant\u2019s expert witnesses carried its own weakness; for example, the testimony that appellant was \u201cat times\u201d in the relevant period incapable of conforming her conduct to the law, and that she could in the period have had lucid intervals, could have caused the jury to think that the checks might have been written during lucid intervals. Also Doctor Smith criticized the diagnosis of Doctor Schuster. And Doctor Schuster based his opinion on statements by appellant to him although he knew of her symptom of \u201cpathological lying\u201d and he could not say she had not made false statements to him. Furthermore, there were the overlapping symptoms, testified to by the experts for both sides, which left the jury free to decide that appellant was not necessarily psychotic because of the symptoms she exhibited. Finally, the complaint that the government did not cross-examine Doctor Radcliffe is of no significance. In United States v. Robinson, 327 F.2d 959, 963 (7th Cir. 1964), the court said the government was not even required to provide expert testimony upon an insanity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">There was testimony that during 1968 and 1969 appellant was director of nursing \u00e1t a convalescent center, supervised a staff of 45 members, purchased the drugs and supplies, conducted meetings of the convalescent center board, and managed the operation servicing 50 or 60 patients. The jury could have considered this testimony as rebutting the testimony of appellant\u2019s lay witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Expert testimony for appellant was that her condition improved after the relevant period, and that in June, 1971 she was no longer psychotic but was, of course, subject to remission under stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Appellant testified at the August, 1971 trial with ability to recall incidents involved in the charges against her. And her mother testified that her daughter appeared to have no lapses of memory at all, did not appear to be out of contact with reality, and appeared to know what she was doing during the May 12 to October 10, 1970 period.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The facts in <em>Westerhausen </em>are far different from the facts here and that case is not authority in aid of appellant on the facts before us. Nor is the proof here \u201c \u2018overwhelming as to . insanity\u2019 \u201d of appellant as the proof was said by the court to be in Nagell v. United States, 392 F.2d 934, 937 (5th Cir. 1968), quoting McKensie v. United States, 266 F.2d 524, 528 (10th Cir. 1959). We cannot conclude that the evidence of insanity was so overwhelmingly one-sided as to justify taking that issue from the jury. United States v. Robinson, 327 F.2d 959, 963 (7th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">We hold that the district court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motions for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">For the reasons given hereinabove, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-18\">. The jury found both defendants not guilty of conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, to commit the substantive offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-25\">. The mother\u2019s conviction as principal was affirmed in an opinion filed simultaneously with this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b175-27\">. Appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial is not in question on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
