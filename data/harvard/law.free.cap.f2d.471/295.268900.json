Appellant contends that his guilty plea in state court was induced by incorrect legal advice and is therefore invalid under the standard specified in North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-24\">Sumlin pleaded guilty to five counts of a ten-count indictment for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. The remaining counts were dismissed, and Sumlin received concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-25\">The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of petitioner\u2019s plea in the state court, and found that the statements by Sumlin\u2019s retained counsel concerning the state recidivist laws, which Sumlin now complains were erroneous, were not a determinative factor in the plea bargaining. There is abundant evidence that Sumlin\u2019s attorney negotiated a significant benefit for his client, and the court found that Sumlin understood what he was doing and what options were open to him when he entered his state-court plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
