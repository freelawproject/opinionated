Donahue brought this action against the defendants Patrick Staunton, individually and as Chicago Area Zone Director of the Illinois Department of Mental Health; H. C. Piepenbrink, individually and as Manteno State Hospital Superintendent; and John F. Briggs, individually and as Director of the Illinois State Department of Mental Health, alleging that defendants had discharged plaintiff from his position as Chaplain at the Manteno State Hospital in abrogation of his right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. He sought relief pursuant to Title 42, U.S.C.A, \u00a7 1983. Jurisdiction was established pursuant to Title 28, U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">This case was tried to the court without a jury. The court filed its findings of fact and entered conclusions of law favorable to plaintiff and rendered judgment against the defendants in the amount of $2,000 as punitive damages, with interest; out-of-pocket expenses in an amount to be later determined; attorney fees of $750; and costs. Affirmatively, defendants were ordered to offer plaintiff full and unconditional reinstatement to his former position and, in the event he accepted such reinstatement, an injunction would be issued restraining and enjoining defendants, their agents and successors, from interfering with, coercing or discriminating against plaintiff in the exercise of his protected rights of free speech. Defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Plaintiff Father Donahue, a Roman Catholic Priest, was appointed Catholic Chaplain at Manteno State Hospital on July 14, 1964, and served in such capacity until his discharge on December 4, 1969. As Chaplain, plaintiff received a salary which he, under his vow of poverty, forwarded to the Order of St. Viator, withholding sufficient funds to provide for his daily needs. In this capacity plaintiff was charged with serving the spiritual needs of the patients and employees at Manteno, along with sundry other duties, including speaking at public functions to explain the operations of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Along with all other employees of the hospital, plaintiff was annually rated in the performance of his duties. Until the final report, prepared after plaintiff\u2019s discharge, he was always rated either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d on seven separate categories of duties and responsibilities. The annual review covering the period from July 14, 1968 to July 14, 1969 (five months prior to his discharge), prepared by plaintiff\u2019s immediate superior, contains the following analysis of his performance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">\u201cFather Donahue energetically and conscientiously discharges his duties as a spiritual advisor and counselor to the patients of Catholic faith at M. S. H. He has extremely favorable rapport with the patients to whom he provides the chaplaincy services, and at all times considers what is best for the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">\u201cFather Donahue constantly strives to bring about better conditions at M. S. H. and in doing so apprises the staff of changes that should be initiated in order to correct situations which are not acceptable for the care and treatment of the mentally ill. His ability to communicate with others concerning these problems and the presentation of his solutions leave little to misinterpretation. His strong initiative and precise communicating among employees and patients are attributes which make him an asset to M. S. H.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">Soon after plaintiff was assigned to Manteno, the hospital entered a period of transition. New policies were instituted so that the patients were no longer kept locked up and under strict security, no longer were the sexes separated, and the hospital\u2019s employment practices were decentralized. Plaintiff approved of these enlightened and progressive policies in theory but became alarmed with the method of their implementation. It was the consensus that such new pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>grams would require more supervision than formerly provided. He was gravely concerned that the supervisi\u00f3n was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In 1966 plaintiff expressed his criticism and concern in a union newspaper column which he authored; in a public speech to a convention of the Illinois State Federation of Labor; and in other avenues of public expression.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following the Board\u2019s report, <em>supra </em>note 1, defendant Piepenbrink in 1967 appointed plaintiff to a committee with the responsibility of developing a hospital policy relating to the problems of promiscuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">It appears from the record that there was a lull in the plaintiff\u2019s public criticism of the hospital operations. Later, frustrated by what he felt was a lack of progress in resolving the problems of the hospital, plaintiff in the fall of 1969 began another campaign of public criticism. His public statements included a speech by him critical of the operations of the hospital, which was reported in a local newspaper on October 20, 1969; on October 27, 1969, the same newspaper printed a letter to the editor written by plaintiff in which he criticized as impractical a particular program of the hospital; and on November 13, 1969, the same newspaper published a paid advertisement authored by plaintiff and one Thomas Nayder which set forth 12 specific incidents of negligence or improper activity at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The advertisement appears to be the most critical statement made by the plaintiff and one of the significant factors leading to his discharge. In relevant part, the advertisement charged that the Director of the Illinois Mental Health Department, the Superintendent of Manteno State Hospital and the directors of certain programs at the hospital were all \u201claymen,\u201d and that there was neglect in the preparation and funerals of the dead, little or no effort on the part of authorities to prevent runaways and improper treatment and delay in treatment of patients. He questioned the legality of a self-medication program and asserted that the hospital lacked certain facilities. He charged there was mixing of untidy patients with tidy patients, that the hospital issued birth control pills to highly promiscuous patients and other incidents of neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Although the truth or falsity of these allegations was not proven at trial, we note that many of the accusations came from reports of the \u201cPharmacy &amp; Therapeutics Committee Meetings\u201d at Manteno State Hospital and other inter-office memoranda. Also, plaintiff testified, and we presume from the court\u2019s findings that it was credited, that he checked every charge he made either by direct observation, conversation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201creliable sources, doctors, nurses, security men and aides,\u201d or through a number of memoranda which came to his office. He also testified that he never knowingly published or stated anything that was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Letters were also written by plaintiff to the Governor in which he stated his purpose was \u201cto relate some of [the] happenings\u201d at the hospital. Copies of such letters were sent to defendant Briggs. In addition, plaintiff encouraged others to write to the Governor to protest what he believed to be the deplorable conditions at Manteno.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Defendants assert that the plaintiff\u2019s statements were made without checking their validity and contained falsehoods and half-truths which were detrimental to the operation of the hospital and the well-being of the patients. The termination slip handed to plaintiff stated he was discharged for cause, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cIn the best interest of the patients and staff at Manteno Hospital, the Chicago Area Zone Director, Patrick Staunton, M. D., and Manteno State Hospital Superintendent H. C. Piepenbrink, have decided on this action. This priest has consistently, arid without checking validity of criticism, made public charges against the treatment programs of this facility which have little basis in fact and which are detrimental to the care and treatment of the patients and can no longer be tolerated by the management of one of its employees.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Hence the principal issue we face here is whether the discharge of plaintiff by the named defendants violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Ancillary issues are: whether plaintiff was an employee of the Manteno State Hospital; whether the Illinois statutory scheme for the discharge of employees was improperly held unconstitutional; and whether the remedy afforded was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">We will assume for the purposes of this opinion that some of the allegations made by the plaintiff were false or misleading. However, upon our examination of the record, we find that at the time of their issuance they were reasonably believed to be true by the plaintiff and were not knowingly false and recklessly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Defendants\u2019 first claim, that plaintiff was not an employee of the State of Illinois or Manteno State Hospital, is without substance. It almost goes without saying that plaintiff was an employee of the State, <em>i.e., </em>he received a salary from the State, it being irrelevant that he saw fit to forward the money to his Order; his performance as Chaplain was evaluated annually by his superior, as was the performance of all other hospital employees; and his termination slip spoke of him as an employee. We hold there were sufficient indicia of an employment relationship to support this cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Since we find that plaintiff was an employee of the State, we need not decide the further question of whether any relationship between an individual and the State other than employment, which, if terminated in violation of constitutional rights, would be sufficient for a cause of action under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">Defendants next contend that the \u201cPersonnel Code\u201d of Illinois, established pursuant to ch. 127, \u00a7 63bl01, et seq., of Illinois Rev.Stat. (1969), was implicitly held unconstitutional by the trial court and thus the use thereof was enjoined. This they argue violated Title 28, U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2281, which provides that any injunction restraining the enforcement or use of a state law by a federal court must be by a district court of three judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>It is conceded that plaintiffs position with the hospital was \u201cexempt\u201d under the Illinois \u201cPersonnel Code,\u201d <em>supra, </em>and that he could be discharged at his employer\u2019s discretion without a civil service hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">We hold that the court below did not find the Illinois statutory scheme violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, but rather held that the discretion afforded employers by the statute was necessarily limited by the requirements of the Federal Constitution ; hence, by implication the state statute was held constitutional. The defendants, not the statute, were held to have, deprived plaintiff of his constitutional rights. The conditional injunction was directed against the defendants, state agents, and not the use of the state statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It necessarily follows that we find nothing improper in the district court\u2019s procedural disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We finally come to the crucial issue, <em>viz., </em>whether the defendants by discharging plaintiff deprived him of his First and Fourteenth Amendments rights to freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Defendants would have us rely on the analysis in Jenson v. Olson, 8 Cir., 353 F.2d 825 (1965), in deciding this question. We find <em>Jenson </em>to be unpersuasive, mainly because it no longer represents the prevailing thought in this area. <em>See </em>Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967) and Pickering v. Board of Education, etc., 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"A_A\">The leading Supreme Court case involving constitutional rights of public employees is Pickering v. Board of Education etc., 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). Under the particular facts in that case, the Court, applying the New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), standard for defamation against public officials, held: \u201cIn sum, we hold that, in a case such as this, absent proof of false statements knowingly or recklessly made by him, a teacher\u2019s exercise of his right to speak on issues of public importance may not furnish the basis for his dismissal from public employment.\u201d 391 U.S., at 574, 88 S.Ct., at 1738.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\"><em>Pickering </em>was a refinement of the idea that public employment may not be conditioned upon the surrender of constitutional rights. As was stated by the Court in Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, at 605-606, 87 S.Ct. 675, at 685, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967), \u201c &lt; * * -x- the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.\u2019 \u201d Taking this lead, we announced in Muller v. Conlisk, 7 Cir., 429 F.2d 901, at 904 (1970): \u201cIt may no longer be seriously asserted that public employees, including policemen, have no right to criticize their employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">The reason for the rule announced in <em>Pickering </em>was explained in Kiiskila v. Nichols, 7 Cir., 433 F.2d 745, at 749 (1970). \u201cA citizen\u2019s right to engage in protected expression or debate is substantially unaffected by the fact that he is also an employee of the government and, as a general rule, he cannot be deprived of his employment merely because he exercises those rights. This is so because dismissal from government employment, like criminal sanctions or damages, may inhibit the propensity of a citizen to exercise his right to freedom of speech and association.\u201d The court elaborated: \u201cTo protect society\u2019s interest in uninhibited and robust debate the first amendment demands that government be prohibited from inhibiting or suppressing speech by indirection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>through discharge of a government employee when the same objective could not constitutionally be achieved by criminal sanctions or other direct means.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">This is not to say that a public employer or State may under no circumstances discharge an employee for his public statements. <em>Pickering </em>provided, 391 U.S. at 569, 88 S.Ct. at 1735: \u201cBecause of the enormous variety of fact situations in which critical statements by teachers and other public employees may be thought by their superiors, against whom the statements are directed to furnish grounds for dismissal, we do not deem it either appropriate or feasible to attempt to lay down a general standard against which all such statements may be judged.\u201d Rather the Court felt: \u201cThe problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 88 S.Ct. at 1734.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Interests of the State which, if strong enough, the Court in <em>Pickering </em>felt might lead to a different result in the future are: (1) maintaining discipline or harmony among co-workers; (2) need for confidentiality; (3) employee\u2019s position may be such that his false accusations may be hard to counter because of the employee\u2019s presumed greater access to the real facts; (4) statements which impede the employee\u2019s proper performance of his daily duties; (5) statements so without foundation as to call into question his competency to perform the job; and (6) a close and personal working relationship between the employee and supervisor which called for personal loyalty and confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Defendants argue that plaintiff\u2019s accusations were so extensive and so critical that they impeded the performance of his duties, namely, to address \u201cprofessional and lay groups to promote understanding of problems and obligations concerning patients\u201d and \u201cinterpret the institution\u2019s problems and policies to the public.\u201d However, we do not find that this was such a critical responsibility of a Chaplain as to give the State a strong enough interest to interfere with the plaintiff\u2019s free speech rights. This is especially so since plaintiff was not even evaluated on this function until May 13, 1969, and then he was rated \u201cgood.\u201d Further, defendants were not able to prove that the plaintiff\u2019s vociferousness hindered him in the performance of his religious and spiritual duties toward the patients at Manteno.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">It could be argued that plaintiff\u2019s exaggerated comments, because he is a priest, were given greater credence by the general public than would those of a non-clerical employee. This may be true, but defendants have not shown that they were hindered in any way in responding to the accusations of plaintiff; in fact, at several points they specifically chose not to respond. Also, if plaintiff\u2019s criticisms were so clearly false, as defendants would have us believe, we do not see how his being a priest, were given greater credence by being refuted by open and free public debate and discussion. Indeed, that is what freedom of speech is all about.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">In sum, we have considered the countervailing factors mentioned in <em>Pickering </em>and find them inapplicable here. We conclude and hold in the case at bar that the interest of society in \u201cuninhibited and robust debate\u201d on matters of public concern, such as mental health care, and plaintiff\u2019s individual interest in being free to speak out on matters of concern to him, outweigh those of the State as an employer. This is a proper guarantee of \u201cthe public\u2019s right to know.\u201d It follows that the actions of defendants, as agents of the State, in dismissing plaintiff, violated his First and Fourteenth Amendments rights to free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">Having found that defendants violated plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>our next concern is whether the relief afforded in the judgment below was proper. Defendants first argue that because the district court found that they \u201cwere acting within their authority and capacity as officials and agents of the State of Illinois,\u201d they were entitled to an immunity from any and all damages resulting from their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In McLaughlin v. Tilendis, 7 Cir., 398 F.2d 287 (1968), where the defendant had claimed protection from damages in a section 1983 action under the Illinois Tort Immunity Act (Ill.Rev.Stats.1967, ch. 85, \u00a7 2-201), we held: \u201cUnder the Supremacy Clause, that statute cannot protect defendants against a cause of action grounded, as here, on a federal statute. * * * However, other officials [than legislators and judges], such as present defendants, retain only a qualified immunity, dependent on good faith action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In this regard, defendants claim that since the court below did not specifically find that they acted in bad faith, they are entitled to immunity from all damages. However, it is a necessary implication of the court\u2019s decision and judgment against the defendants that they acted without justification in the case at bar. \u201cAt best, defendants\u2019 qualified immunity in this case means that they can prevail only if they show that plaintiffs were discharged on justifiable grounds. Thus, here a successful defense on the merits merges with a successful defense under the qualified immunity doctrine.\u201d <em>McLaughlin </em>at 290-291.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Defendants claim that the damage award of $2,750 ($2,000 punitive damages and $750 attorney fees) was improper because it was against defendants <em>and/or their successors. </em>This is inaccurate and ignores the fact that the district court by order of January 7, 1971, deleted the words \u201cand/or their successors\u201d from the monetary award for punitive damages and attorney fees. However, we find that the award of out-of-pocket expenses inadvertently still includes the words \u201cand/or their successors.\u201d Since defendants\u2019 successors were not parties to this law suit, the judgment to that extent must be and is ordered modified by deleting the words \u201cand/or their successors\u201d from the award of out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Defendants question the award of <em>punitive </em>damages. Their concern is without foundation. Since we have found that defendants acted in bad faith, the award of punitive damages was within the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">Although the defendants have not raised the question, we feel that, in the interest of justice, we should inquire into the propriety of awarding attorney fees in this case. Section 1983 does not by its terms expressly authorize or deny the allowance of attorney fees. \u201cThere is ample authority * * * to support the proposition that the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses of preparation for trial is in the discretion of the district court <em>sitting in equity </em>where exceptional circumstances call for their allowance in order to do justice between the parties * * *.\u201d Lee v. Southern Home Sites Corporation, 5 Cir., 429 F.2d 290, at 295 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">In <em>Lee, </em>where the trial court had denied attorney fees, the court found, at 296: \u201cClearly, for this court to overturn a denial of attorneys\u2019 fees, it must appear that the trial court abused its discretion, but it is impossible to review the soundness of such an exercise of discretion unless the trial court indicates in its findings of fact the grounds upon which it exercised its discretion * \u2022&gt;:\u2022_\u201d Similarly, in the case at bar, there are no grounds given for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>award of attorney fees by which we can judge the soundness of the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Nevertheless, we need not remand for further findings in this ease because the reasons for the award of attorney fees appear from the face of the record. The benefit to the general public, <em>i. e., </em>of encouraging free and robust public discussion, is substantial in this case and should not depend for its protection upon the financial status of the individual who is deprived of his constitutional rights. Hence, the relative financial positions of the parties at the time of the constitutional violation, which in the ease at bar weighs in favor of allowing attorney fees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is relevant. There is also some evidence that the result of plaintiff\u2019s dismissal had a chilling effect upon public discussion of mental health care by employees at Manteno. And finally, although defendants\u2019 actions were not found to be egregious, they were consciously taken to stifle plaintiff\u2019s public criticism. Although we consider the better practice to be for a trial judge to state his grounds for an award of attorney fees, we hold the evidence weighs in favor of an award here and in doing so that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"> We have reviewed all other objections to the relief afforded in this case and find them unpersuasive. If more should be said, we need only to quote from the oft-cited case of Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, at 684, 66 S.Ct. 773, at 777, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). \u201cMoreover, where federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief. And it is also well settled that where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">Affirmed as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">. On. September 9, 1966, the Governor of Illinois called for an investigation by the Board of Mental Health Commissioners into the public criticism of the Manteno State Hospital. The main impetus for this investigation seems to have come from picketing by off-duty hospital employees who publicly expressed concern over the moral climate at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The Board issued a report to the Governor on October 20, 1966, and found that sexual behavior of all types would undoubtedly be less if there was a more adequate staff to supervise the patients under the more permissive policies. However, the Board felt that sexual morality was not the basic issue but rather that Manteno was in transition and operating a gigantic institution on a skimpy budget which was designed before most of the new programs began.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">This report in many respects is consistent with the concerns expressed by plaintiff in his public statements, although the report was critical of public criticism itself. In the newspaper report of plaintiff\u2019s public speech it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">\u201cThe new programs introduced by the Illinois Department of Mental Health are fine but it\u2019s like buying an expensive car when you can only afford a wheelbarrow. The programs need workers and the patients need constant examination, weeks and weeks of intensive treatment and constant care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">\u201cBut he added, because there are insufficient employes and because \u2018many employes are unqualified\u2019 to carry out such programs, the result has been unsupervised wards, inadequate care, and illicit sexual activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">. There is credible evidence, in the form of a memorandum from John P. Dailey, Special Assistant to the Governor, to defendant Briggs approving his decision to discharge plaintiff and cautioning him to do it properly because of the inevitable protest from certain sectors, to support the court\u2019s conclusion that defendant Briggs was also a party to the discharge of plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\">. The district court specifically stated: \u201cI have no quarrel with your [defendants\u2019] right to discharge noncivil service employees peremptorily providing that their federal civil rights and constitutional rights have not been violated. I have no quarrel with that being the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\">. <em>See also </em>Simcox v. Board of Ed. of Lockport Tp., etc., Will County, Ill., 7 Cir., 443 F.2d 40, at 42 (1971), where we reiterated the established rule: \u201cAny immunity which public officials enjoy in defiling; with (heir employees is limited by the requirement that their actions <em>vis-\u00e1ris </em>such employees be taken in good faith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b545-6\">. Although there is some indication in the record that plaintiff is on leave from his Order as a priest and is working for compensation with a labor organization, this is irrelevant since the critical time is the time of the constitutional deprivation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b545-15\">SWYGERT, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AR9\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">Despite the defendants' arguments, I agree with the court that the plaintiff\u2019s connection with the Manteno State Hospital was tantamount to an employment relationship. Thus, as indicated by Judge Hastings, the crucial question is whether the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right of freedom of speech was infringed by reason of his termination as chaplain of the hospital. In my judgment the circumstances leading to plaintiff\u2019s discharge legally justified that action and therefore it was error to afford relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">The premise that public employment may be conditioned upon a surrender of constitutional rights was flatly rejected in Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 605-606, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1966); however, the first amendment rights of public employees are not absolute and must yield to accommodation when overriding interests of public policy are at stake. United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 95, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1946). The court concedes as much when it acknowledges that there can be circumstances when a public employee may be discharged for his utterances.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">Pickering v. Board of Education etc., 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), does not wipe out all curtailment of a public employee\u2019s right to speak. \u201c[I]t cannot be gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.\u201d 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. at 1734. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The Court went on to explain that a balance of competing interests must be struck. \u201cThe problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the . . . [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 88 S.Ct. at 1734.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">I read <em>Pickering </em>to hold that if the functions of a public entity are substantially impeded by an employee\u2019s statements relating to those functions, measures may be taken to regulate such speech even to the point of terminating employment. If that reading is correct, then the following view expressed by the Eighth Circuit in Jenson v. Olson, 353 F.2d 825 (8th Cir. 1965), even though predating <em>Pickering, </em>has continuing vitality: \u201cWhen his . . . [the employee\u2019s] speech is disruptive of the proper functioning of the public\u2019s business the privilege of governmental employment may be withdrawn without it being said that he was denied his freedom of speech. To hold otherwise would enable governmental employees to practice the rankest form of insubordination and safely hide behind the right of free speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">As shown by the majority opinion the plaintiff initially began criticizing the hospital\u2019s operation in 1966. Because of plaintiff\u2019s and others criticism, the then Governor of the State of Illinois requested the Board of Mental Health Commissioners to investigate charges of immorality at the Manteno State Hospital. Five Illinois citizens, including two members of the Chicago Bar, composed the Board. After conducting several days of hearings and interviewing nearly thirty witnesses, the Board issued a lengthy report which included a number of findings and a variety of recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The report pointed out that the hospital housed over six thousand patients and had in excess of eighteen hundred employees. The Board then referred to the fact that, in line with modern mental health concepts, the old custodial approach \u201cwhich resulted in the bitterly criticized warehousing of our mentally ill\u201d was being replaced by newer methods so as to permit the institution to be administered as an \u201copen institution.\u201d It was acknowledged that this change had generated a number of administrative problems. The Board then addressed itself to the specific accusation of immorality within the institution. The substance of the report is that the hospital had been doing all it could do to curb \u201cacting-out\u201d sexual behavior among the patients, given the fact that there was a lack of adequate security and supervisory personnel. The Board specifically found the charge untrue that birth control pills were being purchased and indiscriminately dispensed. It concluded that sexual immorality was not the basic problem and that many of the other problems besetting the hospital were due to the changes then in progress as well as a \u201cskimpy\u201d budget and a \u201cburgeoning\u201d admission load. Among other recommendations, the Board urged that the \u201copen door\u201d policy continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">In the course of its discussion, the Board stressed the fact that the promulgation of exaggerated and in some instances unfounded accusations were harmful to patients and their families and discouraged administrators \u201cwho are trying their best to bring about changes against considerable odds.\u201d Regarding these accusations, the Board observed, \u201cEstimates are that it will take a year to repair the damage done to the patients and their relatives, and to restore their pride and that of the employees.\u201d The Board added, \u201cThese remarks are not a plea to stifle criticism \u2022 \u2014 in a community of 8,000 people related to a giant mental health institution as patient, employee or executive, there will always be a broad range of matters to criticize. . . . It is always a satisfying demonstration of public conscience when there is discussion and concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>about programs. But this is only true when responsible and valid criticism with supporting facts is so directed in such a way as to be constructive and to preserve the goals of the institution.\u201d The Board\u2019s report was issued in October 1966. Following its issuance, the plaintiff ceased critizing the hospital for approximately three years; however, in the latter part of 1969 he resumed his attacks. As the majority opinion indicates, these attacks took the form of a speech reported in the <em>Kankakee Daily Journal, </em>a letter to the editor printed in the same newspaper, an appearance on a television program, and an advertisement prepared and paid for by the plaintiff which appeared in the <em>Journal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">Most of the accusations leveled at the hospital\u2019s administration were nothing short of sensational. The newspaper account of his speech reported the plaintiff as having said that \u201chomieidals, suicid\u00e1is, arsonists and molesters were being released into the streets of Kankakee, Bradley, Manteno\u201d and other communities; also that because of unqualified employees there were \u201cunsupervised wards, inadequate care, and illicit sexual activity.\u201d During the television program the plaintiff charged that many of the patients had died of dehydration because they could not get to a drinking fountain. The most scathing criticism was contained in the advertisement which the plaintiff authored.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Shortly after the appearance of the advertisement the hospital terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment. The termination notice contained the reason given by the hospital for its action: \u201cFor cause, to wit: In the best interest of the patients and staff at Manteno State Hospital, the Chicago Area Zone Director, Patrick Staunton, M.D., and Manteno State Hospital Superintendent, H. C. Piepenbrink, have decided on this action. This priest has consistently, and without checking validity of criticism, made public charges against the treatment programs of this facility which have little basis in fact and which are detrimental to the care and treatment of the patients and can no longer be tolerated by the management of one of its employees.\u201d This reason, namely, that plaintiff\u2019s accusations had a detrimental effect on the hospital\u2019s programs for the treatment and care of its patients is corroborated by two contemporaneous documents : one, a report made by the head of the Mental Health Department,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the other, a memorandum signed by the director of the hospital\u2019s Administrative Services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Although the state has the burden of demonstrating that its governmental functions have been impaired by the public utterances of an employee, that burden was met in this case. It is not difficult to envision the harmful and disruptive effect that plaintiff\u2019s accusations had on the patients and their families, the hospital employees and the operation of the hospital generally. His earlier criticism in 1966, the resulting investigation, and the report of the Board of Commissioners must be considered in assessing the position taken by the hospital in 1969. The belief entertained by the institution's authorities that the health and well-being of the patients had been endangered was reasonable under the circumstances. Significantly, the plaintiff offered no evidence to refute the conclusions stated in the termination notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Moreover, the hospital\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff had been irresponsible in voicing his criticisms is substantiated by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony at trial. The heading of the advertisement contained the statement, \u201cMissing; Psychiatrists and Licensed Physicians; who should know what is best for Mentally Ill.\u201d On cross-examination the plaintiff admitted that there \u201cmay have been a few\u201d psychiatrists \u2022 and licensed physicians at the hospital. In reference to his charge that many patients had died of dehydration because they were unable to get to a drinking fountain, the plaintiff admitted that during his employment he received hospital records in regard to \u201cvarious deaths and so-called causes,\u201d and that none of the reports indicated that dehydration had been caused in the manner he had stated during the television broadcast. As a further indication of plaintiff\u2019s irresponsibility in making his accusations, a <em>Kankakee Daily Journal </em>reporter accompanied the plaintiff prior to his dismissal on an inspection tour of wards at Manteno. The newspaper later carried a story that its reporter could find no evidence of the conditions the plaintiff had described.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The task of balancing the conflicting interests outlined in Pickering v. Board of Education etc. is admittedly a difficult one. It requires a careful examination of every facet of the situation in question lest a vital constitutional right be inadequately protected. Such an examination of the facts in this case persuades me that the disruptive effects of plaintiff\u2019s actions on the proper func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>tioning of the Manteno State Hospital which lead to his dismissal were substantial and that the interests of the state outweighed the right of the plaintiff to speak as he did. I would hold that defendants had justifiable reasons for terminating the plaintiff\u2019s employment and that there was no violation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">APPENDIX I TO OPINION OF SWYGERT, CHIEF JUDGE, DISSENTING</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Manteno State Hospital Department of Mental Health</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">REPORT OF SEPARATION</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Name of Employee Joseph Donahue in the Program Support-Chaplaincy (Department or Program)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Nature of the Departure Termination (Resignation, Leave of Absence, Transfer, Termination, Discharge, Prob.

Since the last rating, Father Donahue assumed an opposite position of that of the Department, and in so doing, endeavored to force his opinions and views above that of the Department and after repeated consultations with his Supervisor, the Superintendent and Zone Director, he was unable to support the Department; as a result he was terminated. He was unable to accept the policies established by the Department of Mental Health, and the end result was that he could not interpret them but instead rebutted them, which made him incompatable as a loyal employee of the Department of Mental Health. The position that he assumed in relationship to that of the Department consumed a great deal of his time and as a result, he was unable to complete the work and duties which normally are functions of the Catholic Chaplain. His opposition was so strong that .he had difficulty in cooperating with other faiths, even to the extent of being able to maintain rapport between himself and his assistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">18. Father Donahue\u2019s initiative in carrying out the duties of the Catholic Chaplains\u2019 Office and his dependability in working with the Hospital and its Programs were in exact opposition. Little support, if any, was granted by him, but an undue amount of criticism and opposition were used in an attempt to defeat the policies which were believed to be in the best interests of the residents. His judgment in relation to the Programs at the Hospital and the position which he occupied, left a great deal to be desired and his ability to communicate instructions almost became nonexistent. His inability to work with and cooperate with his assistant were indicative of his inability to adequately supervise and develope his subordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">APPENDIX II TO OPINION OF SWYGERT, CHIEF JUDGE, DISSENTING</p>\n<p id=\"b549-19\">11-3-69 cc: Dr. Staunton Manteno State Hospital</p>\n<p id=\"AyQ\">MEMO</p>\n<p id=\"b549-21\">Date November 3, 1969</p>\n<p id=\"b549-22\">In Re: .............</p>\n<p id=\"b549-23\">To Mr. Piepenbrink, Superintendent From Mr. Wagner \u2014 Geriatric Program</p>\n<p id=\"AQ9\">Discussions with several Geriatric Program employees have made me aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>that some individuals in the community who might consider employment at the hospital are hesitating to do so due to Father Donahue\u2019s recent \u201calarming\u201d statements. At a time when the labor market is tight and finding suitable replacements is extremely difficult, it is indeed confusing that Father Donahue would undertake a vilification of the hospital on matters that have already been proven to be either exaggerations or falsehoods. Cannot someone assist Father Donahue in redefining his complaints so that they can be stated more constructively? Alarming potential employees will not assist the hospital in meeting current challenges and providing the best possible care to our patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">RAW :mbp cc: Mr. Steinmetz Mr. Simmons</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Signature /s/ Robert A.
