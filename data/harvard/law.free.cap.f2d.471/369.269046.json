Lindberg, United States Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-15\">CHOY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">Weyerhaeuser Company (Weyerhaeuser) appeals from a judgment of the district court, holding the appellant liable to indemnify A/S Atl\u00e1ntica &amp; Tinfos Papirfabrik (Atl\u00e1ntica) for damages awarded by a jury to Jesse Stranahan, a Weyerhaeuser employee, for injuries he sustained during loading operations aboard Atlantica\u2019s vessel, the Hoegh Mallard. Atl\u00e1ntica cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s holding that W. J. Jones &amp; Son, Inc. (Jones), the stevedore company loading Weyerhaeuser\u2019s cargo, is not obligated to indemnify Atl\u00e1ntica. We reverse on both the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">Pursuant to a charter party agreement between Weyerhaeuser and Atl\u00e1ntica, the Hoegh Mallard tied up at Weyerhaeuser\u2019s dock in Coos Bay, Oregon to take on a load of lumber products. On June 28, 1969, about 6:00 p. m., the night officer of the ship switched on large spotlights located on the masts, two for each hold. In addition, he placed four portable, stand-up light units at each hold, for the longshoremen to position on whatever part of the hold was being worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">Weyerhaeuser\u2019s employee, Stranahan, was working alongside Jones\u2019 longshoremen in hatch #2 that night. When the crew in #2 hatch took a coffee break about 1:00 a. m., the wings of the hold had been partially filled with four-foot bundles of lumber stacked two high, leaving space for a man to walk on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>top of the stacks. The square of the hatch<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was still unloaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">At about 1:25 a. m. the crew returned from their coffee break, entering the hold single-file, since only one man at a time could go down the ladder. Stranahan walked across the lumber stacks, looking for a way to get down to his work area in the square of the hatch. He got to the edge of a stack, peered over and saw what appeared to be a ledge between the top lumber bundle and the bottom one. In fact, this was a false image created by shadows from the cross-paths of light coming from several light sources around the hatch. Stranahan stepped on the false ledge and tumbled to the floor of the hatch, breaking his hip.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">He sued Atl\u00e1ntica for maintaining an unseaworthy vessel and won a jury award of $71,748.50, plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees. Atl\u00e1ntica then filed a third-party complaint against Weyerhaeuser and Jones, contending that either or both were liable in indemnity for Stranahan\u2019s injuries. In a pre-trial order, the parties stipulated that the vessel\u2019s unseaworthiness was due to inadequate lighting, and that Atl\u00e1ntica was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The district judge found that Stranahan\u2019s injury was proximately caused by Weyerhaeuser\u2019s negligence in failing to provide a safe working place for its employee and that Jones was not negligent and did not breach its warranty of workmanlike service. Therefore, the judge granted indemnity to Atl\u00e1ntica from Weyerhaeuser and dismissed the action against Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">Weyerhaeuser challenges the district judge\u2019s finding that it was negligent. Weyerhaeuser and Atl\u00e1ntica both challenge the finding that Jones was neither negligent nor in breach of its warranty of workmanlike service. I. <em>Scope of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">Jones contends that the findings that Weyerhaeuser was negligent and Jones was not are factual determinations which we must presume to be correct, unless \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On the other hand, Weyerhaeuser and Atl\u00e1ntica contend that the question is whether the correct legal principles were applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">What happened at the accident is not disputed. Nor could these facts be challenged on this appeal, for Atl\u00e1ntica chose not to appeal the Stranahan jury\u2019s finding that the vessel was unseaworthy. Moreover, the parties all stipulated in the pretrial order for this in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>demnity action, that the vessel\u2019s unseaworthiness was due to inadequate lighting and that Atl\u00e1ntica was not negligent. These facts could not be contested in the district court, nor can they now be contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The facts show that the working place was unsafe, not only for Stranahan, but also for the longshoremen. He fell while walking across the top of a cargo stack where longshoremen worked. He was returning from a coffee break, as were the longshore hatch crew. They all came back into the hold and walked single file across the cargo stacks. Stranahan was preceded by John Messman, a winchdriver whose job duties included a specific authority over safety conditions. Messman vaulted past the same spot from which Stranahan fell. Another longshoreman, Delbert Sutphin, was following Stranahan and he intended to follow Stranahan\u2019s footsteps until he saw the latter fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The real issue is one of law: Whose duty was it to ensure that lighting was adequate to make working conditions safe?</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">II. <em>The Duty to Insure That Lighting Was Adequate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Under the Safety and Health Regulations for Longshoring, both Weyerhaeuser and Jones are employers,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whose responsibility for safe working conditions is defined as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cAll walking and working areas shall be adequately illuminated.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe responsibility for compliance with the regulations of this part is placed upon \u2018employers\u2019 . . . \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">In other words, Weyerhaeuser and Jones shared the responsibility of seeing that hatch #2 of the Hoegh Mallard was properly lighted.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Atl\u00e1ntica contends that Weyerhaeuser failed to comply with the regulation and was thus negligent <em>per se. </em>Grigsby v. Coastal Marine Service, 412 F.2d 1011 (5th Cir. 1969). We do not favor such a mechanical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">It is not enough just to say, \u201cThe lighting was inadequate; therefore, the employer was negligent,\u201d at least where the responsibility for compliance is shared by two employers. If both were negligent, then they must share the burden of indemnifying the shipowner for the latter\u2019s liability in maintaining an unseaworthy vessel. This is subject to the conceptual limitations of the \u201cunseaworthiness\u201d doctrine, as recently set forth by the Supreme Court in Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., 400 U.S. 494, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">One employer may have acted reasonably within his power to insure compliance with a given regulation. If so, he may not be negligent. Still, he may have breached a warranty of workmanlike service. Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">If both employers acted reasonably to insure compliance, but the dangerous condition still existed, then liability may be based, not on negligence, but on the strict liability of the warranty of workmanlike service. <em>Ryan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-19\">Several factors must be taken into account, in determining whether an employer has complied with the regulations. How the parties define their relative obligations <em>in contractu </em>may shift or apportion the burden of compliance with the Health and Safety Regulations. Industry customs concerning who has operational control of loading may indicate that one party justifiably relied upon another to take the actual steps of making a working place safe for the workers on the pier and aboard ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\n<em>Weyerhaeuser\u2019s Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Atl\u00e1ntica based its claim to indemnity from Weyerhaeuser on both negligence and warranty of workmanlike service. Although the district judge did not rule on the latter issue, Atl\u00e1ntica persists in contending on appeal that Weyerhaeuser breached its warranty. We hold that, in the circumstances of this case, Weyerhaeuser was under no such warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Generally, a time-charterer like Weyerhaeuser is not charged with a warranty for workmanlike service. McNamara v. Weichsel, etc., 339 F.2d 475 (2d Cir. 1964); D/S Ove Skou v. Hebert, 365 F.2d 341 (5th Cir. 1966), cert. denied sub nom. Southern Stevedoring &amp; Contracting Co. v. D/S Ove Skou, 400 U.S. 902, 91 S.Ct. 139, 27 L.Ed.2d 139 (1970). However, such an obligation does arise when the time-charterer assumes operational control of loading his own cargo. Hartnett v. Reiss Steamship Co., 421 F.2d 1011 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied sub nom. Grain Handling Co. v. Hartnett, 400 U.S. 852, 91 S.Ct. 49, 27 L.Ed.2d 90 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In <em>Hartnett, </em>a mechanical device had been built on the time-charterer\u2019s pier to unload grain from the hold of any ship to a grain elevator. The whole unloading operation was directed by the time-charterer\u2019s employees, from the docking of the ship to the assigning of longshoremen to shovel the grain out of the corners of the hold for pickup by the device\u2019s buckets. The Second Circuit held that the time-charterer owed a warranty of workmanlike service because it had control of the operation and required the time-charterer to indemnify the ship-owner for a longshoreman\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Here, Jones, the stevedore company, had operational control of the loading. Stranahan was a cargo-checker, who did not handle ship or dockside gear. He simply counted. Seholze, Weyerhaeuser\u2019s only other employee aboard the ship was a \u201csuper-cargo,\u201d whose limited authority and duties hardly sufficed to substitute Weyerhaeuser as the party with operational control of the loading. Therefore, we hold that Weyerhaeuser did not owe a warranty of workmanlike service.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Neither was Weyerhaeuser negligent. Weyerhaeuser met its \u201cresponsibility for compliance\u201d under the Safety and Health Regulations as to adequate lighting by contracting for Atl\u00e1ntica and Jones to provide such lighting aboard ship and by relying on Jones, as the party with operational control, to handle the lights in a safe manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">The charter party between Weyerhaeuser and Atl\u00e1ntica provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201c. . . Owner is also to provide on the vessel sufficient lights for night work and to maintain same in efficient working order . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">Atl\u00e1ntica supplied two mast lights and four portable light units.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">Weyerhaeuser and Jones stipulated in their contract that if the lights furnished by the shipowner were inadequate in the opinion of Jones\u2019 employees, Jones was to obtain more lights and charge the cost to the shipowner. Jones did not get more lights. Weyerhaeuser justifiably relied on Jones for adequate lighting, not just because of contractual provisions but also because Jones had a clear operational control over the entire loading. The longshoremen working hatch #2 placed the lights that created a false shadow which deceived Stranahan when he stepped off the cargo stack.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">Atl\u00e1ntica and Jones argue that Weyerhaeuser was negligent because the latter\u2019s other employee on board, Seholze the \u201csupercargo,\u201d had duties which included inspection of Stranahan\u2019s working area. This inspection duty is not sufficient basis for a finding that Weyerhaeuser was negligent. The \u201csupercargo\u201d could merely suggest to the stevedore\u2019s walking boss or hatch boss that something might not be safe. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>decision whether to alter some condition was usually made by the latter, not by the supercargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The supercargo\u2019s failure to discover a condition which all witnesses agreed was not obvious did not constitute negligence on the part of Weyerhaeuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\n<em>Jones\u2019 Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">For much of the same reasons, we cannot hold that Jones was negligent because none of its employees perceived the false shadow in #2 hatch. However, we do find that the existence of the condition was a breach of Jones\u2019 warranty of workmanlike service.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The warranty is breached when a condition is dangerous and was created by the actions of the stevedore\u2019s employees. <em>Ryan, supra. </em>Both elements exist here. Jones\u2019 longshoremen positioned the portable light units so that the cross-paths of light created a false shadow that appeared to Stranahan to be a ledge which would bear his weight. That the condition was dangerous is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The benefit of protection under the warranty extended not only to the stevedore\u2019s own employees, but also to the employees of a third party. In Sanderlin v. Old Dominion Stevedoring Co., 385 F.2d 79 (4th Cir. 1967), a cargo checker who was injured by the acts of a longshoreman recovered against the stevedore company under the warranty of workmanlike conduct. There, the cargo checker was employed by the shipowner; here, Stranahan worked for the time-charterer. If anything, Stranahan\u2019s right to recover was stronger for the warranty arose, at least in part, out of the contract between Jones and Stranahan\u2019s employer, Weyerhaeuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">III. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Weyerhaeuser was not at fault for this accident. Atl\u00e1ntica is entitled to full indemnity from Jones, for breach of warranty of workmanlike service.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">. The \u201csquare of the hatch\u201d is that area of the hold which is directly under the hatch opening of the deck above; i. e., it is a square within the larger square of the entire hold.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\">.

SS Grand Grace, 369 F.2d 159 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">This circuit has adopted a limited scope of review when parties attack a finding of negligence in an admiralty action. In Pacific Tow Boat Co. v. States Marine Corp. of Delaware, 276 F.2d 745 (9th Cir. 1960), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABK\">\u201cSince . . . [McAllister v.

The fixing of that standard is a jural act. To this extent a question of law is involved, and hence a conclusion of law is required, in any determination as to negligence. Nothing said in McAllister or in any of our previous decisions was intended to limit the scope of review in so far as the fixing of the applicable standard of conduct is concerned.\u201d 276 F.2d at 752.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-21\">Compare: Romero v.
