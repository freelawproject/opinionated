Skelton of the U.S. Court of Claims, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b773-13\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">Kinnard Copeland, ably represented by court-appointed counsel, appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for habeas corpus. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">In 1951 Copeland was tried in Harris County, Texas, for burglary. He was convicted by a jury, and after the trial Copeland\u2019s retained counsel withdrew because Copeland did not have the funds to pay him to prosecute an appeal. His conviction was subsequently affirmed, per curiam, by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. He was not represented by counsel on appeal, and the record of his trial was not before that court. The question is whether Copeland was denied his right of counsel on appeal due to his status of an indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">In Pate v. Holman, 341 F.2d 764, 773 (5th Cir., 1965), modified on other grounds 343 F.2d 546, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-17\">\u201c[W]hen a defendant has retained counsel of his own choosing the State cannot be held to have violated the constitutional right of an indigent to counsel on appeal, unless the need for appellate counsel is brought home to the State, either by defendant\u2019s request for appellate counsel or because a responsible State official has actual knowledge that the defendant is indigent and desires to appeal his conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-18\">The district court found that neither the state trial court, the district attorney\u2019s office, nor the Court of Criminal Appeals had knowledge of Copeland\u2019s indigency.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-19\">The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-12\">. <em>See </em>Farris v. Beto, 446 F.2d 1290 (5th Cir., 1971) ; Beto v. Martin, 396 F.2d 432 (5th Cir., 1968) ; Worts v. Dutton, 395 F.2d 341 (5th Cir., 1968) ; Pate v. Holman, <em>supra; accord </em>United States ex rel.

The district court also properly denied relief on this basis. Jiles v. Beto, 422 F.2d 529 (5th Cir., 1971) ; Lamb v. Beto, 423 F.2d 85 (5th Cir., 1970), cert. den. 400 U.S. 846, 91 S.Ct. 93, 27 L.Ed.2d 84.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
