The covering security agreement specifically pledged items (including a truck) described in its Schedule A and generally pledged other items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>through an \u201comnibus clause\u201d set out in the margin below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The omnibus clause gave the appellant a valid secured interest in accounts receivable, inventory, fixtures, machinery, equipment, and tools of the bankrupt. The question here is whether Commercial\u2019s secured interest in \u201cequipment\u201d gave it a lien on two Oldsmobile automobiles owned by the bankrupt. We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">The appellant relies upon the broad language of New York Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-109(2) (McKinney 1964) (hereinafter cited as \u201cU.C.C.\u201d) to show that the \u201cequipment\u201d term of the omnibus clause included the two automobiles. Section 9-109(2) defines \u201cequipment\u201d for present purposes as a residual category which includes all goods not included in the definitions of inventory, farm products or consumer goods. Thus automobiles would fall within this broad category if the definition of Section 9-109 governed for purposes of the security agreement. The classifications of Section 9-109, however, are intended primarily for the purposes of determining which set of filing requirements is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\"> We look rather to U.C.C. \u00a7 9-110 which requires that the description of personal property \u201creasonably identif[y]\u201d what is described. The conclusion that greater specificity is required finds additional support in U.C.C. \u00a7 9-203(1) (b), which provides that the security agreement must contain a \u201cdescription\u201d of the collateral. Certainly the word \u201cequipment\u201d does not constitute a \u201cdescription\u201d of the Oldsmobiles. Unlike a financing statement (U.C.C. \u00a7 9-402) which is designed merely to put creditors on notice that further inquiry is prudent, <em>see </em>In re Leichter, 471 F.2d 785 (2d Cir. 1972), the security agreement embodies the intentions of the parties. It is the primary source to which a creditor\u2019s or potential creditor\u2019s inquiry is directed and must be reasonably specific. <em>See </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 9-203, Practice Commentary 1 at 394; P. Coogan, W. Hogan &amp; D. Vagts, Secured Transactions Under the Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 4.06, at 289-90 (Bender\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code Service Vol. 1, 1968). <em>Cf. </em>In re Weiner\u2019s Men\u2019s Apparel, 2 Bankr.L.Rep. (4th ed.) \u00b663,727 (S.D.N.Y.1970); Mammoth Cave Production Credit Association v. York, 429 S.W.2d 26, 28-29 (Ky.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-11\">What would a potential creditor find upon examination of the security agreement in this case? The only mention of vehicles of any kind in the agreement is the listing of an International truck in Schedule A. Beyond that there is only the \u201comnibus clause\u201d and the generic \u201cequipment\u201d therein. Any examining creditor would conclude that the truck as the only vehicle mentioned was the only one intended to be covered. We thus need not reach the contention that a prior invalid lien on one of the automobiles inured to the benefit of the trustee for benefit of the estate and as such is superior to the lien of Commercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-12\">For the reasons stated above we affirm the decision of the court below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">. In addition to all the above enumerated items, it is the intention that this mortgage shall cover all chattels, machinery, equipment, tables, chairs, work benches, factory chairs, stools, shelving, cabinets, power lines, switch boxes, control panels, machine parts, motors, pumps, electrical equipment, measuring and calibrating instruments, office supplies, sundries, office furniture, fixtures, and all other items of equipment and fixtures belonging to the mortgagor, whether herein enumerated or not, now at the plant of Laminated Veneers Co., Inc. located at 115-02 15th Ave. College Point, New York, and all chattels, machinery, fixtures, or equipment that may hereafter be brought in or installed in said premises or any new premises of the mortgagor, to replace, substitute for, or in addition to the above mentioned chattels and equipment with the exception of stock in trade.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1187-13\">LUMBARD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AeG\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-14\">The majority correctly states the question here as \u201cwhether Commercial\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>secured interest in \u2018equipment\u2019 gave it a lien on two Oldsmobile automobiles owned by the bankrupt.\u201d Essentially, this question resolves itself into two very distinct issues: 1) was it the intent of the parties, as expressed in the security agreement, that Commercial could look to these Oldsmobiles as collateral for its loan to the bankrupt; 2) if such was the expressed intent, is the term, \u201cequipment,\u201d a sufficient description of the collateral under \u00a7\u00a7 9-110 and 9-203 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code to create a valid security interest in this collateral? The majority appears to answer both of these questions in the negative, as did the referee and the district judge. From this holding, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">Initially, I would hold the referee\u2019s and the district judge\u2019s finding that the parties did not intend the security interest to extend to the two automobiles in issue to be clearly erroneous. It seems to me that the very breadth of the omnibus clause of the security agreement is indicative of an intent to cover all personal property owned by the bankrupt, with the exception of stock in trade. The trustee presented no evidence to indicate that this omnibus clause was not intended to mean exactly what it says. Therefore, I feel that the question of intent should have been resolved in appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">There is no argument that the Oldsmobiles would not be included under the Uniform Commercial Code\u2019s definition of \u201cequipment\u201d in \u00a7 9-109 (2) .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question is whether the use of such a generic term is a sufficient \u201cdescription of the collateral\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 9-203(1)(b). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The cross reference for this description requirement is to \u00a7 9-110, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-10\">For purposes of this Article any description of personal property . is sufficient whether or not it is specific if it reasonably identifies what is described.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1188-11\">The official comments to \u00a7 9-110 elaborate on the nature of the description requirement :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-12\">The requirement of description of collateral (see Section 9-203 and Comment thereto) is evidentiary. The test of sufficiency of a description laid down by this Section is that the description do the job assigned to it \u2014that it make possible the identification of the thing described. Under this rule courts should refuse to follow the holdings, often found in the older chattel mortgage cases, that descriptions are insufficient unless they are the most exact and detailed na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>ture, the so-called \u201cserial number\u201d test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">The precise issue here seems to have been considered only once before. In Goodall Rubber Co. v. News Ready Mix Corp., 7 U.C.C. 1358 (Wisc.Circ.Ct., 1970), the court held that this generic term was sufficient to satisfy \u00a7\u00a7 9-110 and 9-203. In addition, there have been a number of cases, that have considered, in the context of both security agreements and financing statements, the sufficiency of descriptions phrased in other generic terms. The decisions have not been uniform. <em>Compare </em>In Re Trumble, 5 U.C.C. 543 (U.S.D.C., W.D., Mich., 1968) (\u201cconsumer goods\u201d held to be sufficient), Thomson v. O. M. Scott Credit Corp., 1 U.C.C. 555 (Pa.Ct. of Common Pleas, 1962) (\u201cinventory\u201d sufficient), In Re Goodfriend, 2 U.C.C. 160 (U.S.D.C., E.D., Pa., 1964) (\u201cinventory\u201d sufficient), and Security Tire and Rubber Co., Inc. v. Hlass, 441 S.W.2d 91 (Ark.S.Ct., 1969) (\u201cinventory\u201d sufficient) with In Re Bell, 6 U.C.C. 740 (U.S.D.C., Colo., 1969) (\u201cconsumer goods\u201d insufficient), Household Finance Corp. v. Kopel, 303 F.Supp. 317 (U.S.D.C., Colo., 1969) (\u201cconsumer goods\u201d insufficient), and Mammoth Cave Production Credit Association v. York, 429 S.W.2d 26 (Ky.Ct. of App., 1968) (\u201cfarm equipment\u201d insufficient). The two Colorado cases holding \u201cconsumer goods\u201d to be insufficient were decided under the Colorado version of \u00a7 9-110, which in terms requires much more specificity in a description of consumer goods than does the New York version.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It appears that the majority of courts that have considered the sufficiency of descriptions stated in terms of \u00a7 9-109 definitions, when \u00a7 9-110 was phrased as it is in New York, have held such descriptions to have been sufficient. In this regard, it should be noted that borrowing by businesses in return for security interests in their \u201cinventory,\u201d another generic term defined in \u00a7 9-109, has become a common financing device under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">I do not mean to suggest that the court should hold that all descriptions in terms of \u201cequipment\u201d will necessarily satisfy \u00a7\u00a7 9-110 and 9-203. Arguably, any such <em>per se </em>rule would be inconsistent with the mandate of \u00a7 9-110 that the description \u201creasonably identif[y] what is described.\u201d This language, as well as the official comments, would seem to indicate a more <em>ad hoc, </em>factual analysis. In this case, we have two Oldsmobile automobiles that were owned by a corporation in the retail lumber business. The most logical conclusion for any reasonable subsequent lender was that these automobiles were being used by the corporation in its business and were thus equipment, with respect to which he was charged with notice of a prior security interest. At the very least, a subsequent lender should be put on inquiry by these circumstances and should seek to learn from the borrower and the prior lender the nature of the use of this property. Therefore, I would reverse the district court\u2019s holding that the description was insufficient under the Uniform Commercial Code, and I would hold that the description in terms of \u201cequipment\u201d was, on the facts of this case, sufficient to \u201creasonably identify\u201d the automobiles and to bring them under the security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-13\">The trustee\u2019s alternative argument, which was rejected by the referee and the district court, is based on the existence of an earlier security interest in one of the two automobiles. Because this interest was not perfected, it was avoided by the trustee under \u00a7 70(c) of the Bankruptcy Act and \u00a7 9-312(5) (b) of the Uniform Commercial Code. Accordingly, the trustee now argues that this security interest should be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>served for the benefit of the estate and asserted to defeat Commercial\u2019s interest. Without reaching the propriety of subrogation in this case, it seems clear that the trustee\u2019s argument is frivolous. Since the earlier interest was unperfected, Commercial is just as able to avoid it under \u00a7 9-312(5) (b) as was the trustee. Therefore, subrogation to the earlier interest does not increase the trustee\u2019s rights against Commercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">. Goods are ... (2) \u201cequipment\u201d if they are used or bought for use primarily in business (including farming or a profession) or by a debtor who is a nonprofit organization or a governmental subdivision or agency or if the goods are not included in the definitions of inventory, farm products or consumer goods ....</p>\n<p id=\"AUK\">From this quotation, it is apparent that the majority is not entirely correct when it states that \u201c[s]ection 9-109(2) defines \u2018equipment\u2019 for present purposes as a residual category which includes all goods not included in the definitions of inventory, farm products or consumer goods.\u201d ,Such a statement ignores the standards enunciated in the first half of the definition for determining when goods are \u201cequipment.\u201d Similarly incorrect is the majority\u2019s unsupported statement that \u201c[t]he classifications of Section 9-109 . . . are intended primarily for the purposes of determining which set of filing requirements is proper.\u201d The official comments to \u00a7 9-109 state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-14\">The classification is important in many situations: it is relevant, for example, in determining the rights of persons who buy from a debtor goods subject to a security interest (Section 9-307), in certain questions of priority (Section 9-312), in determining the place of filing (Section 9-401) and in working out rights after default (Part 5).
