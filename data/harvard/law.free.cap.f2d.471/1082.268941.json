SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AkO\">This appeal from a jury conviction of federal narcotics offenses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> raises questions under the Fourth Amendment, as difficult as they are important, concerning the permissible scope of a search of the person incident to a lawful arrest for violation of a District of Columbia motor vehicle regulation. The ease was heard initially by a division of this court which reversed the conviction, one judge dissenting, on the ground that the search of appellant\u2019s person violated the commands of the Fourth Amendment. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>however, the court vacated the opinion and judgment of the division and held that since the taking of evidence in the District Court had not focused upon the scope issue relied upon by the division, a remand was necessary in order that \u201can authentic version of what actually happened\u201d might be presented.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This supplemental evidentiary hearing having now been completed, we find the search of appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>lant to be unconstitutional and therefore reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">On April 19, 1968, Officer Richard Jenks of the Metropolitan Police Department stopped a 1965 Cadillac at the intersection of Ninth and U Streets, N.W., for a \u201croutine spot check.\u201d At the time of this stop, Officer Jenks examined not only appellant\u2019s temporary operator\u2019s permit and automobile registration card, but also his selective service classification card. Officer Jenks permitted appellant to continue about his business, but only after making notes of the three items. His note taking alerted him to a discrepancy between the \u201c1938\u201d date of birth listed on the temporary operator\u2019s permit and the \u201c1927\u201d date of birth listed on the selective service classification card. Officer Jenks then went to police traffic records and discovered that the operator\u2019s permit issued to \u201cWillie Robinson, Jr.,\u201d born in 1927, had been revoked, and that a temporary permit had been issued to a \u201cWillie Robinson,\u201d born in 1938.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The pictures on the revoked permit and on the application for the temporary permit were of the same person; both were likenesses of the man he had stopped for the routine check on April 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">On April 23, 1968, while on duty, Officer Jenks observed appellant operating the same vehicle. He stopped appellant, asked him for his permit and registration card and, upon being shown the same permit appellant had exhibited four days earlier, placed'appellant under arrest for operating a motor vehicle after revocation of his operator\u2019s permit and for obtaining a permit by misrepresentation. According to his testimony at the remand hearing, Officer Jenks then advised appellant of his rights and proceeded to search him. Since the arrest was one which involved taking appellant to the station house,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under Police Department instructions Officer Jenks was required to make a full field search as an incident to the arrest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A full field search \u201cis a thorough search of the individual.\u201d Remand transcript at 99. \u201cHe examines the contents of all of the pockets in a field type search and in-custody arrest at all times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120. In conducting a full field search, \u201ceven though [the officer] may feel something that he believes is not a weapon, he is instructed to take it out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100. The officer is taught \u201cto examine everything he has on him at the field search. Everything that we find in his pockets is examined to find out what exactly it is.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>Officer Jenks\u2019 search complied with Police Department instructions. He was unable to recall the precise sequence in which he searched appellant. His best recollection was that in placing his right hand on appellant\u2019s left breast he felt an object.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although Officer Jenks could not ascertain the precise size or consistency of this object, there was no suggestion that he believed it to be a weapon or believed himself to be in danger. On the contrary, he admitted that he did not have any specific purpose in mind when he searched appellant: \u201cI just searched him. I didn\u2019t think about what I was looking for. I just searched him.\u201d Remand transcript at 32. Officer Jenks proceeded to extract the object \u2014 which turned out to be a wadded up cigarette package \u2014 from appellant\u2019s pocket. He then opened the package and found it to contain 14 gelatin capsules of heroin. Officer Jenks then placed appellant under arrest for possession of narcotics, and continued his search without finding any weapons or any additional narcotics.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">Throughout the proceedings in this case, the Government has consistently conceded,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and indeed there can be no doubt, that in extracting the cigarette package from appellant\u2019s pocket and opening the package so as to examine its contents, Officer Jenks exceeded the permissible scope of a limited <em>frisk </em>for weapons.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, as Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>Jenks\u2019 testimony at the remand makes clear, the <em>full </em>search <em>of </em>appellant\u2019s person that actually occurred in this case cannot be justified on a theory that the narcotics were \u201cin plain view.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus the question is now squarely presented whether, and under what circumstances, an arresting officer may conduct a <em>full </em>search of the person incident to a lawful arrest for violation of a mere motor vehicle regulation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\"> Ordinarily, a warrant must be obtained by a police officer before he may make a search.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Searches of both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>person and place incident to lawful arrest, however, have traditionally been exceptions to this rule and have been held constitutional even though they have been made without prior approval by a neutral magistrate. Nevertheless, \u201cthe bare fact that a person is validly arrested does not mean that he is subject to any and all searches that the arresting officer may wish to conduct.\u201d United States v. Mills, 153 U.S.App.D.C. -, -, 472 F.2d 1231, 1234 (decided May 10, 1972) <em>(en banc). </em>Rather, the validity of searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment turns upon their reasonableness, and since a warrant will not be available to insure that arrest based searches are reasonable both at their inception and in their execution, courts must review the constitutionality of such searches with special care. <em>See, e. g., </em>Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 766-772, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966); United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 106, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-15\">In exercising this power of review, courts must give particularly careful weight to the fundamental Fourth Amendment principle which has been given renewed emphasis in the housing inspection<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and stop-and-frisk<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> cases: a search will comply with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment only if its scope is no broader than necessary to accomplish legitimate governmental objectives. This principle is stated most clearly in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), in which the Supreme Court upheld an on-the-street detention and search for weapons of three suspects. The Court found that the police officer in <em>Terry </em>had \u201cadequate constitutional ground,\u201d but not probable cause, to believe that the men'he detained and searched were going to commit a crime. In its opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>the Court stressed that the Fourth Amendment governs <em>all </em>intrusions by agents of the public upon personal security, 392 U.S. at 18 n. 15, 88 S.Ct. 1868, and that the manner in which the search and seizure are conducted is as much the test of their reasonableness as whether they were warranted at all. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Citing a number of earlier cases, many of which involved searches initiated upon probable cause, the Court in <em>Terry </em>stated that \u201c[t]his Court has held in the past that a search which is reasonable at its inception may violate the Fourth Amendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he scope of the search must be \u2018strictly tied to and justified by\u2019 the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17-19, 88 S.Ct. at 1878. Thus the Court made absolutely clear that the underlying rationale of <em>Terry </em>was a restatement of, rather than a departure from, existing case law, and that, although <em>Terry </em>itself involved a search upon less than probable cause, the scope limitation principle was to apply to all searches no matter what thp evidentiary basis for their initiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">If <em>Terry </em>left any doubt at all that the scope limitation principle was intended by the Supreme Court to apply to arrest based searches, that doubt was expressly foreclosed by the last of the cases in the <em>Terry-Sibron-Peters </em>trilogy. In Peter's v. New York, which is consolidated with Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968), Officer Lasky of the New York City Police Department was off duty at his apartment when he heard a noise at the door. Looking through the peephole into the hall, he saw two men he did not believe to be fellow tenants tip-toeing out of the alcove toward the stairway. Officer Lasky called police headquarters, put on civilian clothes, and armed himself with his service revolver. Believing he had happened upon the two men in the course of an attempted burglary, Officer Lasky opened his door, entered the hallway, and slammed the door loudly behind him. When the door slammed the two men fled down the stairs and Officer Lasky gave chase. When he caught up with Peters on the stairs and questioned him, Peters explained his presence in the building by saying he was visiting a girl friend whose name he chivalrously declined to reveal on the ground that she was a married woman. Officer Lasky then patted Peters down for weapons and discovered a hard object in his pocket. The object did not feel like a gun, but he thought it might be a knife. Officer Lasky removed this object from Peters\u2019 pocket and found it was an opaque envelope containing burglar\u2019s tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">Given this factual situation, the Supreme Court held that Officer Lasky legally arrested Peters when he collared him on the stairway and curtailed his freedom of movement. This arrest was found to be valid because made on the basis of probable cause to believe Peters was engaged in criminal activity. At this point, according to the Supreme Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-7\">\u201c[Officer Lasky] had the authority to search Peters, and the incident search was obviously justified \u2018by the need to seize weapons and other things which might be used to assault an officer or effect an escape, as well as by the need to prevent the destruction of evidence of the crime.\u2019 * * * <em>Moreover, it was reasonably limited in scope by these purposes. Officer Lasky did not engage in an unrestrained and thoroughgoing examination of Peters and his personal effects. </em>\u2022X* * -X- \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1154-9\">392 U.S. at 67, 88 S.Ct. at 1905. (Emphasis added.) In <em>Peters, </em>then, the Supreme Court applied the scope limitation principle to an arrest based search and found that the search \u2014 which took the form of a frisk followed by a further intrusion into the arrestee\u2019s pockets only after an object possibly a weapon had been felt \u2014 was \u201creasonably limited in scope by [its] purposes\u201d and was not so \u201cunrestrained and thoroughgoing\u201d as to violate the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>Similarly, in Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), the Court used its scope limitation principle to measure the constitutionality of a far-ranging search of a house incident to a lawful arrest for larceny. <em>Terry </em>was specifically referred to, and the <em>Chimel </em>search, in which police discovered coins appellant was accused of stealing, was found to be unconstitutional because it was not \u201c \u2018strictly tied to and justified by\u2019 the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.\u201d 395 U.S. at 762, 89 S.Ct. at 2039. <em>Chimel </em>holds that incident to a lawful arrest for a crime such as theft, which requires instrumentalities and bears fruits, there is ample justification for a warrantless search of \u201cthe arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u2018within his immediate control\u2019 \u2014 construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763, 89 S.Ct. at 2040.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">Thus although the consequences of application of the scope limitation principle may differ under varying circumstances, it is clear that <em>all </em>searches, whether or not based upon probable cause, are governed by the rule, and that in determining the constitutionality of any particular search \u201cour inquiry is a dual one \u2014 whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d Terry v. Ohio, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 19-20, 88 S.Ct. at 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">What then are the legitimate objectives of an arrest based search of the person? What is it that renders such searches permissible at their inception, and to which the scope of such searches must be tied, if their reasonableness is to be maintained? Though they receive slightly different formulation in various cases, the legitimate objectives of warrantless searches of the person incident to arrest seem to be (1) seizure of fruits, instrumentalities and other evidence of the crime for which the arrest is made in order to prevent its destruction or concealment; and (2) removal of any weapons that the arrestee might seek to use to resist arrest or effect his escape.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>presented, then, is whether either of these objectives justifies a full search of the person incident to a lawful arrest for violation of a mere motor vehicle regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Since fruits, instrumentalities or other evidence of crime concealed on the person of the arrestee may be easily disposed of or destroyed, the arresting officer will often be justified in searching for such evidence without delay. But the scope limitation principle requires that when police search a person incident to arrest, the search must be directed toward finding evidence which the arresting officer has probable cause to believe will be found on the person, and that the search be no more intrusive than necessary to recover such evidence. For most crimes, of course, it is clearly reasonable to assume that the arrestee will be in possession of the fruits, instrumentalities or other evidence of the crime for which the person was arrested. Thus in such situations \u201cthe circumstances justifying the arrest are also those furnishing probable cause for the search.\u201d Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 47 n. 6, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1979 n. 6, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970). For other crimes, however, and more particularly for most traffic offenses,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> no search of the person for evidence may be allowed at all because no evidence exists to be found. Admittedly, appellant\u2019s offenses in this case \u2014 driving after his operator\u2019s permit had been revoked and obtaining a new permit by misrepresentation \u2014 are relatively serious ones on the continuum of traffic infractions. Nonetheless, upon stopping Willie Robinson for the second time and upon receiving for the second time Robinson\u2019s fraudulently obtained temporary operator\u2019s permit, Officer Jenks had secured the only evidence of the crime for which the arrest was made which he could possibly have had probable cause to believe was in the arrestee\u2019s possession.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> No further arrest based search for evidence was therefore reasonable or constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">There is, of course, a second, very important, justification for searches incident to arrest \u2014 the interest of government in the safety of its police officers. In Terry v. Ohio, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that when a police officer stops a citizen on the street in the course of a legitimate investigation \u201cthere must be a narrowly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>drawn authority to permit a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of the police officer * * 392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883. The Court made clear, however, that the right to exercise that authority was not automatic. Rather, such intrusions are permissible <em>only </em>if the officer is \u201cable to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant\u201d the officer\u2019s belief that the person with whom he is dealing is both armed and presently dangerous. <em>Id. </em>at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880. Moreover, since the sole basis for such a search is the protection of the officer, the Court held that even when the officer reasonably believes himself to be in danger, the search actually conducted \u201cmust be limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 88 S.Ct. at 1882. Thus the Court in <em>Terry </em>approved a pat-down or \u201cfrisk\u201d of the appellant\u2019s outer clothing for weapons, with a further intrusion only after finding a weapon, precisely because such an intrusion was adequate to protect the officer and was confined \u201cstrictly to what was minimally necessary to learn whether the men were armed and to disarm them once he discovered the weapons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">Similarly, in Sibron v. New York, <em>supra, </em>another stop-and-frisk case, the Court held that a direct intrusion into the pockets of a narcotics suspect was unreasonable at its inception because the mere association of the suspect with other known narcotics offenders was held not to have given the officer justification for any search whatever. Before conducting a self-protective search for weapons, the Court held, the officer \u201cmust be able to point to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous.\u201d 392 U.S. at 64, 88 S.Ct. at 1903. Moreover, the Court in <em>Sibron </em>went further and held that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the officer had reason to suspect Sibron was armed, the actual search \u2014 a direct intrusion into the suspect\u2019s pockets rather than a frisk\u2014 would still have been constitutionally invalid because \u201cnot reasonably limited in scope to the accomplishment of the only goal which might conceivably have justified its inception \u2014 the protection of the officer * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 88 S.Ct. at 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">Thus <em>Terry </em>and <em>Sibron, </em>when read together, stand for the proposition that in the stop-and-frisk situation where, as in the routine traffic arrest, there can be no evidentiary basis for a search, the <em>most </em>intrusive search the Constitution will allow is a limited frisk for weapons, and even then only when the officer reasonably believes himself to be in danger. The Government contends, however, that the standards enunciated in <em>Terry </em>and <em>Sibron </em>are inapplicable to the instant case because the \u201cstops\u201d and \u201cfrisks\u201d involved in those decisions were predicated only upon \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d whereas here, since appellant was arrested on probable cause, a full search was justified. But in focusing on the different quanta of evidence required to justify different degrees of seizures or searches of the person, the Government loses sight of the even more telling distinction between the evidentiary and protective purposes of searches. It is upon this latter distinction that our case hinges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-9\">Because the arrest based searches reviewed and validated by the courts have usually had <em>both </em>evidentiary and protective functions, the casual reader may be given the false impression that these cases stand for the proposition that a lawful arrest will <em>always </em>support a full search of the person. Obviously, when the arrest is made for a crime for which evidence exists, a warrantless intrusion into the pockets of the arrestee to discover such evidence is reasonable under the \u201csearch incident\u201d exception. The officer may, of course, also use this reasonable intrusion to look simultaneously for weapons. But in a fact situation such as ours, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>search can have no evidentiary function, a more careful analysis of proper scope limitations is called for. When the sole legitimate goal of the search is the protection of the officer, the paramount factor in determining the reasonableness of the intrusion is the danger actually presented, and it is of no moment whether the protective search for weapons is incident to an \u201carrest\u201d based on probable cause or incident to a \u201cstop\u201d based only upon reasonable suspicion. \u201cIn short, the physical risk to the officer is created by the circumstances of the confrontation taken as a whole, not by the technical niceties of the law of arrest.\u201d People v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County [Simon], 7 Cal.3d 186, 101 Cal.Rptr. 837, 850, 496 P.2d 1205, 1218 (1972) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">In determining the extent to which the legitimate governmental interest in insuring the safety of law enforcement officers justifies a search of the person incident to a lawful arrest, a distinction must be drawn between the \u201croutine\u201d traffic arrest \u2014 where the officer simply issues a notice of violation and allows the offender to proceed \u2014 and the more serious cases in which the officer effects an \u201cin-custody\u201d arrest in order to transport the traffic offender to the stationhouse for booking. Turning first to the \u201croutine\u201d traffic arrest,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it seems evident that the dangers presented in that situation are to some extent similar to, and certainly no greater than, those presented in the stop-and-frisk situations involved in <em>Terry </em>and <em>Sibron.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Like the investigatory stop, the routine traffic arrest is merely a brief on-the-street encounter. Moreover, the vast majority of traffic violators are law-abiding citizens. Indeed, \u201c[v]ery few drivers can traverse any appreciable distance without violating some traffic regulation.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and as Chief Judge Fuld of the New York Court of Appeals has noted, \u201cA motorist, who exceeds the speed limit does not thereby indicate any propensity for violence or iniquity, and the officer who stops the speeder has not even the slightest cause for thinking that he is in danger of being assaulted.\u201d People v. Marsh, 20 N.Y.2d 98, 101, 281 N.Y.S.2d 789, 792, 228 N.E.2d 783, 786 (1967).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-9\">This is not to say, of course, that a minor traffic stop can never erupt into violence. On the contrary, whenever a police officer confronts a citizen on the street an element of danger is present. But as the stop-and-frisk cases make clear, the mere possibility of danger cannot justify any and all searches the officer may wish to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>duct. The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the possibility that a routine traffic stop might result in injury to the officer, although unquestionably real, is so remote<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that \u201c[t]o allow the police to routinely search for weapons in all such instances would * * * constitute an \u2018intolerable and unreasonable\u2019 intrusion into the privacy of the vast majority of peaceable citizens who travel by automobile.\u201d People v. Superior Court of Yolo County [Kiefer], 3 Cal.3d 807, 91 Cal.Rptr. 729, 744, 478 P.2d 449, 464 (1970) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">We therefore conclude that the permissible scope of searches incident to routine traffic arrests, where there is no evidentiary basis for a search and where the officer intends simply to issue a notice of violation and to allow the offender to proceed, must be governed by the teaching of the Supreme Court as set forth in <em>Terry </em>and <em>Sibron. </em>Thus the most intrusive search the Constitution will allow in such situations is a limited patdown for weapons, and then only when there exist special facts or circumstances which give the officer reasonable grounds to believe that the person with whom he is dealing is armed and presently dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-13\">As the Government points out, however, the instant case involves not a \u201croutine\u201d traffic arrest, but rather a situation in which the arresting officer was required to take appellant into custody. According to applicable Metropolitan Police Department regulations, \u201c[t]he use of Traffic Violation Notices is a courtesy of long standing and shall be employed whenever possible, consistent with the overall safety of the public.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nevertheless, for certain of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>the \u201cmore serious or aggravated types of traffic violations,\u201d issuance of a notice of violation is prohibited, and the officer is required to make an in-custody arrest. Among these is the offense of \u201cOperating After Suspension or Revocation of Operator\u2019s Permit,\u201d one of the two offenses for which appellant was lawfully arrested. Thus the Government asserts that, even though a police officer may not conduct a full search of the person incident to a lawful traffic arrest involving mere issuance of a notice of violation, such a search should be permitted where, as here, the officer is required to take the offender into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">As noted earlier in this opinion, the scope limitation principle of the Fourth Amendment is essentially \u201cfunctional\u201d in nature \u2014 that is, the consequences of its application will vary according to the particular circumstances in which it is applied. Thus in determining the permissible scope of searches incident to in-custody arrests for mere traffic violations, we cannot ignore the fact that, unlike the momentary and relatively minor dangers presented in the stop-and-frisk situation or in the routine traffic stop, the dangers to which the police are exposed in the circumstances of a custodial arrest are sharply accentuated by the prolonged proximity of the accused to police personnel following the arrest. As Chief Justice Wright of the California Supreme Court has noted, the crucial distinguishing feature of the in-custody arrest \u201cis not the greater likelihood that a person taken into custody is armed, but rather the increased likelihood of danger to the officer <em>if </em>in fact the person is armed.\u201d People v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County [Simon], <em>supra, 101 </em>Cal.Rptr. at 857, 496 P.2d at 1225 (concurring opinion). (Emphasis in original.) With this increased danger in mind, it would seem clearly unreasonable to expect a police officer to place a suspect in his squad car for transportation to the station-house without first taking reasonable measures to insure that the suspect is unarmed. We therefore conclude that whenever a police .officer, acting within the bounds of his authority,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> makes an in-custody arrest, he may also conduct a limited <em>frisk </em>of the suspect\u2019s outer clothing in order to remove any weapons the suspect may have in his possession. There are circumstances in which the element of danger may require a full search even as to persons arrested for relatively minor traffic-type offenses, as where the frisk causes the officer\u2019s suspicion to be reasonably aroused as to weapons <em>(see </em>note 9 <em>supra). </em>But no such predicate was advanced for the search at bar. The record clearly establishes Jenks searched appellant without any purpose in mind \u2014 \u201cI just searched him\u201d- \u2014 -because this was standard police instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">The Government contends still further, however, that a frisk does not provide reasonable protection to the officer in the circumstances of an in-custody arrest. We cannot agree. Under the scope limitation principle of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>Amendment, \u201c[a] search for weapons * * * must, like any other search, be strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation.\u201d Terry v. Ohio, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 25-26, 88 S.Ct. at 1882. And in evaluating the reasonableness of a search, it is necessary \u201cfirst to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen,\u201d for there is \u201cno ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\u201d Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 534-535, 536-537, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1734, 1735, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Turning first to the interests of the individual, we must recognize that the properly conducted frisk which we would permit with any in-custody arrest is far more than a \u201cpetty indignity.\u201d On the contrary, \u201c[e]ven a limited search of the outer clothing for weapons constitutes a severe, though brief, intrusion upon cherished personal security, and it must surely be an annoying, frightening, and perhaps humiliating experience.\u201d Terry v. Ohio, <em>supra, </em>392 U.S. at 24-25, 88 S.Ct. at 1882. Thus if we are to strike a reasonable balance under the Fourth Amendment, any <em>further </em>intrusion upon the individual\u2019s privacy should be permitted only if necessary to achieve substantial governmental interests. And this is all the more true where, as here, the officer may not even have reasonable grounds to believe that the individual, who has been arrested for a mere traffic violation, is either armed or dangerous.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-12\">Moreover, when viewed from the reverse side of the equation, we are firmly convinced that a carefully conducted frisk offers substantial protection to the officer. In Terry v. Ohip, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme .Court adopted the following definition of a frisk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-13\">\u201c \u2018[T]he officer must feel with sensitive fingers every portion of the prisoner\u2019s body. A thorough search must be made of the prisoner\u2019s arms and armpits, waistline and back, the groin and area about the testicles, and the entire surface of the legs down to the feet.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-14\">392 U.S. at 17 n. 13, 88 S.Ct. at 1877 n. 13, <em>quoting </em>Priar &amp; Martin, Searching and Disarming Criminals, 45 J.Crim.L.C. &amp; P.S. 481 (1954). Such a frisk, the Court concluded, is \u201creasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>the police officer.\u201d 392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. at 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">The evidence presented at the remand hearing in this case clearly supports this conclusion. Police Sergeant Dennis Donaldson, an instructor at the District of Columbia Police Training Division, testified that in order to protect the arresting officer the standard police practice in the District of Columbia is to conduct a full search of the person whenever an in-custody arrest is made. On cross-examination, however, Sergeant Donaldson admitted that, although the effectiveness of a patdown may vary according to the circumstances, a properly conducted <em>Terry </em>type frisk could uncover virtually every weapon he had ever encountered<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> in the course of in-custody searches. Mr. Ronald Newhouser, a recognized expert in clandestine weaponry,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> also testified for the Government. During the course of his testimony Mr. Newhouser removed from his person 25 concealed weapons that could kill or incapacitate.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Like Sergeant Donaldson, however, Mr. Newhouser conceded that virtually all of these weapons could be detected in the course of a properly conducted frisk.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-10\">We do not mean to suggest, of course, that a protective frisk removes all conceivable dangers to the officer. There will always be the long shot<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> case in the which the arrestee has concealed a novel weapon \u2014 perhaps a razor blade shaped like a coin \u2014 which a frisk will fail to reveal. But the kind of thoroughgoing search which would offer <em>total </em>protection to the officer could only be accomplished at a complete sacrifice of the arrestee\u2019s right to privacy. Indeed, as Mr. Newhouser admitted, the only means of eliminating all possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>risk to the officer is to allow him to spread-eagle the arrestee, strip him of his clothing, and feel into his body cavities for weapons. Deciding what is a reasonable intrusion, given the legitimate objective of protecting the arresting officer, calls for a careful balancing of competing interests. Our position reflects this balancing.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">Pressing its argument still further, however, the Government suggests an alternative theory in support of its contention that a full search of the person should be allowed whenever an in-custody arrest is made. When a suspect has been lawfully arrested and \u201cbooked\u201d on a criminal charge and is to be placed in stationhouse detention, it is ordinarily reasonable to conduct a search of his person<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> in order to prevent introduction of weapons or contraband into the jail facility.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> From this premise the Government argues that, since the suspect will eventually be searched at the stationhouse anyway, a search of this kind might \u201cjust as well\u201d be conducted ' in the field at the time of arrest. Whatever the merits of this argument generally, this court\u2019s recent <em>en banc </em>decision in United States v. Mills, <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>makes clear that it is inapplicable to the ease at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">In <em>Mills </em>the defendant was arrested for the petty offense of driving with a learner\u2019s permit while unaccompanied by a licensed driver. Rather than simply issue a notice of violation, the arresting officer elected to make an in-custody arrest. The officer then frisked the defendant and, finding no weapons, called a scout car to transport the defendant to the stationhouse. After arriving at the stationhouse, the defendant was brought to the booking desk. At that point the defendant clearly had the right to post $50 collateral for his offense and, upon doing so, t\u00f3 i be released immediately, without any detention or search of his person. Instead of informing him of his right, however, the officers ordered the defendant to remove everything from his pockets. Among his possessions the police discovered 22 capsules of heroin and 33 capsules of cocaine. Under these circumstances, the court held the stationhouse search unconstitutional and therefore reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of violations of the federal narcotics laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">Initially the court noted that there could be no evidentiary basis for this search since the defendant\u2019s offense was proved completely at the time of arrest. Moreover, the search could not be justified on the basis of protective considerations because the arresting officer had already frisked the defendant for weapons. Thus \u201c[t]he validity of the search,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cmust stand or fall on the premise that it was a predetention inventory, undertaken to hold and account for valuable or poten-, tially dangerous personal property \u2014 such as rings, belts, watches or jewelry \u2014 during the detention of the person arrested.\u201d 153 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 472 F.2d at 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-13\">Emphasizing the defendant\u2019s right to post collateral, the court then stated that, although a search of the person incident to stationhouse detention may be reasonable, \u201cit would be entirely unreasonable to hold that policemen have discretion to detain and therefore thoroughly search petty offenders * * * who may avoid stationhouse detention altogether by posting collateral.\u201d 153 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 472 F.2d at 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"AjV\">The court therefore held :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-17\">\u201cWhen a person is charged with a collateral-type petty offense, under which he rightfully has the opportunity to post collateral and avoid further detention, and there is no probable cause to believe he committed a more serious crime, the police may not engage in an inventory search of the offender, or an equivalent direction that he empty his pockets, and seek to support it on the ground of holding him in further confinement, unless at a minimum he was timely notified of his opportunity to post collateral (and thus avoid further detention) and refused or was unable to do so. * * \u00bb <footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-19\"> As in <em>Mills, </em>we \u201cdo not here consider the proper scope of a search that is supported by the premise of forthcoming confinement.\u201d 153 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 472 F.2d at 1234. Although appellant Robinson had no right to post collateral for his offenses, he \u2018#as clearly entitled to post either cash or bail bond<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and, upon doing so, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>released immediately, without any stationhouse confinement or incident search of his person.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Moreover, even if appellant was unable to post, such bond, he might still have been eligible for pre-detention release under the recently enacted citation release program.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Officer Jenks had no way of knowing, one way or the other, whether appellant was eventually to be incarcerated at the stationhouse. He therefore had no tenable basis for making a search on the assumption that there would be incarceration. The official who is called upon to make the determinations involved in the decision on incarceration \u2014 the arrangements for bail, the possibility of a citation issued at the stationhouse \u2014 must make that decision before it may be used to justify an intrusion on privacy as one permissible under the Fourth Amendment. The mere possibility that such a search might later be justified obviously cannot serve to eliminate appellant\u2019s rights under .the Fourth Amendment at the time of arrest. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Mills, <em>supra; </em>People v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County [Simon], <em>supra; </em>People v. Overlee, Colo., 483 P.2d 222 (1971) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-12\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-13\">The result we reach today, it should be noted, is by no means unique. On the contrary, the vast majority of courts \u2014 both state and federal \u2014 which have considered the problem hold specifically that, absent \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> a police officer has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>right to search either the person or the vehicle incident to a lawful arrest for violation of a mere motor vehicle regulation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In Grundstrom v. Beto, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>N.D.Tex., 273 F.Supp. 912, 916 (1967), for example, the court, noting that the only legitimate objective of most searches incident to arrests for traffic offenses will be protection of the arresting officer, concluded that \u201c[t]o permit all searches incidental to an arrest to be justified on the theory that the officer is searching for weapons would be to allow wholesale fishing expeditions whenever a legal arrest is made.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Perhaps the most forceful statement of the principle applicable here, however, comes from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In United States v. Humphrey, . 10 Cir., 409 F.2d 1055, 1057-1058 (1969), then Chief Judge Murrah<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> wrote for a unanimous panel;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-9\">\u201cBy its own terms the Fourth Amendment protects people \u2018against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u2019 Thus not all searches run afoul of the constitutional sanction but only those unreasonable in origin or scope. While the evolution of this constitutional standard of reasonableness has varied with our sense of justice, it is certain today that warrantless searches on probable cause are reasonable only when it is unfeasible to obtain a search warrant on proper affidavit * * *. Unless, of course, it is reasonably \u2018incident\u2019 to a legal arrest * * *,for can be said to be a mere \u2018stop and frisk\u2019 as in Terry v. Ohio, supra and Sibron v. New York * * *. Notably, these exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>are not based on anything inherent in the exception itself but result from the inductive case by case application of the constitutional standard of reasonableness. Thus these exceptions are traditionally justified by the need to protect the arresting officers, prevent escape, collect instrumentalities or fruits of the crime (and now evidence, Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967)), and prevent delay which might otherwise permit the criminal to escape or commit his crime. * * * From this rationale it is clear that the scope of a search contemporaneous with a legal arrest must have a reasonable relationship to the protection of the officer or the crime for which the accused was arrested. As stated in Terry v. Ohio, supra 392 U.S. at p. 19, 88. S.Ct. p. 1878, \u2018[T]he scope of the search must be \u201cstrictly tied to and justified by\u201d the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible\u2019, i. e. the detention or arrest. * * * If not, the search is unreasonable and violates Fourth Amendment protected interests. * * * We are in complete agreement with the prevailing federal and state authority which condemns the search of persons and automobiles following routine traffic violations. * * *\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">Nevertheless, the Government contends that most of the courts which have considered the problem of searches incident to mere traffic arrests have failed to distinguish between \u201croutine\u201d arrests on the one hand and \u201cin-custody\u201d arrests on the other. It is clear, however, that our conclusion that a <em>full </em>search of the person should not be permitted in the in-custody situation is in accord with the opinions of those courts which <em>have </em>recognized this distinction. In Barnes v. State, 25 Wis.2d 116, 130 N.W.2d 264 (1964), for example, the defendant was stopped by two police officers for a brake light violation. Rather than simply issue a notice of violation, the officers decided to effect an in-custody arrest. The officers then conducted a full search of the defendant\u2019s person, and in his coat pocket they discovered a small quantity of marijuana. Under these circumstances, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that, although a limited pat-down for weapons is reasonable whenever an in-custody arrest is made, a full search of the defendant\u2019s person is neither necessary nor constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">In People v. Marsh, <em>supra, </em>the defendant was arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant for a prior speeding violation. The arresting officer immediately searched the defendant and found on his person a sheet of paper implicating him in \u201cthe playing of policy.\u201d Noting that the sole legitimate basis for the search was protection of the arresting officer, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the \u201ccustodial\u201d nature of the arrest could not serve to justify a search of the defendant\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">Finally, in People v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County [Simon], <em>supra, </em>a police officer on routine patrol dutyiat night noticed a car \u201cdriving without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>headlights or taillights.\u201d He stopped the vehicle and asked the driver for identification. When the driver failed to produce a driver\u2019s license or a registration certificate for the car, the officer decided to make an in-custody arrest. He then searched the driver\u2019s person and found in his pants pocket a soft plastic bag containing marijuana. In a unanimous decision the Supreme Court of California held that, since there was no evidentiary basis for the search, \u201cthe search of [the driver] * * * cannot be justified as an incident to [the officer\u2019s] decision to take him into custody * * * \u201d 101 Cal.Rptr. at 854, 496 P.2d at 1222. <em>See also </em>State v. Curtis, 290 Minn. 429, 190 N.W.2d 631 (1971).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">Moreover, our conclusion as to the meaning of the constitutional safeguard, and its application to arrests for violations of the traffic code, is supported not only by analysis of the Supreme Court opinions and the decisions of a vast majority of other courts, but also by the similar analyses and conclusions which have been reached by scholars who have given careful study to the issues.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> For example, Wayne LaFave, author of the American Bar Foundation volume Arrest (1965), whose long-term study of arrest problems led to his selection by the American Bar Association as reporter to the Committee on the Criminal Trial, noted over 10 years ago that \u201c[a] search of the vehicle and driver incident to an arrest for a traffic violation is a police practice apparently not uncommon throughout the country,\u201d and urged that the courts undertake an exacting and detailed consideration of the problem of \u201cdefining the proper scope\u201d of such searches. Note, Search and Seizure \u2014 Search Incident to Arrest for Traffic Violation, 1959 Wis.L.Rev. 347, 358. More recently, a writer in the Columbia Law Review found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1169-12\">\u201c * * * [T]he historical development of incidental personal searches furnishes no support for the validation of searches based solely on the fact of lawful arrest. This point had been overlooked by the early courts, most likely because the fact situations of these early cases were such that under either a categorical or examination-of-the-facts approach, an incidental personal search could be justified. Later courts\u2019 failure to analyze the historical underpinnings of the rule and its careless expression in the early cases on the doctrine have led to a hardening of the categorical approach which only recently has begun to be questioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1169-13\">\u201cThe need for this reexamination is clear. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1169-14\">Note, Searches of the Person Incident to Lawful Arrest, 69 Colum.L.Rev. 866, 869-870 (1969). (Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-15\">In quite succinct fashion, Judge Nathan R. Sobel of the New York Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>Court explains that \u201cwhenever a search is made following an arrest for a traffic violation the primary purpose is no longer to arrest but rather to search for \u2018evidence\u2019 of entirely unrelated crimes. Such a search is ipso facto general and unreasonable.\u201d N. Sobel, Search and Seizure 119 (1964). Finally, in the recently proposed Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, which thoroughly reexamines the law of search and seizure, the American Law Institute concludes that a police officer may not conduct a full search of an individual arrested for \u201ca traffic offense or other misdemeanor, the elements and circumstances of which involve no unlawful possession or violent, or intentionally or recldessly dangerous, conduct <footnotemark>45</footnotemark> And this is so whether or not the offender is taken into custody.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">The practical effect of the rule urged upon this court by the Government\u2014 permitting warrantless \u201cfull\u201d searches .incident to mere traffic arrests (or for that matter, incident to arrests for status offenses)<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> \u2014 is fearsome to imagine. As Judge Wisdom has written, the danger is \u201cthat the lowly offense of a traffic violation \u2014 of which all of us have been guilty at one time or another \u2014 may be established as the basis for searches circumventing the rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Amador-Gonzalez v. United States, 5 Cir., 391 F.2d 308, 318 (1968). The rule that a full search without warrant will be supported by <em>any </em>lawful arrest would give dangerously broad discretion to the police officers who would apply it. Logically and consistently applied, such a rule would endanger the rights of the physician hurrying to a night call who runs a stop sign, or of the long-haired youth with his bags packed and on his way to college who exceeds the speed limit, or of the corporate executive arrested for criminal conspiracy under the antitrust laws, or of the civil servant accused of tax fraud, or of any one of us a police officer \u2014 for whatever secret motive or for no reason at all \u2014 wishes to search without the hindrance of normal Fourth Amendment protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-12\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-13\">In this case, of course, we deal with criminal conduct, and there is a natural aversion to reversing a conviction on procedural grounds, given a jury verdict supported by a strong showing of guilt. It has long been recognized, however, that \u201c[n]o right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>and unquestionable authority of law.\u201d Union Pacific Railway Co. v.

A significant difference in presentation of the facts, or at least in emphasis given the facts, by the opposing parties, centers on the further check by Officer Jenks of \u201ccriminal records\u201d which occurred after he had checked \u201ctraffic records.\u201d Counsel for appellant on appeal stressed that appellant had a record of 2 prior narcotics convictions, and suggested that Officer Jenks may have been aware of appellant\u2019s record through his investigation of \u201ccriminal records.\u201d Thus appellant urges that Officers Jenks may have used the subsequent traffic violation arrest as a mere pretext for a narcotics search which would not have been allowed by a neutral magistrate had Officer Jenks sought a warrant. Were this claim to be established, the search would clearly be illegal under the authority of United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U.S. 452, 467, 52 S.Ct. 420, 76 L.Ed. 877 (1932) ; Amador-Gonzalez v. United States, 5 Cir., 391 F.2d 308 (1968) ; Taglavore v. United States, 9 Cir., 291 F.2d 262 (1961). Officer Jenks, however, denied that he had any such motive or strategy to evade the normal 4th Amendment protections. For purposes of this opinion, we accept the Government\u2019s version of this factual question since, even accepting this version, we find the search to be unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">. <em>See </em>note 23 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">.

Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 16 n. 12, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and accompanying text. A protective, frisk for weapons may, of course, evolve into a full search of the suspect\u2019s pockets if the suspicions of the frisking officer are reasonably aroused. This is precisely the 2-step \u201csearch\u201d procedure approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Terry, </em>where the arresting officer \u201cdid not place his hands in [the suspect\u2019s] pockets or under the outer surface of [his] garments <em>until he </em>had felt weapons * * <em>Id. </em>at 29-30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884. (Emphasis added.) Thus it has been clear since <em>Terry </em>that a frisking officer may not remove an object from the suspect\u2019s pockets unless \u201che <em>reasonably </em>believes [it] to be a dangerous weapon * * American Law Institute, Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure \u00a7 110.2(4) (Proposed Official Draft No. 1, 1972). (Emphasis added.) <em>See </em>Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 65, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968). In the instant case, however, there is no evidence whatever that Officer Jenks believed the object in appellant's pocket to be a weapon. On the contrary, Officer Jenks admitted that he did not have any specific purpose in mind when he searched appellant: \u201cI just searched him. I didn\u2019t think about what I was looking-for. I just searched him.\u201d This testimony, and the fact that Officer .Tenks did not limit himself to a frisk, is clearly corroborated by the testimony of Police Sergeant Dennis Donaldson, an instructor at the District of Columbia Police Training Division, to the effect that it is standard Metropolitan Police Department procedure in cases such as this to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>a <em>full </em>search of the person rather than a mere patdown for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">Moreover, even if Officer Jenks believed the object to be a weapon, it is doubtful that such a belief could be upheld ns reasonable. Although Officer Jenks could not determine precisely how hard or how large the object was before removing it from appellant's pocket, he readily admitted that it felt smaller, softer and less suspicious than even a small derringer. Indeed, Sergeant Donaldson made clear that an object such as a wadded up cigarette package ordinarily should <em>not </em>be removed from a suspect\u2019s pocket in the course of a properly conducted frisk. <em>See </em>Tinney v. Wilson, 9 Cir., 408 F.2d 912 (1969) ; United States v. Gonzalez, D.Conn., 319 F.Supp. 563 (1970) ; United States v. Hostetter, D.Del., 295 F.Supp. 1312 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">Finally, even if Officer Jenks\u2019 decision to extract the cigarette package from appellant\u2019s pocket could be sustained ns part of a valid frisk, he still would not have been justified in opening the package so as to examine its contents. AVhen the sole interest of the frisking officer is to deprive the suspect of weapons, and the officer reasonably believes that an object in the suspect\u2019s possession may <em>contain </em>a weapon, the officer\u2019s interest in self-protection can be fully and completely vindicated simply by placing the \u201ccontainer\" beyond the suspect\u2019s reach until the encounter has ended. There is no need whatever for the officer to open the \u201ccontainer\u201d to examine its contents. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Collins, 142 U.S.App.D.C. 100, 108, 439 F.2d 610, 618 (1971) ; United States v. Hostetter, <em>supra; </em>Amacher v.

Indeed the regulations of the Metropolitan Police Department state clearly that if, in the course of a frisk, \u201cthe individual has a parcel, the officer is justified only in placing it beyond the individual\u2019s reach and not in opening it.\u201d Metropolitan Police Department, Guidelines for the Exercise of the Authority to Stop and Frisk (Aug. 27, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-14\">The only exception to this rule arises where the officer, upon discovering the \u201ccontainer,\u201d has probable cause to believe it contains illegal contraband. At that point, the officer may place the individual under arrest for the possession offense and then examine the contents of the \u201ccontainer\u201d in the exercise of his authority to conduct a full search of the person incident to that arrest. In the instant case, however, it is clear that Offifieer Jenks did not arrest appellant for the possession offense, and did not have probable cause to make such an arrest, until <em>after </em>he had opened the cigarette package. Indeed, Officer Jenks admitted that he did not know what was in the package until <em>after </em>he had opened it. Thus for any one of the reasons stated above we must conclude that Officer Jenks did not limit himself to a mere frisk for weapons, but rather conducted a full search of appellant\u2019s person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1152-15\">. Officer Jenks testified at the hearing on remand that lie could not see the cigarette package through the breast pocket of appellant\u2019s coat, that he could not see into the pocket, and that he could not see the 14 gelatin capsules until he had actually opened the package.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1152-16\">.

It is not the arrest which gives rise to the need to make a protective search but rather reasonable cause to believe that a suspect is armed. The situations in which a protective search will be permitted are broader than those which will justify a search incident to arrest whereas the scope of a protective search should be more strictly constrained than that of a search incident to arrest. These two standards should operate separately, and indeed the Supreme Court has held that a lawful arrest is not necessary to justify a protective search. What a lawful arrest does justify is the search for fruits, instrumentalities and evidence <em>of the crime for which the arrest </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>is <em>made, </em>and this is so only because the existence of probable cause for the arrest of a person normally justifies probable cause to believe that the suspect possesses such items.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">Note, Searches of the Person Incident to Lawful Arrest, 69 Colum.L.Rev. 866, 870-871 (1969).

These arrests may \u2014 -though not necessarily in every case\u2014 be predicated on facts which also constitute probable cause to believe that alcohol or narcotics will be discovered in a search of the person or vehicle. <em>See, e. g., </em>Schmerber v.

In earlier proceedings in this case the Government contended that there may have been an evidentiary basis for the search of appellant. This was said to reside in the fact that notices of permit revocation are normally sent to offending drivers, and finding such a notice in appellant\u2019s possession would have been probative of his knowing commission of the crime for which he was arrested. Whatever the merits of this argument generally, it clearly is inapplicable to the case at hand. At the remand hearing in this case, it came to light that (1) appellant\u2019s operator\u2019s permit had been revoked in Sept. 1962; (2) his notice of revocation was received and signed for by him on March 23, 1963 \u2014 more than 5 years prior to the instant arrest and search; and (3) Ofifcer Jenks was aware of these facts by virtue of his inspection of appellant\u2019s \u201ctraffic records.\u201d Thus the likelihood that appellant would be carrying on his person a 5-year-old notice of revocation was so remote as to be practically nonexistent. Under these circumstances, the Government conceded, the District Court ruled, and we agree, that there was simply no evidentiary basis for a search of appellant\u2019s person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">. As we shall see, the instant case does not involve a \u201croutine traffic stop, where the officer simply issues a notice of violation and allows the offender to proceed.\" Rather, because of the unusual nature of appellant\u2019s offenses Officer Jenks was required to take appellant into custody and transport him to the stationhouse for booking. However, the Government in this case has strongly pressed this court to declare that there exists an unqualified right to search incident to <em>all </em>traffic arrests \u2014 whether or not the violator will be taken into custody. Thus we must first address ourselves to the routine traffic arrest situation before determining the significance under the Fourth Amendment, if any, of the in-custody aspect of appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">.

Mr. Newhouser listed these weapons as follows: \u201cA Scalpel Blade, a Scalp Hook or Stab Hook, a Hypodermic Needle with Poison Bag attached, a .22 Derringer Pistol, a Stab Needle, Chemical Mace, a Short Stab Needle, another Stab Needle, a .22 pistol, a Pengun which fires live ammunition, a Blow-gun with a poison dart, a Knife, a Hacksaw Blade Knife, another Stab Hook, a Razor Blade, another Knife, another Razor Blade, a Stab Hook Razor Blade, a 12-ineh Stab Needle, a Poison Spray, another Knife, a .22 calibre Automatic Pistol' and a Hand Grenade.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">. There was, however, some definitional confusion in Mr. Newhouser\u2019s testimony. Initially he defined a frisk as \u201c[a] pat-down, essentially, a hasty search\u201d which is used when \u201cyou are looking for a large concealed weapon, such as a pistol, a hunting knife or something like this.\u201d Given this definition, Mr. Newhouser testified that a frisk would have discovered only the pocket knife. Under cross-examination, however, and confronted with the <em>Terry </em>definition of a frisk, Mr. Newhouser testified that all of the 25 weapons could be detected. Finally, on redirect examination, Mr. Newhouser explained that his answer on cross-examination had included the concept that \u201c[a]s you found the suspicious items you would have to follow that lead.\u201d That concept is, of course, well within the proper scope of a <em>Terry </em>type frisk. <em>See </em>note 9 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">. Approximately 92% of all police fatalities in the period between July 1, 1970 and June 30, 1971 were caused by firearms. International Association of Chiefs of Police, <em>op. cit. supra </em>note 22, at 2. Virtually all firearms, of course, could be detected in the course of a carefully conducted frisk. The only types of weapons which might conceivably escape detection in sucli a frisk fall within the category of knives and other sharp instruments. These weapons, however, were responsible for less than 4% of all police fatalities and approximately 5% of all police casualties during this period. <em>Id. </em>at 5, Fig. 11. And as the testimony at the remand hearing makes clear, many, if not all, of these weapons could be uncovered in a <em>Terry </em>type frisk. <em>Compare </em>United States v. Del Toro, 2 Cir., 464 F.2d 520 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">. The Government presents 2 additional arguments which merit only brief discussion. First, it is suggested that a full search of the person is necessary not only to protect the officer, but also to remove any weapons the arrestee might use to inflict injury upon himself. It seems obvious, however, that in most instances at least a frisk which is sufficient to protect the officer will also suffice to protect against self-inflicted injury by the arrestee. JTvioreover, in the. absence of some statistics to the. contrary, we simply cannot believe a significant number of persons will attempt to end their lives simply because they have been arrested for a mere traffic violation.^</p>\n<p id=\"A_m\">Second, the Government suggests that our decision today will not deter tin* police from conducting unlawful searches, since their goal in such searches is to protect themselves rather than to obtain evidence. The same argument was, of course, considered in <em>Terry, </em>and the Court apparently concluded that since a frisk was sufficient to satisfy the officer\u2019s interest in self-protection, the rule prohibiting full searches wonlji have substantial deterrent effect. /Moreover, we find it somewhat ironic, to say the least, that the Government should contend that our police officers, whose duty it is to uphold the law, would disregard the very law they are entrusted to enforce^ Wp agree with the District Court which, when faced with this same argument at the hearing on remand in this case, concluded that the Government \u201cis simply saying that regardless of what the Courts, the legislatures or anybody else says the police will take the law into their own hands. I will not consider that.\u201d Despite the Government\u2019s pessimism, we are firmly convinced that most police officers are law-abiding citizens, and that the rule we adopt today will provide an effective deterrent to unlawful police sen relies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"pAc1m\">.

The justification for stationhouse searches, of course, is not the mere process of \u201cbooking,\u201d but rather the fact that the suspect will be placed in jail. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v.

Thus, according to Metropolitan Police Department regulations: <em>\u201cBefore being placed in confinement, </em>prisoners shall be thoroughly searched and money, jewelry, other articles of apparent material value, billfolds and contents, ties, belts, suspenders, and all weapons and other articles with which they might injure themselves or effect an escape, shall be taken from them.\u201d Manual of the Police Department, ch.

The court also noted that \u201c[w]hen a petty offense is of a collateral nature, a question arises whether an offender without means * * * can be detained on account of such violation \u2014 or whether such detention enforces an invidious discrimination on the basis of wealth.\u201d 153 U.S.App.D.C. at-- n. 11, 472 F.2d at 1239 n. 11. We do not decide that question today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1164-21\">. The rulos of the Superior Court preclude posting collateral for appellant\u2019s offenses, but a person arrested for obtaining a permit by misrepresentation may post a cash bond of $100 or bail bond of $200, and a person arrested for driving after revocation may post either cash or bail bond of $300. The only significant difference between collateral and bond is that the person released on collateral need not appear in court \u2014 that is, if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>fails to appear on the return date he is deemed to have pleaded guilty and his collateral is forfeited as execution of sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">. Ordinarily a person arrested for an offense for which he may post bond or collateral is brought immediately to the Superior Court for that purpose. If the Superior Court is not in session, the stationhouse clerks who have the function of \u201cbooking\u201d offenders serve also as acting clerks of the Superior Court and are therefore authorized to accept collateral or bond. <em>See </em>23 D.C.Code \u00a7 610 (1967); 23 D.C.Code \u00a7 1110(a) (Supp. V 1972). These stationhouse clerks have no discretion to either increase or decrease the amount of bond or collateral required by court rules. <em>See </em>United States v.

The most common \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d is new information which becomes readily apparent after the vehicle is stopped, as when the officer sees evidence of another crime in plain view, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Drew, 5 Cir., 451 F.2d 230 (1971); Nunez v. United States, 5 Cir., 370 F.2d 538 (1967); or when the officer notes a suspicious movement by one of the car\u2019s occupants which might provide probable cause to arrest for some other crime, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Thomas, S.D.N.Y., 289 F.Supp. 364 (1968); McGee v. United States, D.C.App., 270 A.2d 348 (1970); State v. Boykins, 50 N.J. 73, 232 A.2d 141 (1967); or when the arresting officer has extra knowledge which connects the driver or passengers with other crimes, <em>e. g., </em>Davidson v. Boles, N.D.W.Va., 266 F.Supp. 645 (1967); People v. Watkins, 19 Ill.2d 11, 166 N.E.2d 433 (1960); or at least increases the likelihood that such a connection exists, <em>e. g., </em>Kershner v. Boles, N.D.W.Va., 212 F.Supp. 9 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-16\">This branch of the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d doctrine is illustrated by this court\u2019s decision in Brown v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 43, 365 F.2d 976 (1966), in which Judge (now Chief Justice) Burger, writing for a unanimous court, upheld a warrantless search of an automobile subsequent to an arrest of the driver for driving without a tag light and with an expired inspection sticker. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>The court, however, was careful not to justify the search as an incident to the traffic arrest. Thus the court found that while one police officer was questioning the driver as to his traffic violations a second officer heard over the squad car radio that a robbery had been committed by a person answering the driver\u2019s general description and driving an automobile similar to the one they had just stopped. After reviewing this evidence, which became available to the officer during the arrest but before the search, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-5\">\u201cThe questions presented on these facts are whether the police had probable cause for arresting Appellant on the robbery charge, whether they did in fact arrest him, and whether the search was therefore permissible as one incident to arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">125 U.S.App.D.C. at 45, 365 F.2d at 978. The court held that the officers had probable cause to arrest the driver for robbery, and that following such arrest it was reasonable to search the automobile, for evidence incident to this robbery arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">A second type of \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d upon which courts commonly uphold searches incident to traffic arrests involves those traffic offenses for which evidence may be said to exist. This situation occurs most frequently when the person is arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. <em>See </em>note 16 <em>supra. </em>Similarly, some courts have held that when a car has no license plates, or fictitious plates, and the driver cannot produce proof of ownership, probable cause exists to believe that the ear may have been stolen, and the officer may therefore search both car and driver for evidence of ownership and identity. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Jackson, 7 Cir., 429 F.2d 1368 (1970); Welch v. United States, 10 Cir., 361 F.2d 214 (1966); State v. Rys, 186 Neb. 341, 183 N.W.2d 253 (1971); <em>see also </em>People v.

United States, <em>supra </em>note 3, 391 F.2d 308. ^The court in that case held that the ^search of appellant\u2019s automobile incident to arrest for a traffic violation was unreasonable because the traffic arrest was i merely the pretext for a narcotics search. Judge Wisdom went on from this point, however, to argue for a test which will switch the emphasis in assessments of the reasonableness of searches from the subjective intent of the arresting officer to a logical and manageable objective rule.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-17\">\u201c * * * I would hold that, pretext or no pretext, a lawful arrest of an automobile driver for a traffic offense provides no lawful predicate for the search of the driver or his car\u2014 absent special circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-20\">* * 5j: * Si*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-21\">\u201cThere is a similarity between the effect of a \u2018pretextual arrest\u2019 and the effect of an unlawful arrest, but the two cannot be equated. Proof that a traffic arrest was only a pretext to search for evidence of another offense is significant legally only because it bears on the reasonableness of the search. Search incident to arrest is unreasonable, if there is a lack of relation between the search (or scope of' the search) and the offense for which the arrest was made. That lack of relationship exists without regard to the motivative cause of the arrest when, as in this case, an automobile driver is arrested for making the wrong turn but is searched for narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-22\">\u201cIn this case one of the agents admitted that he arrested Gonzalez in order to search the automobile for narcotics. More often, the determination of the motivation for an arrest requires some judicial divination of the subjective mind. We will have fewer unconstitutional searches, if the emphasis is on the objective relationship between the nature of the offense and the nature (circumstances) of the search, rather than on the motivative cause of the arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-23\">391 F.2d at 315. Judge Wisdom wrote the <em>Amador-Gonzalez </em>opinion in Jan. 1968. The \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d cases decided 5 months later add still further authority to his already convincing position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b1167-24\">.

The court also found, however, that the passenger defendants in the case had no standing to complain of the search of the driver or of the product of that <em>search </em>\u2014 money <em>orders not in the </em>driver\u2019s name.

United States, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 42, 46 n. 26, 459 F.2d 831, 835 n. 26 (1971) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1171-6\">BAZELON, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A_d\">concurring specially:</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">I join in holding that the evidence in question must be excluded, and therefore this case must be remanded for retrial. Since I take a somewhat narrower view of the case than does Judge Wright, in his opinion for a plurality of the Court, I concur separately. I will state my reasons for limiting the issues and for my disagreement with the minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">First, this is not a typical traffic offense arrest. The crimes for which Robinson was initially arrested carry large maximum penalties,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the police regulations reasonably required that Officer Jenks take him into custody and transport him to the stationhouse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court unanimously agrees that this alone justifies a surface pat down, of the kind described in Terry v. Ohio,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> aimed at discovering indications that the arrestee has articles within his control that could be used to harm someone during the period of custody. The minority would justify this rule by upholding the reasonableness not of the search itself, but of the police \u201croutine protective procedures.\u201d If the pat down is permitted by those \u201cprocedures\u201d it would be sustained. I believe that the Supreme Court, in Sibron v. New York,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibited such an approach. Rather, as Judge Wright states,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the pat down is justifiable as reasonable to protect the officer from any inherent and imminent danger and to allow him to discharge his responsibility for the arrestee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-18\">Second, I believe that all the members of the Court are in substantial agreement as to what a police officer must believe before he can remove an object he feels while conducting a surface pat down. Judge Wilkey\u2019s opinion for the minority approves a routine that allows \u201csome flexibility based on the officer\u2019s perception of risk.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It thus appears that the minority agrees \u2014 as I do \u2014 with the plurality that an officer may remove an unidentified object from the control of the arrestee if he reasonably believes that his failure to do so would pose a danger to him, the arrestee, or others. Neither Judge Wright\u2019s nor Judge Wilkey\u2019s opinion suggests either that the officer must experience the emotional state of fear before he may take such action, or that he may remove anything he feels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-19\">But whether Officer Jenks\u2019 state of mind satisfied this requirement of reasonable belief of danger is unclear, and the Court\u2019s disagreement about the constitutionality of the instant search appears to stem from different characterizations of the facts. Although the police department instructs its officers that they should conduct a \u201cfull search\u201d automatically in such a situation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Officer Jenks testified that he \u201cjust searched\u201d Robinson,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he later added that he \u201cknew [the lump] wasn\u2019t cigarettes\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>because, being a crumpled package, it didn\u2019t feel like a cigarette pack through the jacket pocket.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One might fairly infer either that Officer Jenks formed no belief at all, or that, while somewhat inarticulate in describing it, he did perceive that trouble might arise later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">This uncertainty need not be resolved. With the crumpled package in the possession of Officer Jenks, he could not have had a reasonable belief that it would be dangerous. There is no claim that the external appearance of the package gave probable cause to believe that Robinson had committed another crime. The minority argues that this action was justifiable because inspection of any \u201cirregular\u201d object, after it has been removed from the arrestee\u2019s control, serves the \u201cprotective purpose\u201d of the search.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I agree that every part of a protective search, except the physical act of removing an object from the arrestee\u2019s control, is a search for indicia that a weapon is present. In this sense, a protective search is a search for \u201cevidence\u201d \u2014 evidence probative of whether the individual has a weapon on his person. But to define the allowable scope of such a search by reference solely to whether the information sought is sufficiently probative of the existence of weapons would be to render scope limitations meaningless, and to miss the point of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">As the Supreme Court has said, there are many motives for police misconduct that the exclusionary rule will not affect.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The primary deterrable motive for misconduct in cases like that before us is the desire to discover contraband. To suggest, as the minority does, that searches of objects that have been removed from the control of the arrestee are less intrusive than the most thorough Terry-type pat downs, and should therefore be approved as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, is to lump together types of conduct with widely differing potential for abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-14\">We may debate which of these two types of search is the more intrusive in a given case. If we acknowledge this uncertainty, and then focus our exclusionary rule inquiry on the police motivation to discover contraband, we are not thereby suggesting that we view the purpose of the Fourth Amendment as the protection of possession of that contraband. Rather we direct the rule at the overreaching that it is designed to prevent. As Officer Jenks\u2019 testimony below demonstrates,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> there is no substantial motive to engage in unnecessarily thorough Terry-type pat downs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-15\">Insofar as these two search techniques are alternative means to the common end of protection, the police should be required to use the one less likely to conceal a search forbidden by the Fourth Amendment. Indeed, if the Terry-type pat down shows itself also susceptible of misuse, we might have to consider whether there are other available means for police protection. For now, it suffices for me that when an officer conducts a post-arrest, in-custody search for protective purposes alone, he may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>search objects that he has removed, or can reasonably remove, from the control of the arrestee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">No more is required to dispose of this case. I will, however, briefly indulge my own concern \u2014 not about other eases, but about one issue in this case that we may avoid only because we exclude the evidence. Defense counsel has never questioned whether the original \u201croutine spot check\u201d that alerted Officer Jenks to the age discrepancy in Robinson\u2019s identification was conducted in accordance with minimal constitutional requirements. While counsel did challenge, on disputed testimony, the scope of the subsequent inquiry into Robinson\u2019s documentary identification, he and the District Court apparently accepted as controlling authority<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Miney v. District of Columbia, 218 A.2d 507 (1966), which held that such stops were not arrests, and thus were within the power of the police despite the absence of enabling legislation. That case, which of course is not binding on the District Court, did not squarely face the constitutional limitations on such procedures, and it antedated the Supreme Court\u2019s articulation in <em>Terry </em>of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s strictures on \u201call intrusions by agents of the public upon personal security.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-18\">This record does not disclose the circumstances surrounding Officer Jenks\u2019 decision to stop Robinson.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The applicable police regulations, however, may conceivably be interpreted as hints encouraging the use of spot checks to conceal Fourth Amendment violations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although the officer is instructed to be prepared to articulate his reasons for the stop if questioned by the subject, the vague reasons suggested to him imply more than a routine check for license and registration documents. Additionally, the concept, if not the definition, of a spot cheek is that it is random \u2014 for example, pursuant to a formula of one vehicle in ten or fifty. It is the antithesis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>of a stop based on reasons developed from the particular circumstances. Although the Court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence in this case makes it unnecessary to consider this matter, the responsible officials may find it appropriate to consider anew whether the spot-check procedures currently in use are consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">WILKEY, Circuit Judge, <em>dissenting, </em>with whom concur Circuit Judges TAMM, MacKINNON and ROBB: The search conducted in this case was reasonable in both justification and scope. Before proceeding to a detailed analysis, let us briefly put these two issues in perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">With reference to <em>justification </em>for the search, it must be realized at the outset that the frequent use of the terms \u201ctraffic violation\u201d or \u201cmere motor vehicle regulation\u201d in the majority opinion serves only to confuse the analysis of what search was proper in this case with what would be proper in the circumstances of a truly \u201croutine\u201d traffic offense \u2014 such as running a stop sign, exceeding the speed limit, etc. \u2014 which all of us at one time or another may commit. Robinson did not inadvertently slide through a red light or creep above the speed limit; he had had his driver\u2019s permit revoked, he had obtained a new permit by deliberately falsifying his application, and he was operating a vehicle without a valid permit. One is a statutory offense defined by Congress, the other a violation of a District of Columbia ordinance \u2014 both carrying penalties of fines and up to 10 days in jail or up to one year\u2019s imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-11\">Under police regulations Officer Jenks could not permit Robinson to go on his way with a summons, as the ordinary citizen who had been guilty of only a truly routine traffic violation. Officer Jenks was obligated to arrest and take custody of Robinson as he would have a burglar or armed robber caught <em>flagrante </em>delicto.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before the officer could take Robinson into custody in his patrol car, he was required by police standard operating procedure to search the man arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-13\">So we have here a search justified by a full custodial arrest, not a \u201cstop\u201d for investigation, and a search whose scope is related to the problem of custody, not just a \u201cfrisk\u201d for protection while an officer and suspect are conversing on the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-14\">With reference to <em>scope </em>of the search, let us also realize at the outset that the scope of the search involved here in no way remotely approached the outer limits of permissibility sanctioned by the Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for a \u201cfrisk\u201d after a \u201cstop.\u201d The contraband heroin was found in the outer pocket of Robinson\u2019s car coat, not in an area of the body necessitating a highly objectionable invasion of privacy in order to discover it. This is the evidence the majority would order suppressed on the ground the search was \u00ab\u00ab.reasonable by Fourth Amendment standards. Since this search underlies Robinson\u2019s conviction \u2014 reconviction on a new trial without the heroin in evidence would be an <em>impossibility </em>\u2014 a brief review of the exact sequence of events is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">The arrest occurred at 11:10 p. m. in a not too well illuminated residential area in Southeast Washington. After the arrest, in accord with the practice employed in over three thousand prior arrests for such offenses,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer Jenks advised Robinson of his rights and began what is known in standard police parlance as a \u201cfield type search\u201d for protective purposes incident to a \u201cfull custody arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Officer Jenks placed his hands on appellant\u2019s chest, he felt something in the outside left breast pocket of Robinson's \u201ccar coat.\u201d Because the coat was of heavy material, Officer Jenks could not determine either the size or the consistency of the object. In order to find out what the object was, he put his hand in appellant\u2019s pocket, which was open, and pulled out a \u201cwadded-up\u201d cigarette pack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">One thing was clear, this package did not contain cigarettes; Officer Jenks could feel \u201cobjects\u201d inside, he still could not tell what it contained. He then opened the package and discovered that it contained gelatin capsules, later tested to be narcotics. After seeing the capsules, probably containing contraband, he put the package in his own pocket and continued the protective search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">I. <em>A Search Incident to Arrest was Permissible Here</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">The search conducted in this ease must be tested against the long-established doctrine upholding the constitutionality of a warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest. In a recent treatise, the general rule concerning such searches was aptly stated as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-9\">[U]pon a search incident to a lawful arrest the police may search for and seize weapons by which the prisoner may injure the officers or others or effect his escape, incriminating articles connected with the crime as its fruits or the means by which it was committed, also stolen property and other items which it is unlawful for the prisoner to possess, i. e., contraband. In connection with such a search the officers may seize not only evidence tending to establish the crime for which the arrest is made but also evidence of other crimes.\u00ae</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">Such searches incident to arrest are extremely common, outnumbering many-fold searches covered by warrants, a fact which is usually ignored or misstated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Probably the practice is \u201cas old as the institution of arrest.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>The constitutionality of such a procedure cannot be seriously challenged.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Particularly with regard to the protective purpose of such a search, the absence of a warrant is justified by the emergency created by the arrest itself. Indeed, it has been suggested by a noted scholar that the framers of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s search provision considered immediate search of an arrestee inherently reasonable, and viewed the warrant as a not entirely satisfactory way of regulating those searches which might be unreasonable because they did not accompany a valid arrest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">The search conducted in this case clearly fits within this general doctrine of search incident to arrest. Without question, this was a valid arrest. It is also clear that the arrest in this case was not a mere pretext for the search.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Officer Jenks was not a narcotics officer who manufactured a reason for the arrest in order to establish grounds for a warrantless search for suspected contraband. To the contrary, he had a special interest in the exact type of arrest made in this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He was legitimately interested in tracking Robinson down for driving after revocation. Since the arrest originated with this valid purpose, and was legally consummated, the search must be viewed as having been incident to the arrest rather than the reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-14\">Further, this search was in fact undertaken with the permissible purpose of protecting both the officer and the prisoner from the potential of violent use of concealed weapons. Officer Jenks testified that he understood that protection was the major reason police standard operating procedures require a search in these circumstances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He knew that small deadly weapons could be concealed on Robinson\u2019s person. Indeed, he vividly recalled an instance in which a fellow officer was cut by a prisoner\u2019s razor blade which had gone undetected during an arrest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-15\">Although the record does show that Officer Jenks took steps to \u201ccontrol\u201d the prisoner<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and understood the protective purpose of this routine search, there is no explicit indication that he was ever actually in fear of violence from Robinson. However, a purely subjective test of the presence or absence of personal fear on the part of the arresting officer does not determine the constitutional validity of this search incident to arrest and custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-16\">It is true that in examining the permissible grounds for a limited search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number><em>without arrest, </em>a \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d the Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio set out a requirement that there be actual, articulable fear of danger.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Robinson is not a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d situation; the <em>Terry </em>test with reference to fear as a predicate or justification for search does not apply because there was a valid arrest in Robinson\u2019s ease. However, the rationale of <em>Terry </em>does support this search. According to <em>Terry, </em>one of the factors which may be considered in testing the reasonable need for a protective search is an anticipation of danger based on the officer\u2019s experience.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The fact of Robinson\u2019s arrest, not any subjective feeling of fear by the individual officer, brought this case under police procedures requiring a protective search. These standardized procedures represent the distillation of the experience of the entire police force, not just that of a particular officer. That experience obviously produced the reasonable inference that the act of custodial arrest itself, such as we have here, does create a potentially dangerous situation, and strict regulations were devised and promulgated to deal with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">The training of a police officer, like the training of a soldier, must be designed to maximize simplicity, clarity of instructions, and standardization of procedures. For his own protection the soldier is taught to do things instinctively; he is drilled repeatedly in certain procedures until even in times of great stress he reacts automatically by doing the correct thing. In part, the same is true of the police officer; he is taught certain standardized procedures for his own protection, so that in time of stress he will instinctively take the correct action.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">For a police officer, the \u201ccorrect action\u201d is designed not only to protect the officer, and other persons, but to prevent unjustifiable intrusions into citizens\u2019 private affairs. While search and seizure cases are frequently viewed as the classical confrontation of the rights of the individual versus the rights of society, I cannot stress this too strongly: The uninstructed individual judgment of each policeman on every situation <em>ad hoc </em>is likely to result in more violations of individual rights than will obedience to carefully prescribed standard procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">Indeed, the availability of such standard operating procedures, based on a reasonable general inference, may well be exactly what helped keep fear from interfering with Officer Jenks\u2019 effectiveness. We should not let the fact that an officer was operating in accordance with routine protective procedures, rather than out of personal fear, become the factor determinative of the reasonableness of his actions. To the contrary, this circumstance merely changes the question which faces the court from the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s suspicions to the reasonableness of the protective routine he followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-14\">Focusing on the reasonableness of the routine serves the valuable function of providing a more objective standard for judicial review and police guidance. Illusive and unreliable inquiry into the officer\u2019s emotional state would be avoided. The difficult inquiry into emotions may be necessary in <em>Terry </em>situations where it is the only available test of reasonableness. In contrast, this routine search incident to custodial arrest more nearly resembles the case of an officer acting pursuant to the guidelines set forth in a search warrant. No <em>personal </em>suspicion of the presence of evidence is required of the officer, if he stays within the pre-set limits, in such situations. The <em>prior </em>determination of reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>grounds to search and of the reasonable scope of the search is what is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Judge Wright\u2019s opinion rests on the proposition that, regardless of actual police practice or regulations, <em>any </em>search incident to a \u201croutine traffic arrest\u201d is, absent special circumstances, unreasonable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Given the large number of police injuries which have accompanied what at first appeared to be routine automobile stops, I do not accept that proposition.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, although this was a traffic arrest, it was not minor; it was for a serious offense, and the majority opinion at footnote 18 so admits. Aside from these two arguments, more convincingly and to the point, a careful analysis of the possible rationales for a limit on searches incident to minor traffic arrests makes it clear that this particular arrest and search does not fall within any such limited rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">To brush aside the argument usually first advanced, the fact that most traffic offenses, as is true of this one, have no fruits or instrumentalities justifying an evidentiary search is simply irrelevant. This was not an evidentiary search.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It cannot therefore be either justified or condemned because there was no potential for the discovery of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">Another argument for prohibiting searches incident to traffic arrests is the temptation to use such minor infractions, of which anyone may be guilty at some point, as a pretext for the search which follows. However, unlike speeding, driving after revocation is not the sort of offense which is so common that it could readily serve as a vehicle for pretextual arrest. In addition, as discussed above, there is absolutely no basis for concluding that this arrest was in fact pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">A third argument suggests that since minor traffic arrests are so numerous, accompanying searches would create intense community resentment. If conducted in all such cases, the searches would be viewed as unnecessary harassment. If conducted only in some cases, with the search justified by arrest rather than the grounds outlined in <em>Terry, </em>the searches would probably create a suspicion, whether or not justified, of discriminatory harassment. However, it must once again be remembered that the offense prompting the arrest here, driving after revocation, is not a common or insignificant offense.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is a serious crime for which, according to standing police orders, the suspect must be placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>under full custody arrest.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A grave loss of liberty is inevitable. The further intrusion of a limited search could hardly add significantly to Robinson\u2019s sense of resentment. And because the offense is rare and serious, the consequences he suffers will not become commonplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">Finally, and most importantly, a rule barring searches in the context of minor traffic offenses essentially rests on the conclusion that no reasonable inference of danger can be drawn in such instances. That is simply not true in this case, and the court\u2019s entire position, invalidating this protective search, rests on the false premise that there was no reason for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">That premise is false for two principal reasons: First, although the nature of the offense here may not in itself demonstrate a propensity to aggressive violence, its seriousness does indicate that the arrestee will have a strong motive to escape from arrest. The Congress provided that driving after revocation can be punished by a fine of as much as $500, a year in jail, or both.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In addition, the deliberate commission of one such serious offense does reasonably suggest the possibility that the suspect may have other strong reasons for wanting to avoid police custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">Second, as noted above, a police General Order requires that one suspected of driving after revocation must be placed in full custody arrest and taken to the police station. This procedure, reasonable in itself because of the likelihood that the suspect will not respond to a mere citation, necessarily placed the officer in proximity to his prisoner for a considerable period of time. It must be distinguished from the very brief encounters associated with either a <em>Terry </em>stop or a normal traffic citation. Both a strong motive to escape and prolonged contact obviously raise the danger that the prisoner will be willing and able to reach concealed weapons and use them against the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">In short, whatever reasons there may be for a rule barring searches incident to minor traffic arrests, those reasons constitute no logical, relevant rationale on which to invalidate a protective search following apprehension for a serious offense, involving custody of a possibly armed prisoner, which we admittedly have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">II. <em>The Search Was Reasonable in Scope</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">Having concluded that a protective search was justified under these circumstances, I would also hold that this particular search did not go beyond the permissible scope of an inquiry supported by this justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-15\">The withdrawal of the cigarette pack from Robinson\u2019s pocket was clearly permissible. Beginning with the least intrusive step possible, a \u201cpat down\u201d of Robinson\u2019s outer clothing, Jenks came upon an object which <em>could </em>have been a concealed weapon. Jenks could not tell exactly what the object was. But testimony of a concealed weapons expert at the remand hearing makes it clear that a great many deadly or incapacitating weapons could have been concealed in a pocket the size of Robinson\u2019s in such a way that the pat down could have discovered their presence but could <em>not </em>have revealed whether they were weapons, or indeed whether they were hard or soft. In an amazingly graphic demonstration the expert showed that he had concealed upon his person twenty-five weapons \u201cthat could kill or incapacitate.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It should be noted that one of the weapons produced, a .22 pistol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>made from a small aluminum tube, was in fact concealed in a cigarette package.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Even after Jenks was able to feel the size and texture of the cigarette pack inside the pocket, his remaining uncertainty was legitimate. He could have squeezed the pack while it was still in Robinson\u2019s pocket. But all that would have told him was that the \u201cobjects\u201d inside were definitely not cigarettes. The possibility remained that they were any number of harmful objects, from small blades to live bullets. That possibility is exactly what the routine protective search procedure was designed to eliminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">With the question of potential danger unresolved, Officer Jenks\u2019 withdrawal of the package from the pocket was entirely necessary and proper. As previously stated, the tests established under <em>Terry </em>do not necessarily apply here. But both \u201cfrisks\u201d and this search incident to arrest share a protective purpose. Since the risk of violence is probably greater in the case of a full custody arrest than it is in the case of a <em>Terry </em>stop, the search here should be allowed to be at least as thorough. So it is significant that Jenks\u2019 action would be permissible even if the standards established in <em>Terry </em>did apply.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">To be safe, the arresting officer must not only discover potential weapons but also confirm the dangerous nature of the weapon and disarm the arrestee. A pat down would be totally worthless if the arresting officer were prohibited from going further once he had discovered the possibility of unknown danger. A requirement of absolute certainty as to the existence and nature of a weapon before the officer could explore further would assure that any cleverly disguised device remained in the prisoner\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">It also follows that the opening and inspection of the cigarette pack was within the permissible scope of a reasonable protective search incident to arrest. It is established that a search can only remain allowable if each part of the procedure is reasonably related in scope to the justification for its initiation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This last phase of the search meets that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">Even when the cigarette pack was visible, the nature of its contents remained unresolved. It could have contained weapons.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It clearly did not appear to contain cigarettes. Of course, since the package was now in the officer\u2019s possession, any risk of the prisoner\u2019s use of a weapon in this package had been eliminated. But further inspection of the package was still justifiable as a protective measure. If the package <em>had </em>contained a razor blade, or live bullets, the officer would have been alerted to search Robinson much more thoroughly since the possibility of there being other weapons concealed on his person would increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\">It is highly important to note at this point that Officer Jenks\u2019 peek into the cigarette pack had the same purpose and function as every other step in the pat down. Initially, when the arrestee stands before the officer, he contains a potential for danger, quantum unknown. The officer\u2019s prescribed search routine is designed first to discover and then to eliminate that potential for danger. He has the right, unquestioned by the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>jority here, of making the type search authorized by the Supreme Court in <em>Terry </em>in a stop-and-frisk situation. In a full custody arrest situation, Robinson\u2019s case, the officer can legitimately be even more thorough, the exact scope depending on the indicia of danger he encounters in his search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">With the possible exception of <em>confiscation </em>of a <em>discovered </em>weapon, everything the officer does during a pat down is aimed at discovering indicia of potential danger. Jenks\u2019 routine was designed <em>both </em>to neutralize the individual weapons discovered <em>and </em>to obtain their warning that other potential danger might be present. The fact that the potential weapon in the cigarette pack has been removed from the arrestee\u2019s control simply does not destroy its function, shared with that of additional indicia for which the officer can clearly continue to look, as a clue to further danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">When Officer Jenks found the cigarette package \u2014 which clearly did not contain cigarettes \u2014 the basic overall question he had set out to answer was still unresolved, what, potential danger did the prisoner in custody represent to Jenks and others? If the cigarette package had appeared to contain cigarettes, on these facts alone in this case, Jenks might have been unjustified in opening the package, his inquiry in this sector would have been satisfactorily resolved.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But it was certain the package contained something else besides cigarettes, Jenks knew from his training it could have been one of several different type weapons, the potential of danger \u2014 the original motivating question of the whole protective search \u2014 could not b\u00e9 resolved without looking into the package, and so he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">This action flowed logically and naturally from the whole rationale of a protective search, and was as completely justified as initiating this protective custodial-arrest search originally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">Officer Jenks specifically testified that the nature and scope of his protective searches varied depending on how he perceived the risk.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> When the mysterious package was found, Jenks was conducting a face-to-face search of the type used when less danger is perceived. Discovery of one weapon would very likely have prompted the protective measure of turning Robinson around and placing him with his hands against a wall or the car for a more thorough \u201cpat down\u201d search. Thus, the potential contents of the package were highly relevant to Jenks\u2019 legitimate self-protective purposes. Since the cigarette package gave notice of irregular contents, and could have revealed hidden danger, Jenks\u2019 inspection, and the routine commanding it, should be held to fall fully within the justifiable scope of a protective search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">The routine Officer Jenks followed here allows some flexibility based on the officer\u2019s perception of risk, and this we should approve. Such procedures may well spare those who legitimately appear harmless from the indignities of as full a search as might be permissible in any given instance. However, that sort of flexibility would be impossible unless the officer\u2019s routine allows investigation of the unusual and suspicious in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>determine what level of risk in fact exists. In short, the officer should not be allowed to manufacture, nor should he be forced to ignore, those alert signals which indicate what degree of thoroughness will produce adequate protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">I reach my conclusions in this case on the basis of several fundamental propositions concerning the application of the exclusionary rule which deserve explanation. Exclusion of admittedly probative evidence represents a sacrifice of the social values of accurate judicial decision-making and punishment of the discovered crimes. This sacrifice is made in order to deter unreasonable intrusions by the police. Any application of the exclusionary rule must necessarily take this conflict of values into account. The offensiveness of the intrusion and the likelihood of its being deterred must be balanced against the sacrifice to truth and law enforcement.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">We should be mindful, therefore, that the case before us involves a type of intrusi\u00f3n far less offensive to the average person than would be the inspection of private papers or the thorough search of a home. Indeed, Jenks\u2019 peek into Robinson\u2019s cigarette pack is a far cry from what <em>Terry </em>allows, even without the added dangers stemming from a full custody arrest. In <em>Terry </em>the Court described a permissible \u201cfrisk\u201d in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-14\">[T]he officer must feel with sensitive fingers every portion of the prisoner\u2019s body. A thorough search must be made of the prisoner\u2019s arms and armpits, waistline and back, the groin and area about the testicles, and entire surface of the legs down to the feet.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-15\">It is utterly inconceivable to me that Judge Wright can take this as the accepted standard for a permissible \u201cfrisk\u201d' \u2014 but take it they must because this is the Supreme Court\u2019s standard\u2014 and yet hold impermissible Officer Jenks\u2019 search of the contents of the <em>outer </em>pocket of Robinson\u2019s car coat, a protective search made after arrest by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>officer alone at 11:10 p. m. as a prelude to taking custody and transporting the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">If we accept the <em>Terry </em>standard of constitutional \u201creasonableness\u201d for a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d situation, Judge Wright\u2019s holding that the step-by-step search after arrest of Robinson\u2019s open outside breast pocket was treasonable seems to me logically indefensible. Here we can profitably revert to the fundamental principle that the Fourth Amendment condemns only treasonable searches. If a probing of a person\u2019s most sensitive and private areas can be justified for protective purposes, the outer pocket of a car coat (whether specifically listed by the Supreme Court or not) should be considered within the orbit of reasonable search for that same protective purpose.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>We should also be mindful that the exclusionary rule\u2019s primary goal, deterrence, will not be well served by the decision that this search was unreasonable. If society highly values the safety of its police officers, they probably and understandably value it even more. Limits to their self-protective routines must, of course, be drawn; but it is one thing to ask the officer to pass up evidence and quite another to ask him, by foregoing a minimally intrusive technique, to expose himself to a greater and very real risk of bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Finally, we should be aware that a primary flaw in the development of the exclusionary rule has been a continuing abstraction of analysis which puzzles judges in their chambers and requires a hairline constitutional analysis literally impossible of application by the officer in the field. Many police departments have attempted to deal with this problem by training their officers in a set routine, which has evolved from both court decisions on the limits of allowable search and police experience with (among other things) the risks inherent in different situations. This dissent has stressed that this is a sound approach which will tend to minimize intrusion into individual privacy (much more than would a policy of <em>ad hoc </em>individual judgments espoused by Judge Wright) while maximizing safety for all society.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">The fact that Officer Jenks was following routine police procedure of course does not validate either the decision to search or the scope of the search. The reasonableness of that routine itself is precisely what this court must consider. What the presence of the routine does provide is a shift in the focus of the court\u2019s inquiry from the personal fear of the officer to the codified judgment of his superiors \u2014 the established\" routine as followed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">Officer Jenks\u2019 statement that he \u201cjust searched him,\u201d which seems highly important to Judge Wright\u2019s opinion, must be viewed in light of other testimony indicating that the absence of personal fear of danger resulted from the very fact that such protective searches had actually become routine for this officer. The record shows that Officer Jenks knew this search routine was for protective purposes. Viewed in that light, he was not indulging in mere \u201ccuriosity\u201d but \u201croutine curiosity with a protective purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">Since the fact of custodial arrest and the protective purpose present here validate the decision to search, the valid scope of the search is the other issue to be considered. The look inside the cigarette pack, commanded by routine, served a protective function which must be weighed against its intrusiveness. Indeed, as emphasized above, Officer Jenks\u2019 peek had the same purpose as every other step in a pat down \u2014 discovering indicia of potential danger. Here, as I have set forth the rationale of a constitutionally \u201creasonable\u201d search, the physical perceptions of the officer, as opposed to his subjective emotional state, become important. He had legitimately come across an unusual and irregular object \u2014 the precise nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>which he could not determine. The object could have contained weapons \u2014 the discovery of which would counsel further protective measures. A police routine designed to guide appropriate action when doubt is present could counsel one of two actions at that moment. It could require that he always assume the worst and immediately spread-eagle the arrestee during the rest of the pat down. Here, it instead suggested further examination of the irregular object. In addition to being the natural human response, this course avoids unnecessary and embarrassing spread-eagle searches. It is minimally intrusive on the arrestee\u2019s right to privacy. That right of privacy, not the right to conceal contraband, is what the Fourth Amendment protects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">I conclude that the search conducted by Officer Jenks under such a standard operating procedure falls within the permissible scope of any reasonable self-protective search routine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">Robinson\u2019s conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1171-9\">. <em>See, e. g\u201e </em>40 D.C.Code \u00a7 302(d) (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1171-10\">. <em>See </em>General Order No. 3, Series 1959, Metropolitan Police Department, April 24, 1959 <em>(quoted in </em>Plurality Opinion at 23 n. 23).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1171-11\">. 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1171-12\">. 392 U.S. 40, 62, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1902, 20 L.Ed .2d 917 (1968) (emphasis added) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-14\">The inquiry under [the Fourth Amendment] may differ sharply from the inquiry set up by the categories of [the New York stop-and-frisk statute].

Tr., pp. 79-80. To the extent that standard police procedure might counsel a broader search, such as inspection of regular-appearing objects after their removal from the arrestee, that routine would be suspect. Contrary to Judge Wright\u2019s suggestion at his footnote 9, Officer Jenks was not conducting that sort of \u201cfull\u201d search here. Rather, he was following up the clue provided by an unusual object. Starting with the overall regular appearance of any given arrestee, an arresting officer must of necessity progressively narrow the focus of his inquiry by glossing over what appears normal and satisfying himself with respect to objects, the appearance of which ho <em>cannot explain, </em>but which <em>could </em>contain clues of danger.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1181-13\">.

I must respectfully suggest that Judge Wright\u2019s opinion seriously misconstrues the American Law Institute position on searches like that of Robinson. Judge Wright asserts \u201cthe American Law Institute concludes that a police officer may not conduct a full search of an individual arrested for \u2018a traffic offense or other misdemeanor, the elements and circumstances of which involve no unlawful possession or violent, or intentionally or recklessly dangerous, conduct. . . . \u2019 And this is so whether or not the offender is taken into custody.\u201d The omitted part of ALI Search and Seizure, Section 230.2, reads: <em>Provided, </em>That this Section shall not be construed to forbid the search for dangerous weapons authorized by Section 110.2(4) of Part I if the circumstances described in Section 110.2(1) thereof are present at the time of the arrest.\u201d Section 110.2, <em>Stopping of Persons, </em>(1) <em>Cases in Which Stop Is Authorized, </em>is not applicable here, because the circumstances described therein deal with justification for a \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d whereas in Robinson\u2019s case we have a custodial search after an admittedly lawful arrest. Section 110.2(4) is somewhat illuminating but not directly applicable either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-9\">(4) <em>Prisk for Dangerous Weapons. </em>A law enforcement officer who has stopped any person pursuant to this section may, if the officer reasonably believes that his safety or the safety of others then present so requires, search for any dangerous weapon by an external patting of such person\u2019s outer clothing. If in the course of such search he feels an object which he reasonably believes to be a dangerous weapon, he may take such action as is necessary to examine such object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anc\">This of course is virtually the <em>Terry </em>standard for a \u201cfrisk\u201d after a \u201cstop.\u201d As made clear above, logically one cannot <em>accept </em>the scope of the \u201cfrisk\u201d after a \u201cstop\u201d permitted by the <em>Terry </em>standard and <em>reject </em>the scope of the full custodial search for protective purposes after arrest made of Robinson here.</p>\n<p id=\"ANJ\">But if the majority wishes to resort to American Law Institute standards to sustain its holding that the cigarette package of heroin capsules should\u00a1 be suppressed as evidence at the trial, I suggest resort to Section 290.2, Determination of Motions to Suppress Evidence of that same ALI Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-14\">(2) <em>Determination. </em>A motion to suppress evidence shall be granted only if the court finds that the violation upon which it is based was substantial, or if otherwise required by the Constitution of the United States or of this State. In determining whether a violation is substantial the court shall consider all the circumstances, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-16\">(a) the importance of the particular interest violated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-17\">(b) the extent of deviation from lawful conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-18\">(c) the extent to which the violation was willful;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-19\">(d) the extent to which privacy was invaded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-20\">(e) the extent to which exclusion will tend to prevent violations of this Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-21\">(f) whether, but for the violation, the things seized would have been discovered ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-22\">(g) the extent to which the violation prejudiced the moving party\u2019s ability to support his motion, or to defend himself in the proceeding in which the things seized are sought to be offered in evidence against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1183-23\">The inspection of the cigarette package contents from the outer pocket of Robinson\u2019s car coat could hardly be termed a \u201csubstantial\u201d violation, especially when ranged alongside the permissible limits of invasion of privacy set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Terry. </em>But this question deals with the Exclusionary Rule, and this dissent does not rest on the question of the applicability of the Exclusionary Rule, rather on the premise that by accepted standards the search of Robinson should be held \u201creasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">. Judge Wright\u2019s opinion throughout is based on a subjective approach, i. e., whether the officer actually felt fear and acted on that in making the search. In so doing, I submit Judge Wright interjects the <em>Terry </em>requirements for a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d into a full custodial arrest situation, which is quite different, and which I urge can best be handled by a more objective, standardized routine approach. I say \u201cbest\u201d, and I mean \u201cbest\u201d for society, the officer, and the individual apprehended. But even if we should decide Robinson\u2019s ease on the subjective standards of Judge Wright, what is reasonable in this case must in great part be judged through the eyes of a police officer, alone on a lightly traveled street at 11:10 p. m., not from the vantage point of anyone in an acadamic or judicial sanctuary. If hairline constitutional distinctions cause judges to divide 5-4 in their opinions, the police officer on the line, operating in accord with prescribed standard procedures, should get the benefit of the doubt, not the criminal with capsules of heroin boldly carried in his outer pocket.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
