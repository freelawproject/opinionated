Neither party has taken testimony. The record consists of the pleadings, appellee\u2019s application, a copy of appellant\u2019s registration, and copies of numerous third party registrations relied on by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-24\">The record in this ease does not make clear just what is meant by \u201cindustrial thread.\u201d The board noted that the term\u2019s meaning was unclear, and felt that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-25\">[S]ince the goods set forth in the application and opposer\u2019s registration are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>on their face distinctly different, industrial thread as opposed to items of wearing apparel, opposer was under the obligation in the first instance to show that these goods are related in some manner and/or that the conditions surrounding the marketing of these products are such that they would be likely to be encountered by the same persons under circumstances that could give rise * * * to the mistaken belief that they originate from or are in Some way associated with the same producer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">The board further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-5\">[Although thread may be used in the manufacture of wearing apparel, applicant is seeking to register its mark for \u201cindustrial thread\u201d and not thread, per se, and we cannot assume, in the absence of evidence in this regard, that \u201cindustrial thread\u201d may be suitable for and is, in fact, used in the manufacture of such garments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">Appellant argues that the board erroneously assigned it the burden of proof with regard to the nature of appellee\u2019s goods and the channels of trade through which they travel. Appellant concedes that the burden was initially on it as opposer to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of likelihood of confusion, but argues that it met that burden by \u201cshowing that thread is a necessary component in the manufacture and repairing of wearing apparel.\u201d Appellant contends that once it had demonstrated that thread was a component of wearing apparel, the burden of going forward with the evidence -fell upon appellee. In appellant\u2019s view, appellee failed to rebut its <em>prima facie </em>case since appellee produced no evidence concerning the nature of \u201cindustrial thread.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">We, like the board, are unable to determine the nature of the goods described by appellee as \u201cindustrial thread\u201d in the application at bar. In view of the requirement in the law that the description of goods in an application for registration be specific,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we consider it proper in this case to construe appellee\u2019s description of its goods in the manner most favorable to appellant. In our view, the term \u201cindustrial thread\u201d is broad enough to reasonably include thread utilized in the clothing industry to make items of clothing such as those listed in appellant\u2019s registration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-12\">In spite of our interpretation of appellee\u2019s term \u201cindustrial thread,\u201d we are unable to find likelihood of confusion between WONDERTHREAD and WONDERCORD by DAVID CRYSTAL, as those marks are applied to the respective goods. While appellee\u2019s mark is almost identical in meaning with what might be termed the dominant portion of appellant\u2019s mark, the marks have obvious differences in sound and appearance, and are laudatory in nature. Moreover, as pointed out by the board,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-13\">Thread is sold to garment manufacturers whereas the finished garments are sold to the general purchasing public and, in the absence of evidence that garment manufacturers, as in the case of fabrics and, at times, yarn, advise their customers of the brand of thread used in the production of their garments, once again it cannot be assumed that applicant\u2019s thread mark would be ever encountered by purchasers of opposerls apparel so that an opportunity for confusion could, in fact, arise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>Thus appellant has failed to introduce evidence relative to the channels of trade followed by thread used in the wearing apparel industry which would establish his case for likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1307-26\">.
