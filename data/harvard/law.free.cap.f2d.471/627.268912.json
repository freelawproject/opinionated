The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on April 24, 1972. Exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s opinion, findings of fact and recommended conclusion of law were filed by defendant, plaintiff urged their adoption and the case has been submitted to the court on oral argument of counsel and the briefs of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">In this case the court stresses once again (see Duhon v. United States, 461 F.2d 1278, 198 Ct.Cl. 564 (1972)), that the statutory charter of the boards for correction of military records (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552) provides for correction of <em>\u201cany </em>military record\u201d when considered necessary \u201cto correct an error <em>or remove an </em>injustice\u201d (emphasis added). The court has absolutely no doubt that under this liberal standard, together with the admitted facts, the board was required to change plaintiff\u2019s records to show that he was properly ordered on active duty for the period from 1-5 July 1966, and was therefore properly ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days within 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201. The board\u2019s contrary determination was arbitrary and capricious under the controlling standard as well as unsupported by substantial evidence and legally erroneous. The record compelled the board to correct plaintiff\u2019s records in order to \u201cremove an injustice\u201d against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">Since the court agrees with the commissioner\u2019s opinion, findings of fact and recommended conclusion of law, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby adopts the same, together with the foregoing paragraph, as the basis for its judgment in this case. Therefore, it is concluded that plaintiff is entitled to recover and judgment is entered for plaintiff with the amount of recovery to be determined pursuant to Rule 131(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>OPINION OF COMMISSIONER</p>\n<author id=\"b691-5\">SPECTOR, Commissioner:</author>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Plaintiff was a lieutenant colonel in the U. S. Army Active Reserve. Until the date of his separation, as hereinafter described, he had experienced distinguished military service, having entered upon active duty before the United States entered World War II. During the war he received a number of decorations. His active and reserve service 1941 through 30 June 1966, computed under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1208 and 1333, totaled 10 years and 39 days, and his postwar service in the Army Reserve had been considerably above average. For example, in the 5-year period just prior to the events which led to this lawsuit, he had served more than 500 days on active duty. From 1946 through 1966 plaintiff had accumulated a total of 1,847 points for his reserve service, 841 of these points between 1962 and 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">By letter orders of the Headquarters XIII U.S. Army Corps, Fort Devens, Massachusetts, dated 28 April 1966, plaintiff was ordered to active duty for training with the Rhode Island Subsector Command, Providence, Rhode Island, for a period of 25 days from 1 June 1966 \u201cunless sooner relieved <em>or extended by :proper authority.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.] Those orders of 28 April were in fact extended to read \u201c30 days from 1 June 1966\u201d by an amendment of 21 June 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Although not essential to plaintiff\u2019s case, it is observed in passing that his service pursuant to these orders was not in fact \u201cactive duty for training\u201d (ACDUTRA). In reality, plaintiff\u2019s duty consisted of supervision of the reserve units comprising the Rhode Island Sub-sector Command as assistant commander under its commanding officer, a Lt. Col. Charles J. Hillsdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">On 28 June 1966, Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale requested leave from his commanding officer for the period 1 July to 5 July 1966 so that he might travel to Chicago and visit his mother who was ill. His request for leave was granted by Col. Bertil B. Sandell, the Chief of Staff of the XIII U.S. Army Corps, Fort Devens, Massachusetts, conditioned, however, upon Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale\u2019s assurance that he would be able to designate another officer to take over his duties during his absence. Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale was the only officer permanently assigned to the Rhode Island Subsector Command.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">Accordingly, Lieutenant Colonel Hills-dale asked plaintiff to defer 3 days of annual leave the latter had earned and was scheduled to take 1 July through 3 July 1966, and to extend his active duty from 1 July until 5 July 1966 when Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale was scheduled to return from Chicago. As commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale ordered plaintiff to assume command of the Rhode Island Subsector until his return. Such orders are generally characterized as \u201cverbal orders of the commanding officer\u201d (VOCO).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">Pursuant to those orders, plaintiff assumed command of the Rhode Island Sub-sector, actually occupying that office until 5 July 1966 and performing the duties required thereby. These included supervision of units preparing to leave for annual active duty training, procuring of orders for such units, and administrative assistance to \u2019them. When Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale returned on 5 July, plaintiff briefed him on the events which had occurred during his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">Prior to this, by letter orders dated 2 June and 17 June 1966, plaintiff had been scheduled to proceed to Fort Knox, Kentucky, 6 July 1966 for 17 additional days of active duty for training (ACDUTRA). Accordingly, he left the Rhode Island Subsector Command at Providence on 6 July as a member of the advance party of his parent unit, and proceeded to Fort Knox where he conducted classes for the fourth year Command and General Staff School. While he was there on 13 July 1966, plaintiff was contacted by Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale and asked if he would consider continuing on active duty at Providence upon his return from Fort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Knox. Plaintiff accepted, and orders were in fact being prepared for his return to Providence when the unfortunate events hereinafter described took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s duties at Port Knox had been physically taxing. In his capacity as training director he had been lifting heavy boxes of training manuals and climbing flights of stairs during the period 8-16 July 1966. There was a dearth of transportation at Fort Knox and he was also required to walk a considerable distance to his quarters. On 13 July 1966 he reported to the dispensary complaining of feeling ill. He was given medication for an upset stomach. He remained on duty during that week, constantly complaining of illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">On 16 July 1966 at about 5 p. m., however, he requested another officer at the school to drive him to the hospital because he felt extremely ill. An electrocardiogram taken in the emergency room at Ireland Army Hospital, Fort Knox, Kentucky, revealed an acute diaphragmatic wall infarction (heart attack).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Plaintiff was ultimately released from the Ireland Army Hospital on 23 August 1966. A medical report dated 17 August 1966 concluded that upon his entrance on active duty plaintiff \u201cappeared to be in good health and there was no evidence of any misconduct on his part contributing to his heart attack.\u201d The report further indicated that he had no family history of cardiac disease. The examining physician concluded that plaintiff was \u201cunfit for further military service under Chapter III, AR 40-501, Section 9, paragraph 321, Arteriosclerotic heart disease with objective evidence of myocardial infarction.\u201d Accordingly, he recommended \u201cthat the patient be returned to his local unit for further evaluation and separation procedures.\u201d The examining physician\u2019s report was confirmed in the report of a medical board dated 22 August 1966, and plaintiff was released from active duty on 23 August 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">By means of a check mark on the medical board report, plaintiff\u2019s heart attack was characterized as not in line of duty. He appealed that determination 19 December 1966, and on 14 February 1967, the Secretary of the Army reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">2. It is held by the Department of the Army that the myocardial infarction (A disease) for which officer was hospitalized 16 July 1966 at Fort Knox, Kentucky, during the performance of active duty for training was incurred in line of duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">3. It is requested that all records be changed accordingly and that LTC Skaradowski be advised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Subsequently plaintiff tried by letter of 1 June 1967 to secure a waiver of his physical disqualification because he wanted to continue his career in the U.S. Army Reserve. His application for a waiver reviewed his educational attainments, his decorations and commendations, his 17 years in the active reserve in increasingly responsible assignments, and his 500 days of active duty in the 5 years immediately preceding his heart attack. However, on 27 August 1967, after a physical examination of plaintiff, it was determined that he was not qualified for retention because of his heart condition. He has since been rated 30 percent disabled by the Veterans Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">The issue in this case originates in plaintiff\u2019s application dated 25 September 1967 for immediate placement on the Disability Retired List. He was told to apply to the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records (ABCMR) in order to qualify for retired status. This he did, 12 June 1968, asking \u201cto have his records corrected to show that, while on an extended period of active duty from 1 June 1966 to 23 July 1966, he was permanently disabled from a disease (myocardial infarction) while entitled to receive basic pay, and that the disability was incurred in the line of duty.\u201d His application continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-15\">* * * should such a correction be entered in his records, Colonel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Skaradowski would qualify for retirement under the provisions of 10 USC \u00a7 1201.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The determination of the ABCMR was adverse to plaintiff and he was so advised by the Adjutant General 21 November 1968. The reason given was simply \u201cthat insufficient, evidence had been presented to indicate probable material error or injustice * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">When he requested reconsideration, the Executive Secretary of the ABCMR provided a more specific reason for denial of plaintiff\u2019s application, namely, insufficient evidence that plaintiff was on active duty during the period he served as subsector commander for Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale pursuant to verbal orders (VOCO), as heretofore described.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">The parties have, by stipulation, agreed to the admission of a number of joint exhibits. One of these is a statement from Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale\u2019s commander, the aforementioned Col. Bertil B. Sandell. The statement dated 19 March 1969 advises in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">c. At this date, I cannot personally remember positively that Lt. Col. Skaradowski was designated to act for Lt. Col. Hillsdale during this period. However, having read a statement made by Lt. Col. Hillsdale (15 February 1968), I have verified that Col. Skaradowski was on active duty 1-5 July 1966, while Col. Hillsdale was in Chicago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">d. XIII USAC was inactivated on 1 July 1968; consequently, it is not possible to issue orders reflecting Lt. Col. Skaradowski\u2019s period of active duty on 1-5 July 1966.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">As a matter of fact, in a brief supplementary stipulation, the parties have narrowed the issue to the question of whether or not plaintiff was on active duty between 1 June 1966 and 5 July 1966. The period 1 July 1966 to 5 July 1966, pursuant to VOCO, serves as a bridge between the two periods specifically covered by letter orders, as above described.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, if plaintiff was on active duty between 1 July 1966 and 5 July 1966, there can be no question that he was called or ordered to active duty, as extended, for a period of more than 30 days, and he would be entitled to prevail. There are no other issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">Plaintiff was clearly on active duty during the connective period 1-5 July 1966. With what appears on this record to have been typical loyalty to the service, he acted as commander of the Rhode Island Subsector Command in place of its regular commander pursuant to the latter\u2019s order. It is in fact stipulated that Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale \u201cthereupon <em>ordered </em>the plaintiff to assume command of the Rhode Island Sub-sector until his return\u201d and that plaintiff <em>\u201cpursuant to such order, </em>assumed command of the Rhode Island Subsector and actually occupied such office until 5 July 1966 when Col. Hillsdale returned.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">One can only conjecture as to what effect it would have had on plaintiff\u2019s career as an officer in the active reserve, had he disobeyed that order. It is too crabbed a view to suggest that this period was not active duty, and that plaintiff\u2019s initial period of active duty had not been \u201cextended by proper authority\u201d just because the order was oral (VOCO), and was not later confirmed by written order. The military services could hardly function without competent orders, delivered orally. As Lieutenant Colonel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Hillsdale\u2019s commander, Colonel Sandell, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">XIII USAC was inactivated on 1 July 1968; consequently it is not possible to issue orders reflecting Lt. Col. Skaradowski\u2019s <em>period of active duty </em>on 1-5 July 1966. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Als\">In the intervening period, prior to inactivation of XIII Corps, plaintiff had been vainly trying to secure a waiver of his disability and retention in an active status. Only when those commendable efforts failed, did he apply to be placed on the Disability Retired List. That was when he was informed that the absence of a writing to cover the period 1-5 July 1966, was deemed to defeat his applica-' tion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The law is replete with decisions holding \u201cthat done which ought to have been done.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The nature of the duty performed, rather than the form of the orders authorizing the duty, is the determining factor when considering eligibility for physical disability retirement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And it would be \u201cinane indeed\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to suggest that Lieutenant Colonel Hillsdale, commander of the Rhode Island Subsector Command was not competent to issue the orders in question. In other contexts, this court has not hesitated to afford relief where that serves, as here, to right an obvious injustice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Plaintiff was clearly on active duty from 1-5 July 1966, and it is this connective link between two periods of acknowledged active duty which establishes the \u201cmore than 30 days\u201d requirement of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201. That is the stipulated issue in the case. The ABCMR\u2019s determination to the contrary is not supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, in its interpretation of the pertinent statute, the determination is erroneous as a matter of law. It follows that plaintiff is entitled to recover and judgment is entered to that effect. The amount of recovery is reserved for further proceedings under Rule 131(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b693-5\">- 10 USC \u00a7 1201, clauses 1, 2, and 3(B) (i) (as amended by Pub.L. 87-651, 7 September 1962) provide that the Secretary concerned may retire a member with pay if, during a period of active duty of over 30 days duration, the member becomes permanently disabled, provided that the disability extends to 30 per cent under the Veterans Administration schedules and the member has at least eight years of service computed under 10 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1208 and 1333.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-16\">. By stipulation of 16 July 1971, the parties have agreed that \u201c[d]uring the period of 29 June 1966 until 5 July 1966, plaintiff performed the duties of Subsector Commander.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">. <em>See, </em>for example, Diamond v.

United States, 139 F.Supp. 956, 134 Ct.Cl. 874 (1956), a case which in a sense is <em>a fortiori, </em>because plaintiff was required in that instance to prove that he was not on \u201cactive duty for training.\u201d Plaintiff in this case, brought under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, is not barred even were it to be determined that his was \u201cactive duty for training.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\">. <em>See </em>General Cas.
