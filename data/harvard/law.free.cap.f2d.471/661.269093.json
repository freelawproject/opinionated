JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Acyp\">Gregg Steven Strayhorn has appealed from a judgment of conviction for willful failure to report for induction, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a), entered in the Southern District of New York after a court trial before Judge Harold R. Tyler, Jr. The opinion below is reported at 347 F.Supp. 1186 (S.D.N.Y.1972). The chief issues presented for review concern the proper scope and administration of the order of call defense in Selective Service cases. We find no error in the proceedings below, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-19\">As its name implies, the order of call defense involves contentions by a Selective Service defendant that his order for induction came out of proper sequence, or, conversely, that others who should have been called before him were not. Its recognition by this court, United States v. Weintraub, 429 F.2d 658 (2nd Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1014, 91 S.Ct. 572, 27 L.Ed. 627 (1971), and by others, Yates v. United States, 404 F.2d 462 (1st Cir. 1968), rehearing denied, 407 F.2d 50 (1969); United States v. Dudley, 451 F.2d 1300 (6th Cir. 1971); United States v. Baker, 416 F.2d 202 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>but see </em>Schutz v. United States, 422 F.2d 991, 994 (5th Cir. 1970), rests on at least two underlying premises. First, the courts have recognized in this and other contexts that the general order of induction has been a matter of some concern to Congress, <em>see </em>Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 306, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed. 2d 532 (1970); <em>Baker, supra, </em>416 F.2d at 204-205; <em>Dudley, supra, </em>451 F.2d at 1303, and that the particular rules covering priority represent considered social, economic, and political judgments about who should be called to serve at what time. <em>See Dudley, </em>supra; United States ex rel. Bayly v. Reckord, 51 F.Supp. 507, 515 (D.Md.1943). Thus, the order of call defense serves to insure that the Selective Service system does not disregard these priorities. But second, and more important, those registrants dealing with the Selective Service, as with any administrative agency, should be able to expect that they will be treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>fairly, according to previously established ground rules. <em>See </em>United States v. Griglio, 467 F.2d 572 (1st Cir. 1972), aff\u2019g 334 F.Supp. 1283 (D.Mass.1971). In this regard, the order of call defense serves as a safeguard of the individual\u2019s right to be treated with due process of law by federal administrative agencies. <em>Cf. </em>Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959); Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">But, as always, there are countervailing policies. The government, with its strong interest in national defense, depends upon a well-functioning Selective Service system to provide members of the armed forces. Moreover, even the most efficient of administrative agencies are not infallible, and not every minor slip-up represents such an affront to the priority rules and notions of due process as to require the rather drastic sanction of reversing a criminal conviction for failure to submit to induction. Thus, while the majority of courts have had little difficulty recognizing the existence of the order of call defense, definition of its substantive and procedural parameters has proven more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">This court first approached these problems in United States v. Sandbank, 403 F.2d 38 (2nd Cir. 1968). There, we held that the government need not establish the propriety of the order of call as part of its case in chief against every Selective Service defendant; rather, response from the prosecution was required only when the issue was fairly raised as part of the defense. We thus rejected the doctrine of United States v. Lybrand, 279 F.Supp. 74 (E.D.N.Y. 1967), to the contrary, and every circuit that has since considered the question has followed suit. <em>Yates, supra; </em>United States v. Norman, 413 F.2d 789, 792 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1018, 90 S.Ct. 585, 24 L.Ed.2d 510 (1969); <em>Baker, supra; </em>Little v. United States, 409 F.2d 1343 (10th Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">In United States v. Weintraub, <em>supra, </em>we then sought to define the standard and quantum of proof relevant to the order of call defense. We began there, as we do here, with the statutory directive that decisions of the local board are to be final, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460, and thus cannot be judicially reviewed unless lacking any basis in fact. Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1944). Thus, our job in an order of call case is not to second-guess the draft board or to determine the propriety of its actions <em>de novo, </em>but rather to determine whether its handling of the challenged call is \u201cso lacking in support in the record as to be arbitrary and capricious.\u201d 429 F.2d at 660. As other courts have recognized, such a standard not only reflects the finality policies of the Selective Service Act, but also strikes something of a balance between the individual and societal interests at stake here. <em>Griglio, supra; Dudley, supra; </em>United States v. King, 455 F.2d 345 (1st Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">In <em>Weintraub, </em>we also noted that once an \u201capparent departure\u201d from the proper order of call was shown by the defendant, the burden shifted to the government to explain. 429 F.2d at 661. While the government is then required to show the propriety of its actions beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>see King, supra; Dudley, supra; Baker, supra, </em>the seemingly heavy demands of that standard must be viewed in light of the \u201cbasis in fact\u201d requirement. Thus, what the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is not that the local board acted flawlessly, but rather that the defendant was not prejudiced by arbitrary and capricious action.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">Moreover, the order of call defense is not made out by exposing any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>single error, however egregious, in the order of call. Rather, the record must show actual prejudice to the defendant, wholly unjustified delay of the induction of enough 1A registrants so that if the local board acted correctly, the defendant would not have been called when he was. United States v. Camara, 451 F.2d 1122 (1st Cir. 1971); United States v. Smith, 443 F.2d 1278 (9th Cir. 1971). Thus, before the number five man of a ten man monthly delivery \u201clist\u201d can receive the benefit of the order of call defense, it must appear that six available registrants with higher <em>priorities</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>have been arbitrarily bypassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">In practice, the discharge of the various evidentiary burdens outlined above need not be cumbersome. The defendant can meet his initial requirement by merely showing that, at the time of his induction order, there existed enough available lA\u2019s with higher priorities for call than his, whose inclusion on a monthly list would have \u201cbumped\u201d him off. In response, the government need not engage in extended review of the attacked bypasses, but can normally satisfy its burden through documentary evidence and testimony of a local board clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">At various stages of the proceedings in this case, the defendant, the government, and the district court have expressed some understandable confusion about the precise scope of the government\u2019s burden in these cases. While no exact definition is possible, we reiterate what was said in Weintraub\u2014 only that local board action so lacking a basis in fact as to be arbitrary and capricious will allow a judicial conclusion that another registrant was improperly bypassed. We further hold, as we believe <em>Weintraub </em>made implicit, that a record which merely shows that some Selective Service deadlines have been missed, or that regulations have been technically violated, will not suffice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, as Chief Judge Coffin of the First Circuit said in <em>Griglio, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\">\u201c[W]e will not deem a violation of a regulation as applied to third persons a deprivation of due process as to a registrant unless it is apparent that favoritism to another or discrimination against the registrant was intended, or unless the violation is so flagrant and serious that, whether intended or not, concern for fair and efficient administration justifies the sanction of voiding an induction adversely affected by the violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">Moreover, in the interest of efficient administration of justice, we take this opportunity to set down guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>lines for the future handling of the order of call defense in the district courts. We agree with the decisions in <em>King, supra, </em>and United States v. Lloyd, 431 F.2d 160, 164 (9th Cir. 1970), that the order of call defense, going as it does to the validity of the induction order, is properly heard by the court, not the jury. <em>Cf. </em>Cox v. United States, 332 U. S. 442, 452-453, 68 S.Ct. 115, 92 L.Ed. 59 (1947). Consequently, in light of the broad discovery permitted by the federal rules, the minimal initial burden placed on the defendant, and the technical nature of the defense, we hold that it is one properly raised before trial through a motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>See King, supra, </em>455 F.2d at 354. Aided by liberal discovery, the motion should sufficiently identify those registrants whose bypass the defendant is attacking.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district courts may deem the order of call defense waived, in trials beginning after January 1, 1973, if the issue is not raised in the above manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The motion should be heard by the district court prior to trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at least where jury trial has been demanded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This procedure will avoid interrupting jury trial for the raising and determination of the order of call defense, and, if the defense is meritorious, will obviate the necessity for impanelling a jury at all. Of course, at the hearing on the motion for acquittal, the substantive parameters of the defense will be those outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">We turn then from basic principles to the particular facts of this ease. Since Judge Tyler\u2019s opinion fully sets forth the relevant findings of fact, we shall refer to them here only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Strayhorn was the number nineteen man of a total of thirty-eight in the relevant September, 1969, call. Thus, as Judge Tyler recognized, in order for him to prevail, the government had to \u201close\u201d on twenty registrants or more out of the forty-four challenged in this case. Or, put another way, if it appears that less than twenty registrants here were improperly bypassed, the defense must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">As Judge Tyler held, Strayhorn properly discharged his initial burden by identifying forty-four registrants who had 1A classifications and priorities higher than his on the date of his induction order and who were not called. The parties then stipulated that ten of these registrants were correctly bypassed, leaving thirty-four at issue. The government\u2019s case with respect to this group was complicated by a factor peculiar to this case. Strayhorn\u2019s draft board had been the object of a \u201ctrashing\u201d incident on July 1 or 2, 1969; the board\u2019s files were extensively damaged and destroyed. Thus, many of the registrants\u2019 files at issue here had to be reconstructed in the period prior to trial; some were still unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Quite reluctantly, Judge Tyler began by extending the benefit of the doubt to Strayhorn with respect to fourteen registrants whose files were rendered \u201cunclear\u201d by the trashing incident. He did so largely on the basis of United States v. Dudley, <em>supra, </em>which he read as precluding the use of expert testimony about the status of challenged registrants where case files and documents are not produced. While we do not quarrel with the result reached, we read <em>Dudley </em>more narrowly. That case does not hold that oral testimony can never be used to meet the government\u2019s bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>den, nor does it hold that the unavailability of files, for whatever reason, prevents other proof of proper bypass. Rather, in <em>Dudley </em>the government attempted to meet its burden through a general explanation of why the induction of registrants may be delayed\u2014 pending appeals, physical examinations, etc. There was no attempt to explain why the particular registrants at issue were bypassed. While the Sixth Circuit held that kind of testimony to be insufficient to meet the prosecution\u2019s burden, it did not rule that particularized testimony about the reasons for not inducting individual registrants at a particular time would be insufficient. Similarly, while the <em>Dudley </em>court implies that the best evidence in an order of call case is a registrant\u2019s file, 451 F.2d at 1304, n. 5, it clearly does not preclude other means of satisfying the government\u2019s burden, particularly where the file is, for good reason, unavailable or incomplete. While the usual procedure should be to produce the files in question, if such a course is impossible we do not see why oral testimony about the specific reasons for bypassing an individual registrant cannot be used by the prosecution in an order of call case.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">After \u201ccrediting\u201d these fourteen registrants to the defendant, Judge Tyler went on to find that the government had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each of the remaining twenty registrants at issue was properly bypassed. We agree. The record shows that virtually every bypass, if not all, was technically correct under the regulations; those few that are at all questionable clearly do not represent arbitrary or capricious action, particularly when taken in the context of a local board that had been the recent victim of criminal vandalism. We thus affirm Judge Tyler\u2019s conclusion that Strayhorn\u2019s order of call defense must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions are far less troublesome. Strayhorn contends that reversal is mandated by the fact that the local board had destroyed a number of outdated Form 116\u2019s, a statistical feeder report about the status of 1A registrants. He claims that if this report had been available, he might have been able to show that his local board had contributed more than its share of inductees in the past, and that the September, 1969, quota was consequently disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The claim is without merit. It is clear that Strayhorn does not claim that the records were destroyed in bad faith, or that the local board was told that he needed them. Instead, they were disposed of in accordance with routine regulations. Moreover, Strayhorn\u2019s attack on the quota system was not raised until time of trial; even when raised, it was based wholly on conjecture. Under these circumstances, the presumption of regularity which surrounds the administrative establishment of local board quotas is hardly overcome, and the destruction of the outdated documents was not prejudicial. <em>See </em>United States v. Hall, 449 F.2d 1206, 1208 (5th Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Strayhorn next claims that a statement he made in completing a DD 98 (Loyalty Questionnaire) at the AFEES constituted an inarticulate request for conscientious objector status, and that the local board erred in not so treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Judge Tyler found that the statement at best represented \u201cpolitical and particular\u201d views about war, <em>see </em>Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 458, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971), and thus did not rise to the level of statutory conscientious objection. We agree. Indeed, the record as a whole indicates that, far from opposing war, Strayhorn viewed it as a convenient method for the resolution of class and racial disputes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The final claim is that the \u201csix months\u201d rule, Rule 4 of the Second Circuit Rules Regarding Prompt Disposition of Criminal Cases, was violated in this instance. The contention is frivolous. The indictment was filed here on September 1, 1971, and the government filed its notice of readiness for trial within 45 days. True, the government did not fully comply with a discovery order until late February, 1972, but even if the latter date is controlling, it was within the six month period. Indeed, the motion to dismiss on this ground was argued on the day the case was first called for trial, March 2, 1972, which was six months and one day after the indictment. Since the government was obviously ready for trial well within the six month period and so notified defendant and counsel, there was clearly no reversible error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\">. Prior to its rejection of the order of call defense, at least with inspect to willful refusal to report, in Sch\u00fctz v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the Fifth Circuit had reached a similar conclusion. Lowe v. United States, 389 F.2d 51 (5th Cir. 1968) ; Greer v. United States, 378 F.2d 931 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">. The institution of the draft lottery does not eliminate the order of call defense; it merely realigns the priorities involved. While under the former system the general, priority rule was \u201coldest first,\u201d the order of call is now basically determined by the position assigned to a registrant\u2019s birthday in the lottery. <em>Compare </em>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.6 (1972) <em>with </em>its outdated analogue, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.7 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">. We do not read the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion in United States v. Smith, <em>supra, </em>as holding to the contrary. In that case, the local board had violated 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.14, requiring the forwarding of a registrant\u2019s file to the appeals board no later than five days after the expiration of the appeal period, by an unexplained delay of seven months in one case and almost two years in another. Thus, while the opinion in <em>Smith, </em>does at one point note that improper bypass is made out when it is shown that \u201cthe delay was in direct violation of a specific regulation,\u201d 443 F.2d at 1280, it is important to remember the factual context in which that statement was made. Indeed, we note that in treating the order of call defense in United States v. Lee, 454 F.2d 192 (9th Cir. 1972), the court specifically said that the defendant had to show not only a regulalation violation, but also \u201cthat the result <em>delayed significantly </em>the time at which higher priority registrants became fully acceptable for induction.\u201d 454 F.2d at 193 (emphasis added). After citing <em>Smith, </em>the court went on to note that it did not have before it such a case, since, \u201cIn none of the cases presented did the delay seem arbitrary or discriminatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b727-11\">. Of course, in order to safeguard the confidentiality of Selective Service files, the district judge can enter appropriate protective orders governing discovery. <em>See Weintraub, supra, </em>429 F.2d at 661.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\">. As the First Circuit noted in <em>King, supra, </em>455 F.2d at 354, these motions may well be the kind in which the district court may resort to the aid of a magistrate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b727-15\">. Of course, if jury trial has been waived, the district court may consolidate this hearing with the trial on the merits. <em>King, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b728-5\">. Our disposition of this issue makes it unnecessary for us to consider the merits, or even the availability of a defense to an order for induction based on irregularities in a local board quota. For cases in which variations of this defense were raised, and rejected, <em>see </em>United States v. O\u2019Riley, 459 F.2d 53 (9th Cir. 1972) ; United States v. De Smet, 456 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir. 1972), aff\u2019g mem. 5 SSLR 3087 (N.D.Cal.1971) ; United States v. Howells, 452 F.2d 1182 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b729-22\">. For example, Strayhorn filled out a DD 398 (Personal History Statement) at the AFEES as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-23\">\u201cThe United States Government should be overthrown by the use of arms \u2014 The only thing that you pigs understand is a 12 Gauge.
