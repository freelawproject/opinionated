Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 89 S.Ct. 1886, 23 L.Ed.2d 610 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">This suit was commenced on June 17, 1964, seeking to enjoin, and for an accounting of profits and damages resulting from, defendants\u2019 alleged infringement of three patents owned by the plaintiff relating to a fluteless swaging tap.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">Before trial, plaintiff withdrew its patent No. 2,991,491, admitting its invalidity due to plaintiff\u2019s own prior public use. The trial court held plaintiff's patent Re. 24,572 valid and infringed and patent No. 3,050,755 infringed but invalid for prior public use by plaintiff. It dismissed defendants\u2019 antitrust counterclaim. Besly-Welles Corp. v. Balax, Inc., 291 F.Supp. 328 (E.D.Wis.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-17\">Upon appeal, this Court affirmed the judgment of invalidity of No. 3,050,755 and reversed the judgment of the validity of Re. 24,572. Bendix Corp. v. Balax, Inc., 421 F.2d 809 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 911, 90 S.Ct. 2203, 26 L.Ed.2d 562 (1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-18\">The Court vacated that part of the judgment dismissing defendants\u2019 antitrust counterclaim in order to consider \u201cthe relevance, if any, of <em>Lear.\u201d </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Upon remand, the district court concluded that the defendants had established their counterclaim and were entitled to judgment. The district court considered that this court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe right to estop licensees from challenging a patent is not part of the \u2018limited protection\u2019 afforded by the patent monopoly,\u201d constituted the law of the case. Then, inasmuch as many of plaintiff\u2019s license agreements contained \u201ca concession by the contracting party either that it would not legally challenge the Besly patent or that it acknowledged the patent\u2019s validity\u201d and inasmuch as some of those concessions were to continue \u201cduring the life of this agreement or thereafter,\u201d the district court concluded that \u201cBesly had gained and retained control of a substantial portion of the swaging tap market.\u201d Bendix Corp. v. Balax, Inc., 321 F.Supp. 1095, 1096 (E.D.Wis.1971).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The basic facts may be summarized as follows: Until 1950 a cutting tap was the only tool available in the United States for internal thread forming. In 1950 at least two manufacturers began making swaging taps. In 1957 the plaintiff commenced marketing its improved swaging tap in regard to which it eventually obtained three patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s earliest swaging tap patent was issued in 1957 and reissued as Re. 24,572 on December 2, 1958. Patent No. 2,991,491 was issued on July 11, 1961. Patent No. 3,050,755 was issued on August 28, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">Defendant Balax was incorporated in 1959 and defendant Van Vleet has been its president since then. From May to November 1961, Van Vleet met and communicated with representatives of plaintiff, at which time Van Vleet disclosed that he had been developing what he considered a superior type of swaging tap. The discussions included the possibility of a cross-license agreement between Balax and plaintiff. Van Vleet took copious notes of these discussions, which ended without any agreements being reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Balax sold its first swaging tap on January 3, 1962, and later obtained a patent on its \u201cno lead error\u201d swaging tap.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">When plaintiff filed its complaint for infringement on June 17, 1964, it also charged that Balax and Van Vleet had appropriated plaintiff\u2019s trade secrets. The district judge, after the original trial, found that the information disclosed by plaintiff to Van Vleet took great effort to develop, had value to plaintiff, and was claimed by plaintiff to have been used by the defendants as a short cut to get into the swaging tap business. 291 F.Supp. at 344-346. Nevertheless, the district court \u201cconcluded that while the information disclosed by plaintiff constituted trade secrets, no confidential relationship existed between the parties.\u201d 421 F.2d at 821. This Court affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that the defendants were not liable for appropriation of plaintiff\u2019s trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">At the time the infringement suit was filed in 1964, plaintiff had license contracts with ten companies to act as either a manufacturing licensee or sales outlet. Several others were added prior to June 22, 1970, when the Supreme Court denied a petition for certiorari from this Court\u2019s opinion invalidating plaintiff\u2019s last patent. 399 U.S. 911, 90 S.Ct. 2203, 26 L.Ed.2d 562. At that time, plaintiff notified all of its licensees of the cancellation of their agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">According to flow diagrams furnished by both plaintiff and defendants in their briefs, prior to June 22, 1970, (1) plaintiff sold some of its-kind of taps to distributors ; (2) plaintiff sold other of its kind of taps to purchasing licensees who in turn sold them to other distributors; (3) plaintiff\u2019s manufacturing licensees manufactured plaintiff\u2019s kind of taps and sold them to other distributors; (4) defendant Balax sold its own patented kind of taps to other distributors; and (5) Balax\u2019s licensed manufacturers made Balax\u2019s kind of taps and sold them to yet other distributors. Thus both plaintiff\u2019s and Balax\u2019s respective kinds of swaging taps reached the hands of some of the approximately 20,000 independent distributors of swaging and cutting taps. These distributors, in turn, resold the taps to hundreds of thousands of machine shops and other tap users throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">In seeking to support the judgment of the district court upholding their counterclaim, the defendants have relied primarily upon (1) the provisions of several of plaintiff\u2019s license agreements which provided substantially that \u201cLicensee agrees that it will not contest the validity of any patent which is now a part of this Agreement during the life of this Agreement and thereafter\u201d; (2) the provisions of several of plaintiff\u2019s sales contracts wherein the tap purchaser acknowledged the validity of the underlying patent or patents without limiting the acknowledgment to the life of the sales arrangement; (3) the bringing or threatening to bring of patent infringement suits by the plaintiff; and (4) the granting of nonexclusive licenses and the exaction of royalties by plaintiff as consideration for not bringing infringement suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">In the prior appeal, Judge Hastings, speaking for this Court and after pointing out that defendants\u2019 counterclaim charged two violations of federal antitrust laws, the first of which was \u201cillegal procurement and enforcement of patents\u201d under the doctrine of fraud-praeticed-on-the-patent-office of Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S.Ct. 347, 15 L.Ed.2d 247 (1965), said at 421 F.2d 819:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-15\">\u201cThe district court specifically found that defendants had not met their burden of proving fraud on the patent office by clear and convincing evidence as required in Armour &amp; Co. v. Wilson &amp; Co., 7 Cir., 274 F.2d 143, 148 (1960). Our examination of the record leads us to conclude that such finding is not clearly erroneous and thus we accept it. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>conclusion of the district court that this claim of antitrust violation is without merit should be approved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">This conclusion constituted the law of the case and established that the invalidity of the plaintiff\u2019s patent was the result of an error of judgment by the patent office based upon good faith applications by the plaintiff. Hence, the fact of invalidity has no probative value in the case in attempting to establish any antitrust violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The defendants\u2019 second contention of plaintiff\u2019s violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, as analyzed by Judge Hastings in the first appeal, was that \u201ceven if all of plaintiff\u2019s patents were valid, plaintiff would be guilty . for the reason that they have misused their patents to extend the patent monopoly beyond the scope permitted by the Constitution and the Congress.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Every patent misuse does not constitute a <em>per se </em>antitrust violation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> excusing proof of precise damage or foreclosing inquiry into reasonableness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Report of the Attorney General\u2019s National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 254 (1955) concluded that \u201c[f]rom some abuses of patent policy may flow consequences not drastic enough to meet antitrust prerequisites of effect on competition.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Therefore we must determine whether a patent misuse occurred and if so, its nature and whether it constituted an antitrust violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">Congress has made it clear that the exaction of a royalty and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>granting of a non-exclusive license as consideration for not suing for infringement, or suing to prevent infringement, do not constitute, in and of themselves, misuse of a patent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we indicated in the prior appeal and hold in this one, whether any antitrust - violation has occurred must be measured as though the plaintiff\u2019s patents were valid. Correctively, an infringement suit does not become an antitrust violation because a patent is held invalid.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The district court concluded that plaintiff monopolized the swaging tap market by, among other matters, \u201c[h]aving obtained concessions as to the \u2018validity\u2019 of its now invalid patent, and having obtained waivers regarding judicial action.\u201d 321 F.Supp. at 1096.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In 1950, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe general rule\u201d was that a patent licensee operating under a license agreement was estopped to deny the validity of his licensor\u2019s patent in a suit for royalties. Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339 U.S. 827, 836, 70 S.Ct. 894, 94 L.Ed. 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">All of the licensee restrictions imposed by the plaintiff occurred subsequent to 1950. The plaintiff commenced its infringement suit in 1964. The district court\u2019s first judgment was rendered in 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-18\">On June 16, 1969, the Supreme Court decided Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 89 S.Ct. 1902, 23 L.Ed.2d 610, holding that a licensee is not estopped to interpose the invalidity of the licensed patent as a defense to an action by the patentee-licensor to enforce the license agreement. The Court expressly overruled its 1950 holding to the contrary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">Thereafter, we remanded this case to the district court to consider \u201cthe relevance, if any, of <em>Lear.\u201d </em>421 F.2d at 821. The district court apparently assumed that <em>Lear </em>was relevant and that the license restrictions constituted <em>per se </em>antitrust violations in the light of <em>Lear. </em>The court did not consider whether <em>Lear </em>is to be applied retroactively.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-20\">Recently the Supreme Court in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97, 106-107, 92 S.Ct. 349, 355, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971), summarized the factors to be considered in determining whether unconstitutional, noncriminal cases are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>be applied nonretroactively<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as a matter of <em>stare decisis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">\u201cIn our cases dealing with the nonretroactivity question, we have generally considered three separate factors. First, the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied . . . or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed, . . . Second, it has been stressed that \u2018we must . weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\u2019 . . . Finally, we have weighed the inequity imposed by retroactive application, for \u2018[w]here a decision of this Court could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively, there is ample basis in our cases for avoiding the \u201cinjustice or hardship\u201d by a holding of nonretroactivity.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">In <em>Lear, </em>there was an express overruling of a past precedent. Although the Court noted that \u201c[l]ong before <em>Hazeltine </em>was decided, the estoppel doctrine had been so eroded that it could no longer be considered the \u2018general rule\u2019 \u201d (395 U.S. at 664, 89 S.Ct. at 1908), nevertheless in <em>Hazeltine </em>the Court characterized it as the general rule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Whether <em>Hazeltine </em>was \u201cclear past precedent\u201d to the Supreme Court in 1971, the unqualified pronouncement in that case undoubtedly made the doctrine clear enough to parties relying upon it from 1950 to 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The prior history of the estoppel doctrine, its purpose and effect, and its merits and demerits were thoroughly canvassed in <em>Lear. </em>The Court began its analysis with a statement of the competing policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-13\">\u201cThe uncertain status of licensee estoppel in the case law is a product of judicial efforts to accommodate the competing demands of the common law of contracts and the federal law of patents. On the one hand, the law of contracts forbids a purchaser to repudiate his promises simply because he later becomes dissatisfied with the bargain he has made. On the other hand, federal law requires that all ideas in general circulation be dedicated to the common good unless they are protected by a valid patent. Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., <em>supra </em>[376 U.S. 225 [84 S.Ct. 784, 11 L.Ed.2d 661] (1964)]; Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., <em>supra </em>[376 U.S. 234 [84 S.Ct. 779, 11 L.Ed.2d 669] (1964)]. When faced with this basic conflict in policy, both this Court and courts throughout the land have naturally sought to develop an intermediate position which somehow would remain responsive to the radically different concerns of the two different worlds of contract and patent. The result has been a failure. Rather than creative compromise, there has been a chaos of conflicting case law, proceeding on inconsistent premises. Before renewing the search for an acceptable middle ground, we must reconsider on their own merits the arguments which may properly be advanced on both sides of the estoppel question.\u201d 395 U.S. at 668, 89 S.Ct. at 1910.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">The Court concluded its survey of the estoppel doctrine by determining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-15\">\u201cSurely the equities of the licensor do not weigh very heavily when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>are balanced against the important public interest in permitting full and free competition in the use of ideas which are in reality a part of the public domain. Licensees may often be the only individuals with enough economic incentive to challenge the patentability of an inventor\u2019s discovery. If they are muzzled, the public may continually be required to pay tribute to would-be monopolists without need or justification. We think it plain that the technical requirements of contract doctrine must give way before the demands of the public interest in the typical situation involving the negotiation of a license after a patent has issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 89 S.Ct. at 1911.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The key policy motivation weighing the scales in <em>Lear </em>in favor of outlawing licensee estoppel was obviously the \u201cunmuzzling\u201d of licensees to challenge patentability. Clearly, that unmuzzling occurred instanter the day <em>Lear </em>was decided. Consequently, it operates retrospectively in the sense that it affected the executory portion of license restrictions regardless of when they were negotiated and entered into by the parties. As of June 16, 1969, such restrictions became null and void and unenforceable. Massillon-Cleveland-Akron Sign Co. v. Golden State Advertising Co., 444 F.2d 425, 427 (9th Cir. 1971); Panther Pumps &amp; Equipment Co., Inc. v. Hydrocraft, Inc., 468 F.2d 225, at 231 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">On the other hand, it is difficult to see how the awarding of damages (assuming they would be provable as proximately caused by a restriction) would effectuate any unmuzzling, particularly in this case where the defendants are not licensees and were never subjected to the restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">In an analogous situation, the Sixth Circuit has held that a license restriction voidable under <em>Lear </em>is not void <em>ab initio, </em>entitling the licensee to recoup royalties already paid. Troxel Manufacturing Co. v. Schwinn Bicycle Co., 465 F.2d 1253 (6th Cir. August 11, 1972).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">To award damages occurring prior to the decision of <em>Lear, </em>based upon the license restrictions voided on that date, would not enforce <em>Lear\u2019s </em>policy but would be purely punitive, a result not warranted where, as here, no fraud nor bad faith was shown to be involved. This brings us to the third factor determining retroactivity: it would lead to inequitable results to apply <em>Lear </em>retroactively insofar as damages are concerned in the present case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>clude, therefore, that <em>Lear </em>should not be applied retroactively to this case in its damage aspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Consequently, the portion of plaintiff\u2019s license agreements providing that the licensee \u201cwill not contest the validity of any patent which is now a part of this agreement during the life of this agreement\u201d did not constitute a misuse of the patent. The clause became null and void on June 16, 1969, and the patents on which it was based became invalid shortly thereafter as a result of this Court\u2019s final decision in that regard. 421 F.2d 809, cert. denied, 399 U.S. 911, 90 S.Ct. 2203, 26 L.Ed.2d 562 (1971). At that point the policy of <em>Lear </em>had been vindicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">However the problem here is complicated by the fact that some of the plaintiff\u2019s license agreements purport to extend the no-contest provisions beyond the life of the agreements and some of its sales agreements purport to extend the acknowledgment of patent validity beyond the life of the agreements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U.S. 29, 85 S.Ct. 176, 13 L.Ed.2d 99 (1964), the Court found a <em>per se </em>misuse of patent where royalty payments under license agreements projected beyond the expiration date of the last covered patent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The misuse was based on activities (exaction of royalties) occurring in the post-expiration period.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">Here the licensees were purportedly agreeing not to contest the validity of plaintiff\u2019s patents after the termination of the license agreement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There is no evidence in the record that any licensee terminated his license arrangement with the plaintiff and hence no post-expiration activities actually took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">However, some misuse may be inferred from the mere presence of the \u201cthereafter\u201d clause. Licensees and purchasers may have been induced to continue their licensing or purchasing arrangements with the plaintiff because if they terminated those arrangements to seek to deal with a competitor such as defendant, they would, prior to <em>Lear, </em>have been unable to defend against an infringement suit by the plaintiff. Nevertheless, in order to succeed in their counterclaim the defendants must show all of the ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ments necessary to create an antitrust cause of action, including damages suffered by the defendants as a proximate result of illegal acts of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Much of defendants\u2019 evidence intended to show antitrust damages is based upon the alleged failure of the business of Balax to progress in an economically satisfactory manner due to the financial pressures of maintaining its defense to this lawsuit. Even as such damages, if proved, are not recoverable from a patent law standpoint inasmuch as a suit to prevent infringement is not a patent misuse (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(d)),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> neither are the same damages recover-, able from an antitrust standpoint unless the suit is an integral part of a conspiracy to restrain trade or to monopolize<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> over and beyond the protection afforded by the presumptively-valid patent rights.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Our examination of the record discloses no action by the plaintiff relating to the institution of this lawsuit which differs in any material respect from that of any patentee who has assumed that his patent is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The defendants\u2019 original counterclaim, filed on June 30, 1964, did not allege much more than that \u201cDefendants have continually been harassed by Plaintiff and have been the victims of illegal conspiracies in restraint of trade and of interference with contract.\u201d An amended counterclaim was filed on February 14, 1966, stating, among other allegations, that the plaintiff and its licensees had agreed to handle plaintiff\u2019s taps only and that one of plaintiff\u2019s officers \u201cregularly meets with representatives of \u2018competitive\u2019 tap manufacturers in a Metal Cutting Tool Institute and at Tap Standards meetings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">After hearing the evidence in the original trial (at which most of the evidence in the record now before us was adduced), the trial judge found (291 F.Supp. 328, 348):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-16\">\u201cIn my opinion, this counterclaim may not succeed because (1) there was no adequate proof of fraud in procuring the patents in suit, (2) the plaintiffs are not properly chargeable with illegal enforcement of their patents, and (3) there has been no sufficient showing of an illegal combination to restrain trade.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">Upon remand there was a two-day trial at which proof was limited to that which was not available at the time of the previous trial. The trial judge\u2019s findings at the conclusion of the remand trial included a finding that the plaintiff \u201cimproperly influenced the pricing structure of swaging taps and exerted an excessive influence on the price thereof\u201d (Finding of Fact 17) and that the \u201csales to consumers by distributors for Besly and its licensees were at . identical list prices. . . .\u201d (Finding of Fact 19). The evidence shows that swaging taps are sold at approximately the same price.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We have searched the record in vain in an effort to find any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>other evidence tending to support the trial judge\u2019s finding, not of price-fixing, but of improper price influencing.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Although \u201c[n]o formal agreement is necessary to constitute an unlawful conspiracy,\u201d American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 809, 66 S.Ct. 1125, 1139, 90 L.Ed. 1575 (1946), similarity in the sale of standardized products does not alone make out a case of collusive price fixing, the reason being that competition will ordinarily cause one producer to charge about the same price charged by any other.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> United States v. International Harvester Co., 274 U.S. 693, 708-709, 47 S.Ct. 748, 71 L.Ed. 1302 (1927); Cement Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n v. United States, 268 U.S. 588, 605-606, 45 S.Ct. 586, 69 L.Ed. 1104 (1925). The Supreme Court \u201chas never held that proof of parallel business behavior conclusively establishes agreement or, phrased differently, that such behavior itself constitutes a Sherman Act offense.\u201d Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v.

(1972), we held that a patentee who controlled one-third of the relevant market posed a \u201cdangerous probability\u201d of monopolizing that market. Although Judge Stevens stated in that case that the dangerous probability test did not \u201cinvolve an evaluation of the actual likelihood that an attempt would have succeeded if not frustrated by an intervening event,\u201d it is noteworthy, if not distinguishing, that there the intervening event was exposure of a fraud on the patent office and engaging by the patentee in predatory conduct, whereas here the issuance of the patents was procured in good faith by the plaintiff and the intervening agent was this Court's holding that the patents were invalid. Once petition for certiorari was denied, all of plaintiff\u2019s agreements based on the invalidated patents were cancelled (A. 565), thus terminating plaintiff\u2019s ability to consummate any monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">All of those facts and pertinent precedents, however, simply emphasize that in this case the question of potential monopoly power is exceedingly delicately balanced on several fine lines and we should not purport to rely upon its existence or non-existence if in fact the defendants have not met their burden of demonstrating that plaintiff\u2019s conduct \u201cinjured [them] in [their] business or property.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">Defendant Balax claimed and the district court found that plaintiff\u2019s activities enabled it to \u201cunlawfully foreclose competitors, among others Balax, from a substantial market, i. e., the sale for resale of swaging taps\u201d (F.F. 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">Balax not only had obtained a patent on an improved type of swaging tap, but marketed that tap as a superior product.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">The dollar volume of Balax swaging tap sales (rounded to the closest thousand dollars) were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">1964 $108,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">1965 156,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU8\">1966 267,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">1967 332,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">1968 430,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJP\">1969 484,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad0\">1970 647,000 (projected)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Comparative sales of swaging taps in terms of percentages were;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ0\">Besly 58% 50% 52% 45% 45% 50% 32%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM5\">Balax 8 10 15 17 20 23 26</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhX\">Besley Licensees 33 39 33 38 35 27 42</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">Balax\u2019s sales had increased at a steady, substantial rate prior to the cancellation of Besly\u2019s licenses on June 22, 1970; its share of the swaging tap market increased at the same time in an impressive fashion and at the expense of Besly\u2019s share of that market (the plaintiff\u2019s licensees\u2019 share also increasing but not as sharply as that of Balax).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-18\">In the ordinary situation of proving damages allegedly caused as the result of certain actions by another, the injured person or corporation shows how its sales <em>declined </em>during the pertinent period but even that is not deemed sufficiently probative. In Continental Nut Co. v. Robert L. Berner Co., 393 F.2d 283, 286 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 923, 89 S.Ct. 254, 21 L.Ed.2d 259-(1968), this Court said that \u201cwhere . . the plaintiff knows the identity of the customers it claims to have lost and has a record of the previous purchases of each, special damages in the form of profits lost because of the withdrawal of patronage by such customers, to be recoverable, must be proved with-that specificity which shows the loss of profit attributable to patronage withheld by the particular customer and that such' withholding was the result of . [the other party\u2019s unlawful act].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-22\">Here, -where Balax\u2019s sales increased very substantially, the evidence of damages consists of (1) Van Vleet\u2019s testimony that he \u201cthinks\u201d that \u201cone of the reasons\u201d for Balax\u2019s Detroit representative discontinuing representing Balax was because a Ford Motor Company plant to which he hoped to sell taps had learned of the infringement suit (A. 508-10); (2) Van Vleet\u2019s testimony that \u201cI believe our business amounted to something like 60 per cent of what it would have amounted to had this action not been brought\u201d (A. 511) and (3) Balax\u2019s sales manager\u2019s testimony that but for the lawsuit sales would be \u201cI would say at least twice as much as we are currently [selling]\u201d (A. 536-537).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-23\">We have already discussed the fact that the institution of the law suit in itself was not an actionable wrong here and that defendants failed to prove that such institution was an integral part of a conspiracy. It is further obvious that the defendants have not proved any specific damages nor shown beyond mere speculation that if any damages were sustained, they were the result of any antitrust violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-24\">The same manufacturers, including plaintiff, who supply the swaging tap market also supply the cutting tap mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ket, except Balax which supplies only the swaging tap market. There is no evidence in the record that plaintiff has played any part in excluding the defendants from the cutting tap market. Yet the crucial testimony regarding what Balax conceives to be its damages included the following (A. 536, 537) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">\u201cQ. Has Balax expanded its market geographically as far as you feel it can?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201cA. No, definitely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201cQ. What should Balax do in order to expand the market further geographically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\u201cA. We need a more complete line for one thing, and we need representation in probably three additional areas in the country where we are not represented now and where there is a substantial volume of tap business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">* * -\u00bb * * -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\u201cQ. How would you expand your line so as to be able to expand your market geographically ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\u201cA. The product which would be most closely related to our line and, therefore, would lend itself to selling to our current dealer and distributor organization would be a line of cutting taps.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">In other words, Balax\u2019s business has steadily increased and would increase more if it carried cutting taps, which it does not, through no reason proved to be attributable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Although defendants concede that \u201cthe intrusion of swaging taps into the cutting tap market results in very substantial losses to the established cutting tap manufacturers,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> defendants would hypothesize without supporting evidence that the cutting tap manufacturers would conspire with the plaintiff (1) to keep the price of swaging taps high although those of cutting taps were dropping during a'price war and (2) to restrict themselves through license agreements, all to the benefit of plaintiff but to their own great detriment. We have previously considered the pricing aspects and we now add as we did in the <em>Kearney &amp; Trecker </em>case, supra, that \u201cdefendant never took a license and to the extent that those provisions made plaintiff\u2019s licensees less effective competitors, defendant certainly was not harmed.\u201d 452 F.2d at 600, n. 52. There is no evidence that the defendants were foreclosed from any market or, if they were, that they were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">We conclude that there was no <em>per se </em>patent misuse and were no <em>per se </em>antitrust violations, which enable us to consider the reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s actions and to require that defendants prove damages with specificity and also to prove that such damages, if any, were caused by plaintiff\u2019s actions. In accordance with our preceding analysis, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s actions in protecting what it presumed to be a valid patent were reasonably designed to effectuate that protection, that defendants did not prove any recoverable damages, and that assuming or speculating that damages were incurred by defendants, they failed to prove that such damages were the proximate result of plaintiff\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">Therefore we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\">. \u201cA tap is a tool used to form threads on the cylindrical inner surface of a hole. A swaging tap forms threads by deforming the metal and displacing it into the form of the desired thread. A swaging tap, which forms no chips, is to be distinguished from a cutting tap which forms threads by cutting away the metal with cutting teeth. The swaging method is said to be more economical and easier to perform than the cutting method. Swaging taps have a longer life than cutting taps. They produce no metal chips. The costly and time consuming inspection and cleaning of the work after the job is completed is thus eliminated.\u201d Bendix Corp. v. Balax, Inc., 421 F.2d 809, 811 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 911, 90 S.Ct. 2203, 26 L.Ed.2d 562 (1970). In order to produce a cutting tap, a fluted blank is needed on which to grind the threads. The machine needed to produce the fluted blank is relatively expensive. Swaging taps have no flutes (or parallel grooves) so that fluted blanks are not needed. Thus the maker of swaging taps needs only a thread grinding machine and not an expensive flute grinding machine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-20\">.

Holding every patent law transgression to be the same as an antitrust violation would, moreover, put the patent owner on a different footing than owners of other property subject to antitrust.

Although the Court sought to distinguish <em>General Electric </em>on the ground that the product involved there was patented, Mr. Justice Stewart, dissenting, concluded that \u201c[i]t is clear, therefore, that the Court today overrules General Electric.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 84 S.Ct. at 1061. Justices Brennan and Goldberg were concerned with \u201cagreements that may have been entered into in reliance upon United States v. General Electric.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 84 S.Ct. at 1059. Obviously with these considerations in mind, the majority opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas decided that \u201c[w]e reserve the question whether, when all the facts are known, there may be any equities that would warrant only prospective application in damage suits of the rule governing price fixing by the \u2018consignment\u2019 device which we announce today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24-25, 84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>S.Ct. at 1058. On remand, tlie district court found that the new rule would be unfair to the litigant in that case, precluding damages. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the reserved question did not apply to the litigants in that case but to the prospective application of the new rule in other cases. Simpson v.

In defendants\u2019 brief, p. 43, they state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-18\">\u201cThe advent of swaging taps seriously threatened the cutting tap manufacturers for two reasons. First, swaging taps have no flutes so that fluted blanks are not needed, and small competitors can readily enter the market with a single thread grinding machine (A-465, 513). Second, each swaging tap replaces on the average at least 10 cutting taps (A-483). Hence although the swaging tap costs twice as much as a cutting tap, swaging taps will replace cutting taps for a consumer at one-fifth the investment. <em>The parties agree swaging taps can supersede approximately 50% of the cutting taps now in use (A-Jf8S, 58J\u00a1, 566). In other words, of approximately </em>$60,000,000 <em>in cutting taps sold, </em>$30,000,000 <em>will he lost to swaging taps (A-566). </em>However, when swaging taps supersede the $30,000,000 worth of cutting taps, those swaging taps will sell for only $6,000,000 because as noted each swaging tap, although costing twice as much as a cutting tap, will replace 10 cutting taps (A-483).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-20\">\u201cThus the intrusion of swaging taps into the cutting tap market results in very substantial losses to the established cutting tap manufacturers . \u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b224-5\">.

Van Vleet testified in answer to the question as to why Balax went into the swaging tap market (A. 513) : \u201cPor a number of reasons. One, we were unable to purchase on the outside \u2014 from an outside vendor blanks of suitable quality. We tried with three manufacturers to purchase blanks and were not successful. Second, we realized how much we\u2014 realized as the result of tests how inferior the current swaging taps were to the kind that we could build. The tests that we have run and tests that our customers had run in the field indicated a marked superiority in our product. Thirdly, we could go into the swaging tap business without the purchase \u2014 without the capital investment of expensive fluting equipment and make a profit. We, therefore, elected to work on that area and to meanwhile design our own fluting equipment for the cutting taps so that we would be self-sufficient and do all of our operations within our own four walls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">Van Vleet also testified (A. 467) : \u201cOur methods at Balax are so very different, our procedures, our operations, our machinery, is so very different that if we tried to use Besly-Welles methods, we could not operate our shop. We could not make a profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">The district court found after, the first trial that \u201cwhen the plaintiffs visited the Balax plant in 1965, they found very little in common between the two operations.\u201d 291 F.Supp. at 345.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b225-21\">.

We noted that the trial court had rather summarily brushed aside the charge of antitrust violations by dismissing defendants\u2019 antitrust. counterclaim against plaintiffs.

Under the express terms of our prior remand \u201cthe relevance, if any, of <em>Lear\" </em>has been determined \u2014 it has none. That settles the issue before us and the original dismissal of the counterclaim should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">I, therefore, join in that part of the majority opinion holding that <em>Lear </em>should not be applied retroactively and on this ground alone concur in the judgment of reversal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
