North Western contended that UTU had not complied with its duty under Section 2 First of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 First) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to \u201cexert every reasonable effort\u201d to settle the work rules dispute between the parties as to the number of brakemen to be employed on CNW\u2019s trains. The court issued a temporary restraining order, but subsequently dismissed the suit on the ground that the UTU\u2019s duty under Section 2 First was not justiciably enforceable. This court affirmed, 422 F.2d 979 (1970). The Supreme Court, however, held that CNW\u2019s claims of violation were justiciable, 402 U.S. 570, 91 S.Ct. 1731, 29 L.Ed.2d 187 (1971), and directed that the District Court consider and decide them on their merits. After a hearing the District Court found (August 13, 1971) that the UTU had not \u2014nor had CNW \u2014 bargained in compliance with Section 2 First during the various stages of the dispute and that, therefore, self-help in the form of a strike could not be indulged without exhausting \u201cevery reasonable effort\u201d to settle the controversy, 330 F.Supp. 646 (1971), and it issued an injunction against a strike, <em>id. </em>at 652. The parties renewed their negotiations and additional hearings were held by the District Court in November, 1971. On December 22, 1971, a decree was entered holding that both parties had bargained in good faith and that the UTU was now free to resort to self-help. It further held that the court was without power to remand the dispute to the National Mediation Board (NMB) and it, therefore, dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction, 336 F.Supp. 1149. CNW filed its notice of appeal on January 6, 1972, and on its application the District Court entered an injunction pending appeal on January 10, 1972, enjoining a strike. The UTU noted its appeal from the latter order and moved to vacate the injunction or advance the appeal. The motion to vacate was denied, but the appeal was expedited.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">1. <em>The Issues Involved:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">Two issues are involved in this appeal: (1) Did the District Court abuse its discretion in issuing the injunction pending the appeal? And, (2) what steps of the statutory procedure must be revisited when there has not been a good faith compliance with Section 2 First? There is a third question which our disposition obviates, <em>viz: </em>What guidelines must the District Court follow in determining whether there has been a good faith compliance with Section 2 First?</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">We have concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the injunction and that each of the steps provided by the Act must be reinvoked where the parties have not in good faith heretofore exerted every reasonable effort to settle their dispute. Only in this manner will the taint of previous bad faith be purged.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">2. <em>The Issuance of the Injunctive Relief Pending Appeal:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">The UTU urges that the issuance of the injunction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> staying the calling of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the strike was violative of the NorrisLaGuardia Act and an abuse of discretion. We believe that this contention is completely answered by the holding of this court in the previous appeal in this case [not disturbed by the reversal on other grounds]. See Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. United Transportation Union, <em>supra, </em>422 F.2d at 983-985. We quote only one paragraph of the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">\u201cThere is nothing in the text of the Norris-LaGuardia Act or in the legislative history surrounding the drafting and enactment of the Act indicating a Congressional intent to remove from the district court their long-recognized power to grant injunctions pending appeal. To remove from the district courts the power to grant injunctions pending appeal ... is to in effect make the district court the court of last resort on these matters regardless of the difficulty or the novelty of the issues involved. In the absence of any specific Congressional intention ... we decline to read into the Act such a serious limitation into the judicial review process.\u201d At 984.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In addition, this is as the District Court found \u201ca ease of first impression\u201d in which there are no precedential guidelines to follow and that present a \u201cthorny problem\u201d of explosive quality. In the light of these considerations, the \u201cbalance of equities herein favors the granting of an injunction pending appeal. . \u201d While the employees here are protected by a million dollar bond, neither the public nor the railroad have any protection from the irreparable injury that would flow from a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">As for the claim that the UTU was not afforded a hearing on the injunction issue, the record indicates that CNW gave notice on December 22, 1971 of its intention to seek a stay pending appeal. Some two to three weeks thereafter UTU was given opportunity to and did present its position, but to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">3. <em>Further Mediation:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">The principal issue involved here \u2014further mediation \u2014 is not so easily resolved. However, we start with the proposition that in adopting the Act Congress intended to and did create a \u201cscheme of gradually escalating pressures\u201d as Mr. Justice Brennan aptly described them in Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Transportation Union, <em>supra, </em>402 U.S. at 597, 91 S.Ct. at 1745. And, he added: \u201cThe Act is built upon a step-by-step framework. Each step is carefully drawn to introduce slightly different pressures upon the parties to reach settlement from the preceding step. First, the parties, confer jointly. Next, the National Mediation Board may add its pressure through mediation. . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>In short, \u201cCongress was content to enact a machinery which dragged on, with cooling-off periods and various status quo restrictions, while the parties were required to \u2018treat with' one another.\u201d At 591, 91 S.Ct., at 1742.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">However, as the Court points out in the opinion at 578, 91 S.Ct. at 1736: \u201cThe strictest compliance with the formal procedures of the Act is meaningless if one party goes through the motions with \u2018a desire not to reach an agreement\u2019 \u201d. That is exactly what happened here when the parties previously went through each step of the procedures. The District Court has found on remand of the case that neither party acted in good faith in exerting every reasonable effort to settle their differences. Hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ing so tainted every step of the required procedures of the Act, it is necessary that they revisit each step in a good faith effort to settle their dispute. The District Court, however, only required that the joint conference step be invoked. We submit that before self-help is permitted that the parties must also exhaust the next step, <em>i. e., </em>the National Mediation Board. This they have not done. This latter step is the very heart of the Act, because it brings into play the mediation expertise of the Board. Still, this most influential and effective step has not in good faith ever been exerted.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In view of this failure to invoke this step, neither UTU nor CNW may under the Act resort to self-help and appropriate restraint must be continued to prevent such exercise. We do not pass upon the action of the District Court with reference to its findings of good faith efforts of the parties in their joint conferences in exerting every reasonable effort to settle their dispute. However the findings of the District Court as to the good faith of the parties in the joint conference stage are such that if they hereafter demonstrate their good faith in mediation, those findings will stand as approved. We do note that in Findings 78 and 79 the trial judge found that UTU would not agree to any proposal for reduction in the size of mainline crews; nor to accept any offer of additional compensation for employees working on crews of one conductor and one brakeman. Nor would CNW agree to the \u201cJacksonville formula\u201d which most of the railroads have already embraced. In the light of the previous bad faith that the trial court found present at every step of the proceedings, such actions by the parties are suspect and in conjunction with slight evidence of future unwillingness to consider seriously any compromise may well be the basis for a bad faith finding. Such adamant positions \u2014 crystallized during the previous bad faith session of the parties \u2014 must be cast aside before good faith negotiation and conciliation will succeed. The trial court must appraise them with exceeding care and make certain that the parties are in \u201cthe strictest compliance\u201d with the Act. If what the UTU indicated as to the financial condition of CNW is true, the union may be riding a good horse to death with featherbedding. On the other hand, if the additional brakemen are necessary to the safe and efficient operation of the railroad, they should be put on as they have been by other roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\">.

The District Court found that an injunction was necessary to maintain the <em>status </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>quo </em>pending tlie determination of the appeal, because a strike would (1) moot the appeal; (2) irreparably injure CNW and the public, because it would suspend the transportation of freight and passengers resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue each day to CNW; (3) deprive the public of transportation, including 90,000 commuters daily, as well as mail, freight, etc.; (4) seriously impair government services, including both military and civilian personnel, supplies, material, etc.; (5) threaten the health and welfare of a whole section of the country because of a shortage of food, medicines, etc.; and (C) stop essential transportation services to millions of people.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
