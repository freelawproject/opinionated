The Internal Revenue Service denied the deductions by authority of section 269 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 269). Hall paid the additional tax due and sued the United States for a refund in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-17\">Hall was granted summary judgment on the theory that section 269 is inapplicable to post-acquisition losses. We believe the decision below violates both the literal language of section 269 and the purpose of the statute as revealed by the legislative history. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a trial on the remaining factual dispute over Hall\u2019s reason for the acquisitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-18\">Hall is a profitable business engaged in constructing highways. The five acquired corporations operated bowling alleys. Their financial history indicates substantial losses for the years before and after the acquisition. By acquiring the five corporations and by filing a consolidated return, Hall reduced its income with the other corporations\u2019 operating losses. These losses claimed by Hall are only the losses incurred by the five corporations after the acquisition date of April 1, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-19\">Section 269 prevents Hall from deducting the losses if its principal pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>pose in acquiring the corporations was \u201cevasion or avoidance of Federal income tax by securing the benefit of a deduction [it] would not otherwise enjoy.\u201d The District Judge held that \u201cthe general factual situation surrounding the purchase of the bowling corporation stock tends to support the government position enough to justify a finding that there is a genuine dispute as to taxpayer\u2019s motivation in purchasing the stock.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">This factual dispute over motivation would have gone to trial but for the District Judge\u2019s reading into the statute the following limitation: \u201c[s]ection 269 does not prohibit the offsetting of actual post-affiliation losses of the subsidiary against the post-affiliation income of the acquiring taxpayer.\u201d Thus the Trial Judge\u2019s restrictive interpretation of section 269 would effectively limit the dis-allowance of deductions to losses that the acquired corporations already incurred before the acquisition<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and to built-in losses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since Hall only claimed deductions for losses that the corporations incurred after the acquisition, the District Judge, 338 F.Supp. 670, granted summary judgment under his conception of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">This restrictive interpretation is discussed in at least five Circuit Court cases with two Circuits supporting the District\u2019s Court\u2019s decision and three rejecting it. <em>Compare </em>Herculite Protective Fabrics Corp. v. Comm\u2019r, 3 Cir., 1968, 387 F.2d 475; Zanesville Investment Co. v. Comm\u2019r, 6 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 507, with Borge v. Comm\u2019r, 2 Cir., 1968, 405 F.2d 673, cert. den. sub nom. Danica Enterprises, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, 395 U.S. 933, 89 S.Ct. 1994, 23 L.Ed.2d 448 (1969); Luke v. Comm\u2019r, 7 Cir., 1965, 351 F.2d 568; R. P. Collins &amp; Co., Inc. v. United States, 1 Cir., 1962, 303 F.2d 142.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We concur with the majority and in particular with the analysis in the most recent pronouncement by the Second Circuit in <em>Borge. </em>The language of the statute gives no hint of any restriction to pre-acquisition losses. Without qualification the statute approves the disallowance of any deduction obtained by a corporate acquisition motivated principally by a desire to avoid taxes. The government may have difficulty proving such motivation for post-acquisition losses,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but such difficulty does not lead this Court to establish a <em>per se </em>rule preventing the government from attempting to do so. The legislative history indicates that the congressional purpose was to enable the Internal Revenue Service to disallow not only current and past losses but also prospective and anticipated losses.

(1943), reprinted in 1944 C. B. 973, 1016. <em>See also </em>Reg. 1.-269-3(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">This Circuit\u2019s decision in Supreme Investment Corp. v. United States, 5 Cir., 1972, 468 F.2d 370, is not inconsistent with our decision to apply section 269 to post-acquisition losses under the circumstances presented here. In <em>Supreme Investment </em>the acquiring corporation purchased all the shares of another corporation and then promptly liquidated the acquired corporation. The question was whether section 269 prevailed over section 334(b)(2) to prevent the acquiring corporation from obtaining a higher tax basis in an asset than the acquired corporation had. The Court turned to the legislative history of section 269. S. Rep.No.627, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943), reprinted in 1944 C. B. 973, 1017, suggests an examination of the \u201clegislative plan\u201d of the Internal Revenue Code section used by the taxpayer to obtain the tax benefit. Because Congress added section 334(b)(2) to substitute an objective test for the subjective test previously used <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to decide whether to alter a tax basis after liquidation of a recently purchased subsidiary, the Court thought that it would be inappropriate to inject another subjective test through the application of section 269. No such situation is presented in the present case. The legislative history of section 269 itself indicates Congress intended to discourage one corporation from buying another corporation when the main reason is to take advantage of the other corporation\u2019s operating loss.

The existence of a factual dispute is challenged by the taxpayer on the theory that the government failed to \u201cset forth specific facts shoving that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d as required by Rule 56(e), Fed. R.Civ.P. There are sufficient facts elicited by the government\u2019s interrogatories to support the District Judge\u2019s finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\">.
