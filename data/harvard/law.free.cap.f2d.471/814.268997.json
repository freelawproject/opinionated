We grant their motion and remand the case for further consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The applicants are three federal prisoners presently incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. On September 14, 1972 they were transferred from that institution to the Dougherty County Jail in Georgia, apparently to testify at a trial, and were returned to the Atlanta penitentiary on about September 20, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">On September 26, 1972, the applicants filed in the district court a complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for injunctive relief and damages. In their petition to proceed in forma pauperis, they alleged that the conditions in\u2019 the Dougherty County Jail were so substandard as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The applicants also complained that the guards at the jail, under the direction of the sheriff, had confiscated some of their personal property, including money, clothing, law books, and legal pleadings. The petition set forth a claim for $1,-000. 000.in actual and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">The district court summarily denied the applicants\u2019 request to proceed in forma pauperis on the ground that their return to Atlanta had rendered the controversy moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">It is clear that the applicants presently lack standing to seek injunctive relief with respect to the alleged conditions in the Dougherty County Jail. Williams v. United States Department of Justice, 5 Cir. 1972, 462 F.2d 1291. Their claims for damages resulting from these conditions, and for the return of their confiscated property, are still viable, however. Simmons v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1972, 462 F.2d 1340, 1342, fn. 1; United States ex rel. Jones v. Rundle, 3 Cir. 1971, 453 F.2d 147, 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Accordingly, we permit this appeal to proceed in forma pauperis and vacate the judgment below. The district court is directed to consider further the applicants\u2019 claim for relief under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-10\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-11\">.
