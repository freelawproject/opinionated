Sugarman . now pending in the Supreme Court.\u201d [339 F.Supp. 906, probable jurisdiction noted, 407 U.S. 908, 92 S.Ct. 2434, 32 L.Ed.2d 682] We are of the view that the better procedure would have been for Judge Frankel to have withheld his order of dismissal, pending resolution of <em>Dougall </em>by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the district court and remand with directions to refrain from further proceedings pending the decision in Dougall v. Sugar-man.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
