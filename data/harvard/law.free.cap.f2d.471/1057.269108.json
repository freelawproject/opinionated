They were allegedly observed in the vicinity of the Credit Union just prior to the robbery by Mrs. Carlin P. Middleton, who subsequently testified against the appellees before the grand jury. Prior to trial the Government made available to the defense all the Jencks Act material for each of the witnesses it intended to call at the trial except for the grand jury testimony of Mrs. Middleton.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For some undetermined reason the stenographic notes of Mrs. Middleton\u2019s testimony had been lost. On the record made in the District Court it does not appear either that the preservation procedures employed by the private recording company were inadequate or that the notes were lost or suppressed by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-26\">At the pre-trial identification hearing the Government offered Mrs. Middleton as a witness. After she had testified, pursuant to a motion by defense counsel, the trial court ruled that at trial Mrs. Middleton should not be permitted to testify in regard to any matters whatsoever. The trial judge\u2019s action was ostensibly based legally on the authority of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, as construed by our decision in Lee v. United States <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; the factual basis of his action is stated in detail, <em>infra. </em>The ruling was appealed to this court and was affirmed by order without written opinion. The Government now asks that the ease be reheard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>Because there is some indication that the District Court may have misinterpreted our decision in <em>Lee </em>and because subsequent cases, both in this court and in the United States Supreme Court, recognize that in some situations in which Jencks Act material has been lost, the sanctions of that Act need not be applied, we remand with directions that the District Court reconsider the motion to suppress and conduct a further hearing on the issues of the degree of negligence of the Government and the risk of prejudice to the defendant from the absence of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">I. <em>The District Court\u2019s Rationale and the Government\u2019s Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Through the court reporter who took stenographic notes of Mrs. Middleton\u2019s grand jury testimony, the Government proffered evidence that the notes were placed in a folder in a file in the office of the reporting service for which he worked, that the folder was removed from the file to type a transcript for an unrelated case, and that when the folder was returned to the file the notes of Mrs. Middleton\u2019s testimony were missing.3 This is all that appears in the record as to the cause of the loss. The Government contends on this appeal that the notes had been maintained under the \u201cregular and systematic procedures\u201d employed by the reporting service for the maintenance and safekeeping of the notes of grand jury proceedings which its employees recorded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It contends that \u201cthe lack of negligence in handling was clearly demonstrated by the evidence adduced.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Government even went so far as to suggest, with only the slightest circumstantial evidence that the notes had been stolen on behalf of one of the defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">The appellees, on the other hand, contend that \u201cthe question of negligence was and is a viable one in this case.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although they offered the District Court no evidence that anything done by the Government or the reporting service was not in accordance with accepted practices, appellee Jackson maintains on this appeal that \u201cthe inexplicable loss of such important papers automatically raises a serious question of good faith and negligence. And the procedures employed by (the reporting service) <em>must have been inadequate, </em>given the secrecy and importance of the notes to the defense, or else the loss would not have occurred.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-13\">Despite the debate on this appeal on the negligence question, our examination of the record indicates that the trial court never expressly decided the issue. It hinted in a few words that the reporting firm had shown itself to be unreliable, but said no more on the subject.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-14\">A. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Stated Reasons</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-15\">The District Judge\u2019s ruling seems to consist of three parallel strands of thought. The first, which is infused most frequently throughout his colloquy with counsel, was expressed as \u201cIn this case, wholly aside from the strict interpretation of Jencks, as a pure matter of fairness, Mrs. Middleton\u2019s testimony was so rambling on the stand here, and so inconsistent and some of her statements so inherently outrageous that as a matter of fairness alone I think perhaps we can\u2019t have the testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter he reverted to this theme: \u201cI am not talking just about the photographic information. I am talking about her testimony generally .... That is absurd testimony, absolutely ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>surd. And then there were other inconsistencies in her testimony . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">He then adverted to the second strand of his thought: \u201cBut normally that would be a matter for the jury, not for me. But Jencks says you must have this material. . . . They say you have got to have them and I think you have to have them if you\u2019re going to put the witness on.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He then amplified this in discussing Lee v. United States:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[Ljikewise here there is no indication but that the reports were destroyed not in the ordinary course of business, but destroyed or lost not by the U. S. Attorney, but by the reporting firm employed by the United States; and that, of course, there is no indication whatever that there was any conscious purpose on behalf of the defendant [sic], and the defense counsel has agreed that was not so . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In referring to our court\u2019s holding in <em>Lee, </em>\u201c. <em>. . </em>the fact, without making any general and sweeping holding, that in all cases the loss of Jencks Act statements will bar the witness. They say that in the context of that case and the delay in trial they cannot permit failure to produce the Jencks Act statement to go by without reversing.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">The third strand of the trial judge\u2019s thoughts were not that the Jencks Act was an absolute bar, but that the law should be evaluated with reference to the importance of the testimony and the possible prejudice to the defendant. He referred to the statement made by an inter-office prosecution memorandum, \u201c \u2018The fact that many of the witnesses, especially Mrs. Middleton, opened up in the grand jury,\u2019 . . . Now surely that indicates the importance of the grand jury testimony from the Government\u2019s point of view. If it is important from the Government\u2019s point of view, surely it is no less important from the defendant\u2019s point of view.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxSh\">In concluding his rationale, the trial judge interwove his first thought, the inherent contradictions and absurdity of the witness\u2019 testimony, with his third, the importance of it to the Government and to the defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-20\">In the context of this case, in the context of the many interviews had by Mrs. Middleton, in the context of her testimony on the stand in this case and the cross-examination, and except for the evidence that she has given on the stand here, there is no written word-for-word question and answer testimony anywhere available or would be available except this testimony in the grand jury which the U. S. Attorney and the grand jury thought was so terribly important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-21\">It appears to this court that the absence of that question and answer testimony before the grand jury would, therefore, under the circumstances of this case and the circumstances and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>evidence we have as to the many statements made by this witness and her testimony on the stand, would be very prejudicial to the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">B. <em>The Government\u2019s Position versus the Trial Court\u2019s Reasoning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Turning now to the characterization of the trial judge\u2019s rationale by the Government, on the original appeal from the pretrial order suppressing all of Mrs. Middleton\u2019s testimony, the Government argued only two points: that the Jencks Act provided no sanction for the \u201cgood faith\u201d loss of the grand jury minutes, and that the defendants suffered no prejudice due to this loss. There was no reference to the factor which appears to us from the transcript to have weighed most heavily in the trial judge\u2019s mind, <em>i. e., </em>the inherent contradictions and lack of veracity (in his opinion) of the witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">On petition for rehearing the Government broadened the scope of its argument, urging that \u201c. . .in failing to overturn the decision of the District Court, the panel in the instant case has in effect imposed upon the Government a form of strict liability in regulating the maintenance of Jencks Act material.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We think this may be an incorrect characterization of the trial court\u2019s rationale. There was not necessarily a rule of strict liability in Judge Hart\u2019s decision, as he repeatedly both made reference to his own disbelief of the witness and weighed the importance of the testimony to the Government and defense, although he did say \u201cyou must have the material\u201d and \u201cin all cases the loss of Jencks Act statements will bar the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">But the Government went even further in its petition for rehearing, and urged upon this court that we interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Augenblick<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and our decision in United States v. Bryant<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as a blanket rule that in all cases a \u201cgood faith\u201d loss of evidence or statements by the Government should not invoke the statutory sanctions of the Jencks Act, <em>i. e., </em>a rule of strict wow-liability. We cannot agree with this as a proper rule for decision either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-13\">II. <em>The Jencks Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACU6\">A. <em>Rationale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-14\">If the judicial process be viewed as a search for truth, then the principal objective of the Jencks Act must be considered to be enhancing the likelihood of truth by enabling the defendant to gain access to previous statements of witnesses and use them as desired to test the accuracy of the actual testimony in court given by the same witnesses.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>Under this view of the judicial process, the penalty imposed upon the Government, authorizing the trial court to strike the testimony of a witness where the Government \u201celects\u201d not to produce the previous statements, is merely an ancillary method employed to compel the Government to assist in achieving the main objective, <em>i. e., </em>the maximum truth in the courtroom. The penalty imposed on the Government, denial of the use of the witness, is strictly subsidiary and is not in any sense the objective of the statute. On the other hand, if the judicial process be viewed as an adversary game, then the failure of the Government to produce the previous statement of a witness results in an automatic penalty to the Government, denial of the use of its witness, just as in a football game offensive holding automatically results in a fifteen-yard penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Viewed in its proper perspective, the judicial process <em>is </em>a search for truth, not an adversary game, and therefore the Jencks Act is not a mandate compelling the trial judge to strike (or bar) a witness\u2019 testimony when a previously made statement, irrespective of the reason, cannot be produced by the Government. On the' other hand, the Government does not necessarily exonerate itself from the penalty of the statute by pleading so-called \u201cgood faith.\u201d Instead, the trial judge\u2019s effort must be to see that the defendant has access to previous statements of a witness to the fullest extent possible under the terms of the statute, in order to further the interests of justice in the search for truth. Whether the testimony of a witness is stricken or barred in advance, however, is in the discretion of the trial judge if eliminating the witness\u2019 testimony would restrict the search for truth rather than assist it in the instant and future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Ordinarily, excluding evidenc\u00e9 will assist this search only where the information has been lost or destroyed, negligently or for an unjustified purpose. \u201cThe language of the Jencks Act bolsters this position. Section 3500(a) speaks of statements in the possession of the United States, and subsection (d) provides that its sanctions apply \u2018[i]f the United States elects not to comply.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is undenied that the United States does not have \u201cpossession\u201d of the statement, a fact which alone does not settle the matter. The United States might have \u201celected\u201d to destroy the statement, which would then have given rise to inquiry as to motive and effect, as to purpose and prejudice. Or it might have acted negligently, and the policy of the statute, the quest for truth, is undercut as much by governmental negligence as by intentional acts of destruction. But the United States has not been shown to have performed any act, wilfully or negligently, to destroy these grand jury minutes, nor has it in the language of the statute \u201celect [ed] not to comply with an order of the Court . to deliver to the defendant any such statement.\u201d The Government has delivered the grand jury minutes of all other witnesses, and all other memoranda bearing on the testimony of the witness Middleton, most of which it could not be compelled to produce. The Government most desperately would \u201celect\u201d to produce Mrs. Middleton\u2019s transcript, too, but it is beyond the Government\u2019s powers to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">We do not read \u201celect\u201d in the literal or narrow sense, but rather as a purposive or negligent act on the part of the Government which has as a direct and foreseeable result the loss or destruction of documents which otherwise the Government could be compelled to produce. Looking to both the words and purpose of the statute, in this case so far there has been no showing that the Government has done either by commission or omission any act which has resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>its inability to comply with an order of the court to produce the grand jury testimony. There is, then, at present no basis under the statute for the application of the sanctions therein prescribed.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">B. <em>Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">The parties here and the trial court draw divergent conclusions from previous decisions of the Supreme Court and this court. The trial court stated, \u201cBut Jencks [statute] says you must have this material,\u201d and cited our decision in Lee v. United States, in which we did say, \u201cBut the Jencks Act does not embody <em>in terms </em>any \u2018good faith\u2019 exception\u201d.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> From this the defendants argue that only if the destroyed or lost documents were completely incorporated in other documents given to the defense can the Government be excused. On the other hand the Government strenuously urges that absent bad-faith suppression or negligent loss by the Government of Jencks Act information a witness\u2019 testimony must <em>always </em>be admitted at trial. This result, according to the Government, is required by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Augenblick,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and this court\u2019s decision in United States v. Bryant.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We see nothing in either <em>Augenblick </em>or <em>Bryant </em>that <em>requires </em>the admission of Mrs. Middleton\u2019s testimony, nor do we see anything in <em>Lee </em>which <em>requires </em>striking or barring in advance her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">In <em>Lee </em>the missing records were of narcotics dealings with the defendant, and the two government investigative agents each said on cross-examination that without such records (which he himself had made) \u201che could not say what the precise scope of those dealings was.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Government was unable to produce the records because they had been destroyed. The defense motion to strike the testimony was denied, an action which on appeal was held to be erroneous. In <em>Lee </em>the act responsible for the non-producibility of the records, even though no evil intent was shown, was a purposeful act by the Government itself. There was also the factor that \u201cthe ability of the accused to defend has already been jeopardized by a deliberate delay between offense and arrest calculated to serve police purposes alone . . . . The police cannot have it both ways, simultaneously seeking the privilege of delay and neglecting their responsibilities under the Jencks Act.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, since \u201cthe Jencks Act does not embody in terms any \u2018good faith\u2019 exception\u201d, we were \u201cslow to imply one\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> in <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-8\">In <em>Augenblick </em>the Supreme Court found that the Government had not purposely suppressed missing Jencks Act information and held the witness\u2019 testimony admissible at trial. \u201c[T]he Government bore the burden of producing them or explaining why it could not do so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>The record is devoid of credible evidence that they were suppressed.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Augenblick </em>clearly did not hold, however, that testimony must be admitted in any case in which the Government is in \u201cgood faith\u201d and nonnegligent. The Supreme Court simply held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in permitting a witness\u2019 testimony even though the Jencks Act information had been lost.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">In <em>Bryant </em>we held \u201cthat sanctions for non-disclosure based on loss of evidence will be invoked in the future <em>unless </em>the Government can show that it has promulgated, enforced and attempted in good faith to follow rigorous and systematic procedures designed to preserve all discoverable evidence gathered in the course of a criminal investigation. The burden, of course, is on the Government to make this showing.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> And we footnoted, \u201cAlthough there <em>is </em>an exception for good faith loss of evidence, . . \u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> thus recognizing that the Jencks Act penalty should not be automatically invoked when evidence once in the possession of the Government turns up missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">Also in <em>Bryant </em>we did say that even though Jencks Act information has been lost or destroyed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-9\">criminal <em>convictions </em>otherwise based on sufficient evidence <em>may </em>be permitted to stand so long as the Government made \u201cearnest efforts\u201d to preserve crucial materials and to find them once a discovery request is made.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-21\">It must be noted, however, that the court\u2019s language in <em>Bryant </em>was permissive and not mandatory, and that it spoke in terms of a conviction already obtained, at a stage when the trial or appellate court would be in a position to review the whole record in evaluating the interests of justice. In the case at bar we have a total ban before trial of one witness\u2019 testimony, based on the combined themes that the Jencks Act requires it (no good faith exception and the importance of the testimony) and the inherent incredibility of the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-22\">Our test enunciated in the <em>Bryant </em>decision and applied to losses occurring prior to that decision is what we have called a \u201cpragmatic balancing approach,\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> requiring the trial court to \u201cweigh the degree of negligence or bad faith involved, the importance of the evidence lost, and the evidence of guilt adduced at trial in order to come to a determination that will serve the ends of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This balancing approach was applied by the District Court on remand in <em>Bryant, </em>resulting in a determination that \u201c[a]lthough the degree of negligence shown is regrettably great, it is outweighed by other factors,\u201d specifically the fact that the tape recording which had been lost was almost entirely unintelligible and would have been of little use to the defense.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-23\">We did not have occasion in <em>Bryant </em>to consider the proposition, raised by appellees here, that even non-negligent loss of Jencks Act material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>may be a ground for imposition of Jencks Act sanctions if the trial court finds that the unavailability of the statement seriously prejudices the defense. Absent due process considerations,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> we hesitate to adopt this position here. As we noted in <em>Bryant, </em>the purpose of discovery rules in criminal cases is \u201c[to] make the trial more a \u2018quest for truth' than a \u2018sporting event.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> While we stated then and still believe that the Government\u2019s burden in this quest for truth \u201cmust be a heavy one,\u201d we do not turn that burden into an absolute duty. All we require is that the Government make \u201c \u2018earnest efforts\u2019 to preserve crucial materials and to find them once a discovery request is made.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> It might be argued that such a rule provides an easy means for the Government to avoid the Jencks Act by pleading innocent loss in situations where it would be difficult for the defense to rebut the Government\u2019s showing of care. But until future cases indicate otherwise, we are not so suspicious of the Government\u2019s intentions with respect to complying with the Jencks Act to justify adopting such a prophylactic rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">III. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Own Belief as to Truth of Witness\u2019 Testimony Is No Part of Jencks Act Rationale</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANZ\">After the trial judge gave his personal evaluation of the witness Middleton\u2019s testimony, he stated, \u201cBut normally that would be a matter for the jury, not for me. But Jencks says you must have this material.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> If the trial judge had omitted the word \u201cnormally\u201d \u2014\u201cBut that would be a matter for the jury, not for me\u201d \u2014 he would have been on sound ground. He erred in thinking that this was an abnormal case in which he was required to evaluate the witness\u2019 credibility, because \u201c. . . Jencks says you <em>must </em>have this material.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-10\">The trial judge thus confused two entirely separate matters, his belief as to the truth of the witness\u2019 testimony and the obligation of the Government to produce Jencks material or incur the penalty provided by the Jencks Act. This was reasoning from a false premise, because there is nothing in the rationale behind the penalty which may be imposed under the Jencks Act that has anything to do with the trial judge\u2019s own belief (or lack of belief) in the witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-11\">As we discussed the rationale of the Jencks Act, \u201cThe command of the statute is thus designed to further the fair and just administration of criminal justice, a goal of which the judiciary is the special guardian.\u201d <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The lever provided by the Jencks Act to \u201cfurther the fair and just administration of criminal justice\u201d is to penalize the Government, if it \u201celects\u201d not to produce the statements. There is nothing in the Act or the background of the Act which implies that the trial judge\u2019s action in striking or barring a witness\u2019 testimony is to be influenced in any way by his opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>the veracity of the particular witness involved. Logically there is no reason why the trial court\u2019s opinion on the witness\u2019 veracity should relate to the Government\u2019s obligation to produce or incur the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">Bear in mind that in the case at bar the trial judge took up the Jencks Act question in a preliminary hearing held to inquire under <em>Wade-Gilbert-Stovall </em>as to the admissibility of eyewitness identification testimony.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> As this court <em>en banc </em>has recently had occasion to observe, in connection with pre-trial suppression hearings on identification, \u201cIn considering the admissibility of identification evidence at trial, constitutional infirmities will bar its admission, but testimonial infirmities go only to the weight of the evidence. We start with the principle, well phrased by Judge (now Chief Justice) Burger in a different context but thoroughly applicable here: \u2018When an eyewitness is willing to give testimony, under oath and subject to all the rigors of cross-examination and penalties of perjury, he must be heard.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In that case as here, we recognized that a witness\u2019 veracity should be considered by the jury and not by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">In the case at bar the problem is not that the trial judge has abused his discretion; in the stated reasons for the exercise of his discretion he has revealed an erroneous rationale for so doing. We recognize that the trial court has discretion in applying the Jencks Act, depending upon his finding as to either the motivation of the Government in destroying the document, or its culpability for negligence, or its exercise of bad judgment in administrative procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">As to the trial judge\u2019s faulty premises : First, he appeared at times to take the mandate of the Jencks Act as being without exception, probably based on a misreading of our opinion in Lee v. United States.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As we discussed above, unless either in the instant or subsequent cases the interest of justice will be furthered by penalizing the Government, then that penalty is not to be invoked automatically as in an adversary game. In order to exclude testimony, there should be a showing of either negligence or purposeful destruction accompanied by either bad motive or bad judgment. Despite the debate on this appeal on the negligence question, our examination of the record indicates that the trial court never expressly decided the issue. It hinted in a few words that the reporting firm had shown itself to be unreliable, but said no more on the subject.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> With regard to the trial court\u2019s weighing the prejudice resulting to the defendants by the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>Mrs. Middleton\u2019s testimony, if the Government was neither malicious, negligent, nor stupid, we do not see that any question of weighing possible prejudice to the defendants arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">The second basic error in the rationale of the trial court was, of course, in barring the testimony of the witness in advance of trial, based on his own doubt of its veracity, and in linking this doubt with his obligation to invoke the penalty of the Jencks Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">It should be noted in concluding that even if the District Court finds some degree of negligence, it need not automatically invoke the Jencks Act sanction. As we said in <em>Bryant, </em>we have adopted a balancing approach for these cases which gives broad discretion to the trial court.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> If, even after finding some degree of negligence, the trial court finds the risk of prejudice to the defense slight, it can refuse to impose the Jencks Act sanctions.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court should feel free to consider all matters relevant to the prejudice issue, including other available evidence of Mrs. Middleton\u2019s grand jury testimony and the importance of that testimony to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">As to the character and extent of the Government\u2019s responsibility, we hold that the negligence of the reporting company, if any and depending on the type, may be imputed to the Government. Because of the various public policies relating to criminal prosecutions necessarily involved here, but of course which do not exist in a strictly private agency relationship, the full scope of the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>should not be applied. Rather, the Government\u2019s responsibility for the acts of its agent, and grounds for invoking the sanctions of the statute to bar otherwise admissible testimony, should be tested more by the principles of negligent entrustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-11\">We therefore remand this case to the District Court for further consideration of the issues of the degree of negligence or bad administrative judgment on the part of the Government and the risk of prejudice to the defense caused by the unavailability of a transcription of Mrs. Middleton\u2019s grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-12\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1121-16\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (1970).

Covello, 410 F.2d 536 (2d Cir. 1969). In this Circuit, however, a frequent practice has developed of determining Jencks Act issues prior to the commencement of trial.
