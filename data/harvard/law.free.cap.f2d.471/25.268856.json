They also challenge as prejudicial error several of the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the admission of evidence and his instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that the evidence adduced at the trial amply supported the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts and that the appellants\u2019 challenges to the trial judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and charge fail to demonstrate prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We do not subscribe to the contention of the appellant John Greeley that the trial judge abused his discretion in permitting the Government to cross-examine him, for impeachment purposes, with respect to his June 16, 1960 robbery conviction which resulted in his imprisonment until 1965. The contention is premised on two grounds: (1) remoteness of the conviction; and (2) its alleged prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">We need only say as to this contention, that we recently re-affirmed the rule in this Circuit that subject to certain limitations, inapplicable here, a felony conviction may be adduced to impeach the credibility of a witness. United States v. Gray, 468 F.2d 257 (decided October 3, 1972). Further, we have specifically held that a trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting, for impeachment purposes, evidence of a 10-year-old felony conviction of a witness. Wounick v. Hysmith, 423 F.2d 873 (1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">For the reasons stated the judgments of conviction will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\">. The defendant-appellant Ronald Greeley\u2019s challenge to the trial judge\u2019s denial of his request for inspection of certain F.B.I. interview reports is without basis. The reports do not contain Jencks Act (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500), or exculpatory (Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963)), material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-10\">.
