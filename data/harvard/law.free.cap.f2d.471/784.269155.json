Citizens Casualty Company of New York, 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b846-20\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b846-21\">Plaintiff, Guy Daniel Crum, an employee of Buras Contractors, Inc., brought suit against defendant, Continental Oil Company, for injuries sustained by him while working aboard a fixed platform owned by defendant, located in the Gulf of Mexico about 30 miles offshore from Grand Isle, Louisiana. The accident occurred on September 11, 1969, at which time plaintiff, along with other Buras employees, was engaged in the maintenance and repair of defendant\u2019s platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-22\">The undisputed facts, taken from plaintiff\u2019s own deposition, indicate that the accident occurred as follows: Crum, employed as a welder\u2019s helper by Buras, was instructed by his foreman to obtain I-Beams of a certain size from a stack of I-Beams on the platform. Three roustabouts, also employees of Buras, were assigned to help pull the beams out of the stack. Pursuant to Crum\u2019s instructions, the roustabouts lifted several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>I-Beams while Crum, using a device called a tugger clamp, attempted to remove the proper sized beam from near the bottom of the stack. As Crum started attaching the clamp to the beam, one of the beams held by the roustabouts fell, and despite the warning cries of the roustabouts, Mr. Crum\u2019s hands were seriously injured by the falling beams. Continental Oil owned and operated the platform and all the materials on the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The district court, with the pleadings and plaintiff\u2019s deposition before it, granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment based upon the following finding: \u201cthere is no material issue of fact .involved in this ease, and . . . the established facts . . . not only fail to show any negligence whatsoever on the part of the defendant, Continental Oil Company, but, in fact, negate any evidence of negligence on the part of defendant. . . . \u201d Plaintiff appeals, claiming that had the case gone to the jury, he would have proven that the accident was caused by defendant\u2019s negligent failure to maintain the platform and materials on it in proper condition. <em>See </em>Washington v. T. Smith &amp; Sons, 68 So.2d 337 (La.App. \u2014 Orleans, 1953); Dupre v. Travelers Insurance Co., 213 So.2d 98 (La.App. \u2014 First Cir., 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">As a general rule, we look with extreme caution in cases where the trial judge has removed a negligence determination from the jury. Under Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., summary judgment will lie only, \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with thei affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See </em>Marsden v. Patane, 5 Cir. 1967, 380 F.2d 489, 491; Sherman v. Hallbauer, 5 Cir. 1972, 455 F.2d 1236, 1241; Croley v. Matson Navigation Co., 5 Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 73, 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Applying these stringent standards, we are unable to say that the district court erred in granting summary judgment. The undisputed facts taken from plaintiff\u2019s own deposition make clear that the accident was caused solely by the dropping of the I-Beam by the roustabouts, who were employees of Buras. Despite plaintiff\u2019s vehement protestations, we agree with the trial judge, and are unable to say that a reasonable juror could have found defendant in any way causally negligent for this accident. The district court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
