Citizens Casualty, Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b179-16\">RONEY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">Appellant Ernest Lee Abshire was convicted of the interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2312 (the Dyer Act), and of the interstate transportation of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. Appendix \u00a7 1202(a)(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-18\">On appeal, Abshire contends that the District Court erred by (1) refusing to grant him a continuance, (2) admitting a jailer\u2019s testimony that revealed a prior criminal record, (3) refusing to sever his Dyer Act trial from his firearm trial, (4) admitting eyewitness identification evidence, and (5) refusing to order the government to produce two defense witnesses. Additionally, as a sixth point, Abshire argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-19\">(1) The general rule is that a motion for a continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial judge\u2019s decision will not be disturbed unless he clearly abused his discretion. Joseph v. United States, 343 F.2d 755 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U. S. 828, 86 S.Ct. 65, 15 L.Ed.2d 73 (1965). <em>See also </em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, 466 F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1972) ; United States v. Valdez, 418 F.2d 363 (5th Cir. 1969); Welsh v. United States, 404 F.2d 414 (5th Cir. 1968). Appellant contends that the trial judge should have granted the continuance to permit newly-appointed co-counsel to familiarize himself with the case. We agree with the District Court that the continuance was unnecessary. Appellant had been represented for the six months preceding the trial by his original coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>sel, who had thoroughly prepared the case and was present throughout the trial, and newly-appointed co-counsel relied upon original counsel\u2019s preparation in conducting a sifting cross-examination and a thorough defense. The District Court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">(2) Appellant contends that his defense was irretrievably prejudiced by the testimony of Mr. Marvin Cash, the jailer at the Pulaski County Jail in Little Rock, Arkansas. Mr. Cash testified that the gun which appellant was accused of transporting in interstate commerce was stolen the night of an escape from the jail. Appellant argues that the references to his previous jail term and to his escape branded him a criminal in the eyes of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Admissibility of evidence is a matter within the broad discretion of the trial court, United States v. Gonzalez, 466 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1972), and this Circuit holds fast to the rule that the prosecution must not employ evidence of prior crimes for the purpose of showing either defendant\u2019s criminal character or his propensity to commit crimes. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Garber, 471 F.2d 212 (5th Cir. 1972). But evidence of prior criminal conduct is admissible if relevant for another purpose. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Payne, 467 F.2d 828 (5th Cir. 1972); United States v. Davis, 464 F.2d 558 (5th Cir. 1972); United States v. McGlamory, 441 F.2d 130 (5th Cir. 1971); United States v. Pittman, 439 F.2d 906 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 842, 92 S.Ct. 138, 30 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The testimony of Mr. Cash was both relevant and necessary to the proof of the crime charged, and admission of the testimony did not unfairly prejudice appellant\u2019s defense. To establish the firearm violation, the government had to prove the identity of the gun which was traced to appellant, the element of interstate transportation, and appellant\u2019s access to the weapon. On these facts, the evidence was properly admitted. It cannot be excluded simply because it established that appellant had escaped from a jail where he had been incarcerated for an earlier offense. The inclusion of references to \u201cjail\u201d or \u201cprison\u201d does not disqualify essential, otherwise relevant, testimony. <em>See </em>United States v. Sutherland, 463 F.2d 641 (5th Cir. 1972) ; Bram v. United States, 226 F.2d 858 (8th Cir. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">(3) Appellant argues that the trial judge unnecessarily compounded the prejudice of Mr. Cash\u2019s testimony by refusing to grant separate trials for the firearm charge and the Dyer Act charge. According to appellant, the testimony establishing the firearm offense, especially the \u201cjail\u201d references, necessarily \u201cspilled over\u201d into the Dyer Act case.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\"> Under Rule 8(a), F.R.Crim.P., two or more offenses may be joined if they \u201care based on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d Motions for relief from prejudicial joinder are authorized by Rule 14, F.R.Crim.P., and they are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. United States v. Lane, 465 F.2d 408 (5th Cir. 1972). The burden of demonstrating prejudice is a difficult one, and the ruling of the trial judge will rarely be disturbed by a reviewing court. 8 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 14.02 [1] (2d ed. 1972). The defendant must show something more than the possibility that a separate trial might have offered him a better chance of acquittal. <em>Cf. </em>Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">In the case at bar, both offenses arose out of the same sequence of events, so joinder was proper under Rule 8(a). <em>See </em>Tillman v. United States, 406 F.2d 930 (5th Cir.), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 395 U.S. 830, 89 S.Ct. 2143, 23 L.Ed.2d 742 (1969). The trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant appellant\u2019s motion for severance was within the limits of his discretion. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>judge carefully instructed the jury to consider each charge separately, and we cannot conclude that those instructions were not followed. Considerations of judicial economy dictate \u201cthat the government should not be made to prove the same facts more than once.\u201d 8 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 8.05 [2], pp. 8-19 (2d ed. 1972). <em>See </em>Tillman v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">(4) Appellant was arrested after he was involved in an automobile accident with the stolen car. The arresting officer drove appellant back to the scene of the wreck where he was identified by the driver of the other automobile. While appellant was being so identified, another eyewitness was able to see him again. Relying upon United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), appellant contends that these witnesses\u2019 subsequent in-court identifications were tainted because he was not advised of his right to counsel prior to the on-the-scene identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The Supreme Court in Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972), refused to extend <em>Wade </em>to investigatory showups held before formal charges had been filed against the defendant. Appellant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Wade, </em>therefore, is misplaced. Moreover, the identification process here did not, when viewed in the totality of the circumstances, violate due process under the standard of Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967), and Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440, 89 S.Ct. 1127, 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (1969). <em>See also </em>Robinson v. Alabama, 469 F.2d 690 (5th Cir. 1972); Marden v. Purdy, 409 F.2d 784 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">(5) Appellant contends that it was error for the trial judge to deny appellant\u2019s motion to compel the government to subpoena and to pay the witness fees for two defense witnesses. According to Rule 17(b), F.R.Crim.P.,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">The court shall order at any time that a subpoena be issued for service on a named witness upon an <em>ex parte </em>application of a defendant upon a satisfactory showing that the defendant is financially unable to pay the fees of the witness and that the presence of the witness is necessary to an adequate defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The rule in this Circuit is clear that a Rule 17(b) motion must state facts that show the relevancy and necessity of the requested witnesses\u2019 testimony. <em>See </em>United States v. Dillon, 446 F.2d 598 (5th Cir. 1971). The trial judge here correctly denied the motion when appellant explicitly refused to disclose any facts which would show that the presence of the witnesses was necessary to an adequate defense. <em>Cf. </em>Samora v. United States, 406 F.2d 1095 (5th Cir. 1969); Welsh v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">(6) Finally, appellant attacks the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his firearm conviction. When reviewing the sufficiency of evidence, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Accordingly, we must draw all reasonable inferences and make all reasonable credibility choices which support the jury\u2019s verdict. United States v. Sutherland, <em>supra. </em>Here, the circumstantial evidence and the testimony of appellant\u2019s accomplice provided a sufficient basis for the jury to connect appellant with the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b181-16\">GODBOLD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ae_\">(specially concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b181-17\">While I agree with Judge Roney\u2019s opinion, it seems to me appropriate to state more specifically the position of the Supreme Court and of this circuit concerning the use of one-man \u201cshow-ups\u201d for purposes of identification. While Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972), held that the investigatory showup prior to filing of formal charges is not a <em>per se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>violation of the right to counsel, it noted that an identification made prior to formal charge remains subject to the requirement of Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967), that it not be so impermissibly suggestive as to violate due process. This circuit has, in view of all the circumstances, held valid under <em>Stovall </em>standards a \u201cone-man show up,\u201d Marden v. Purdy, 409 F.2d 784 (5th Cir. 1969), in circumstances described by us as being such that \u201cthe distinctive description left little room for error.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Stovall </em>itself recognized that \u201c[t]he practice of showing suspects singly to persons for the purpose of identification, and not as part of a lineup, has been widely condemned.\u201d 388 U.S. at 302, <em>87 </em>S.Ct. at 1972. This circuit, along with others, while recognizing the desirability of prompt identification, has stated its reluctance to encourage individual confrontation of suspect by victim when there are no exigent circumstances such as were present in <em>Stovall </em>and in that case made a lineup not feasible. Thus in United States v. Venere, 416 F.2d 144 (5th Cir. 1969), we denied the applicability of the <em>Stovall </em>principle to a confrontation arranged by the private citizen-management of the victim prior to police participation, but said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">Where police custody is involved, the need for a formal lineup may not be circumvented by keeping the arrestee away from the station house while contriving confrontations of a more informal nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">416 F.2d at 148. In Rivers v. United States, 400 F.2d 935 (5th Cir. 1968), we pointed out \u201c[t]he inherent dangers of impromptu identifications,\u201d and \u201c[t]he opportunity for suggestive practices, either accidental or intentional\u201d to which they are subject. 400 F.2d at 940. <em>See also </em>Jackson v. United States, 134 U.S. App.D.C. 18, 412 F.2d 149 (1969); Bates v. United States, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 405 F.2d 1104 (1968).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-19\">. Harris v.
