Following the district court\u2019s denial for the second time of a prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>nary injunction against construction of a jail and other facilities known as the Metropolitan Correction Center (\u201cMCC\u201d) we are called upon to decide whether a redetermination by the General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) that the MCC is not a facility \u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment,\u201d made pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision remanding the case after the \"earlier appeal, Hanly v. Mitchell, 460 F.2d 640 (2d Cir. 1972) (Feinberg, J.), cert. denied, Hanly v. Kleindienst, 409 U.S. 990, 93 S.Ct. 313, 34 L.Ed.2d 256 (1972) (herein <em>\u201cHanly </em>/\u201d), satisfies the requirements of NEPA and thus renders it unnecessary for GSA to follow the procedure prescribed by \u00a7 102(2) (C) of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2) (C), which requires a formal, detailed environmental impact statement. In view of the failure of the GSA, upon redetermination, to make findings with respect to certain relevant factors and to furnish an opportunity to appellants to submit relevant evidence, the case is again remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Since the background of the action up to the date of our earlier remand is set forth in <em>Hanly I, </em>we limit ourselves to a brief summary. Appellants are members of groups residing or having their businesses in an area of lower Manhattan called \u201cThe Manhattan Civic Center\u201d which comprises not only various courthouses, government buildings and businesses, but also residential housing, including cooperative apartments in two buildings close to the MCC and various similar apartments and tenements in nearby Chinatown. GSA, of which appellant Robert L. Kunzig was the Administrator, is engaged in the construction of an Annex to the United States Courthouse, Foley Square, Manhattan, located on a site to the east of the Courthouse and immediately to the south of Chinatown and the aforementioned two cooperative apartments. The Annex will consist of two buildings, each approximately 12 stories high, which will have a total of 345,601 gross square feet of space (214,264 net). One will be an office building for the staffs of the United States Attorney and the United States Marshal, presently located in the severely overcrowded main Courthouse building, and the other will be the MCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The MCC will serve, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Prisons, Department of Justice, as the detention center for approximately 449 persons awaiting trial or convicted of short term federal offenses. It will replace the present drastically overcrowded and inadequate facility on West Street, Manhattan, and will be large enough to provide space not only for incarceration but for diagnostic services, and medical, recreational and administrative facilities. Up to 48 of the detainees, mostly those scheduled for release within 30 to 90 days, may participate in a community treatment program whereby they will be permitted to spend part of each day in the city engaged in specific work or study activity, returning to the MCC after completion of each day\u2019s business.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A new program will provide service for out-patient non-residents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The MCC will be serviced by approximately 130 employees, only 90 of whom will be present on the premises at any one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">In February 1972, appellants sought injunctive relief against construction of the MCC on the ground that GSA had failed to comply with the mandates of \u00a7 102 of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2) (C), which requires the preparation of a detailed environmental impact statement with respect to major federal actions \u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d On March 22, 1972, the application was denied by the district court on the ground that GSA had concluded that the Annex would not have such an effect and that its findings were not \u201carbitrary\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. The Government concedes that construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>the Annex is a \u201cmajor\u201d federal action within the meaning of \u00a7 102 of NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Upon appeal this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s order as to the office building but reversed and remanded as to the detention center, the MCC, on the ground that the GSA\u2019s threshold determination, which had been set forth in a short memorandum entitled \u201cEnvironmental Statement\u201d dated February 23, 1971,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was too meager to satisfy NEPA\u2019s requirements. That statement confined itself to a brief evaluation of the availability of utilities, the adequacy of mass transportation, the removal of trash, the absence of a relocation problem and the intention to comply with existing zoning regulations. In remanding the case this Court, although finding the GSA statement sufficient to support its threshold determination with respect to the proposed office building, concluded that the detention center \u201cstands on a different footing,\u201d <em>Hanly I </em>at 646, and that the agency was required to give attention to other factors that might affect human environment in the area, including the possibility of riots and disturbances in the jail which might expose neighbors to additional noise, the dangers of crime to which neighbors might be exposed as the consequence of housing an out-patient treatment center in the building, possible traffic and parking problems that might be increased by trucks delivering food and supplies and by vans taking prisoners to and from the Eastern District and New Jersey District Courts, and the need for parking space for prison personnel and accommodations for visitors, including lawyers or members of the family. This Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">\u201cThe Act must be construed to include protection of the quality of life for city residents. Noise, traffic, overburdened mass transportation systems, crime, congestion and even availability of drugs all affect the urban \u2018environment\u2019 and are surely results of the \u2018profound influences of high-density urbanization [and] industrial expansion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 647.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">We further noted that in making the threshold determination authorized by \u00a7 102(2) (C) of NEPA the agency must \u201caffirmatively develop a reviewable environmental record\u201d in lieu of limiting itself to perfunctory conclusions with respect to the MCC. This Court granted the injunction as to the MCC but after consideration of the balance of hardships stayed the order for a period of 30 days to enable GSA to make a new threshold determination which would take into account the factors set forth in the opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Following the remand a new threshold determination in the form of a 25-page \u201cAssessment of the Environmental Impact\u201d (\u201cAssessment\u201d herein) was made by the GSA and submitted to the district court on June 15, 1972. This document (to which photographs, architect\u2019s renditions and a letter of approval from the Director of the Office of Lower Manhattan Development, City of New York, are attached) reflects a detailed consideration of numerous relevant factors. Among other things, it analyzes the size, exact location, and proposed use of the MCC; its design features, construction, and aesthetic relationship to its surroundings ; the extent to which its occupants and activities conducted in it will be visible by the community; the estimated effects of its operation upon traffic, public transit and parking facilities; its approximate population, including detainees and employees; its effect on the level of noise, smoke, dirt, obnoxious odors, sewage and solid waste removal; and its energy demands. It also sets forth possible alternatives', concluding that there is none that is satisfactory. Upon the basis of this Assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>ment the Acting Commissioner of the Public Building Service Division of the GSA, who is the responsible official in charge, concluded on June 7, 1972, that the MCC was not an action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">On August 2, 1972, appellants renewed their application to Judge Tenney for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the Assessment failed to comply with this Court\u2019s direction in <em>Hanly I, </em>that it amounted to nothing more than a rewrite of the earlier statement that had been found inadequate, and that some of its findings were incorrect or insufficient. Appellants further demanded a consolidation of the motion for preliminary relief with a jury trial of the issues. On August 8, 1972, Judge Tenney, in a careful opinion, denied appellants\u2019 motions, from which the present appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">At the outset we accept and agree with the decision of the <em>Hanly I </em>panel that the agency in charge of a proposed federal action (in this case the GSA) is the party authorized to make the threshold determination whether an action is one \u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment\u201d as that phrase is used in \u00a7 102(2)(C). Judge Feinberg, speaking for the panel in <em>Hanly I, </em>recognized this screening function of agencies in upholding GSA\u2019s determination that the proposed office portion of the Annex building did not require a detailed impact statement. <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 644. This interpretation comports with the general pattern of NEPA, which contemplates that with respect to each major federal action the responsible official of the federal agency authorized to take the action is the person obligated to follow the \u201caction-forcing\u201d procedures prescribed by \u00a7 102(2) (C), and with guidelines issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (the \u201cCEQ\u201d) and the GSA. See, e. g., Council on Environmental Quality, Guidelines, 36 Fed.Reg. 7724 (April 23, 1971); Implementation Procedures attached to GSA Order [PBS 1095.1A] issued December 2, 1971, by the Commissioner, Public Building Service, 1 Env.L.Rep. 46150-46152.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly we are satisfied that \u201cGSA was the appropriate body to make the original determination as to environmental impact,\u201d <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">We are next confronted with a question that was deferred in <em>Hanly </em>I\u2014 the standard of review that must be applied by us in reviewing GSA\u2019s action. The action involves both a question of law \u2014 the meaning of the word \u201csignificantly\u201d in the statutory phrase \u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment\u201d \u2014 and a question of fact\u2014 whether the MCC will have a \u201csignificantly\u201d adverse environmental impact. Strictly speaking, our function as a reviewing court is to determine <em>de novo </em>\u201call relevant questions of law,\u201d Administrative Procedure Act \u00a7 10(e), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, see K. Davis, 4 Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 29.01 (1958) (herein \u201cDavis\u201d), and, with respect to GSA\u2019s factual determinations, to abide by the Administrative Procedure Act, which limits us in matters not involving an agency\u2019s rule-making or adjudicatory function to determining whether its findings are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d or \u201cwithout observance of procedure required by law,\u201d APA \u00a7 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>(e), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (A) and (D); see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed. 2d 136 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Where the court\u2019s interpretation of statutory language requires some appraisal of facts, a neat delineation of the legal issues for the purpose of substituted judicial analysis has sometimes proven to be impossible or, at least, inadvisable. Furthermore, in some eases a complete <em>de novo </em>analysis of the legal questions, though theoretically possible, may be undesirable for the reason that the agency\u2019s determination reflects the exercise of expertise not possessed by the court. See, e. g., Moog Industries, Inc. v. FTC, 355 U.S. 411, 78 S.Ct. 377, 2 L.Ed.2d 370 (1958), where the Court declined to overturn the Commission\u2019s discretionary determination, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-6\">\u201cIt is clearly within the special competence of the Commission to <em>appraise the adverse effect on competition </em>that might result from postponing a particular order prohibiting continued violations of the law. Furthermore, the Commission alone is empowered to develop that enforcement policy best calculated to achieve the ends contemplated by Congress and to allocate its available funds and personnel in such a way as to execute its policy efficiently and economically.\u201d 355 U.S. at 413, 78 S.Ct. at 379 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIeV\">Accordingly, with respect to review of such mixed questions of law and fact the Supreme Court has authorized a simpler, more practical standard, the \u201crational basis\u201d test, whereby the agency\u2019s decision will be accepted where it has \u201cwarrant in the record\u201d and a \u201creasonable basis in law.\u201d NLRB v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111, 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944); see Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, 307 U.S. 125, 146, 59 S.Ct. 754, 83 L.Ed. 1147 (1939); 4 Davis \u00a7\u00a7 29.01, 30.05 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Noth withstanding the possible availability of the \u201crational basis\u201d standard, we believe that the appropriate criterion in the present case is the \u201carbitrary, capricious\u201d standard established by the Administrative Procedure Act, since the meaning of the term \u201csignificantly\u201d as used in \u00a7 102(2) (C) of NEPA can be isolated as a question of law. This was the course taken by the district court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and is in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), where its review of the Department of Transportation\u2019s authorization of federal funds to finance construction of a highway through a federal park, turned on the meaning to be attributed to a statutory prohibition against such an authorization if \u201ca feasible and prudent\u201d alternative route exists. \u00a7 4(f) Dept. of Transportation Act of 1966, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(f) (1964 ed. Supp. V); \u00a7 18(a) of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1968, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 138 (1964 ed. Supp. V). Speaking for the Court, Justice Marshall declared that upon review the facts should be scrutinized to determine whether the agency decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d as required by the APA and whether the agency followed the necessary procedural requirements. We see no reason for application of a different approach here since the APA standard permits effective judicial scrutiny of agency action and concommitantly permits the agencies to have some leeway in applying the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>to factual contexts in which they possess expertise. Accordingly we conclude that the applicable scope of review of an agency\u2019s threshold determination that an impact statement is not required under \u00a7 102 of NEPA is the \u201carbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion\u201d standard. See, e. g., Echo Park Residents Committee 'V. Romney, 3 E.R.C. 1255 (C.D.Calif. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Upon attempting, according to the foregoing standard, to interpret the amorphous term \u201csignificantly,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 102(2) (C), we are faced with the fact that almost every major federal action, no matter how limited in scope, has <em>some </em>adverse effect on the human environment. It is equally clear that an action which is environmentally important to one neighbor may be of no consequence to another. Congress could have decided that every major federal action must therefore be the subject of a detailed impact statement prepared according to the procedure prescribed by \u00a7 102(2) (C). By adding the word \u201csignificantly,\u201d however, it demonstrated that before the agency in charge triggered that procedure, it should conclude that a greater environmental impact would result than from \u201cany major federal action.\u201d Yet the limits of the key term have not been adequately defined by Congress or by guidelines issued by the CEQ and other responsible federal agencies vested with broad discretionary powers under NEPA. Congress apparently was willing to depend principally upon the agency\u2019s good faith determination as to what conduct would be sufficiently serious from an ecological standpoint to require use of the full-scale procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Guidelines issued by the CEQ, which are echoed in rules for implementation published by the Public Buildings Service, the branch of GSA concerned with the construction of the MCC, suggest that a formal impact statement should be prepared with respect to \u201cproposed actions, the environmental impact of which is likely to be highly controversial.\u201d See Council on Environmental Quality, Statements on Proposed Federal Actions Affecting the Environment, Guidelines \u00a7 5(b), 36 Fed.Reg. 7724 (April 23, 1971); Public Buildings Service, Environmental Statements, Attachments \u00a7 la(5) (Dec. 2, 1971), 1 Env.L. Rep. 46151. However, the term \u201ccontroversial\u201d apparently refers to cases where a substantial dispute exists as to the size, nature or effect of the major federal action rather than to the existence of opposition to a use, the effect of which is relatively undisputed. This Court in <em>Hanly I, </em>for instance, did not require a formal impact statement with respect to the office building portion of the Annex despite the existence of neighborhood opposition to it. The suggestion that \u201ccontroversial\u201d must be equated with neighborhood opposition has also been rejected by others. See Citizens for Reid State Park v. Laird, 336 F.Supp. 783 (D.Me.l972).<footnotemark>9A</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">In the absence of any Congressional or administrative interpretation of the term, we are persuaded that in deciding whether a major federal action will \u201csignificantly\u201d affect' the quality of the human environment the agency in charge, although vested with broad discretion, should normally be required to review the proposed action in the light of at least two relevant factors: (1) the extent to which the action will cause adverse environmental effects in excess of those created by existing uses irTtKe area affected by it, and (2) the absolute quantitative adverse environmental effects of the action itself, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>the cumulative harm that results from its contribution to existing adverse conditions or uses in the affected area. Where conduct conforms to existing uses, its adverse consequences will usually be less significant than when it represents a radical change. Absent some showing that an entire neighborhood is in the process of redevelopment, its existing environment, though frequently below an ideal standard, represents a norm that cannot be ignored. For instance, one more highway in an area honeycombed with roads usually has less of an adverse impact than if it were constructed through a roadless public park. See, e. g., Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Although the existing environment of the area which is the site of a major federal action constitutes one criterion to be considered, it must be recognized that even a slight increase in adverse conditions that form an existing environmental milieu may sometimes threaten harm that is significant. One more factory polluting air and water in an area zoned for industrial use may represent the straw that breaks the back of the environmental camel. Hence the absolute, as well as comparative, effects of a major federal action must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Chief Judge Friendly\u2019s thoughtful dissent, while conceding that we (and governmental agencies) face a difficult problem in determining the meaning of the vague and amorphous term \u201csignificantly\u201d as used in \u00a7 102(2) (C), offers no solution other than to suggest that an impact statement should be required whenever a major federal action might be \u201carguably\u201d or \u201cpotentially\u201d significant and that such an interpretation would insure the preparation of impact statements except in cases of \u201ctrue\u201d insignificance. In our view this suggestion merely substitutes one form of semantical vagueness for another. By failure to use more precise standards it would leave the agency, which admittedly must make the determination, in the very quandary faced in this case and only serve to prolong and proliferate uncertainty as to when a threshold determination should be accepted. The problem is not resolved by use of terms as <em>\u201cobviously </em>insignificant,\u201d \u201cminor,\u201d <em>\u201carguably </em>significant,\u201d a <em>\u201cfairly arguable\u201d </em>adverse impact, or the like, or by reference to \u201cgrey\u201d areas or characterization of our opinion as \u201craising the floor\u201d to permit agencies to escape an impact statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">We agree with Chief Judge Friendly that an impact statement should not be required where the impact will be minor or unimportant, or where \u201cthere is no sensible reason for making one,\u201d and that such a statement should be required where the action may fairly be said to have a potentially significant adverse effect. But these conclusions merely pose the problem which cannot be solved by an interchange of adjectives. In our view such a morass can be avoided only by formulation of more precise factors that must be considered in making the essential threshold determination. This we have attempted to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">In the absence of such standards we cannot agree that construction of a proposed office building of the type forming part of the Annex would be \u201cobviously insignificant\u201d and hence would not require an impact statement. An office building or, indeed, a jail, may have an adverse impact in an area where such use does not exist and is not permitted by zoning laws (e. g., Park Avenue and 72nd Sreet) whereas the contrary would hold in a location where such uses do exist and are authorized by such laws (e. g., the location of the MCC). See Goose Hollow Foothills League v. Romney, 334 F.Supp. 877 (D.Ore.1971) (setting aside threshold determination that high-rise building would not significantly affect environment where no weight had been given to fact that it would change character of neighborhood and concentrate population in the neighborhood). Rather than encourage agencies to dispense with impact statements, we believe that application of the foregoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>objective standards, coupled with compliance with minimum procedural requirements (specified below), which are designed to assure consideration of relevant facts, will lead agencies in doubtful cases (so-called \u201cgrey\u201d areas) to obtain impact statements rather than to risk the delay and expense of protracted litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Although this Court in <em>Hanly I </em>did not expressly articulate the standards we have used, its decision that the proposed office building portion of the Annex would not be environmentally significant conforms to the rationale. The office building would not differ substantially from the makeup of the surrounding area. Nor would it in absolute terms give rise to sizeable adverse environmental effects. Most of the employees occupying the building would merely be transferred from the existing Courthouse where the newly created space will be used primarily for courtrooms and desperately needed office space for court personnel. On the other hand, the proposed jail, for reasons set forth in detail in <em>Hanly I, </em>might have adverse effects differing both qualitatively and quantitatively from those associated with existing uses in the area. Moreover there was insufficient evidence that the absosolute environmental effect with respect to the jail had been analyzed and considered by the GSA. Thus the matter was remanded for reappraisal. Now that the GSA has made and submitted its redetermination in the form of a 25-page \u201cAssessment,\u201d our task is to determine (1) whether it satisfies the foregoing tests as to environmental significance, and (2) whether GSA, in making its assessment and determination, has observed \u201cprocedure required by law\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 10 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The Assessment closely parallels in form a detailed impact statement. The GSA\u2019s finding that the MCC would harmonize architecturally with existing buildings in the area, and even enhance the appearance of the neighborhood, is supported by details of the proposed building, architectural renditions, and photographs of the area. The facade of the MCC and of the Annex office building are designed to reflect the first cornice height of the Municipal Building, a prominent architectural feature of both the United States Courthouse and the New York Supreme Court, and to blend closely in appearance and geometry with the surrounding buildings, including the newly constructed New York City Police Headquarters. The windows, which will be glazed with unbreakable polycarbonate plastic shatter-proof sheets will be recessed and will be of a dark gray color designed to insulate the community from visual contact with the detainees. Moreover, there will be no fortress walls or unsightly steel-barred windows, cf. Ely v. Velde, 451 F.2d 1130 (4th Cir. 1971). In short, the building will not look like a correctional center.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">The Assessment further describes efforts that will be made to minimize any contact between detainees and members of the community. In addition to the recessed, darkened windows, all prisoners will enter the building through an entrance on Cardinal Hayes Place, located on the side opposite from and out of view of neighborhood residental apartments. Although there will be a roof-top recreational area for detainees, a 20-foot wall will minimize their visibility from the apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The Assessment further notes that any increase in traffic from MCC will be extremely slight. One van will take and return detainees on one daily round trip during weekdays to the Eastern District Courthouse and to the Newark District Courthouse. However, this traffic will be offset by the fact that two vans currently used to bring prisoners from West Street to the Courthouse in Foley Square' daily will be eliminated since these prisoners will be transported from the MCC across enclosed bridges connecting it with the Courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Visiting hours at the MCC will be permitted between 8:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. and between 7:00 P.M. and 9:00 P.M. The GSA Assessment projected on ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>the basis of past experience that approximately 130 visitors will arrive per day with no more than 20 on the premises at any one time. This would not impose any excessive burden on mass transportation facilities, which are nearby, numerous and include several subway lines and bus routes described in detail. In addition to limited parking during the day on certain nearby streets, there are at least six garages or lots available for parking in the area, also identified by location and capacity. There will be only four truck deliveries of supplies per day to the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The windows of the MCC are designed to minimize any noise from within the premises, in addition to which detainees will be under constant supervision when outside on the roof-top for recreational purposes. During the past five years there have been only two small inside disturbances at the present detention facility at West Street, Manhattan, and three outside disturbances, the latter confined to non-violent picketing, marching and the like, incidents which have been common occurrence in the Foley Square area during the same period.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The Assessment makes clear that the MCC will not produce any unusual or excessive amounts of smoke, dirt, obnoxious odors, solid waste, or other forms of pollution. The utilities required to heat and air-condition the building are readily available and the MCC is designed to incorporate energy-saving features, so that no excessive power demands are posed. The GSA further represents that the building will conform to all local codes, use and zoning, and attaches a letter from the New York City Office of Lower Manhattan Development dated August 4, 1971, indicating approval of the Annex, which includes the MCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Appellants contend that the Assessment is merely a \u201crewrite\u201d of GSA\u2019s earlier February 23, 1971 \u201cEnvironmental Statement\u201d found inadequate in <em>Hanly 1, </em>and that GSA has failed to take into consideration certain adverse facts. A comparison of the 25-page detailed Assessment with the earlier statement reveals that the former is far more than a \u201crewrite\u201d and that it furnishes detailed findings with respect to most of the relevant factors unmentioned in the earlier statement. On its face the Assessment indicates that GSA has redetermined the environmental impact of the MCC with care and thoroughness. In the absence of contrary factual proof, we would have no hesitancy in upholding it, whether it is reviewed by the \u201carbitrary, capricious\u201d standard or the \u201crational basis\u201d test. Judged by the comparative uses in the area and according to its quantitative environmental effects, the MCC should not have a significant effect upon the human environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Appellants offer little or no evidence to contradict the detailed facts found by the GSA. For the most part their opposition is based upon a psychological distaste for having a jail located so close to residential apartments, which is understandable enough. It is doubtful whether psychological and sociological effects upon neighbors constitute the type of factors that may be considered in making such a determination since they do not lend themselves to measurement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However we need not decide that issue because these apartments were constructed within two or three blocks of another existing jail, The Manhattan House of Detention for Men, which is much larger than the proposed MCC and houses approximately 1,200 prisoners.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore the area in which the MCC is located has at all times been zoned by the City of New York as a commercial district designed to provide for a wide range of uses, <em>specifically including \u201cPrisons.\u201d </em><footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Despite the GSA\u2019s scrupulous efforts the appellants do present one or two factual issues that merit further consideration and findings by the GSA. One bears on the possibility that the MCC will substantially increase the risk of crime in the immediate area, a relevant factor as to which the Assessment fails to make an outright finding despite the direction to do so in <em>Hanly I. </em>Appellants urge that the Community Treatment Program<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the program for observation and study of non-resident out-patients <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> will endanger the health and safety of the immediate area by exposing neighbors and passersby to drug addicts visiting the MCC for drug maintenance and to drug pushers and hangers-on who would inevitably frequent the vicinity of a drug maintenance center. If the MCC were to be used as a drug treatment center, the potential increase in crime might tip the scales in favor of a mandatory detailed impact statement. The Government has assured us by post-argument letter addressed to the Court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-4\">\u201cNeither the anticipated nonresident pre-sentence study program nor any program to be conducted within the Metropolitan Correction Center will include drug maintenance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">While we do not question the Government\u2019s good faith, a finding in the matter by GSA is essential, since the Assessment is ambiguous as to the scope of the non-resident out-patient observation program and makes no finding on the subject of whether the MCC will increase the risk of crime in the community.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition one of the appellants, Sien Wei Liu, has furnished to the district court an affidavit taking issue with certain facts found by the GSA, including the visibility of the jail\u2019s rear entrance from nearby apartment buildings, the distance of the MCC from the closest apartment, the possible use of nearby overcrowded community medical facilities by prisoners, and the claim that certain city officials are opposed to the location of the MCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">Appellants further contend that they have never been given an opportunity to discuss the MCC with any governmental agency prior to GSA\u2019s submission of its Assessment, which raises the question whether the agency acted \u201cwith-, out observance of procedure required by law,\u201d see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). We do not share the Government\u2019s view that the procedural mandates of \u00a7 102(A), (B), and (D), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(A), (B) and (D), apply only to actions found by the agency itself to have a significant environmental effect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While these sections are somewhat opaque, they are not expressly limited to \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d Indeed if they were so limited \u00a7 102(D), which requires the agency to develop appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>alternatives to the recommended course of action, would be duplicative since \u00a7 102(C), which does apply to actions \u201csignificantly affecting\u201d the environment, specifies that the detailed impact statement must deal with \u201calternatives to the proposed action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2) (C)(iii). However, in our view the Assessment does, in fact, satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 102(2) (A) that an interdisciplinary approach taking into account the \u201cnatural and social sciences and the environmental design arts\u201d be used. The GSA has retained architects familiar with the design requirements of the Civic Center and consulted with the Office of Lower Manhattan Development in an effort to harmonize the MCC with the Civic Center. The Assessment scrupulously takes into account the aesthetics and the tangible factors involved in the designing and planning of the MCC. Furthermore we find that \u00a7 102 (2) (D) was complied with insofar as the GSA specifically considered the alternatives to continuing operation at the present facility at West Street and evaluated the selected site as compared with other specified possibilities. Although the assessment of the alternative sites was not as intensive as we might hope, its failure to analyze them in further detail does not warrant reversal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">A more serious question is raised by the GSA\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 102(2)(B), which requires the agency to \u201cidentify and develop methods and procedures . . . which will insure that presently unquantified environmental amenities and values may be given appropriate consideration in decision-making along with economic and technical considerations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332 (2)(B). Since an agency, in making a threshold determination as to the \u201csignificance\u201d of an action, is called upon to review in a general fashion the same factors that would be studied m depth for preparation of a detailed environmental impact statement, \u00a7 102(2) (B) requires that some rudimentary procedures be designed to assure a fair and informed preliminary decision. Otherwise the agency, lacking essential information, might frustrate the purpose of NEPA by a threshold determination that an impact statement is unnecessary. Furthermore, an adequate record serves to preclude later changes in use without consideration of their environmental significance as required by NEPA.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Where a proposed major federal action may affect the sensibilities of a neighborhood, the prudent course would be for the agency in charge, before making a threshold decision, to give notice to the community of the contemplated action and to accept all pertinent information proffered by concerned citizens with respect to it. Furthermore, in line with the procedure usually followed in zoning disputes, particularly where emotions are likely to be aroused by fears, or rumors of misinformation, a public hearing serves the dual purpose of enabling the agency to obtain all relevant data and to satisfy the community that its views are being considered. However, neither NEPA nor any other federal statute mandates the specific type of procedure to be followed by federal agencies. There is no statutory requirement that a public hearing be held before a site for a house of detention is selected by the Attorney General or construction of the facility is undertaken by the GSA. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4003, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 602-606. Although the Guidelines issued by the CEQ suggest that agencies \u201cshall include, whenever appropriate, provision for public hearings, and shall provide the public with relevant information, including information on alternative courses of action,\u201d Council on Environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Quality, Statements on Proposed Federal Actions Affecting the Environment, Guidelines \u00a7 10(e), 36 Fed.Reg. 7724, 7726 (April 23, 1971), these provisions apply only to the procedure for preparation of detailed impact statements <em>after </em>the preliminary determination of significance has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Notwithstanding the absence of .statutory or administrative provisions on the subject, this Court has already held in <em>Hanly I </em>at 647 that federal agencies must \u201caffirmatively develop a reviewable environmental record . . . even for purposes of a threshold section 102 (2) (C) determination.\u201d We now go further and hold that before a preliminary or threshold determination of significance is made the responsible agency must give notice to the public of the proposed major federal action and an opportunity to submit relevant facts which might bear upon the agency\u2019s threshold decision. We do not suggest that a full-fledged formal hearing must be provided before each such determination is made, although it should be apparent that in many cases such a hearing would be advisable for reasons already indicated. The necessity for a hearing will depend greatly upon the circumstances surrounding the particular proposed action and upon the likelihood that a hearing will be more effective than other methods in developing relevant information and an understanding of the proposed action. The precise procedural steps to be adopted are better left to the agency, which should be in a better position than the court to determine whether solution of the problems faced with respect to a specific major federal action can better be achieved through a hearing or by informal acceptance of relevant data.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">In view of the Assessment\u2019s failure to make findings with respect to the possible existence of a drug maintenance program at the MCC, the increased risk of crime that might result from the operation of the MCC, and the fact that appellants have challenged certain findings of fact, we remand the case for the purpose of requiring the GSA to make a further investigation of these issues, with directions to accept from appellants and other concerned citizens such further evidence as they may proffer within a reasonable period, to make supplemental findings with respect to these issues, and to redetermine whether the MCC \u201csignificantly affects the quality of the human environment\u201d. If, as a result of such further investigation, the GSA concludes that a detailed environmental impact statement is required, a preliminary injunction will be granted restraining further construction of the MCC until the agency has complied with the procedures required by \u00a7 102(2) (C) of NEPA. In the event that the GSA reaffirms its initial determination, the district court will determine, should a further request be made, whether preliminary injunctive relief is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">With the aid of hindsight we recognize, as does the dissent, that a further Assessment, when added to the time and expense already incurred, will prolong the final determination far beyond the time that would have been required if the energies of the GSA had been directed initially toward the preparation of an impact statement. However, important issues have been presented and there is no suggestion of bad faith or deliberate delay on the part of anyone. Indeed if the need for an impact statement had been obvious, this Court in <em>Hanly I </em>would hardly have accepted the initial determination with respect to the office building portion of the Annex and remanded the case for a further determination as to the MCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">.

It gives too little because it raises the floor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>what constitutes \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332 (2)(C), higher than I believe Congress intended. It gives too much because it requires that before making a threshold determination that no impact statement is demanded, the agency must go through procedures which I think are needed only when an impact statement must be made. The upshot is that a threshold determination that a proposal does not constitute major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment becomes a kind of mini-impact statement. The preparation of such a statement under the conditions laid down by the majority is unduly burdensome when the action is truly minor or insignificant. On the other hand, there is a danger that if the threshold determination is this elaborate, it may come to replace the impact statement in the grey area between actions which, though \u201cmajor\u201d in a monetary sense, are obviously insignificant (such as the construction of the proposed office building) and actions that are obviously significant (such as the construction of an atomic power plant). We would better serve the purposes of Congress by keeping the threshold low enough to insure that impact'' statements are prepared for actions in this grey area and thus to permit the determination that no statement is required to be made quite informally in cases of true insignificance.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">While I agree that determination of the meaning of \u201csignificant\u201d is a question of law, one must add immediately that to make this determination on the basis of the dictionary would be impossible. Although all words may be \u201cchameleons, which reflect the color of their environment,\u201d C. I. R. v. National Carbide Corp., 167 F.2d 304, 306 (2 Cir. 1948) (L. Hand, J.), \u201csignificant\u201d has that quality more than most. It covers a spectrum ranging from \u201cnot trivial\u201d through \u201cappreciable\u201d to \u201cimportant\u201d and even \u201cmomentous\u201d. If the right meaning is at the lower end of the spectrum, the construction of the MCC comes within it; <em>per contra </em>if the meaning is at the higher end.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The scheme of the National Environmental Policy Act argues for giving \u201csignificant\u201d a reading which places it toward the lower end of the spectrum. The statute\u2019s objectives, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321, were \u201cTo declare a national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment; [and] to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment . . . . \u201d Section 4332 outlines methods designed to insure that \u201cthe policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the[se] policies.\u201d Most of its provisions are hortatory; the only one with teeth is the mandate in subdivision (2) (C) that each agency must \u201cinclude in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement . . . \u201d covering the five items listed in that section, one of which is described in subdivision (D) at greater length. Subdivision (C) also outlines formalized procedures designed to insure that the expertise, knowledge and interest of Federal, State and local agencies, of the public, and of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) are brought to bear on such statements. These have been fleshed out by the CEQ\u2019s Guidelines, notably \u00a7 10(e), 36 Fed.Reg. 1726 (1971), directing the agencies to develop procedures for the preparation of impact statements which \u201cshall include, whenever appropriate, provision for public hearings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">It is not readily conceivable that Congress meant to allow agencies to avoid this central requirement by reading \u201csignificant\u201d to mean only \u201cimportant,\u201d \u201cmomentous,\u201d or the like. One of the purposes of the impact statement is to insure that the relevant environmental data are before the agency and considered by it prior to the decision to commit Federal resources to the project; the statute must not be construed so as to al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>low the agency to make its decision in a doubtful case without the relevant data or a detailed study of it. This is particularly clear because of the absence from the statute of any procedural requirement upon an agency in making the threshold determination that an impact statement is not demanded, although the majority has managed to contrive one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> What Congress was trying to say was \u201cYou don\u2019t need to make an impact statement, with the consequent expense and delay, when there is no sensible reason for making one.\u201d I thus agree with Judge J. Skelly Wright\u2019s view that \u201ca statement is required whenever the action <em>arguably </em>will have an adverse environmental impact,\u201d Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (S.C.R.A.P.) v. United States, 346 F.Supp. 189, 201 (D.D.C.1972) (three-judge court) (emphasis in original), prob. juris. noted, 409 U.S. 1073, 93 S.Ct. 683, 34 L.Ed.2d 662, with the qualification, doubtless intended, that the matter must be <em>fairly </em>arguable. This qualification reconciles the S.C.R.A.P. holding with Judge Gignoux\u2019 opinion in Citizens for Reid State Park v. Laird, 336 F.Supp. 783 (D.Me.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Beyond the general scheme of the legislation, a court normally looks for guidance, in the case of a statute calling for administrative action, to the views of those charged with its administration. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 433-434, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). However, this does not mean that dominating weight should be given to the views of agencies upon whom NEPA placed a duty to make impact statements when the result would be to relieve them from that obligation \u2014 particularly when these are \u201caction\u201d agencies like the GSA. The National Environmental Policy Act established its own watch-dog agency, The Council on Environmental Quality. The CEQ Guidelines lend additional support to the conclusion that the threshold determination of significance must be set at a low level. They provide that \u201cif there is <em>potential </em>that the environment may be significantly affected, the statement is to be prepared.\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 5(b), 36 Fed.Reg. 7724 (1971) (emphasis added). And they state further, in a remark highly relevant to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-7\">Proposed actions, the environmental impact of which is likely to be highly controversial, should be covered in all cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-8\"><em>Id. </em>This Guideline has been expressly adopted by the GSA in its own regulations, GSA Public Buildings Service Order 1095.1A, Attachment B, \u00a7 1(a)(5) (Dec. 2, 1971). With respect, I see no basis for reading this as limited to cases where there is a dispute over what the environmental effects actually will be. Rather, I would think it clear that this includes action which the agency should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>know is likely to arouse intense opposition, even if the actual environmental impact is readily apparent. Apart from the former being the natural meaning of the words, the CEQ may well have had in mind that when action having some environmental impact \u201cis likely to be highly controversial,\u201d an agency assessment that the action does not constitute major Federal action significantly affecting the environment is almost certain to evoke challenge in the courts. The CEQ could well have believed that rather than to incur the delay incident to such a suit, and the further delay if a court sustains the challenge \u2014 both vividly illustrated in this case where nearly two years have elapsed since the initial assessment that an impact statement was not required and a further remand is being directed\u2014 the agency would do better to prepare an impact statement in the first instance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to possibly providing new information making reconsideration or modification of the project appropriate, such a policy has the added benefits of allowing opponents to blow off steam and giving them the sense that their objections have been considered\u2014 an important purpose of NEPA, as it is of the British statutory inquiry. See Wade, Administrative Law, ch. 6 (3d ed. 1971). The Guidelines thus reinforce my belief that the scheme of the statute requires us to confine \u201csignificantly\u201d to the lower range of the spectrum which that word covers. *</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">I thus reach the question whether, with the term so narrowed, the GSA\u2019s refusal to prepare an impact statement for the MCC can be supported. Accepting the majority\u2019s standard of review, I would think that, even with the fuller assessment here before us, the GSA could not reasonably conclude that the MCC does not entail potentially significant environmental effects. I see no ground for the majority\u2019s doubt \u201cwhether psychological and sociological effects upon neighbors constitute the type of factors that may be considered in making such a determination [of significant environmental effect] since they do not lend themselves to measurement.\u201d The stat- J ute speaks of \u201cthe overall welfare and development of man,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331 ! (a) and makes it the responsibility of Federal agencies to \u201cuse all practicable means . . . to . . . assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and culturally pleasing, surroundings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4331(b) (2). Moreover, \u00a7 4332(2) (B) directs that \u201cpresently unquantified environmental amenities and values ... be given appropriate consideration in decisionmaking along with economic and technical considerations.\u201d I cannot believe my brothers would entertain the same doubt concerning the relevance of psychological and sociological factors if a building like the MCC were to be constructed at Park Avenue and East 72nd Street, assuming that zoning allowed it. While the fact that the area here in question contains many office buildings justified this court\u2019s previous conclusion that construction of the building to house the United States Attorney and other federal officials would not significantly affect the environment, 460 F.2d at 646, it does not support a similar conclusion with respect to a jail. Although there is a larger New York City jail in the neighborhood, a glance from our own windows will show that it must be nearly or wholly invisible to the 3,000 persons living in the two large cooperative apartments, Chatham Towers and Chatham Green, which \u201cdirectly face the proposed new jail, some 100-150 feet away.\u201d 460 F.2d at 642. The effect, at least on these people, is thus wholly diferent from the unseen New York City jail several blocks away. Finally, I do not perceive how the expedient devised by the majority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>deal with appellants\u2019 arguments relating to the Community Treatment Program and the program for observation and study of non-resident out-patients really meets their points. While I assume that the Government\u2019s present intentions with respect to these programs are as limited as it has stated, these may be altered with the passage of time. I see nothing in NEPA that would require a new impact statement if the programs should be augmented as the years pass. This is why, as previously stated, the Guidelines recommend that \u201cif there is <em>potential </em>that the environment may be significantly affected, the statement is to be prepared.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">I do not mean anything said in this i opinion to imply that GSA will be unable | to conclude in an impact statement that | construction of the MCC is justified, j Furthermore, as I have suggested in an-5 other case, \u201cOnce it is determined in any j particular instance that there has been I good faith compliance with those proce- dures [of NEPA], we seriously questio<em>n </em>whether much remains for a reviewing court.\u201d City of New York v. United States (II), 344 F.Supp. 929, 940 (E.D. N.Y.1972); see also Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coil ordinating Committee, Inc. v. AEC, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 33, 449 F.2d 1109, 1115 1(1971); Natural Resources Defense 1 Council, Inc. v. Morton, 458 F.2d 827, 1838 (D.C.Cir.1972); A. W. Murphy, The National Environmental Policy Act and [the Licensing Process: Environmental Magna Carta or Agency Coup de Grace, 72 Colum.L.Rev. 963, 1006-07 (1972). However, as said in City of New York v. United States (I), 337 F.Supp. 150, 160 (E.D.N.Y.1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">To permit an agency to ignore its duties under NEPA with impunity because we have serious doubts that its ultimate decision will be affected by compliance would subvert the very purpose of the Act and encourage further administrative laxity in this area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The energies my brothers would require GSA to devote to still a third assessment designed to show that an impact statement is not needed would better be devoted to making one.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">I would reverse and direct the issuance of an injunction until a reasonable period after the making of an impact statement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-9\">. The majority apparently construes the earlier opinion in this case, Hanly v. Mitchell, 460 F.2d 640, 647 (2 Cir. 1972), as holding that some procedures for public participation are required before making a threshold assessment that no impact statement is required. I cannot agree. The full statement in the opinion was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7F\">But in the context of an act designed to require federal agencies to affirmatively develop a reviewable environmental record, this perfunctory and conclusory language simply does not suffice, even for purposes of a threshold section 102 (2) (G) determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARxv\">What the court was saying was that \u201cin the context of an act designed to require federal agencies to affirmatively develop a reviewable environmental record\u201d <em>by preparing an impact statement, </em>the agency could not escape the duty of making one, at least in an arguable case, by \u201cperfunctory and conclusory language.\u201d This is a long way from dictating any procedure for public participation in threshold determinations. The discussion in 460 F.2d at 648-649 affords further evidenco that the earlier panel did not think there need be public participation before the GSA prepared a revised assessment. In any event, the statute is so clear on this point that I would feel constrained not to follow any contrary dictum, if dictum there were.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-5\">.
