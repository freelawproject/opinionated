We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">THE INVENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">The invention relates to a herbieidal composition comprising a N,N-disubstituted-c(,\u00ab-diphenylacetamide (hereinafter Diphenamid) and 4,6-dinitro-o-sec.butyl-phenol (hereinafter DNBP) dissolved in a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent, and a method of using that composition to control weeds. As background, the specification acknowledges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-18\">Both N,N-disubstituted-o(,o(-diphenylacetamide and 4,6-dinitro-o-sec.butyl-phenol are known herbicides. The former herbicide is known to be effective for pre-emergence control of a wide variety of broadleaved weeds and weed grasses as described in U. S. Patent No. 3,120,434 and U. S. Patent No. 3,043,676. The latter herbicide is well-known and effective against annual broadleaved weeds and weed grasses. A combination of N,N-dimethyl-\u00ab,oc-diphenylacetamide and 4,6-dinitro-o-sec.butylphenol for controlling weeds in peanuts was noted in North Carolina Pesticide Manual, p. 43 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-19\">The novelty in appellants\u2019 composition resides in the use of a particular chlorinated hydrocarbon \u2014 e. g. chloroform, methylene chloride, or others possessing 1-3 carbon atoms \u2014 as a solvent carrier for the two herbicides to form an emulsifiable concentrate which can be dispersed in water, if desired, for application to weeds.

id=\"b1464-5\">Pohland 3,120,434 Feb. 4, 1964</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-6\">Lemin et al. 3,152,881 Oct. 13, 1964</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-7\">Worsham et al., \u201cWeeds in row crops-recommended practices\u201d, Research Report, Southern Weed Conference, Jan. 1966, page 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">Worsham discloses little more than what appellants have acknowledged in their specification to be prior art-\u2014 namely, that a mixture of Diphenamid and DNBP has been recommended for control of weeds in row crops of peanuts by application when the ground cracks as peanuts emerge. Worsham is silent as to the carrier for the disclosed herbicide combination. Appellants contended below, as they continue to urge here, that the herbicide actually used by Worsham was a so-called \u201ctank mix\u201d \u2014 a mixture of a wettable powder of Diphenamid and an aqueous solution of DNBP alkanolamine salt, both available commercially at that time and mixed with water in the field just prior to application. The Patent Office has not questioned appellants\u2019 assumption, and we will treat their representation as true for purposes here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-9\">Lemin discloses herbicidal compositions comprising Diphenamid and a particular triazine derivative for use in controlling weeds in crop and turf fields. According to Lemin, those compositions may take the form of solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dispersible powders, emulsifiable concentrates, granular formulations or dusts containing (1) both active ingredients in dispersed or readily dispersible form and (2) a carrier. Further, says Lemin, \u201cwhen general herbicidal activity is desired, a phytotoxic carrier, for example, high boiling mineral oil fractions or chlorohydrocarbons can be used.\u201d Lemin prepares his emulsifiable concentrates by dissolving Diphenamid, the triazine and a surfactant in a water-immiscible solvent carrier, the latter being exemplified by various ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons and ethylene dichloride. A cosolvent can be used \u201cif desired.\u201d It is clear from Lemin that Diphenamid was known at the time of appellants\u2019 invention to be soluble in such chlorohydrocarbons as ethylene dichloride or methylene chloride.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">Pohland discloses the addition of chloroform to a mixture containing Diphenamid and benzene \u201cto render the mixture homogeneous\u201d; thereafter, \u201c[t]he <em>solvents </em>were removed by evaporation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The board found \u2014properly, we think \u2014 that Pohland evidences that those in the art knew that \u201cdiphenamid is soluble in chloroform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">THE DECISION OF THE BOARD</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-13\">The board sustained the rejection of all claims over Worsham in view of Lemin or Pohland. In brief, the board concluded that the use of such chlorohydrocarbon solvents as methylene chloride or chloroform, in which Diphenamid is known to be soluble, as the solvents for the Worsham herbicidal mixture would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art within the ambit of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. It found an affidavit submitted by appellants under Patent Office Rule 132, designed to show that the claimed compositions and method possess unobvious properties and produce unobvious results vis-\u00e1-vis the \u201ctank mix\u201d of Worsham to be \u201cnot * * * persuasive of the claims\u2019 patentability * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-15\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-16\">We think that the knowledge which the references evidence was in the hands of one of ordinary skill in the art at the time appellants\u2019 invention was made is sufficient to establish \u2014 at least prima facie \u2014 that the claimed subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>as a whole would have been obvious at that time. By January 1966, Worsham had disclosed to the herbicide art that Diphenamid and DNBP, apparently in \u201ctank-mix\u201d form, was an efficacious combination for the control of weeds in peanut crop rows. By that time, those in the art also knew, as evidenced by Lemin, that Diphenamid together with a different herbicide was useful for weed control in crop fields in either dispersible powder (tank-mix) form or in emulsifiable concentrate form, with the chlorohydrocarbon ethylene dichloride indicated as a suitable solvent in preparing the emulsifiable concentrate. The conclusion is inescapable, we think, that the preparation and herbicidal use of an emulsifiable concentrate containing Diphenamid, DNBP and a chlorohydrocarbon solvent such as ethylene dichloride, methylene chloride or chloroform would similarly have been obvious to one of ordinary skill, particularly in light of the further disclosure of Lemin and Pohland that those chlorohydrocarbons act as solvents for at least Diphenamid.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">Appellant argues that Lemin\u2019s Example 1 discloses only a \u201ccomplex solvent system\u201d consisting of naphthalene, isopropanol, xylene and ethylene diehloride for use in preparing his emulsifiable concentrates, and hence does not suggest a simple concentrate containing merely a chlorohydroearbon solvent. Apart from the fact that appellants\u2019 claims do not exclude the presence of other cosolvents in addition to the chlorohydroearbon solvent, and an example in their specification actually illustrates the use of exylene as part of their composition, we think appellants have effectively ignored other portions of Lemin which reasonably suggest that Diphenamid is soluble in a single chlorohydroearbon without required addition of further cosolvents. All the disclosure in a reference, not just the specific examples, must be evaluated for what it fairly teaches those of ordinary skill in the art. See, e. g., In re Boe, 355 F.2d 961, 53 CCPA 1079 (1966); In re Chapman, 357 F.2d 418, 53 CCPA 978 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">Appellants\u2019 remaining argument centers around the affidavit of Vostral, submitted in an effort to show that the emulsifiable concentrates of the claims are more effective in removing weeds from soy bean crops than the \u201ctank mix\u201d combination of Diphenamid and DNBP disclosed and used by Worsham. The pertinent portions of the affidavit are reproduced below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-10\">I compared the herbicidal action of the new emulsifiable concentrate form of Diphenamid and DNBP with these two herbicides alone and in a tank mixed form prepared according to conventional formulations (wettable powder of Diphenamid and aqueous triethanolamine salt of DNBP). The four herbicidal formulations were applied to field plots having areas of 200 ft.2. The plots were 10 ft. wide and 20 ft. long, and there were three replications for each treatment including three untreated check plots. The soil in the plots was prepared for seeding and soybeans were planted in all plots the first week in June. The herbicidal test formulations were applied broadcast over all foliage three weeks later. The soybeans and weeds had emerged and were growing actively. The plots were in a field having a heavy infestation of ragweed lambs-quarters, and pigweed. Seven weeks later, the fresh weights of soybeans and weeds were measured on an area 3.3 ft. x 20 ft. \u2014 66 ft.2 \u2014 (two crop rows, 36\" row spacing). The three untreated check plots averaged 8.5 lbs. of weeds, fresh weight and 24.2 lbs. soybeans. These average amounts were each assigned the unitary value 100, and the herbicide-treated plots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>were compared in terms of percentage of the untreated averages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">The results were as shown in the table:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-5\">Treatment and Rate in lbs.

Diphenamid and Pre2.0 + 1.5 58 83 emerge \u00ae) CA8046D 4.0 -f 3.0 57 83</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-10\">The examiner and board were of the view that the affidavit results are insufficient to overcome the prima facie case of obviousness established by the references, Vostral\u2019s conclusions and appellants\u2019 contentions to the contrary notwithstanding. We agree. As the board noted, the affidavit data shows that application of the appellants\u2019 herbicidal composition at a rate of 1.75 lbs./acre total active ingredient \u201cgives results substantially identical * * \u201d to those obtained when the prior art \u201ctank mix\u201d composition is applied at that rate. Composition claims 1-5 and process claims 10-13 contain no limitation concerning the amount of Diphenamid and DNBP herbicidal ingredient in the composition or the amount of those active ingredients applied per acre in carrying out the process. The limitations appearing in composition claims 6-9 and process claim 14 pertaining to a ratio of Diphenamid to DNBP of 2:1.5 are of no avail to appellants either, for such compositions can readily be applied to weeds at a rate of 1.75 lbs. total active ingredient/acre, the rate at which the affidavit shows no nonobvious results are obtained. Clearly, appellants\u2019 objective evidence of nonobviousness is not commensurate in scope with claims 1-14 which the evidence is offered to support. See In re Tiffin, 448 F.2d 791, 58 CCPA 1420 (1971), modifying 443 F.2d 394, 58 CCPA 1277 (1971) and cases therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-13\">With respect to process claims 15 and 16, which do recite that 2.0 lbs. Diphenamid and 1.5 lbs. DNBP (or 4.0 and 3.0 lbs., respectively, in claim 16) are applied per acre, somewhat different considerations apply. Both the examiner and board observed that several references of record, not heretofore mentioned, indicate that chlorohydrocarbons are themselves herbicides, and that appellants have provided no data as to the per se herbicidal activity of the chlorohydrocarbon solvent which is utilized in the emulsifiable concentrate employed in appellants\u2019 process. While appellants deprecate those references as \u201cancient\u201d history and the epitome of \u201cprimitiveness,\u201d it should be noted, as we pointed out earlier, that a reference of relatively recent vintage \u2014 Lemin itself \u2014 discusses the \u201cphytotoxic\u201d effect of ehorohydrocarbon herbicide carriers. The record before us does not contain clear and convincing evidence that any increase in herbicidal activity shown by appellants\u2019 emulsifiable concentrate compositions when applied at rates of 3.5 and 7.0 lb./acre total active ingredient is not due at least in part to the presence of the chlorohydrocarbon solvent in that composition. We think that evidentiary defect is fatal to appellants\u2019 case. See, by way of analogy, In re Lemin, 408 F.2d 1045, 56 CCPA 1050 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-14\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1465-11\"> In their brief, appellants raise no issue with the board\u2019s finding that there is \u201cno reason to expect any problem\u201d as to the solubility of DNBP in various chlorohydrocarbons,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
