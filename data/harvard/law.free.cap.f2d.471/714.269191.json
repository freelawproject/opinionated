The <em>Pioneer </em>is owned and operated by Konkar Maritime Enterprises, S.A., a Panamanian corporation having its principal place of business in Athens, Greece. The shipowner\u2019s sole stockholders are Greek citizens who do not maintain any residence in the United States. Frangiskatos brought this action under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688 and the general maritime law, to recover damages, allegedly sustained in Japan, where Frangiskatos signed on as a member of the <em>Pioneer\u2019s </em>crew, and on the seas between Japan and Australia during the course of the ship\u2019s voyage. The <em>Pioneer </em>has never called at a port in the United States, nor has it ever derived income from American sources. Konkar Maritime Enterprises, S.A. maintains a shipping office in New York, known as Konkar Maritime New York Agencies, Ltd., which assists in negotiating time charter agreements, and forwards to the insurers illness and accident reports for the <em>Pioneer </em>and other enterprises bearing the Konkar name. It has, however, no connection whatsoever with cargo transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-22\">The district court dismissed Frangiskato\u2019s complaint against the shipowner and the shipowner\u2019s agents \u2014 -the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>defendants upon which process was effectively served \u2014 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>see </em>Lauritzen v.

Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947); Fitzgerald v. Westland Marine Corp., 369 F.2d 499, 501-502 (2d Cir. 1966); <em>cf., </em>Grammenos v.
