McCants, an employee of Alabama State Docks and Terminals (Docks), received accidental fatal injuries while working on a pier owned by Docks assisting in the repair of the clam shell of a shore crane owned and then being operated by Docks in the discharge of cargo from the vessel, \u201cS.S. SNEHOLT\u201d, which was under time charter to Alcoa Steamship Company (Alcoa) from its owner, A/S Ivarans Rederi (Ivarans). Mrs. McCants brought suit in admiralty for damages accruing from her husband\u2019s death against Alcoa and Ivarans, who in turn counterclaimed against Aetna Casualty and Insurance Company and Docks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-26\">Upon the pleadings and affidavits on file the trial court granted summary judgment dismissing the suit with prejudice,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based upon an analysis of the undisputed facts and the conclusion that the case was indistinguishable on the facts from, and governed by Victory Carriers v. Law, 1971, 404 U.S. 202, 92 S.Ct. 418, 30 L.Ed.2d 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-27\">We agree with the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions. The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"ADD\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1433-17\">. The S.S. SNEHOLT also was named as a defendant in rem, but apparently never seized or served.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1433-18\">.
