On the day in question, Wooten was released from duty at noon to go to another building in the penitentiary for lunch. He was given a pass by his Prison Industry supervisor to use a freight elevator to descend to the ground floor. The elevator was operated and maintained by the staff of the Prison Industries. Unfortunately the elevator was overloaded, and as a result of its abrupt descent, Wooten\u2019s back was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Without so much as a passing nod at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4126 in his findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial judge found the Government negligent under the Federal Tort Claims Act and entered judgment in favor of Wooten for $3,000 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\"><em>In limine </em>we reject Wooten\u2019s narrow construction of the words \u201cactivity directly related to the prisoner\u2019s work assignment\u201d as limiting compensable injuries to those which occur at the work bench. It is true that whether particular activity being performed makes a prisoner eligible for compensation must, because of variable facts, be left to a case by ease determination. But in the undisputed factual context of this ease we need look only to the standard principles of workmen\u2019s compensation law. \u201cThe basic rule * * * is that the journey to and from meals, on the premises of the employer, is in the course of employment,\u201d 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 15.51, and if, under these circumstances, an employee sustains injury it is compensable. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 15.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Wooten\u2019s injury being compensable under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4126, his exclusive remedy was under that law. United States v. Demko, 1966, 385 U.S. 149, 87 S.Ct. 382, 17 L.Ed.2d 258. The District Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain Wooten\u2019s Federal Tort Claims Act complaint. United States v. Cole, 5 Cir. 1967, 376 F.2d 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with directions that the complaint be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Reversed and remanded with Directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-24\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">. The statute and the Inmate Accident Compensation Regulations of the Federal Prison Industries, 28 C.F.R. 301.1 et seq. establish the test of compensation coverage for prisoners as being whether the injury was suffered in an activity directly related to the prisoner\u2019s work assignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
