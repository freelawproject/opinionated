He was sentenced to serve eight years in the custody of the Attorney General. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Early on the morning of September 4, 1969, federal and state officers arrived at 138 Darson Marie Street, San Antonio, Texas, for the purpose of executing a search warrant. As they surrounded the house, one of the officers peered through a bedroom window and discovered the defendant Mendez asleep on the \u2018bed with an automatic revolver inches away from his hand. While the officer at the window kept his drawn pistol trained on Mendez, the other officers forcibly entered the house and seized Mendez as he awoke. A search of the house disclosed a substantial quantity of heroin in unstamped containers, which the Government introduced as evidence at Mendez\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Mendez\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that by forcibly entering his house without knocking or announcing their purpose, the arresting officers violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the district court therefore erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence found inside the house. The Government, on the other hand, argues that \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d existed to justify the officers\u2019 lack of compliance with the announcement rule. <em>Cf. </em>Miller v. United States, 1958, 357 U.S. 301, 309, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332, 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">Although the Supreme Court generally requires strict compliance with the unqualified terms of the \u201cknock and announce\u201d statute, it recognizes exceptions to the rule. <em>See </em>Sabbath v. United States, 1968, 391 U.S. 585, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 20 L.Ed.2d 828; Ker v. California, 1963, 374 U.S. 23, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726. Similarly the Ninth Circuit has held \u2014 on facts strikingly similar to the facts this case presents \u2014 that federal officers may dispense with the requirement of a prior announcement \u201cwhere to require it would create palpable peril to the life and limb of the arresting officers.\u201d Gilbert v. United States, 9 Cir. 1966, 366 F.2d 923, 932. <em>See also </em>Blakey, The Rule of Announcement and Unlawful Entry, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 499, 542-543 (1964). In view of the drawn weapon lying within the reach of the defendant a prior announcement might well have endangered not only the arresting officers but also the defendant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">On the authority of <em>Sabbath </em>and <em>Gilbert, </em>we hold that in the limited circumstances of this case the arresting officers were justified in failing to comply with the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-17\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\">. \u00a7 <em>3109. Breaking doors or windows for entry or exit.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">The officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in the execution of the warrant.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
