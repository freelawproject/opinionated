See Urback v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 130 N.J.L. 210, 32 A.2d 337 (E. &amp; A. 1943); Gallagher v. New England Mutual Life Ins. Co., 19 N.J. 14, 114 A.2d 857 (1955); Parker Precision Products Co. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 407 F.2d 1070, 1073 (3d Cir. 1969), and cases there cited. Furthermore, we agree with defendant that Johnson v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 53 N.J. 423, 251 A.2d 257, 263 (1969), concerned the right to rescind for false statements in an application for a health and accident policy after the incontestable clause became effective in view of the terms of N.J.S.A. 17:38-13.2 (A) and is inapplicable to this case, where the one-year incontestable clause had not become operative. See Russ v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 112 N.J.Super. 265, 270 A.2d 759, Opinion of Nov. 9, 1970 (Law Division-Essex County); Nardiello v.

These questions and answers in Part II of the Application for Life Insurance signed January 14, 1965, were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">\u201c3\u201d: Have you (c) within the last 5 years had any x-ray, electrocardiogram or other diagnostic procedure ordered by a physician or practitioner? Yes, 1964 \u2014 general cheek up and x-ray after auto accident</p>\n<p id=\"b95-28\">\u201c4\u201d Other than is stated in your answers to the preceding questions, have you in the last 5 years, so far as you know,</p>\n<p id=\"b95-29\">a) had any sickness, disease or injury? No</p>\n<p id=\"b95-31\">b) been admitted to, or advised to be admitted to a hospital or sanitorium or other similar institution? No</p>\n<p id=\"b95-32\">e) consulted any physician or practitioner for any reason, including routine check-up examination? Yes, 1964 gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>eral cheek-up and x-ray after auto accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The application contained this statement immediately before the insured\u2019s signature on Part II:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">I HEREBY DECLARE that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the information given in these \u201cAnswers to the Medical Examiner\u201d is correctly recorded, complete and true, and I agree that the Company, believing it to be true, shall rely and act upon it accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\">. The order also stated that the \u201cfraudulent answers * * * were material misrepresentations.\u201d This diversity case was tried to the court, which found, on the basis of competent evidence, that on January U, 1965, the insured\u2019s doctor examined a swelling under the insured\u2019s arm and had an x-ray taken of the area of the swelling on that date. He informed Red-ler that the swelling was probably a papiloma, or an excess breast, but that a further battery of tests would have to be made, requiring hospitalization. On or about January 11, 1965, the doctor arranged for Redler to enter the hospital for further tests. On January 13, 1965, Redler made application for the life insurance policy in question with New York Life and gave the insurance agent the first semi-annual premium due under the policy. On January 18, Redler had a further examination by Dr. Thaler and the hospital appointment was confirmed. The insurance policy in question was delivered to Redler sometime after January 20 by his insurance agent. At no time did Redler indicate to the agent or to the insurance medical examiner that he had been x-rayed on January 11, 1965, or was about to undergo any further tests. On January 28, the insured entered the hospital and, during his stay, the swelling was diagnosed as a variety of cancer, which caused his death on July 12, 1965. The testimony at trial showed that the policy was issued solely in reliance on these statements. The witnesses revealed that, had the company been advised that an x-ray had been taken on January 11, the company would have waited until after the results of the x-ray were received before issuance of the policy, and that, had the company been advised of the existence of the undiagnosed swelling, the policy would \u25a0not have been issued until a diagnosis was made. These findings were not clearly erroneous. See F.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Also, one of three paragraphs on the application for the policy immediately preceding the signature of the insured provided that the policy \u201cshall [not] * * * take effect\u201d until delivery \u201cand then only if the written representations made in the entire application for insurance would be, without material change, at time of delivery of the policy, ti-ue and complete representations of the state, at that time, of those matters inquired about in such application.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-12\">. In view of defendant\u2019s answer to interrogatory 39(h) stating \u201cwe submit that the evidence would permit the inference of intentional misstatement,\u201d and ihe discussion of the elements of legal fraud during the trial (N.T. 132-33), we reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that the \u201cissue of \u2018legal fraud\u2019 was never pleaded, nor * * * tried at the trial court level.\u201d See F.R.Civ.P. 15(b), providing that \u201cissues * * * tried * * * shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\u201d '</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
