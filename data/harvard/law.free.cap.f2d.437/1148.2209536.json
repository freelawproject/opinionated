Calvert taxes on the value of a home assessed under \u00a7 2036 of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Calvert bought the home less than two years before her death and conveyed it to her daughter, Mrs. Guynn, four months after its purchase. Mrs. Calvert continued to live there until her death. The district court based its exclusion of the home from Mrs. Calvert\u2019s estate on the ultimate finding that there was \u201cno evidence of an express or implied agreement between decedent and her daughter to the effect that decedent would continue to occupy the property during her lifetime.\u201d On the uncontroverted facts we hold that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-18\">Mrs. Calvert, at the age of 81, moved from Denver, Colorado, to Galax, Virginia, in order to be closer to her daughter. Before moving, Mrs. Calvert paid the full purchase price for a house in Galax which Mrs. Guynn selected. The sellers deeded the property to Mrs. Calvert, but the deed was not recorded. Four months later the former owners executed a second deed, joined in by Mrs. Calvert, conveying the property outright to Mrs. Guynn, and this time the deed was recorded. Mrs. Calvert filed a gift tax return covering the home and some securities which she gave to her daughter. Both before and after the second conveyance of the home, Mrs. Calvert was the sole resident. She paid for improvements and paid the property taxes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>Mrs. Guynn, the daughter, paid nothing for the upkeep of the property and received no rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">Section 2036 describes a broad scheme of inclusion in the gross estate, not limited by the form of the transaction, but concerned with all inter vivos transfers where outright disposition of the property is delayed until the transferor\u2019s death. Estate of Linderme, 52 T.C. 305 (1969); cf. C.I.R. v. Estate of Church, 335 U.S. 632, 645, 69 S.Ct. 322, 337, 93 L.Ed. 288 (1949). The donor\u2019s interest need not be reserved by the instrument of transfer, nor need it be legally enforceable. McNichol\u2019s Estate v. C.I.R., 265 F.2d 667 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 829, 80 S.Ct. 78, 4 L.Ed.2d 71 (1959). An interest retained pursuant to an understanding or arrangement comes within \u00a7 2036. Skinner\u2019s Estate v. United States, 316 F.2d 517 (3d Cir. 1963). The understanding need not be express. It may be implied from all the circumstances surrounding the transfer. Estate of Linderme, 52 T.C. 305 (1969); Treas.Reg. \u00a7 20.2036-1, T.D. 6296 (1958), as amended, T.D. 6501 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">Both mother and daughter expected Mrs. Calvert to live in the house indefinitely. Indeed, that expectation underlay Mrs. Guynn\u2019s selection of a house close to her own: \u201cit would be more feasible with her advanced years to have her permanently located where I could look after her a little better.\u201d Mrs. Guynn stated that her mother never discussed the possibility of moving out of the house once she moved in. On the issue of whether they had made any agreement, Mrs. Guynn\u2019s testimony is most crucial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-6\">\u201cQ. Did you and your mother discuss the fact that even though the house was in your name, she would continue to live in it until her death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-13\">\u201cA. Discuss it, why, no. It wasn\u2019t necessary to discuss it. I wanted her with me. I wanted her nearby and she wanted to be with me</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-14\">* -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-15\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsE\">\u201cWhy, no, we didn\u2019t discuss it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avh\">It was assumed * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1204-16\">Consistent with this mutual assumption, Mrs. Calvert retained all the attributes of ownership except bare legal title. She remained in exclusive possession, paid the taxes, made improvements out of her own funds and paid no rent. From every outward indication, Mrs. Calvert\u2019s relationship to the property was no different after the transfer to her daughter than before. Conversely, Mrs. Guynn\u2019s possession and economic enjoyment of the property was totally postponed until her mother\u2019s death. We hold, therefore, that the testimony of Mrs. Guynn and the actions of the parties establish an implied understanding that Mrs. Calvert would retain the possession and enj'oyme'nt of the property within the meaning of \u00a7 2036.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-17\">While the issue of implied agreement must turn on all the circumstances of each transaction, the continued exclusive possession by the donor, and the withholding of possession from the donee, are highly significant factors. On this basis, we distinguish those cases where a residence j'ointly occupied by the donor and the donee has been held not includa-ble in the donor\u2019s gross estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Tax Court has made the same distinction. Compare Estate of Linderme, 52 T.C. 305 (1969), with Estate of Gutch-ess, 46 T.C. 554 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-18\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1203-13\">.
