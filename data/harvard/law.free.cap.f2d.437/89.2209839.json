Excelsior applied before the referee for an order requiring the receiver to personally pay the losses of his operation. The referee ruled against Excelsior. On review, the district court affirmed. This court does likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Excelsior\u2019s theory was that MacDonald was negligent. The referee found that the acts of MacDonald were not the proximate cause of Excelsior\u2019s loss. Also, he concluded that Excelsior had assumed the risk of the receiver losing money.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">Of course, Excelsior was a very large creditor before the bankruptcy proceedings started. It was anxious to keep the debtor open in the hope of getting good sales of the restaurants which did not materialize.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">We find the record justifies the referee\u2019s findings and the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the referee\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
