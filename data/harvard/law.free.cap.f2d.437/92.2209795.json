On this appeal he makes the following contentions: (1) he could not</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">possess the requisite scienter to commit the crimes charged because he is a \u201ccompulsive gambler\u201d; (2) he was the victim of a legislative scheme of entrapment which constitutes a bill of attainder; (3) he did not receive a fair trial because of improper jury instructions by the court and improper jury argument by government counsel; (4) evidence was improperly admitted against him and he was denied the right of confrontation; and, (5) the court erred in failing to suppress certain evidence alleged to have been obtained as the result of a \u201csham arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s contentions and find them totally without merit. The judgment of conviction based upon the jury\u2019s verdict is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
