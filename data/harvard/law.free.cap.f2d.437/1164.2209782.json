He contends on this score that his petition for habeas corpus relief is premised on denial of his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel at his trial, and that the standard prevailing in the sentencing court for testing such a claim is \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-15\">This Court has time and again ruled that in a situation such as here presented habeas corpus relief is unavailable for lack of jurisdiction. United States ex rel. Leguillou v. Davis, 212 F.2d 681, 683, 684 (1954) and its progeny: Mucherino v. Blackwell, 340 F.2d 94, 95 (1965); Frazier v. Blackwell, 325 F.2d 154, 155 (1963); Sims v. Willingham, 300 F.2d 162 (1962), cert. den., 371 U.S. 851, 83 S.Ct. 91, 9 L.Ed.2d 87 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-16\">The cited cases explicitly hold that Section 2255 has made the sentencing court the exclusive forum for challenge to the validity of a conviction and sentence in first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-17\">Section 2255 requires a federal prisoner to exhaust his remedies in the sentencing court and in the Court of Appeals for the circuit in which that court is located, and to apply to the Supreme Court for certiorari from a denial of such remedies, as we explicitly stated in Crismond v. Blackwell, 333 F.2d 374, 377 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-18\">As we said in <em>Leguillou, </em>a motion pursuant to Section 2255 \u201ccan be \u2018inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of * * * detention\u2019 only if it can be shown that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a Section 2255 proceeding from affording the prisoner a full hearing and adjudication of his claim of wrongful detention.\u201d 212 F.2d at 684. Here, Galante has not made such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-21\">Anent Galante\u2019s contention that a Section 2255 application in the sentencing court would afford him an \u201cinadequate and ineffective remedy,\u201d we specifically said in <em>Leguillou </em>at pages 683-684 that \u201cdoubts about its administration in a particular case\u201d does not make the remedy \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>Here Galante seeks by his habeas corpus petition to make a collateral attack on legal standards in effect in the Second Circuit. We cannot give sanction to such attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">The Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1219-22\"> The Lewisburg Penitentiary is located in the Middle District.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
