The relevant facts are not in dispute and may be stated briefly as follows. In July 1964 Ulku Gurkan, an unmarried Turkish citizen, came to the United States as an exchange visitor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under the auspices of the Agency for International Development (AID) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Her purpose in coming here was to study psychiatric nursing in order to qualify as an instructor at the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing in Istanbul. She obtained several extensions of her original visa which enabled her to complete her studies and obtain a master\u2019s degree in psychiatric nursing from Boston University. The last extension expired on January 30, 1969. On March 9, 1969, she married Charles A. Silverman, an American citizen, and on April 24th of the same year applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for a waiver of the statutory two-year foreign residence requirement which normally she would have to meet before being allowed to return to the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e) (1964). In her application for the waiver she stated that to require her to leave this country would impose exceptional hardship on her husband because of his ill health. The rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>vant statutory waiver provision upon which she relies reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\"><em>\u201cProvided further, </em>That upon the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency, or of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he has determined that departure from the United States would impose exceptional hardship upon the alien\u2019s spouse or child (if such spouse or child is a citizen of the United States or a lawfully resident alien), the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attorney General to be in the public interest; * * *\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e) (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Despite strenuous objection from AID, the INS found that the applicant\u2019s compliance with the two-year foreign residency requirement would impose exceptional medical hardship on her new husband and requested that the Secretary of State recommend whether the waiver should be granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary recommended that the waiver not be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 11, 1969, INS notified Mrs. Silverman, <em>inter alia, </em>that both the State Department and INS had carefully reviewed the facts in her case; that the State Department had recommended against granting her waiver; that accordingly her application had been denied and that she must arrange to leave the United States on or before a specified date.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">On January 30, 1970, the Silvermans brought the instant suit to enjoin the commencement of deportation proceedings against Mrs. Silverman and for a judgment instructing the defendants to issue the waiver. They argued that under the statute only the INS was authorized to make the decision in hardship waiver applications and that the Secretary of State\u2019s recommendation was a mere matter of form. Alternatively, they contended that to deny Mrs. Silver-man residency in the United States would deprive both plaintiffs of their right to liberty under the Fifth Amendment. The defendants moved for dismissal of the complaint or in the alternative for summary judgment. The district court took jurisdiction of the case <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and decided for the plaintiffs, granting a preliminary injunction on February 25, 1970, 309 F.Supp. 570, and a final injunction on March 9, 1970. The Government appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The district court construed the statutory waiver proviso set out above \u201cto provide that decision by the Attorney General whether to waive the foreign residence requirement may be based either upon the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State or upon that of the [INS] Commissioner after determination of exceptional hardship.\u201d The court then went on to say,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">\u201cThis construction seems to be required by the plain language of [the proviso], especially the punctuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>and the word \u2018of\u2019 as underlined in the following excerpt, \u2018That upon the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State, pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government Agency, or_of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he has * * \u201d Silverman v. Rogers, 309 F.Supp. 570, 574 (D. Mass.1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The court noted that its decision was \u201cat odds\u201d with regulations implementing the exchange-visitor program <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but felt that its interpretation guarded \u201cthe interest obviously underlying the particular proviso, to wit, protection of a United States citizen against exceptional hardship, which interest ordinarily conflicts with considerations of foreign policy of prime concern to the Secretary of State.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We start with the thought that in spite of some awkwardness in its structure, the statute lends itself to a construction unfavorable to appellees. It also lends itself to a construction favorable, but we cannot agree with the district court\u2019s view that this latter is \u201crequired by the plain language.\u201d 309 F. Supp. at 574. The question is, which clause modifies which. The ultimate provision for the waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement may be read to be conditioned upon, (a) the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State pursuant to the request of an interested United States Government agency, or (b) the request of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he has determined hardship. However, it is equally possible to read the statute as authorizing waiver conditioned upon the recommendation of the Secretary of State when he (a) has received a request of a government agency, or (b) has received a request of the Commissioner after he had determined hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">In the light of this ambiguity it becomes important to examine the legislative history. The proviso in question was added by the 1961 revision of the statute. It was derived from a then-existing provision which read,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">\u201cupon request of an interested Government agency and the recommendation of the Secretary of State, the Attorney General may waive such two-year period of residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attorney General to be in the public interest.\u201d Act of June 4, 1956, ch. 356, 70 Stat. 241.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">Although the 1956 statute did not make any provision for hardship cases, the State Department's regulations took them into account. 22 Fed.Reg. 10840 (1957).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Between June 1956 and the end of 1960, the State Department approved 2104 waiver applications out of 2674 such applications received, and 1812 of those approved were hardship cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This liberal policy<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was strong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ly disapproved by Subcommittee No. 1 of the House Committee on the Judiciary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The subcommittee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aal\">\u201cIt is believed to be detrimental to the purposes of the program and to the national interests of the countries concerned to apply a lenient policy in the adjudication of waivers <em>including cases where marriage occurring in the United States, or the birth of a child or children, is used to support the contention that the exchange alien\u2019s departure from this country would cause personal hardship.\" </em>H.R.Rep. No. 721, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 121 (1961) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In light of this, the subcommittee proposed language in place of the then-existing proviso, which is substantially similar to that finally adopted, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\"><em>\u201cProvided further, </em>That upon the favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State, pursuant to the request of a Government agency desiring to obtain the alien\u2019s services for the prospective benefit to the national defense, economy, welfare or cultural interest, or of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he has determined that departure from the United States would impose exceptional hardship upon the alien\u2019s spouse or child (if such spouse or child is a citizen of the United States or a lawfully resident alien), the Attorney General may waive the requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien whose admission to the United States is found by the Attorney General to be in the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The House Committee on Foreign Affairs specifically adopted this suggestion for the 1961 bill. 1961 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2773. In particular, it noted that it was reenacting and amplifying the earlier proviso \u2014 and it also noted that it made only one \u201cimportant change\u201d in the existing law, namely, to allow the Secretary of State to approve variances in the place where the two-year foreign residence requirement could be fulfilled. <em>Id. </em>at 2774. The House approved the committee language as reported. 107 Cong.Rec. 18281 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The Senate version would have kept the language of the then-existing proviso, Act of June 4, 1956, ch. 356, 70 Stat. 241. It should be noted that the Senate report on the bill stated that \u201cThe waiver is subject to a request by an interested agency of the Federal Government <em>and recommendation by the Secretary of State to the Attorney General.\" </em>S. Rep. No. 372, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 19 (1961) (emphasis added). When the Senate received the House version, it voted to substitute the language of its own bill for the House bill and send the bill to conference. 107 Cong.Rec. 18515 (1961). The language of the then-existing proviso (as readopted by the Senate) and the new version drafted by Subcommittee No. 1 of the House Committee on the Judiciary were combined to make the final version. In its conference report, the House managers said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">\u201c[The House bill] reenacted and amplified [Act of June 4, 1956, ch. 356, 70 Stat. 241] but contained one modification, namely, the requirement of the finding by the Secretary of State that the 2 years\u2019 residence abroad of an exchange alien, if not occurring in the country from which he came to the United States, is in accord with the basic purpose of the exchange program. <em>The Senate amendment contained language similar in intent but different in wording. </em>The Senate conferees accepted the House language with amendments.\u201d 1961 U. S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 2779-2780 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the intent of both the House and Senate versions of the 1961 proviso now in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e) (1964), <em>supra,, </em>was the same, namely, to include the Secretary of State in the hardship waiver process. Indeed, it would have been illogical to <em>reduce </em>the number of agencies wielding a veto, given the expressed purpose of Subcommittee No. 1 to grant fewer hardship waivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"> Weight must also be given to the regulations, which have consistently given the Secretary a decisive voice in all waivers. <em>See </em>note 3, <em>supra; </em>35 Fed. Reg. 5958 (1970), 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 1132. \u201cIn case of ambiguity it is appropriate to give weight to the view of the body entrusted to administer the act.\u201d Massachusetts Trustees of Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates v. United States, 312 F.2d 214, 222 (1st Cir. 1963), aff\u2019d, 377 U.S. 235, 84 S.Ct. 1236, 12 L.Ed.2d 268 (1964); <em>accord, </em>American Power &amp; Light Co. v. SEC, 141 F.2d 606, 621 (1st Cir. 1944), aff'd, 329 U.S. 90, 67 S.Ct. 133, 91 L.Ed. 103 (1946). Finally, we note that Congress has not seen fit to question the administrative practice. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A \u00a7 1182(e) (1970), amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e) (1964); 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 874. We therefore resolve the statutory ambiguity in favor of giving the Secretary a veto over hardship waiver applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We turn now to plaintiff\u2019s alternative argument, that to allow the government to refuse Mrs. Silverman the right to reside in the United States would deprive both plaintiffs of their constitutional rights. We see no merit in this contention. Mrs. Silverman enjoys no special right to remain in this country, it being within congressional discretion to place conditions on her right of entry or continued residence. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 584-591, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952); Perdido v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 420 F.2d 1179, 1181 (5th Cir. 1969). Plaintiffs also argue that the government\u2019s action here is destroying their marriage. Even assuming that the federal government had no right either to prevent a marriage or destroy it, we believe that here it has done nothing more than to say that the residence of one of the marriage partners may not be in the United States. It does not attack the validity of the marriage. Swartz v. Rogers, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 254 F.2d 338, 339, cert. denied, 357 U.S. 928, 78 S.Ct. 1373, 2 L.Ed.2d 1372 (1958); <em>cf. </em>Papageorgiou v. Esperdy, 212 F.Supp. 874, 877 (S.D.N. Y.1963); <em>see also </em>Mendez v. Major, 340 F.2d 128, 132 (8th Cir. 1965). In the instant case at least one and presumably both of the parties were well aware before their marriage that Mrs. Silverman had agreed to return to Turkey. Under these circumstances, we see nothing unfair in permitting the government to carry out its policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Reversed and remanded with directions to the district court to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-12\">.
