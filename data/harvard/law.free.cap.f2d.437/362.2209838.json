Eaton, 416 F.2d 22 (9th Cir. 1969)], rejected Eaton\u2019s claim of inadequate trial representation due to his retained counsel\u2019s \u201cunexplained failure to subpoena a material witness\u201d and denied him \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">It concluded, in substance, that counsel\u2019s non-action was not due to inadvertence or neglect but instead was part of counsel\u2019s careful trial strategy and that Eaton was adequately represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">The record fully supports these factual conclusions. Counsel testified that, after discussions with Eaton, he interviewed Carter, the prospective witness, but was convinced that Carter\u2014 who was a government informer \u2014 would be \u201cthe worst possible witness to call on behalf of the defense.\u201d And, as the district judge noted, at the trial counsel \u201cevidenced a thorough knowledge and understanding of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-20\">Eaton also urges that he was not afforded an opportunity to participate in the decision not to call Carter and was consequently deprived of the Sixth' Amendment guarantee of compulsory process for the production of witnesses. The argument rests on the premise that this right may not be waived by counsel. The premise cannot be accepted, however, since it ignores both the purpose of the right and the implied authority of counsel to conduct the defense. Watkins v. Nelson, 430 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir. 1970); United States v. Meek, 388 F.2d 936 (7th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 951, 88 S.Ct. 1855, 20 L.Ed.2d 866. See Wilson v. Gray, 345 F.2d 282 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 919, 86 S.Ct. 288, 15 L.Ed.2d 234 (attorney empowered to waive an accused\u2019s confrontation right without prior consent).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-21\">Eaton\u2019s remaining points do not merit discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-15\">. (a) Denial of due process because he was not afforded a 2255 hearing before Carter became unavailable. See McDonald v. United States, 282 F.2d 737 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-23\">(b) Denial of due process because he did not receive legal assistance in preparing his 2255 motions. See Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 488, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1968); Dillon v. United States, 307 F.2d 445 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
