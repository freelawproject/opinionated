The Union filed unfair labor practice charges and the Board invalidated the election, ordering the Company to bargain with the Union. The Board, after reconsidering the case in light of NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), issued a supplemental order in which it again ordered the Company to bargain with the Union. This supplemental order was based upon the Board\u2019s finding that the Company\u2019s unfair labor practices had dissipated the Union\u2019s majority and rendered a fair or coercion-free rerun election unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">The unfair labor practices as found by the Board were in the nature of interference, restraint, and coercion. The unfair conduct consisted of the intimation of additional benefits if the Union were rejected by the employees, and, if the Union won the election, the loss by employees of present benefits, such as \u201cshop time,\u201d coffee breaks, double time on night shifts, free transportation to out-of-town jobs, and the substantial loss by the Company of the business of a then regular customer and the consequent curtailment of available work to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Upon the authority of Gissel Packing Co., <em>supra, </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition of the companion cases considered therein, we find substantial support for the Board\u2019s conclusion that the unfair labor practices rendered unlikely a fair rerun election. Consequently the order to bargain should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\">. The authorization cards were dear and unambiguous, each stating that the signer-authorized the Union to represent the employee for collective bargaining purposes. The Union made a demand that the Company bargain and offered to have the cards checked by a disinterested person. The Company simply refused to bargain and the Union then filed a petition for a representation election.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
