This sentence was reversed and a change of venue ordered. After a second trial, petitioner was again convicted, and the second life sentence was imposed. In 1969, petitioner was transferred to the Federal Penitentiary at Marion, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">In June 1969, petitioner was given a hearing by the Parole Board. In August 1969, the petitioner was denied a parole with a \u201cset-off\u201d date of May 1974 being designated as the next date for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">The District Court held that petitioner\u2019s parole eligibility date was correctly determined by the Board of Parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">There is no proof that Petitioner\u2019s eligibility date for parole was incorrectly determined by the Parole Board. It further appears that petitioner was never denied a hearing on the point, but rather that a hearing was held where it was determined that parole should be denied. There is no further proof that any delay in granting a hearing existed which might have prejudiced his chances for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">Petitioner cites his good prison record in urging that he should not have been denied parole in 1969, but his argument is mainly an indictment of the present Parole system. He claims that the members of the Board of Parole are not qualified to administer their jobs satisfactorily, largely because they must rely on reports of laymen guards who are prompted in their actions by personal feelings and emotional moods of the moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">In our view, the petitioner cannot prevail. It is well established that the determination of a parole eligibility date is wholly within the discretion of the Board of Parole. Walker v. J. C. Taylor, Warden, 338 F.2d 945, 946 (10 Cir., 1964); Brest v. Ciccone, 371 F.2d 981 (8 Cir., 1967); United States v. Fredrick, 405 F.2d 129 (3 Cir., 1968). This is not a case where a specific rule of the Parole Board can be seen as operating \u201cso capriciously\u201d or is so \u201cunreliably determined\u201d as to state a claim under the Civil Rights Statutes. United States ex rel. Campbell v. Pate, 401 F.2d 55 (7 Cir. 1968). Moreover, the Parole Statute (Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4201) does not recognize any of the arguments which have been advanced by petitioner as appropriate to challenge the qualifications of Parole Board members, so in that respect, petitioner\u2019s argument must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">The order of the District Court denying the petitioner's motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1201-15\">. The motion filed was designated as seeking \u201cDeclaratory Judgment, Incorporating Injunction Against Enforcement of Federal Statute.\u201d As such the action should be dismissed, federal post-conviction relief being the appropriate remedy. We shall, however, consider the motion as one seeking relief by habeas corpus. Gregory v. United States Board of Parole, 308 F.Supp. 258 (W.D.Missouri, 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
