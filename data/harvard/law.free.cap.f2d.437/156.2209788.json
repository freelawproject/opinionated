The reason why petitioner takes this seemingly anomalous position becomes apparent on a review of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">On October 22, 1965, petitioner entered a plea of guilty in federal district court to a charge of conspiring to forge money orders in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 500. Sentencing was deferred pending a pre-sentence report; in the meantime, petitioner was transferred to state custody for proceedings on a charge of breaking and entering in violation of Florida State law. On December 21, 1965, petitioner was convicted in Florida State Court and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. Petitioner filed a timely appeal from his state conviction. On January 21, 1966, petitioner was returned to federal court and sentenced to two years. This sentence was ordered to begin upon release from the ten year state sentence.\" While petitioner was in the custody of state authorities awaiting the outcome of his state appeal, he filed two motions in federal district court to have the judgment on his federal sentence stayed pending disposition of the state conviction on appeal. In these motions petitioner claimed that his plea of guilty had been entered involuntarily. On November 1, 1966, the federal district court denied petitioner\u2019s motions. Subsequently, petitioner\u2019s state convictions were reversed, Simmons v. State, 200 So.2d 619 (Fla.App.1967), and petitioner was released from state custody. In May 1969 petitioner was taken into federal custody under the two-year sentence imposed in January 1966. On November 21, 1969, petitioner filed the present section 2255 motion in the same federal district court in which he had filed his previous motions, alleging again that his plea of guilty had been involuntary. The trial court denied petitioner\u2019s motion on grounds that it was \u201ca second or successive motion for similar relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">Petitioner contends now that the federal district court which ruled on his original motions in 1966 did not have jurisdiction to hear those motions because at the time petitioner was not \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of section 2255. Therefore, petitioner argues, his second motion of November 21, 1969, could not have been a \u201csecond or successive motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">The requirement that a person be \u201cin custody\u201d before he may avail himself of the writ of habeas corpus was applied until recently to preclude a prisoner from attacking a sentence which he had not yet begun to serve. McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238 (1934). The rationale underlying this rule was that the only relief available on habeas corpus is immediate release or discharge from the custody complained of. McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. at 136-137, 55 S.Ct. at 25-27. Therefore, a prisoner serving consecutive sentences could not attack a sentence he was scheduled to serve until he was actually imprisoned under that sentence. In 1968, however, the Supreme Court overruled <em>McNally </em>and held that \u201ca prisoner serving consecutive sentences is \u201cin custody\u201d under any one of them for the purposes of section 2241(c) (3).\u201d Pey-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 67, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968) -<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The chief reason the Supreme Court gave for abandoning the prematurity doctrine of <em>McNally </em>was that \u201c[postponement of the adjudication of [the issues raised in motions for post-conviction relief] can harm both the prisoner and the State and lessens the probability that final disposition of the case will do substantial justice.\u201d 391 U.S. at 62, 88 S.Ct. at 1553. Moreover, the Court felt that \u201c[n]othing on the face of \u00a7 2241 militates against an interpretation which views [prisoners] as being \u2018in custody\u2019 under the aggregate of the consecutive sentences imposed on them.\u201d 391 U.S. at 64, 88 S.Ct. at 1555.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Peyton v. Rowe, of course, involved federal habeas corpus and not section 2255. Moreover, the opinion did not mention Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed.2d 407 (1959), a \u00a7 2255 proceeding which held that a prisoner incarcerated under one sentence cannot challenge a sentence which will not begin until completion of the sentence then being served since the prisoner is not then in custody under the sentence challenged. There seems to be no question, however, that the effect of Peyton v. Rowe was also to overrule <em>Heflin, </em>and to expand the scope of section 2255 along with section 2241 to keep \u00a7 2255 as broad as habeas corpus. <em>See </em>Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 211-222, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1071-1072, 22 L.Ed.2d 227 (1969); United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 217, 72 S.Ct. 263, 271, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952); United States v. Meyer, 8th Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 1020, 1022 n. 2. Clearly, the same considerations respecting the undesirability of postponing determination of the issues apply to section 2255 as apply to habeas coi\u2019pus. The only possible stumbling block in the way of extending Peyton v. Rowe to section 2255 is that the wording of section 2255 is more specific than section 2241, and actually states that the writ extends to federal prisoners \u201cin custody * * * claiming the right to be released.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>Rowe v. Peyton, 4th Cir., 383 F.2d 709, 719 n. 48. We do not believe, however, that the \u201cright to release\u201d clause need be construed as requiring that the prisoner immediately be \u201cset outside the prison\u2019s walls free of the restraint.\u201d Rowe v. Peyton, 383 F.2d at 719. Indeed, a reasonable construction of this clause would be that the prisoner need only be claiming the right to be released from having to serve the future sentence. This construction of section 2255 would certainly be in keeping with other cases in this Circuit which have held that under section 2255 relief other than the right to immediate release from confinement can be granted. <em>See </em>Rosa v. United States, 5th Cir. 1968, 397 F.2d 401; James v. United States, 5th Cir. 1968, 388 F.2d 453. We conclude, therefore, that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is \u201cin custody\u201d under any one of them for the purposes of section 2255. <em>See also </em>United States v. Meyer, 8th Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 1020, 1022 n. 2; Scibierras v. United States, 10th Cir. 1968, 404 F.2d 247; Crow v. United States, 10th Cir. 1968, 397 F.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">In the instant case, however, we are confronted with the further question whether the prisoner must be in the custody of federal and not state authorities when he is challenging his federal sentence. Again the rather specific wording of section 2255 presents a problem, for it provides that \u201ca prisoner <em>in custody under a sentence of a court established by Act of Congress </em>* * * may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. [emphasis added] Of course, the same principles that persuaded the Supreme Court to overrule <em>McNally, </em>and that persuade us here to extend Peyton v. Rowe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to section 2255 apply regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated. Thus there would be no reason to restrict section 2255 to prisoners actually in federal custody. Nor do we think that the above-quoted wording requires such a restrictive application. Both the First Circuit and the Eighth Circuit have already faced this identical problem and have held that the Supreme Court\u2019s liberal construction of \u201cin custody\u201d in Peyton v. Rowe would allow for courts as well as sentences to be joined to create a concept of continuing custody for the duration of a prisoner\u2019s incarceration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jackson v. United States, 8th Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 1146; Desmond v. United States Board of Parole, 1st Cir. 1968, 397 F.2d 386. <em>See also </em>United States ex rel. Meadows v. New York, 2 Cir., 426 F.2d 1176 [section 2241 extends to prisoner in federal custody challenging a state sentence]; George v. Nelson, 9th Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 1179 [Peyton v. Rowe applies even though two sentences were imposed by different sovereigns]; Word v. North Carolina, 4th Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We agree with the First and Eighth Circuits\u2019 construction of section 2255 and therefore join them in holding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is available to a prisoner in state custody attacking a federal sentence scheduled to be served in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Petitioner\u2019s last contentions are that even if the district court had jurisdiction of his original motions, his present motion could not have been a second or successive motion because (1) his previous motions were not section 2255 motions; and (2) his present motion raises altogether different allegations from hi\u00a7 previous motions. We have read carefully and compared petitioner\u2019s motions, and we reject both these contentions. Petitioner\u2019s previous 1966 motion was labeled \u201cmotion to vacate and set aside judgment and sentence, or motion to stay under conditions certain the judgment and sentence of the Court, [etc.]\u201d It is clear that petitioner was seeking relief in the nature of a section 2255 order to vacate his sentence and that the trial court treated it as such. Moreover, in petitioner\u2019s present section 2255 motion before the district court, he conceded that this was a second motion but claimed that the present motion raises completely new allegations. While petitioner\u2019s present motion does contain a more detailed factual presentation of his claim to relief, his basic contention is exactly the same as the claim in his 1966 motion \u2014 that claim being that he \u201centered a plea of guilty in [federal] court under the impression that he could post bail on the state conviction, and serve the federal sentence while his appeal was being processed in state court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He thus claimed that hi's guilty plea was involuntary. The district court has considered this contention not once, but twice. We will not require it to hear the claim a third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-5\">. Petitioner argues in his brief that Peyton v. Rowe should not control this case because that decision is not retroactive. It is clear that Peyton v. Rowe is to be retroactively applied. Wadley v. California, 9th Cir. 1969, 418 F.2d 296; Heryford v. Parker, 10th Cir. 1968, 396 F.2d 393, 397.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. See the language of the First Circuit in Desmond v. United States Board of Parole, 397 F.2d 386:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">In Peyton v. Rowe * * * the Court held that a defendant while serving the first of two consecutive sentences could attack the second. It does not seem to us a significant stretch to say that he may attack a federal sentence, yet to be served, while defendant is in custody completing a state sentence. The same principles which dictated Peyton v. Rowe seem to us to support jurisdiction here. To be sure, defendant is not physically \u201cin custody</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-13\">under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress\u201d, but if custody is to be construed as single and continuous, we may join the courts as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">397 F.2d at 389.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-15\">. This was the exact wording of petitioner\u2019s 1966 motion. The only difference between the 1966 motion and petitioner\u2019s present motion is that in the present motion petitioner alleges that a postal inspector told him that if he pled guilty to the federal charge, he would be able to serve his federal sentence before his state sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
