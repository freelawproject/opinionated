Indicted and tried for second-degree murder,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his sole defense at trial was that he acted in response to McKenzie\u2019s assaulting him with an eleven-inch butcher knife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant was convicted by a jury of second-degree murder and sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of twenty years in prison. On this appeal, he raises numerous points, only two of which require extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">The government\u2019s prosecutor devoted much of his rebuttal argument to sarcastic attacks upon defense counsel, as well as the defendant himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-14\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am very happy that my opponent doesn\u2019t do the thing that I do, and that is try to inflame you. I know that he is only concerned with the facts. I know he is only concerned with bringing out what the evidence has shown, and he has no desire to inflame you one way or the other, particularly in favor of his client. I think Mr.-has demonstrated tremendous objectivity on behalf of his client. For instance, when he tells you about how Robert has served in the Navy, and how he worked for the last 15 years consistently; and how, ladies and gentlemen, on last Friday when you all had a holiday, what did Robert do ? He worked that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-16\">Now that\u2019s all very, very objective on the part of Mr. _, and hasn\u2019t any importance as far as inflaming you in favor of his client. You know that. Because you know Mr. - would only relate to you facts from the witness stand that bore upon the crime. And you know how important it is for you to know that Robert\u2014 pardon me \u2014 the defendant, worked last Friday. Now that\u2019s very material to what happened on the date of this killing, isn\u2019t it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-21\">And Mr__stood before you and told you that he doesn\u2019t know why the prosecutor talked to you about being a judge and jury. It was to inflame you, but not Mr.__Mr. - wouldn\u2019t do anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-25\">* *X- * -X- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-26\">I\u2019m not going to say Mr. _ said that to inflame you in favor of his client. I wouldn\u2019t do that, because I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>know Mr__wouldn\u2019t think of such a thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">* * * * * -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJS\">And, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, when we talk about lying, and talk about perjury, Mr. _ has a way of saying to you, \u201cCounsel says to you\u201d, \u201cCounsel says this.\u201d I didn\u2019t say a thing. The witnesses said these things, not me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">-X- -X * * X -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">You reach your own decision, and leave out this \u201cinflamed\u201d argument that I use in this case; and only think of the objective argument of my opponent, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">* * * * -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">In other words, we are painting a picture here of a man who just voluntarily surrenders himself to the whims of the jury, and takes the stand in order to tell the truth? Baloney. He took the stand in order to set up a defense \u2014 and he has a right to. What interest has he in lying to you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-13\">-X- * -X- -X- -X- \u2022\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-14\">These are the, quote, \u201ctruths\u201d you are to believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">It should not be necessary to explain that the defendant, and not his attorney, is on trial in a criminal case. Nor</p>\n<p id=\"b748-28\">should it be necessary to explain that sarcasm and ridicule are not the stuff of good argument or good taste in judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the government\u2019s representative resorts to such behavior, we are the poorer for it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That the offensive remarks were made on rebuttal, rendering answer by defense counsel virtually impossible, makes them all the more regrettable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-29\">Prejudice in such matters is an imponderable difficult to discern upon a cold record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The effect of an argument upon the jury is best gauged by those who observe it. In this case, defense counsel was elsewhere alert to object to \u2014 and the trial court to correct \u2014the prosecutor\u2019s unwarranted</p>\n<p id=\"b748-30\">remarks.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As for the prosecutor\u2019s attack upon the \u201ctruths\u201d in appellant\u2019s testimony, we note that the trial took place before Gibson v. United States<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Harris v. United States <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> made clear our increasing concern with such remarks. Finally, we reiterate that both the prosecution and defense counsel should avoid inappropriate references to the accused.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the present record, we cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks were sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Appellant likewise claims error in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury on the critical issue of malice. In accordance with his announced policy of relying whenever possible upon standardized jury instructions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the judge defined malice for the jury<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in almost precisely the wording of the Junior Bar Section\u2019s Instruction 83,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> with a perceptive modification of the language of the last paragraph which the judge deemed wise in light of our decision in the <em>Austin </em>case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appellant attacks one of the defini-</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">tions of malice contained in that instruction, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\"><em>Malice may also be defined as a condition of mind that prompts a person to do a wrongful act willfully, that is, on purpose, to the injury of another, </em>or to do intentionally a wrongful act toward another without justification or excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">The argument is that the italicized portion of this definition erroneously informed the jury that an injurious, wrongful act is done with malice if done only \u201cwillfully, that is, on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-13\">In Green v. United States,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> upon which appellant relies, we condemned an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>instruction stating that a wrongful act intentionally done was \u201ctherefore\u201d done with malice. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">A wrongful act intentionally done is not therefore done with malice. Omitted from [such a] definition of malice is the element of wilfulness, which the court elsewhere included in its definition of malice, or that the intentionally done wrongful act was without justification or excuse.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">As <em>Green </em>makes plain, malice cannot be equated with conduct involving no more than an intentional act. \u201cMalice aforethought is an unjustifiable, inexcusable and unmitigated man-endangering state of mind;\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> intent to do an injurious act, even one highly dangerous to human life, is equivalent to malice only in the absence of justification, extenuation or excuse for that state of mind. Intent- may be, and often is, an ingredient of malice,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but never its exact counterpart. The necessary additional element is supplied only by an absence of circumstances justifying, mitigating or excusing \u201cthe man-endangering state of mind.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aeq-dedup-0\">We think, however, that appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Green </em>is misdirected. The instruction in the present case does not feature the vice that <em>Green </em>pointed out; certainly not in so many words, nor even inferentially without ignoring the final modifying phrase \u2014 \u201cwithout justification or excuse.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In this regard, Instruction 83, at the very worst, does no more than leave it ambiguous as to whether the final phrase modifies only the last clause of the sentence, or the first \u2014 and assertedly the offending\u2014 clause as well. And other language in Instruction 83, outside the sentence under scrutiny, connoted the \u201cman-endangering\u201d ingredient that a state of mind amounting to malice must possess.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">There is nothing, however, to suggest that the jury resolved this ambiguity by a misinterpretation of the governing law, and much to argue that it did not. The instructional flaws, if any, are subtle, a far cry from the flatly erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>statement in <em>Green. </em>For years, any difficulty has escaped lawyers and judges alike.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, a considerable part of the charge was devoted to an accurate statement of the contrasting elements of murder and manslaughter, which was perhaps the key element in the case. It is hard to believe that the jury could have been misled by imprecision in the solitary sentence under attack. Then, too, appellant\u2019s trial counsel was given ample opportunity to consider and object to the charge, and explicitly voiced his approval. This we believe, fortifies our conclusion that on the evidence in this case, the instruction had no erroneously adverse impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Nonetheless it must be said that Instruction 83, in distinguishing malice from mere purposefulness, is less than luminously clear. And, undeniably, clarity is extremely important in the definition of malice \u2014 \u201cthe sole element differentiating murder from manslaughter\u201d.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Admittedly, malice is a difficult concept to articulate; in recent times, we ourselves have struggled with the term,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and even now we seek to make it more meaningful to trial juries. We believe that we perform this mission best by pointing to one of our own decisions, rendered after the case at bar was tried, for the amelioration sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In United States v. Bush<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we modified Instruction 83 to eliminate still another ambiguity.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The revised version reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-14\">\u201cMalice\u201d does not necessarily imply ill-will, spite, hatred, or hostility by the defendant toward the person killed. \u201cMalice\u201d is a state of mind showing a heart regardless of the life and safety of others, a mind deliberately bent on mischief, a generally depraved, wicked and malicious spirit. \u201cMalice\u201d may also be defined as the condition of mind which prompts a person to do willfully, that is, on purpose, without adequate provocation, justification or excuse, a wrongful act whose foreseeable consequence is death or serious bodily injury to another.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">This definition should be used in instructions given after the <em>Bush </em>decision to avoid a claim of reversible error based either on the challenge appellant has presented, or on other difficulties in Instruction 83.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-28\">. 22 D.C.CODE \u00a7 2403 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aj_\">.

In closing argument, appellant\u2019s trial counsel, who is not his counsel on this appeal, referred to his client as \u201cRobert\u201d and the prosecutor took the same tack on rebuttal. We have cautioned against this technique, <em>see </em>Pendergrast v. United States, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 20, 30 n. 57, 416 F.2d 776, 786 n. 57, cert. denied, 395 U.S. 926, 89 S.Ct. 1782, 23 L.Ed.2d 243 (1969) , which, however, was decided after trial of the case at bar. <em>See also </em>Armstead v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 347 F.2d 806 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b749-5\">. The judge noted that such a practice has the beneficial effect of aiding review by this court, since standard instructions need not be combed in detail in each individual case. That is a consideration worth honoring so long as the instructions and the evidence maintain a concrete relationship, as certainly they did here. But as Mr. Justice Frankfurter once said in a similar context. \u201c[W]e are not here dealing with an abstract man who killed an abstract [person] under abstract circumstances and received an abstract trial on abstract issues.\u201d Fisher v. United States, 328 U.S. 463, 478, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 1326, 90 L.Ed. 1382 (1946) (dissenting opinion). In many cases, the jury\u2019s attention may be more clearly focused upon the critical issues for its decision by careful modification of the instructions in light of the particular facts of the case, than by a series of abstract principles unrelated to any factual situation, as could become the case with standardized instructions. Of course, the wording of instructions is in general a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we would not presume to lay down a general rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\">. The full instruction defining malice follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">To establish the second essential element of the offense, it is necessary that the defendant, at the time he so injured the decedent McKenzie, have acted with malice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">Now malice does not necessarily imply ill will, spite, hatred or hostility by the defendant toward the person killed. Malice is a state of mind showing a heart regardless of social duty, a mind deliberately bent on mischief, a generally depraved, wicked and malicious spirit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-14\">Malice may also be defined as a condition of mind that prompts a person to do a wrongful act willfully, that is, on purpose, to the injury of another, or to do intentionally a wrongful act toward another without justification or excuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-15\">Malice may be either express or implied. Express malice exists where one unlawfully kills another in pursuance of a wrongful act or unlawful purpose, without legal excuse. Implied malice is such as may be inferred from the circumstances of the killing, as, for example, where the killing is caused by the intentional use of fatal force without circumstances serving to mitigate or justify the act, or when an act which imports danger to another is done so recklessly or wantonly as to manifest depravity of mind and disregard of human life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-16\">In determining whether a wrongful act is done with malice, you may infer that a person ordinarily intends the natural and probable consequences of acts knowingly done or knowingly omitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-17\">If a person uses a deadly weapon in killing another person, you are permitted to draw the inference of malice from his use of such weapon, in the absence of explanatory or mitigating circumstances. You are not required to infer malice from the use of such weapon, but you may do so if you deem it appropriate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b749-18\">.

Murder, other than felony-murder, is homicide committed with malice; with premeditation and deliberation added, it is of the first degree. All other homicide, felony-murder again excluded, is manslaughter. Homicide is extenuated, and so reduced to manslaughter, when produced by an act \u2014 albeit intentional \u2014 in the heat of passion arising from adequate provocation. And, of course, an intentional act causing death is neither murder nor manslaughter if legally justified or excused. In each of the last two situations, malice is negated by the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b750-14\">. We realize, of course, that in the common law of homicide \u201cjustification\u201d and \u201cexcuse\u201d were terms of art not themselves embracing the concept of mitigation underlying the reduction of some types of homicide from murder to manslaughter. F. Wharton, Homicide \u00a7\u00a7 7-9 (3d ed. 1907). We cannot believe, however, that a jury of laymen would be aware of the technical common law distinctions; we think that more naturally the jury would give those terms the broader significance, particularly in the light of the trial judge\u2019s instructions differentiating manslaughter from murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b750-16\">. <em>See </em>note 12, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Sims v.

After reading from the transcript of the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">\u201cWhat disturbs me, and what disturbs you, no doubt, is that some people believe that you recompense no man evil for evil. Some people believe that you love those who mistreat you. And some people believe that hatred has no place in your heart. The famous recording of history may be summed up in a few words, \u2018Forgive them for they know not what they do.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Counsel suggested that the jurors should judge not, that they be not judged. He said that \u201cRobert\u201d was \u201ctelling the truth, no question about it\u201d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and asked \u201cWhat would he gain by lying?\u201d. In short, counsel delivered a wide-ranging, free-style jury argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">It was in response to these statements by the appellant\u2019s counsel that the prosecutor made the remarks which are criticized by the majority. Although one of us might not have answered as the prosecutor did, I think we should consider his remarks in context, and in the context of the argument that provoked them. When so considered they do not, in my judgment, merit the majority\u2019s criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">I suggest in addition that we should be reluctant to condemn an argument by the prosecutor which evoked no complaint from the defendant\u2019s experienced and able counsel, who heard it, and who apparently accepted it as fair comment on his own remarks.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">. See Canons of Professional Ethics Canon 15. \u201c * * * It is improper for a lawyer to assert in argument his personal belief in his client\u2019s innocence or in the justice of his cause. * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
