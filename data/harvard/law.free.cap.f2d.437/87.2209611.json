The district court dismissed Stirling\u2019s complaint because it failed to allege that the district court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Leave to file an amended complaint was denied, on the ground that Stirling could not \u201ccure retroactively service that was defective when made.\u201d We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Rule 8 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribes the rather simple requirements of a sufficient complaint. Besides a straightforward statement of the claim and a demand for judgment, the complaint need contain only \u201ca short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court\u2019s jurisdiction depends, * *' * \u201d Any doubt that the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in this context refers to subject matter rather than personal jurisdiction can be resolved by reference to Form 2 of the Rules, which speaks only of subject matter jurisdiction. See Rule 84. Cf. Chambers v. Blickle, 312 F.2d 251 (2d Cir. 1963).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Because the district court may also have dismissed the complaint on the mistaken belief that personal jurisdiction did not lie, we note that we are of the view that Homasote was \u201cdoing business\u201d in New York and that effective service of original process was made, thereby vesting the court with jurisdiction of the defendant. A Homasote salesman operating exclusively in the Western District of New York regularly solicited orders from the company\u2019s seven distributors in the area, and inspected \u201chundreds\u201d of construction sites where Homasote products were in use. Moreover, Homasote drivers made deliveries in the district twice weekly using trucks leased by the company and the total value of these deliveries in 1969 exceeded $750,000. It is clear that Homa-sote had subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the New York courts pursuant to \u00a7 301 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. CPLR \u00a7\u00a7 311, 313 authorize out-of-state service on an officer of such corporations. Here, Homasote\u2019s president was personally served at company headquarters in New Jersey. Under Federal Rules.4(d) (7), (f) the district court thereby acquired personal jurisdiction of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\">. The district court listed improper venue and defective service as additional grounds for dismissal, but these shortcomings rested upon the complaint\u2019s failure to allege personal jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. Because Rule 8(a) specifies the formal requirements of a complaint in a civil suit in the federal court, New York law is not binding. This would be true even in a case where federal jurisdiction was founded on diverse citizenship. See Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., 356 U.S. 525, 78 S.Ct. 893, 2 L.Ed.2d 953 (1958); Iovino v. Waterson, 274 F.2d 41 (2d Cir. 1959), cert. denied sub nom. Carlin v. Iovino, 362 U.S. 949, 80 S.Ct. 860, 4 L.Ed.2d 867 (1960). Cf. Lebensfeld v. Tuch, 43 Misc.2d 919, 252 N.Y.S.2d 594 (Sup.Ct.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
