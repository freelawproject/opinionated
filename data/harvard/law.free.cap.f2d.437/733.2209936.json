Count I of the indictment charged them with conspiring from May 24 to July 10, 1967, to transfer heroin and marijuana illegally in violation of Section 371 of the Criminal Code (18 U. S.C. \u00a7 371). They were also charged in Count II with transferring about 293 grams of marijuana on June 7, 1967, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4742(a}.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">Count IY charged that Fox and Vajner sold heroin to Narcotics Agent Charles Hill on June 13, 1967, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a). Count V charged that on the same date they transferred 222 grams of marijuana in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4742(a), and, finally, Count VI charged that they transferred about 106 grams of marijuana on July 10, 1967, in violation of the same provision. After a bench trial the three defendants were found guilty under Counts I and II, and Fox and Vajner were found guilty under Counts IV, V, and VI. Concurrent sentences were imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">At the bench trial, defendants successfully moved under the Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500) for the production of Agent Hill\u2019s May 24, 1967, report of his May 19th activities. In accordance with paragraph (c) of that Act, before delivering the report to defense counsel, the Assistant United States Attorney requested the court to examine it <em>in camera, </em>because \u201cthere may be some extraneous matters in this report that are not necessarily related to this particular case.\u201d After the <em>in camera </em>examination, the court stated that there was some extraneous matter in the report but ordered it delivered to defense counsel without deletions. The Government furnished the report to us after the oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-17\">Defendants assert that the damaging nature of the report prejudiced the trial court against them. In particular, defendants contend that the report, which was never admitted into evidence, must have convinced the district court that the Government had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendants were engaged in illicit activities prior to Hill\u2019s May 19, 1967, visit to the Club Del Rio in East Chicago, Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-18\">Defendants recognize that in a bench trial, the court is deemed to have considered only admissible and relevant material (United States v. Krol, 374 F.2d 776, 779 (7th Cir. 1967)), at least absent a showing of substantive prejudice. United States v. Oliver, 363 F.2d 15, 19 (7th Cir. 1966), certiorari denied, 385 U.S. 904, 87 S.Ct. 216, 17 L.Ed.2d 135. In an attempt to show such prejudice, defendants have seized upon the following statement of the district court;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-19\">\u201cI frankly have seen no evidence of entrapment here so far. The Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ment had information from a source which they were cheeking out that marijuana and narcotics were available at this particular establishment [Club Del Rio]. They went there to investigate and were readily informed that it was available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Defendants assert that this passage shows that the trial judge used the May 24, 1967, report of Agent Hill in deciding that the Government had reasonable grounds to believe they were engaged in illicit activities prior to the intervention of the government agents. However, our study of the evidence shows that the trial judge had ample independent evidence before him to support the foregoing statement. Agent Hill testified that prior to going to the Club Del Rio on May 19, 1967, he and Agent Cruz had conferred with \u201cBabe,\u201d the informer, in Gary, Indiana, before proceeding to the Club Del Rio. The informer told them that he had met defendant Vajner previously, evidently at the Club Del Rio. Hill stated that government agents would not have attempted to purchase narcotics from the defendants without having \u201cinformation that a person is engaged in the illicit trafficking of drugs and marijuana.\u201d Hill obtained his \u201cfirst knowledge\u201d of the Club Del Rio through the informer before accompanying him there twice on May 19. Beforehand, the informer had told Hill that the informer \u201chad met a person named Joe [defendant Vajner] who was a bartender at the Club Del Rio, and Joe had stated he could get him [the informer] heroin and marijuana.\u201d Defendant Vajner testified that Babe, the informer, had been in his Club several times before May 19. On May 18, Vajner stated that he told the informer he \u201cwould try to find somebody\u201d from whom Babe could obtain marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">In view of this testimony, it cannot be said that the district court relied on extraneous matters in concluding that the government agents had reasonable grounds to believe that marijuana and narcotics were available at the Club Del Rio. Moreover, Agent Hill\u2019s May 24th report contains no information about the Club Del Rio that was not contained in his or Vajner\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, we reject defendants\u2019 contention that the trial judge considered inadmissible evidence, causing defendants substantial prejudice, before he concluded that the Government had reasonable grounds to suspect illegal conduct at the Club Del Rio.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Defendants next assert that they were entitled to acquittal on the ground of entrapment at the close of the Government\u2019s case and on the evidence as a whole. As shown above, prior to the May 19th visit to the Club Del Rio, the Government had reasonable grounds to believe that narcotics were available there through Vajner. Therefore it was permissible for Agent Hill to give Vajner the opportunity to commit a crime. Heath v. United States, 169 F.2d 1007, 1010 (10th Cir. 1948); United States v. De Vore, 423 F.2d 1069, 1071 (4th Cir. 1970). Vajner\u2019s predisposition was already known, and it was he, not Hill, who involved Fox and Gill. In the circumstances of this case, the district court correctly overruled the defense of entrapment as to all three appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">On cross-examination of Agent Hill, Gill\u2019s counsel asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-10\">\u201cAs a matter of fact, any plan of conspiracy or agreement which did in fact come about, or so-called conspiracy I should say, wouldn\u2019t you say it occurred directly as the result of your motivating, influencing force, your presence on that day [June 7th] ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Because of the form in which the question was stated, the trial judge sustained an objection and defense counsel never attempted to rephrase the question. This evidentiary ruling of the trial judge was well within his discretion to exclude a witness\u2019 \u201csubjective feelings and conclusions.\u201d Boomer v. New York Central Railroad Company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>409 F.2d 382 (7th Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The question called for a speculative conclusion which the witness was not competent to make. Hill\u2019s answer to the above question could not be \u201crationally based on the perception of the witness,\u201d so that his opinion would not be admissible even under liberal standards. See McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 11 (1954); Rule 7-01, Preliminary Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States District Courts and Magistrates (March 1969). Certainly Hill could not know whether the conspiracy \u201coccurred directly as the result of\u201d his \u201cmotivating, influencing force\u201d and \u201cpresence\u201d. Only the three defendants would know that. They took the stand and gave their version of the June 7th events, so that they were not truly prejudiced by the refusal to permit Hill to answer. He had already testified that other than on June 7th, he had no knowledge of any conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Finally, defendants argue that, at least as to Gill, no conspiracy was established. In his closing argument below, however, Gill\u2019s counsel conceded \u201cthere was participation by these three gentlemen [Gill, Fox and Vajner].\u201d The Government proved that on June 7th Gill transferred a package of 2.336 grams of marijuana to Hill and later that day accepted $100 from Hill for a package of about 293 grams of marijuana. These two overt conspiratorial acts were pursuant to Vajner\u2019s insistence that Hill purchase the narcotics through Gill. Moreover, Hill testified that Gill told Hill that he\u2019d have to give the marijuana money to Gill. There is abundant testimony that Vajner agreed to obtain narcotics for Hill through Fox and that on June 7th Fox and Vajner dealt with Hill through Gill. It was unnecessary for the Government to prove that all three defendants handled the drugs, nor was direct evidence of the conspiracy required. Laeaze v. United States, 391 F.2d 516, 519 (5th Cir. 1968). Here each defendant\u2019s participation was sufficiently shown to support the court\u2019s inference of a conspiracy among all.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-13\">. Because of United States v. Covington, 395 U.S. 57, 89 S.Ct. 1559, 23 L.Ed.2d 94, on July 17, 1969, we reversed the convictions of the three defendants on Count III and those of Pox and Vajner on Count VII, and the indictments were dismissed <em>pro tanto.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-5\">. Even in United States v. Petrone, 185 F.2d 334, 336 (2d Cir. 1950) (per curiam), on which defendants principally rely, the exclusion of impressions was treated as \u201cone of discretion * * * as wise admonitions for the general conduct of the trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
