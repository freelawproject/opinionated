The notice advised that he might obtain review of the order, pursuant to \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), by filing a civil action against the Secretary in the district court, within 60 days from the date of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">Appellant commenced his action on September 19, 1968, two days late. The district court dismissed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">The exclusive method for obtaining judicial review of a final decision of the Secretary is set forth in Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Under that Section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-14\">(g) Any individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action <em>commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Secretary may allow. * </em>* * [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMN\">The district court was clearly correct in dismissing the action. A petition to review a decision of the Secretary must be brought within the statutory time limit. Jamieson v. Folsom (7 Cir. 1963) 311 F.2d 506, appeal dismissed and certi-orari denied, 374 U.S. 487, 83 S.Ct. 1868, 10 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1963); Bomer v. Ribi-coff (6 Cir. 1962) 304 F.2d 427; See, Johnson v. Flemming (10 Cir. 1959) 264 F.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
