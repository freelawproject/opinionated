He argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">The government\u2019s case was based solely on the testimony of the victim, Squires. Comes Last presented no witnesses on his behalf. It is argued that Squires\u2019 testimony is insufficient to establish a taking by Comes Last of Squires\u2019 boots and the forty dollars that he had stashed there. Squires testified that he was assaulted by Comes Last and one Dale King, both of whom he knew. Squires was hit on the jaw, knocked down and kicked. He was lying face down in the snow when his boots were removed. He did not see who removed the boots. On cross-examination the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">\u201cQ. Do you know who was taking off your boots then, if your face was down ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">A. No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-16\">Q. In fact, it could have been Dale rather than Percy, could it not? You couldn\u2019t see them could you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-19\">A. He has four hands I guess. They started taking both my boots off at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-20\">Q. You were aware both of your boots were coming at the same time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-21\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-22\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s implied finding that Comes Last directly participated in the-taking of the boots and the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
