We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">Although the appellant has no appeal or motion for collateral relief pending in any court, he asserts that as an indigent he is entitled to his own copy of his record in order to prepare a petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">We do not agree with this contention. To the contrary, we have consistently held that a federal prisoner has no absolute right to copies of court records to search for possible defects, merely because of his status as an indigent. Skinner v. United States, 5th Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 1036 [1970]; Walker v. United States, 5th Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 278; Harless v. United States, 5th Cir. 1964, 329 F.2d 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">In the recent case of Wade v. Wilson, 1970, 396 U.S. 282, 90 S.Ct. 501, 24 L.Ed.2d 470, cited by appellant, the Supreme Court indicated that under \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d where state laws and procedure entitled the indigent to have access to his transcript, as on direct appeal, he can not thereafter be denied the right to borrow an existing transcript for the purpose of framing a petition collaterally attacking his conviction. No such \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d are alleged in the instant case, nor does the appellant allege that he is being unlawfully deprived of borrowed copies of the records and files in his case. We therefore perceive no compelling reason militating in favor of a departure from this court\u2019s previous decisions, supra. See Lucas v. United States, 6th Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s Local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
