BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">This is another incidence of Admiralty\u2019s eternal triangle \u2014 longshoreman, shipowner, stevedore \u2014 in which injured longshoreman \u2014 as a Sieraeki-Ryan-Yaka pseudo seaman \u2014 sues shipowner for damages suffered by reason of unseaworthiness, followed by shipowner\u2019s claim against stevedore for indemnification on the ground that stevedore breached its WWLP.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">The immediate issue is whether the District Court erred in failing to award Shipowner indemnity over against Stevedore, in the amount that Shipowner paid in damages to Longshoreman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The answer turns primarily upon whether it was clearly erroneous for the trial Judge to have found that Stevedore did not breach the WWLP because the defect in the equipment, which was the cause of Longshoreman\u2019s injury, was a <em>latent </em>defect not reasonably detectable. Tied into this are related questions of the Stevedore\u2019s duty of inspection and immediate responsibility for compliance with federally mandated safety regulations. We hold that the crucial fact findings were not clearly erroneous under F.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and we affirm the judgment of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-24\">I. Background \u2014 A Thirteenth Rung</p>\n<p id=\"b652-25\">In this typical third-party, indemnity case, Longshoreman (Horace Delaneu-ville, Jr.) sued Shipowner for damages caused by Shipowner\u2019s unseaworthy vessel. Shipowner then sued Stevedore (Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation) for indemnity because of breach of Stevedore\u2019s WWLP. The case was tried to the District Court sitting in Admiralty without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-26\">At the close of the case the Judge concluded (a) that with regard to Longshoreman and Shipowner, (i) Longshoreman\u2019s injuries were caused by the unseaworthiness of the ship, and (ii) accordingly Longshoreman was entitled to recover damages from Shipowner. The Court determined (b) with regard to Stevedore and Shipowner, (i) the defect in the equipment rendering the ship un-seaworthy was a <em>latent </em>defect and consequently (ii) Stevedore did not breach its WWLP, thus (iii) affording Shipowner no legal ground upon which to demand indemnity. Shipowner appeals only from that part of the judgment that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>nies him indemnification from Stevedore.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">A. Into The Hold</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">On August 3, 1968 Stevedore was in charge of removing a cargo of bauxite from the No. 5 hold of M/S Vigan. In order to properly accomplish this task it was necessary to operate a bulldozer inside the hold of the vessel. This was Longshoreman\u2019s job, and he was proceeding to it at the time that he sustained his injury. The No. 5 hold has a steel strengthener built into it which begins approximately 35 to 45 feet below the weather deck, or approximately 12 to 20 feet above the tank top. This strengthener is about twelve and one-half feet in length, and runs at an angle along the side of the ship. To enable one to gain ingress into the No. 5 hold there is a permanent, steel ladder that runs from the main deck down to the strengthener, and from the strengthener there is a removable aluminum ladder that spans the remaining twelve feet or so to the floor of the hold. When in use the removable ladder is held in place by hooks permanently fastened to the top end of each side of the ladder which fit over a steel bracket welded to the strengthener. The bar, described as \u201cone continuous piece of metal\u201d, about eighteen inches wide, is welded to the strengthener in \u201ctwo places\u201d. The legs of the bar extend out about five and one-half inches. This leaves enough space between it and the wall of the ship for the hooks of the ladder to fit over the bar without difficulty. In effect the metal bar is similar to an additional rung of the permanent ladder, being located approximately twelve inches below the end of it. The two steel hooks are welded to the top end of each side of the ladder. These hooks are designed to hang over the bar in order to secure the removable ladder to the ship.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The accident did not occur on Longshoreman\u2019s first descent into the hold that day. Sometime prior to the accident Longshoreman descended into the hold, worked down there, and then ascended to the main deck. All of this transpired without incident of any kind. However \u2014 as the Court impliedly held on evidence which warranted credit \u2014 on Longshoreman\u2019s second descent into the hold the hooks holding the temporary ladder slid sideways along the bar, dislodged completely from it, and then ladder and Longshoreman both toppled to the floor of the hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">B. From the Depths</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">Although badly shaken, Longshoreman was nevertheless able to pick up the aluminum ladder and place it against the bulkhead at a point immediately below the end of the permanent ladder. He then \u201ccarefully climbed up the ladder\u201d and emerged from the depths (of the hold) onto the main deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">On his climb back up the ladder he had noticed that the \u201cbracket was broken\u201d, that \u201cthe right hand side going up was broken\u201d. Longshoreman, in testifying about his observation, stated: \u201cThe bar was broken across, and it was flat in, the peice from the wall to where the bar was bent down flat, and the bar was also bent in a little * * * the bar itself was bent in * * * [a] slight bend in the bar itself, a light curve in the bar * * * [which] curved in, towards the wall.\u201d Longshoreman testified further that the bar did not contain an <em>actual </em>break, but that the break was in \u201cthe bar that was coming from the wall * * * [that part] was broken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and bent, mashed in, bent in.\u201d Although the testimony was confusing because Longshoreman attempted to describe what had taken place, the trial Court was entitled to conclude impliedly that with the \u201cleg\u201d part loosened from the bulkhead or the main hangar portion of the bracket, there was nothing to keep the ladder hooks from slipping off the bracket.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">II. What Duty? What Breach of WWLP?</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">As it turns out, on the facts previously summarized, the Judge\u2019s conclusions practically eliminate any controversy over, or the existence of, any significant legal principles. He declared quite positively that (i) the ladder fell to the deck, (ii) the bracket device broke, and (iii) the defect was latent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\">This puts a heavy burden on Shipowner since the question of whether a stevedore has breached its WWLP is a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact. Southern Stevedoring and Contracting Company v. Hellenic Lines Limited, 5 Cir., 1968, 388 F.2d 267, 1968 A.M.C. 573; D/S Ove Skou v. Hebert, 5 Cir., 1966, 365 F.2d 341, 1966 A.M.C. 2223, cert. denied, Southern Stevedoring 6 Contracting Co. v. D/S Ove Skou, 400 U.S. 902, 91 S.Ct. 139, 27 L.Ed.2d 139. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The decision of the trier of fact cannot be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> F.R.Civ.P. 52(a); Mc-Allister v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20, 1954 A.M.C. 1999; Cia Maritima Del Nervion v. James J. Flanagan Shipping Corporation, 5 Cir., 1962, 308 F.2d 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">It is the shipowner\u2019s obligation to furnish a seaworthy vessel, not the stevedore\u2019s initial duty to determine whether the shipowner has complied with the demands made by the law. Accordingly the stevedore does not have to conduct the sort of detailed inspection as would a shipowner and, conversely, the duty of inspection is to follow up adequately on deficiencies which are either obvious or revealed by a cursory examination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial Judge was entitled to credit testimony implying that neither condition existed. This would include Longshoreman\u2019s testimony that on each of the three times he passed directly in front of the bar upon which the hooks of the temporary ladder were attached, at a distance of approximately 16 inches, he noticed nothing unusual. Added to this was the negative testimony from Stevedore\u2019s foreman and from the ship\u2019s Chief Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The finding that the bracket device broke makes Shipowner\u2019s position both formidable and awkward. To succeed at this juncture he must virtually show that the Judge was compelled to find that a cursory observation by Stevedore<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would have revealed the break in the bracket or, if not yet complete, the obvious warning signs of an imminent fracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\"> Thus the case is but a repetition of our earlier declaration that \u201cWhere there has been no notice of a damaged or faulty ladder, the courts have not implied a hypothetical duty to inspect, and the stevedore has not been required to indemnify the shipowner.\u201d Cia Maritima Del Nervion v. James J. Flanagan Shipping Corp., <em>supra, </em>at 120, 124. See also T. Smith &amp; Son, Inc. v. Skibs A/S Hassel, 5 Cir., 1966, 362 F.2d 745, 1966 A.M.C. 1700; Vaccaro v. Alcoa Steamship Company, 2 Cir., 1968, 405 F.2d 1133. It is true that once a stevedore is placed on notice that a defective condition exists' aboard ship, it must take immediate, affirmative action to correct it, and to make the ship safe for its intended use. Santomarco v. United States, 2 Cir., 1960, 277 F.2d 255, 1960 A.M.C. 1089; Smith v. Jugosalvenska Linijska Plovidea, 4 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 176, 1960 A.M.C. 841. But this is not met for want of (i) notice or constructive notice<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (ii) an opportunity for correction. For whatever may be the status of \u201cinstantaneous un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>seaworthiness\u201d <em>vis-a-vis </em>Shipowner and Sieracki seaman<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in order for the stevedore to be held liable for indemnity for an accident that occurs subsequent to its discovery of the defective equipment, the stevedore must have sufficient time between the discovery and the accident to correct the defect. See Orlando v. Prudential Steamship Corp., 2 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 822. Nor are the cases<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> so heavily pressed by Shipowner contrary to our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Shipowner\u2019s contention that indemnity is compelled because of Stevedore\u2019s violation of \u00a7 1504.25(f) of the Health and Safety Regulations <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> likewise stands on these decisive findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We have given the fullest sweep to these regulations as mandating a standard of safety to be met by a stevedore. Manning v. M/V \u201cSea Road\u201d, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 603; Grigsby v. Coastal Marine Service of Texas, Inc., 5 Cir., 1969, 412 F.2d 1011, 1969 A.M.C. 1513; Marshall v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., 5 Cir., 1964, 334 F.2d 131, 1964 A.M.C. 1686. But they are to be fairly construed and applied in the light of each record. The provision in C.F.R. to which Shipowner refers provides that portable ladders \u201cbe <em>of </em>adequate strength and lashed, blocked, <em>or otherwise secured </em>against shifting or slipping.\u201d (Emphasis ours). Here, on the findings, the accident occurred, not because the hooking device was inherently defective or inadequate, but rather because it broke allowing the well-hooked ladder to slip off the bracket. There was no proof offered \u2014 and certainly none from Shipowner \u2014 that had the bracket not been defective the hooks would have been inadequate. Granting that Stevedore \u2014 in addition to Shipowner \u2014 had an affirmative duty to see that the portable ladder was \u201clashed, blocked, or otherwise secured\u201d the Court was entitled to conclude that had the bracket not been defective, the ladder was \u201cotherwise secured\u201d by the bracket device and ladder hooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">Indemnity was denied, not because the conduct of Shipowner precluded enforcement, but rather because Stevedore did not breach its WWLP. This result is faithful to Weyerhaeuser Steamship Co. v. Nacirema Operating Co., 1958, 355 U.S. 563, 78 S.Ct. 438, 2 L.Ed.2d 491, 1958 A.M.C. 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-15\">.

While there is cargo in the hold this removable ladder is \u201cusually kept in the forecastle.\u201d Once the hold has been nearly, or completely discharged, and Stevedore is ready to have the temporary ladder put in place, it alerts one of the mates of M/S Vigan who, in turn, instructs the crew to lower the ladder into the hold. The ladder is lowered and one of the crew climbs down the permanent ladder and places the iron hooks over the bar. It is impossible to attach the temporary ladder to the metal bar by merely lowering the ladder onto the bar from the weatherdeck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">. On examination by counsel for third party Defendant-Appellee Longshoreman gave a full description of the appearance of the longitudinal bar, and of the ladder-hook-fittings as they appeared <em>after </em>the accident had occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">* * # s\u00a1; *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\u201cQ I see.

When I got down there to where the hooks were on the temporary ladder, I had my hands on the first rung of the ladder that was right below the hooks, that is when the ladder started to shift and fall over. With the weight of my body I tried to push the ladder back, and I couldn\u2019t do it. I tried again and I still couldn\u2019t do it.

The Judge, by bench pronouncements made directly into the record, which pronouncements are as much a judicial declaration as those made subsequently in the quiet of his chambers, made precise conclusions: \u201c[i] The preponderance of the evidence certainly shows \u2014 if we go on the preponderance which the law requires me to do \u2014 certainly shows that the ladder fell to the deck; * * * [ii] that the evidence further shows that the bar that has been referred to which was attached or welded to the outer extremity of the strengthener, was * * * broken * * *.

So whatever defect there was \u2014 and there had to be a defect for the ladder to fall \u2014whatever defect there was was a latent defect which I don\u2019t think this evidence shows could reasonably have been found by Kaiser anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alm\">Subsequently the Judge, in ruling on post trial motions, made a Minute Entry in which he adopted this transcript as the Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">.
