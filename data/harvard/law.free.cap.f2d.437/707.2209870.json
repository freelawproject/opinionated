Tashof is engaged in the retail trade as New York Jewelry Co. (NYJC). His store is located in an area that serves low-income consumers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> many of whom hold low-paying jobs, and have no bank or charge accounts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> About 85 percent of NYJC\u2019s sales are made on credit. The Commission found, after a Hearing Examiner had dismissed the charges as unsubstantiated, that NYJC falsely advertised the availability of discount eyeglasses, and misrepresented its prices and credit practices. NYJC claims that the evidence is insufficient to support the Commission\u2019s findings, and that in any event the findings do not justify the order entered against it. We affirm the findings, and enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">\n<em>I. The Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">The Commission\u2019s findings fall into four categories: (A) those with respect to false advertising of eyeglasses; (B) those with respect to false advertising of discount prices; (C) those with respect to misrepresenting credit charges; and (D) those with respect to misrepresenting \u201ceasy credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-19\"><em>A. False Advertising of Eyeglasses: </em>The Commission first found that NYJC employed a \u201cbait and switch\u201d maneuver with respect to sales of eyeglasses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence showed that NYJC advertised eyeglasses \u201cfrom $7.50 complete,\u201d including \u201clenses, frames and ease.\u201d The newspaper advertisements, but not the radio advertisements, mentioned a \u201cmoderate examining fee.\u201d During this period, NYJC offered free eye examinations by a sign posted in its store, and through cards it mailed out and distributed on the street.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> NYJC claimed that it offered $7.50 eyeglasses only to persons with their own prescriptions. But we have no doubt that the record amply supports the Commission\u2019s finding that the advertising campaign taken as a whole offered complete eyeglass service for $7.-50.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-20\">That much shows \u201cbait.\u201d There was no direct evidence of \u201cswitch\u201d \u2014 no direct evidence, that is, that NYJC disparaged or discouraged the purchase of the $7.50 eyeglasses, or that the glasses were unavailable on demand, or unsuited for their purpose. The evidence on which the Commission rested its finding was a stipulation that out of 1,400 pairs of eyeglasses sold each year by NYJC, less than 10 were sold for $7.50 with or without a prescription.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> NYJC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>claims that this evidence does not support the finding. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">It seems plain to us that the Commission drew a permissible inference of \u201cswitch\u201d from the evidence of bait advertising and minimal sales of the advertised product.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At best only nine sales \u2014 64/100 of one percent of NYJC\u2019s eyeglass sales \u2014 were made at $7.50. The record leaves unexplained why NYJC\u2019s customers, presumably anxious to purchase at as low a price as possible, would so consistently have bought more expensive glasses if suitable glasses at $7.50 were available.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>Further, NYJC continued to advertise the $7.50 glasses for a year and a half despite the scarcity of sales, a fact which tends to support a finding of a purpose to bring customers into the store for other reasons.\u00ae This evidence, we think, was sufficient to shift the burden of coming forward to the respondent. But NYJC offered no evidence to negate the inference of \u201cswitch.\u201d The relevant facts are in NYJC's possession, and it was in the best position to show, if it could be shown at all that the $7.50 glasses were actually available in the store.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Yet the most NYJC could produce was its sales manager's denial that the $7.50 glasses were disparaged. NYJC never did point to even a single sale of the advertised product.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-19\"><em>B. False Advertising of Discount Prices: </em>There is no dispute that NYJC claimed to be a discount seller of eyeglasses. Nor is there any question that the sales slips introduced by the FTC were sufficient to show NYJC\u2019s actual prices. NYJC\u2019s claim is that the Commission erred in relying on expert testimony of prevailing prices, and in computing the prices against which NYJC\u2019s were compared.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-20\">The Commission\u2019s staff presented the only evidence of prevailing prices: the testimony of Dr. Zachary Ephraim, an optometrist.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since optometrists are a major retail outlet for eyeglasses, and perform a service closely comparable to that provided by NYJC\u2014 examining eyes and filling prescriptions \u2014Dr. Ephraim was well qualified to testify about prevailing prices. We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>that his uncontradicted testimony was a sufficient basis for the Commission\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The Commission determined the generally prevailing prices of eyeglasses on the basis of Dr. Ephraim\u2019s testimony of the usual price charged by most optometrists in the trade area.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> NYJC first claims that the Commission erroneously ignored the expert\u2019s statements that some sellers might charge higher prices. We disagree, because Dr. Ephraim referred only to some extremely high prices that a relatively few sellers might charge. Thus the record as a whole supports the Commission\u2019s finding of generally prevailing eyeglass prices, <em>i: e., </em>the prices to which NYJC\u2019s must be compared in considering the charge that its representations of discount prices were false.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> NYJC\u2019s second claim concerns the Commission\u2019s refusal to include in the prevailing price the amount which the consumer would have had to pay for an eye examination. Since NYJC offered \u201cfree\u201d eye examinations, it could be argued that no adjustment for examinations was required. But the Commission did make allowance for NYJC\u2019s actual cost of the examination. We cannot say that this treatment was unreasonable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is worth noting that even if the prevailing prices were computed as NYJC has urged, NYJC\u2019s customers still paid a higher than prevailing price more often than not.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\"><em>C. Failure to Disclose Credit Charges: </em>Nearly all the evidence regarding NYJC\u2019s failure to inform its customers fully and adequately of all credit charges was documentary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It showed that NYJC used three different contract forms during the time in question. All three were materially deficient in one respect or another. The first form failed to disclose the annual percentage charge on the unpaid balance, the dollar amount of the credit charge, and the cash price of the item. The second form failed to show either a monthly or annual percentage interest rate. The third form failed to reveal the total obligation, the finance charge in dollars, and the annual percentage interest rate. Moreover, there was substantial evidence that NYJC often failed even to provide all the information contemplated by the contract form. Also, the evidence revealed unexplained discrepancies among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>NYJC\u2019s contract forms, its own internal records, and the \u201ccustomer cards\u201d it handed to credit clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">We think the record amply supports the Commission\u2019s finding that NYJC\u2019s credit practices were deceptive. The offer of credit without disclosure of the charges therefor in an understandable fashion is, of course, likely to prevent the customer from learning about the cost of credit. This is particularly true for NYJC\u2019s customers, many of whom both lack the sophistication to make the complex calculation of credit costs for themselves, and must depend to a large extent on credit for their purchases.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\"><em>D. False Representation of \u201cEasy </em>CreditNYJC\u2019s advertising was permeated with references to \u201ceasy credit.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The complaint charged that the credit was not easy for two reasons: first because NYJC sought \u201coften with success, to obtain garnishments against [customer\u2019s] wages,\u201d after having extended credit \u201cwithout determining [the customer\u2019s] credit rating or financial ability to meet payments<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and second because NYJC sold goods \u201cat unconscionably high prices that greatly exceeded the prices charged for like or similar merchandise by other retail establishments.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We hold that the record supports the Commission\u2019s finding that NYJC\u2019s representations of easy credit were misleading because of its rigorous collection policy. Consequently, there is no need to decide whether the Commission\u2019s finding that the representations were misleading because of the store\u2019s \u201cgreatly excessive prices\u201d is adequately supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\"><em>1. Rigorous Collection Policy </em>\u2014 The Commission found that NYJC\u2019s collection policies were rigorous indeed, and therefore its representation of easy credit was misleading. The record supports this finding.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-16\">We have no doubt that the Commission was within its discretion in interpreting \u201ceasy credit\u201d to refer not only to easy availability but also to easy terms and leniency with respect to repayment and collection.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Commission noted the oppressive effect of wage garnishments on persons who, like many of NYJC\u2019s customers, have low paying jobs, and found that NYJC regularly garnished its customers\u2019 wages.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In one year, for example, it sued some 1600 customers \u2014 about one out of every three. Firms with many more customers than NYJC used the garnishment process much less often.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> NYJC, which possessed all the relevant facts, offered nothing to negate the Commission\u2019s finding that it pursued a rigorous collection program, and, indeed, in this court did not challenge the Commission\u2019s opinion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-17\">NYJC does claim, however, that the complaint did not fairly apprise it of the charge that its easy credit representations might be found misleading on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the basis of its collection policy.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Although the complaint is hardly a model of clarity, we think that a fair reading provides sufficient notice.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It is clear that the main charge is misrepresentation by use of the term \u201ceasy credit,\u201d not, as NYJC has urged throughout the course of proceedings, unconscionably high prices per se. High prices were but one of the two independent grounds said to make the representation deceptive. The other was NYJC\u2019s collection policies. Moreover, NYJC has claimed no prejudice from the alleged vagueness of the complaint.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It has pointed to no evidence it might have introduced if it had been given clearer notice of the charge. And by the time of the hearing it must have known that its collection policies were under attack, for it agreed to a stipulation about the number of garnishments it, and other stores, filed each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><em>2. Greatly Excessive Prices </em>\u2014 The other ground for the Commission\u2019s ultimate conclusion that NYJC\u2019s representations of \u201ceasy credit\u201d were misleading was its finding that NYJC charged \u201cgreatly excessive prices.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We need not decide whether this finding is adequately supported, however, for, even if it is not, we have no \u201csubstantial doubt [that] the administrative agency would have made the same ultimate finding [i. <em>e., </em>that NYJC\u2019s representations of \u201ceasy credit\u201d were misleading] with the erroneous findings or inferences out of the picture.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In this case it is clear from the structure of the Commission\u2019s opinion <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and the reasons it gave in support of its order <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> that NYJC\u2019s representations of \u201ceasy credit\u201d were considered misleading on two separate grounds, to wit, the store\u2019s rigorous collection practices and its greatly excessive prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\n<em>II. The Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">NYJC attacks only two parts of the Commission\u2019s order \u2014 one paragraph which orders it to disclose certain credit information, and one paragraph which forbids it to advertise discount prices without having taken a survey of comparative prices.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>A. Disclosure of Credit </em>Terms: To combat NYJC\u2019s failure to reveal its credit terms (see part I (C) ), the Commission ordered it to disclose, both orally and in writing, a variety of factors relating to credit charges in its installment contracts.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> NYJC argues that the enactment of the new Truth in Lending Act<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> shows that the Commission had theretofore lacked the power to order affirmative disclosures of credit information.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The argument is without merit. The Act establishes minimum standards of disclosure which the Commission may enforce without proving unfairness and deception on a ease by case basis. It was not intended to cure a previous deficiency in Commission power to deal with individual cases, and to shape its remedies to the facts of these cases.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">Equally unpersuasive is NYJC\u2019s contention that the Truth in Lending Act sets the bounds of an affirmative disclosure order. NYJC has pointed to nothing in the terms of the Act or its legislative history which supports this view. The sole question for us is whether the remedy chosen by the Commission bears a reasonable relationship to the violations uncovered.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Viewed in this light, NYJC\u2019s attacks on the disclosure order are unavailing. The Commission\u2019s demand that NYJC disclose credit terms in all transactions, for example, is reasonably related to its finding that many of NYJC\u2019s sales involved a small dollar credit charge, but a high percentage rate, and that credit information is crucial to NYJC's low-income customers. Thus the fact that the Truth in Lending Act exempts sales involving minimal dollar charges<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>controlling. Similarly, the Commission\u2019s order that NYJC disclose its credit terms orally<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> is reasonably related to the finding that many of NYJC\u2019s customers are unsophisticated consumers who would not benefit from written disclosure alone. That the Truth in Lending Act has no such requirement does not invalidate this portion of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><em>B. Advertising Discount Prices: </em>The Commission ordered NYJC to cease and desist from representing that it sells \u201cany article of merchandise\u201d at a discount price (see part I (B) ), unless it first takes a \u201cstatistically significant survey\u201d which shows that the prevailing price is \u201csubstantially\u201d above NYJC\u2019s. The order apparently subjects NYJC to civil penalties<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> if it advertises discount prices without having taken the survey, even if the advertisement is true.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The Commission claims that this remedy constitutes \u201creasonable action * * * calculated to preclude the revival of the illegal practices.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We agree. NYJC was shown to have taken little account of the true level of prices in the trade area.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We think the FTC may enter an order to ensure that this is not repeated in the future, without having to determine whether respondent\u2019s previous conduct was due to inadvertence, bad faith, or a kind of inattention or negligence involving some intermediate culpability. Where a businessman has wrought a wrong on the public, he may be held to a reasonable business procedure that will prevent repetition of that wrong, and in view of his past record he will not be permitted to object that his own approaches might also avoid this wrong in the future, perhaps by happenstance and perhaps only on occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">NYJC has offered nothing either here<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> or before the Commission<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> to support its assertion that the statistical survey requirement is unduly burdensome. The requirement does not appear onerous on its face. Thus the order must be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-19\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-10\">.

The Commission apparently developed two theories to explain why high prices made a representation of \u201ceasy credit\u201d misleading. One theory seems to be that \u201ceasy credit\u201d represented to the customer that NYJC\u2019s cash price for its merchandise was \u201cnot substantially higher than prices generally prevailing in the trade area for the product.\u201d Commission Opinion at 33. Evidence of NYJC\u2019s high prices, then, was said to show the falsity of NYJC\u2019s representation. The other theory is that while \u201ceasy credit\u201d represented that \u201cthe charge imposed for credit will be reasonable,\u201d NYJC hid a credit charge in its high prices so that \u201cin fact the credit might be costing [the customer] dearly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32; <em>of. </em>FTC Economic Beport, <em>supra </em>note 1, at 18-20. These theories were mixed together in such a way that it is not clear which one is the basis of the Commission\u2019s conclusion that NYJC\u2019s high prices made its representations of \u201ceasy credit\u201d misleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b767-16\">.

In the context of this case, we think the word \u201clenient\u201d describes precisely the deceptive practice the Commission has barred, <em>see </em>part I (D) (1), <em>supra.

NYJC also claims that the Commission is without power to order affirmative disclosure of credit information unless the original representation was misleading. It says its representations were not misleading, but at worst incomplete. But we have long since passed the point where the power of the Commission to reach statements that are deceptive because they contain less than the whole truth can be doubted. <em>E. g., </em>Ward Laboratories, Inc. v. FTC, 276 F.2d 952, 954 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 827, 81 S.Ct. 65, 5 L.Ed.2d 55 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b768-16\">.

NYJC also claims that in a later suit for civil penalties it will not be able to defend against a charge that it failed to disclose all credit information orally. We are unconvinced by this hypothetical fear. First, if it turns out to be a real problem, the Commission can bo consulted before a penalty action. <em>See </em>16 C.

Second the Commission has the burden of proof in a compliance action, <em>see </em>Western Radio Corp. v. FTC, 339 F.2d 937 (7th Cir. 1964).
