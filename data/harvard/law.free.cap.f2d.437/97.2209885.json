Jobie Bishop\u2019s conviction for such offense, upon a separate trial, has been sustained by this Court. United States v. Bishop, 434 F.2d 1284 (6th Cir., 1970). We held that the evidence in that case was sufficient to permit a jury to find that Jobie had transported the Corvette to Kentucky where its motor was removed and its chassis burned. The arresting officers found the motor in the possession of appellant Johnny Bishop and the burned chassis on a river bank about three miles from the farm home of Leon Bishop, father of Jobie and Johnny. Jobie Bishop testified at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>his own trial as well as at Johnny\u2019s. Johnny did not take the stand at either trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The evidence at both trials established the theft of the Corvette at Lebanon, Ohio, and its discovery in Clay County, Kentucky. Jobie denied stealing the vehicle. It was his story that the motor found in Johnny\u2019s possession had been brought by him to Johnny for the purpose of having it installed in the chassis of a 1959 Corvette already owned by Jobie. He said that he purchased the motor \u2014 the engine block \u2014 from a used car dealer in Lebanon and carried it to Clay County, Kentucky, in the trunk of his own Chevrolet ear. At both trials Jobie disclaimed any connection with or knowledge of the burned Corvette chassis found near his father\u2019s home. The government\u2019s proofs, however, clearly established that the engine block found in Johnny\u2019s possession and the burned chassis both belonged to the stolen 1968 Corvette.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The question involved on appeal is the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant submission of appellant\u2019s guilt to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In addition to Johnny\u2019s receiving and possessing the stolen engine block, there was evidence that he told one of the arresting officers that his brother had said the motor was \u201chot\u201d and that he had understood that it had been stolen. Appellant denied making such admissions, but a factual issue for the jury\u2019s resolution was made. There was, however, no <em>direct </em>evidence that appellant Johnny Bishop ever had possession of the chassis of the stolen Corvette or had any knowledge of it. In our opinion in Jobie\u2019s case, we held in effect that transportation, possession or concealment of one part of a motor vehicle does not constitute violation of the Dyer Act. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201cEven considering the broad congressional purpose of the Dyer Act, United States v. Turley, supra, [352 U.S. 407, 77 S.Ct. 397, 1 L.Ed.2d 430] it cannot be said that an engine block, taken by itself may be fairly encompassed within the wording of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2311, 2312 (1964).\u201d United States v. Bishop, 434 F.2d 1284 (6th Cir. 1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">In Jobie\u2019s case there was no direct evidence that he had driven the Corvette from Lebanon, Ohio, to Clay County, Kentucky. But notwithstanding our above quoted observation, we held that the total circumstances warranted submission of the question of Jobie\u2019s guilt. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">\u201cA review of the full record reveals (1) admissions by the Appellant both in court and to federal agents relating to the possession, interstate transportation, and delivery of an allegedly stolen engine block; (2) a contradicted explanation of how the Appellant came to be in possession of the allegedly stolen engine block; (3) an ongoing relationship between the Appellant in Lebanon, Ohio and his father and twin brother in Clay County, Kentucky; and (4) that the allegedly stolen automobile was in working order in Lebanon, Ohio, before it was stolen and all of its major parts \u2014 not just its engine block \u2014 -were found at or near the Appellant\u2019s family home in Clay County, Kentucky. We find that a jury may draw an inference that the Appellant was a party to the interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle from the admitted possession of a major part of that vehicle where such possession is accompanied by factual circumstances such as those present in the case.\u201d 434 F.2d 1284 (6th Cir. 1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">In this case, Jobie testified that he had brought the motor down to have Johnny \u201cchange it for me,\u201d and that he, himself, did not do that kind of work in the garage where he worked in Lebanon, Ohio; that his employers \u201cdon\u2019t allow me to change no motors.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cJohnny does all that kind of work, he always does all the work on my cars, so far as changing motors and I brought it down there and I wanted him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>to put it in the Corvette for me\u201d; that \u201che\u2019s changed four or five for me, if not more\u201d; that he, himself, did not fool with changing motors, but that his brother Johnny was \u201cskilled in taking out engines and putting in engines.\u201d He added that Johnny \u201cdoes all my work for me * * * and knows how to take one motor out of a car and put another one in it,\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s been doing that kind of work\u201d for some time. Jobie explained the foregoing activity as being an aid to his activity in \u201cdrag racing\u201d; he also said that he was somewhat of a \u201chot rodder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We held in Jobie\u2019s case that the jury could infer that he transported the Corvette with its motor in it. We are likewise persuaded that Johnny\u2019s usual and special function in removing motors from vehicles brought to him, as testified by Jobie, would warrant allowing a jury to find that he first received the whole vehicle and joined in the effort to conceal it by taking out the motor and burning the chassis. In reaching such conclusion, we apply the familiar rule that the government\u2019s evidence is to be viewed in its most favorable light. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); United States v. Prieur, 429 F.2d 1237, 1238 (6th Cir. 1970); United States v. Decker, 304 F.2d 702, 705 (6th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Appellant\u2019s address to us makes the often repeated assertion of a claimed rule that the government\u2019s proofs \u201cmust be inconsistent with any reasonable theory of innocence.\u201d In Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 139, 75 S. Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954), the Supreme Court denied the existence of such a rule. We have consistently obeyed Holland. United States v. Bradley, 421 F.2d 924, 926 (6th Cir. 1970); United States v. Burkeen, 350 F.2d 261, 266 (6th Cir. 1965); United States v. Grimes, 332 F.2d 1014, 1016 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
