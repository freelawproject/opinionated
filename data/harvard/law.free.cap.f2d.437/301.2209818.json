Searaven, initiated this proceeding to recover charter hire due Compa\u00f1\u00eda under a charter party agreement with Kenray, Inc., an exporter of scrap metals, by enforcing a lien, or imposing a constructive trust, upon funds held by Beverly Hills National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Bank &amp; Trust Company. The disti'ict court awarded Compa\u00f1\u00eda $96,750 from the fund, the amount of the charter hire, plus interest. Compa\u00f1\u00eda De Navegacione Almirante S.A. Panama v. Certain Proceeds of Cargo, 288 F.Supp. 77 (C. D.Cal.1967).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Kenray was heavily indebted to the bank, which held a security interest in certain scrap metal owned by Kenray. Kenray and the bank agreed that the scrap would be sold in an overseas market to enable Kenray to reduce its debt to the bank. They agreed that Kenray would charter a vessel to carry the metal abroad and would purchase additional scrap with funds to be supplied by the bank in order to utilize the full capacity of the chartered ship. The bank financed the purchase of the additional scrap and provided a letter of credit to cover stevedoi\u2019ing service, but asked Kenray to procure a vessel without a letter of credit from the bank for charter hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Kenray chartered the Searaven from Compa\u00f1\u00eda to carry the scrap metal to discharging ports in Japan or Formosa. The charter agreement provided for charter hire of $96,750 \u2014 90 per cent to be paid within seven days after delivery of signed bills of lading marked \u201cFreight Prepaid as Per Charter Party\u201d ; the balance payable after discharge of the cargo. The bank was not party to the charter party agreement, and did not issue a letter of credit for charter hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Kenray contracted to sell the scrap to several Formosa firms, payment to be by foreign letters of credit in favor of Kenray to be drawn against upon presentation of freight prepaid bills of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Kenray\u2019s scrap,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plus a quantity owned by Purdy International Corporation, was loaded aboard the Searaven, and Compania\u2019s agent issued \u201cFreight Prepaid\u201d bills of lading to Kenray. Kenray delivered bills of lading representing Ken-ray\u2019s portion of the cargo (about 90 per cent) to the bank, together with drafts in favor of the bank on the foreign letters of credit furnished by the consignees. The bank collected the drafts and asserted a banker\u2019s lien against the proceeds. The bank also asserted a banker's lien against Kenray\u2019s commercial account containing the freight paid to Kenray by Purdy for carriage of Purdy\u2019s scrap on the Sea-raven.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">While the Searaven was en route to Formosa, Compa\u00f1\u00eda instituted the present proceeding as a libel in rem and in personam for charter hire against \u201cthe proceeds of cargo, freights and sub-freights of the S.S. Searaven,\u201d and against Kenray and the bank. Com-pa\u00f1\u00eda asserted that it had a maritime lien on the cargo for charter hire and that this lien attached to the proceeds of the letters of credit collected by the bank. The district court ordered a portion of the fund sufficient to satisfy the charter hire brought into court under former General Admiralty Rule 37, now Supplemental Rule C(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">When the Searaven arrived in Formosa, the captain, acting for Compa\u00f1\u00eda, declined to relinquish possession of the cargo until the consignees guaranteed payment of both charter hire and the cost of repairs made in Hawaii en route to Formosa. The captain discharged the cargo on Compania\u2019s instruction, however, after the consignees posted bond for the cost of repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">Absent an inconsistent agreement, the vessel owner has a lien on cargo for freight. Osaka Shosen Kaisha v. Pacific Export Lumber Co., 260 U.S. 490, 497, 43 S.Ct. 172, 67 L.Ed. 364 (1923); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The Bird of Paradise, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 545, 555, 18 L.Ed. 662 (1866); The Eddy, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 481, 18 L.Ed. 486 (1866); The Saturnus, 250 F. 407, 409-410 (2d Cir. 1918); Gilmore &amp; Black, The Law of Admiralty \u00a7 3-45, at 165 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Like a land carrier\u2019s common-law possessory lien, and unlike the ordinary maritime lien, the vessel owner\u2019s lien on cargo for freight continues only so long as the cargo remains in the owner\u2019s actual or constructive possession. It is extinguished by unconditional delivery of the goods. The Maggie Hammond, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 435, 449-450, 19 L.Ed. 772 (1869) (dictum); The Bird of Paradise, <em>supra, </em>72 U.S. at 556; Sears v. Wills, (4,885 Bags of Linseed) 66 U.S. (1 Black) 108. 112-113, 17 L.Ed. 35 (1861); Gilmore &amp; Black, <em>supra, </em>at 165-166. <em>See also </em>Krauss Bros. Co. v. Dimon S.S. Corp., 290 U.S. 117, 125-126 n. 3, 54 S.Ct. 105, 78 L.Ed. 216 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The district court held that release of the cargo to the Formosan consignees did not extinguish the cargo lien because Compa\u00f1\u00eda, prior to release, attached funds representing the \u201cproceeds\u201d of the cargo. The court rested its ruling entirely upon N.H. Shipping Corp. v. Freights of the S/S Jackie Hause, 181 F.Supp. 165, 170 (S.D.N.Y. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In <em>Jackie Hause, </em>the owner discharged the cargo only after the shipper-consignee agreed to deposit in escrow, to await determination of ownership, the amount due as unpaid freight. The court held that delivery of the cargo on this condition \u201cdid not effect that absolute and unconditional change of possession to the consignee sufficient to extinguish the vessel\u2019s lien for payment of its charter hire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">In the present case, Compa\u00f1\u00eda conditioned discharge upon the posting of security for payment of costs of repair ; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but so far as charter hire was concerned, Compa\u00f1\u00eda released the cargo unconditionally. Under the authorities cited above, Compa\u00f1\u00eda thereby relinquished its lien on cargo for freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Compa\u00f1\u00eda seeks to sustain the judgment on a second theory, namely, that under the charter party it had a non-possessory lien on the freights and sub-freights earned by the cargo, and that the attached funds included such freights.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\"> A lien on freights is lost, however, if the charges are paid without notice of the shipowner\u2019s rights. <em>See </em>Marine Traders, Inc. v. Seasons Navigation Corp., 422 F.2d 804, 806-807 (2d Cir. 1970); Hall Corp. v.

Packers v. Compania Columbiana Del Caribe, S. A., 339 U.S. 684, 689-695, 70 S.Ct. 861, 94 L.Ed. 1206 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><em>Swift </em>makes clear that admiralty jurisdiction does not extend to an \u201cindependent equitable claim\u201d as distinguished from an \u201cincidental\u201d one. <em>See Swift, supra,, </em>at 690, 70 S.Ct. 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Compa\u00f1\u00eda apparently argues that equitable issues are \u201cincidental\u201d rather than \u201cindependent\u201d whenever advanced in litigation in which the court\u2019s jurisdiction has been properly invoked. Compa\u00f1\u00eda points to the statement in Putnam v. Lower, 236 F.2d 561, 569 (9th Cir. 1956), that \u201cwhere the original jurisdiction is maritime, a court of admiralty may entertain an issue of fraud, mistake, or other equitable claim where either is alleged as affecting the rights of parties to a maritime action.\u201d (236 F.2d at 569 (footnote omitted)); <em>see also </em>CIA Estrella Blanca, LTDA v. S.S. Nictric, 247 F.Supp. 161, 171 (D.Or. 1965) , aff\u2019d 368 F.2d 575 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">In <em>Putnam, </em>however, the equitable issues arose in an admiralty action by way of defense. In <em>Swift </em>it was necessary to decide the equitable issues to protect the court\u2019s admiralty jurisdiction \u201cfrom being thwarted by a fraudulent transfer.\u201d 339 U.S. at 694, 70 S.Ct. at 868.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Compania\u2019s constructive trust claim was not presented by way of defense, and it was unnecessary to resolve it to enable the court to exercise jurisdiction over Compania\u2019s admiralty lien claim. Nor was resolution of the equitable issues necessary to afford an adequate remedy on the admiralty claim. If Compa\u00f1\u00eda had an admiralty lien on the fund, an effective judgment could have been rendered in Compania\u2019s favor whether or not the bank held the money as constructive trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">Thus, Compania\u2019s constructive trust claim constituted a separate basis for recovery, legally unrelated to Compania\u2019s maritime lien claim; and we are inclined to the view that it was therefore an independent equitable claim beyond the admiralty jurisdiction. <em>Swift, supra, </em>at 690-691, 70 S.Ct. 861; The Eclipse, 135 U.S. 599, 608, 10 S.Ct. 873, 34 L.Ed. 269 (1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">The district court did, however, have jurisdiction over Compania\u2019s equitable claim on two other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">The district court had \u201cpendent\u201d jurisdiction over the claim. In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), the Supreme Court held that \u201cpendent\u201d jurisdiction exists when there is a federal claim</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-16\">\u201cand the relationship between that claim and the state claim permits the conclusion that the entire action before the court comprises but one constitutional \u2018case.\u2019 The federal claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>must have substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court. The state and federal claims must derive from a common nucleus of operative fact. But if, considered without regard to their federal or state character, a plaintiff\u2019s claims are such that he would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding, then, assuming sub-stantiality of the federal issues, there is <em>power </em>in federal courts to hear the whole.\u201d 383 U.S. at 725, 86 S.Ct. at 1138 (citation and footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Here, the only question was who was entitled to the fund. Compa\u00f1\u00eda advanced two theories to support its claim. One was that it had a maritime lien on the fund \u2014 a theory raising issues within the district court\u2019s admiralty jurisdiction, as the bank concedes. Compania\u2019s second theory was that the bank held the fund as constructive trustee for Compania\u2019s benefit. Compania\u2019s suit thus joined alternative theories of recovery, one within and one outside federal jurisdiction. Because both arose from \u201ca common nucleus of operative fact\u201d \u2014 involving the same parties, the same transactions, the same res, the same amount claimed due \u2014 and because Com-pa\u00f1\u00eda would ordinarily be expected to try both in one judicial proceeding, the district court had power, under <em>Gibbs, </em>to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the equitable claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><em>Gibbs </em>made clear, of course, that \u201cpendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiff\u2019s right. Its justification lies in considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants * * 383 U.S. at 726, 86 S.Ct. at 1139 (footnote omitted). But in this case there were good reasons for the federal court to hear the equitable claim. Compania\u2019s federal claim could only be asserted in a kind of in rem proceeding exclusively cognizable in a federal district court exercising admiralty jurisdiction. Mad-ruga v. Superior Court, 346 U.S. 556, 560, 74 S.Ct. 298, 98 L.Ed. 290 (1954). In consequence, Compa\u00f1\u00eda could submit both claims to the fund only to a federal court. Sound discretion precluded fractionating a dispute over the single res simply because Compa\u00f1\u00eda pressed two theories of recovery. <em>Cf. </em>Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co., 374 U.S. 16, 21, 83 S.Ct. 1646, 10 L.Ed.2d 720 (1963). Such a course would have resulted in unnecessary and duplicative litigation, a waste of judicial and private resources, needless delay, and the creation of difficult problems of laches, statutes of limitation, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">The district court also had jurisdiction on the second, independent, ground that diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 was established on the record. Compa\u00f1\u00eda was a citizen of Panama, the bank a citizen of California, and the amount on controversy exceeded $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">It is immaterial that the district court purported to exercise admiralty rather than pendent or diversity jurisdiction. Troupe v. Chicago, D. &amp; G. Bay Transit Co., 234 F.2d 253, 258 (2d Cir. 1956); Moran Towing &amp; Transp. Co. v. Navigazione Libera Triestina, S.A., 92 F.2d 37, 39 (2d Cir. 1937); Prince Line v. American Paper Exports, 55 F.2d 1053, 1056 (2d Cir. 1932). There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>no right to a jury trial since the constructive trust claim was equitable, Black v. Boyd, 248 F.2d 156, 162 (6th Cir. 1957); and even if such a right existed the bank could not complain for it did not demand a jury. <em>See </em>United States v. The John R. Williams, 144 F.2d 451, 454 (2d Cir. 1944); Prince Line, <em>supra; cf. </em>The Confiscation Cases, 87 U.S. 92, 109-110, 22 L.Ed. 320 (1873); United States ex rel. Pressprich &amp; Son Co. v. James W. Elwell &amp; Co., 250 F. 939, 942 (2d Cir. 1918). There is no choice of law problem. Both parties assume that California substantive law governs the constructive trust claim, or at least that state law simply follows general equitable principles.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Turning to the merits, we agree with appellant that the district court\u2019s findings do not support imposition of a constructive trust for Compania\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">There is no finding that the bank received or retained the funds by fraud, actual or constructive. There is no finding that a confidential relationship existed between the bank and either Ken-ray or Compa\u00f1\u00eda. There is no finding that the bank misrepresented to Kenray or to Compa\u00f1\u00eda that the bank would pay Compa\u00f1\u00eda from the proceeds of the letters of credit, or permit Kenray to do so. The drafts and letters of credit were not delivered to the bank by Kenray through mistake or as the result of undue influence, but deliberately and voluntarily. There is no finding that the bank was unjustly enriched by receipt of the proceeds \u2014 they were applied to the reduction of Kenray\u2019s pre-existing debt to the bank, and left Kenray obligated to the bank for over $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The district court concluded that Ken-ray received the Purdy subfreights and the proceeds of the letters of credit as constructive trustee for the benefit of Compa\u00f1\u00eda. If this were so, Compa\u00f1\u00eda could follow the fund into the bank\u2019s hands, for the district court also found that the bank was not a good faith purchaser. R.S. Restitution \u00a7 160, comment g, p. 647; V Scott on Trusts, p. 3571 (3d ed. 1967). But there is nothing in the findings that would justify treating Kenray as any more than a debtor of Compa\u00f1\u00eda, and mere failure to pay a debt does not create a constructive trust upon the debtor\u2019s property for the creditor\u2019s benefit. <em>See </em>McKee v. Paradise, 299 U.S. 119, 122, 57 S.Ct. 124, 81 L.Ed. 75 (1936); Woodruff v. Coleman, 98 A.2d 22 (D.C.Mun.Ct. of App.1953).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">The district court also concluded that the bank held the funds as constructive trustee for Compa\u00f1\u00eda. The substance of the district court findings is that both the bank and Compa\u00f1\u00eda were creditors of Kenray, and the bank secured payment out of funds that Kenray otherwise might have used to pay Compa\u00f1\u00eda. It does not follow that the creditor who was paid holds the payment as constructive trustee for the benefit of the creditor who was not. <em>See </em>Zirker v. Baber, 161 Cal.App.2d 355, 327 P.2d 63 (4th D.C.A. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">.
