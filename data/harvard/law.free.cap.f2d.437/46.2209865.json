The question presented is whether he is entitled to the income-spreading benefits of the original version of \u00a7 1302 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302 (1958),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as to the income derived \u201cin respect of\u201d the invention. The Tax Court held that he had failed to establish that \u201cnot less than 80 per cent of the gross income in respect of such invention\u201d was received in 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">After securing his patent in 1959, taxpayer attempted unsuccessfully to interest others in obtaining licenses. Failing to do so, he had parts made by a machine shop and assembled them himself. His sales during 1959, 1960 and 1961 did not result in profit. Thereafter he was able to interest two large companies in his product and, since they did not wish to do their own manufacturing under license, commenced manufacturing the product himself. His income from the sale of the patented valve was, for 1963, substantially greater than in previous years.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">Had the taxpayer been able to sell the patent to customers who would themselves provide for the manufacture of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the patented article, the taxpayer\u2019s income in respect of the invention would be represented by the customary royalties of sales price received for the use of the patent. But, where an inventor acts as his own manufacturer, the income in respect of the invention is a part of the profits from sale of the patented article. The problem is how to apportion the profits between income from the invention itself and income from the entrepreneurial enterprise of manufacture and sale. <em>See </em>Alfred W. Barber, 19 T.C. 600 (1952). The question is not dealt with by regulation. The Tax Court did not come up with an answer. It simply rejected the formula proposed by the taxpayer, which appears to be the only one by which 80 per cent of gross income from the invention could be made to fall in the year 1963.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Appellant did not attempt to hypothesize a reasonable royalty, or any arms-length arrangement for compensation of the inventor by one who produces or otherwise exploits the product of the invention. Instead he reasoned as follows: postulating an arrangement by which a machine shop is employed by the inventor to do the manufacturing and is compensated on a cost-plus basis, he concluded that all net profits above that \u201cplus\u201d should be attributable to the invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We agree with the Tax Court that this is not an acceptable method of determining the extent of income fairly attributable to the invention itself. At the least it must be said that the resulting figure represents return not only for the creative process resulting in the invention itself, but also for such exploitation activities as sale and distribution of the manufactured product.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-15\">.

Under the common royalty arrangements according to which the manufacturer pays the inventor a fixed sum per article sold or a percentage of receipts, the taxpayer would not here qualify. Only 42.47 percent of the total number of valves sold were sold in 1963; only 56.77 percent of the gross receipts from the sale of valves accrued in 1963.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
