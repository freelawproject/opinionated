The suit is based on a claim for personal injuries received as a result of alleged medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-27\">The district court found that diversity had been \u201cmanufactured\u201d; that suits had been filed in state courts against the individual defendants before the statute of limitations had run; but that timely action had not been taken against the hospital which refused to waive the limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-28\">Following the holding of McSparran v. Weist, 402 F.2d 867 (3rd Cir. 1968), cert. den. <em>sub nomine </em>Fritzinger v. Weist, 395 U.S. 903, 89 S.Ct. 1739, 23 L.Ed.2d 217 (1969), the district court dismissed the action as to the individual defendants but denied the motion of the defendant hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-29\">The plaintiff appellant disputes the factual determinations made by the lower court but the record contains ample support for the findings and we will not disturb them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-30\">The hospital appellant contests prospective application of the \u201cmanufactured diversity\u201d doctrine. This issue was considered and decided adversely to appellant by the court en banc in McSparran v. Weist, <em>supra. </em>Accord: Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>v. Hale, 433 F.2d 324 (5th Cir. 1970); Lester v.
