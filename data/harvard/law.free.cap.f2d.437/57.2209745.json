Trial was commenced on April 15, 1970 in the District of Connecticut, before Judge T. Emmet Clarie and a jury. After the jury returned a verdict ' of guilty on April 24, Reed was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment and is presently in prison for unrelated federal convictions. White was sentenced to fifteen years and was released on bail pending this appeal. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The government\u2019s chief witness at trial was Ralph Maselli, an accomplice of the co-defendants. He admitted that in exchange for his testimony the government had granted him complete immunity from ten federal bank robbery charges and, through an \u201carrangement\u201d with the state authorities, from a state murder charge. Both defendants testified on their own behalf and denied robbing the bank in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The appellants\u2019 main contention is that the district court erred in precluding cross-examination of Maselli concerning whether he contemplated writing a book about his bank robibery escapades. Appellants\u2019 claim is based on the following colloquy. During cross-examination of Maselli, defense counsel asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">Q. Mr. Maselli, are you still planning to write a book about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-13\">Mr. Crane: Object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-14\">Mr. Tiernan: I think it is extremely pertinent, if your honor please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-15\">(Counsel then were called to the bench and the following discussion was held.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-16\">The Court: What is the basis of the discussion ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-17\">Mr. Tiernan: The basis of the question is, your Honor, that in a previous case this witness testified that he discussed with his attorney the writing of a book about his adventures as a bank robber: that he discussed receiving $15,000 for the writing of this book and I think it clearly shows his interest in this matter. Who is going to buy a book from a witness whose testimony doesn\u2019t convict anyone ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-19\">The Court: Where does he testify to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-20\">Mr. Tiernan: He testified to this matter before Judge Blumenfeld in Bridgeport, in a case involving the robbery of a High Ridge National Bank in Stamford, Connecticut, if your Honor pleases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-21\">I have the transcript here available if you would like to see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-22\">The Court: What relevancy does that have to his truthfulness here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-23\">Mr. Tiernan: It clearly shows his interest in the outcome of the case, shading his testimony, or testifying falsely, if he expects to receive some monetary reward for writing a book about this. And as far as a bank robber, people would certainly be less willing to buy a book if his evidence was insufficient to convict anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-24\">The Court: I can\u2019t see the relevancy. The objection is sustained * * The jury will disregard the last question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-25\"> Reed and White contend that Judge Clarie erred in disallowing this line of inquiry as irrelevant, since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>inquiry was intended to show Maselli\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case and a defendant has the right to a full cross-examination of any circumstance which may evidence bias, interest, or prejudice toward him. We agree that the district court erred in this regard, for it is settled that a witness\u2019s possible financial stake in the outcome of a case is highly relevant. Wheeler v. United States, 351 F.2d 946 (1st Cir.1965). But we consider the error harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of the defendants\u2019 guilt, in view of the fact that the claimed possibility of reward was speculative in the extreme, and in view of the fact that there were 115 pages of other inquiry on cross-examination of Maselli as to that witness\u2019s motives in testifying, including his promised immunity from numerous criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We have examined the appellants\u2019 other contentions and we find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b113-7\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">I concur in the result and the opinion except that I do not find error in Judge Clarie\u2019s exclusion of the book testimony.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
