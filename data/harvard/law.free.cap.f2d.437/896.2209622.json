The Secretary contended that the appellants (employers) were violating provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 15(a) (2) and 15(a) (5) of the Act and sought an injunction to restrain such violations and further to restrain the appellants from withholding payment of minimum wages and overtime compensation alleged to be due certain employees. Since the case was submitted upon a written stipulation of facts, there is no factual dispute under review. The district court granted the relief sought except that it refused to enjoin and restrain the appellants from future violations of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-23\">We have given full consideration to the contentions of the parties and find ourselves in agreement with the opinion and judgment of the district court.
