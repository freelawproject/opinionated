Sa-maniego, was charged with aiding and abetting Edwin Leo Busch, who was charged with the robbery of a National Bank while using a hand gun (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (d)). Codefendant Busch entered a plea of guilty to the lesser included offense (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)). Appellant waived a jury, and was tried and found guilty of aiding and abetting Busch in commission of the lesser included offense (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2113(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-23\">Appellant urges three errors on appeal \u2014the insufficiency of the evidence to convict; the alleged bias on the part of the trial judge; and the alleged refusal of the trial judge to permit counsel for defendant to see all of the probation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-24\">We find none of the errors urged have merit, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-25\">I.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-26\">\u201cIn order to aid and abet another to commit a crime a defendant must in some way associate himself with the venture \u2014 he must participate in it as something he wishes to bring about, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>and he must seek by his action to make it succeed. The word abet contains within it an implication of guilty knowledge on the part of the participant.\u201d Grant v. United States, 291 F.2d 746, 748 (9th Cir. 1961); United States v. Camarillo, 431 F.2d 616 (9th Cir. 1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">Of course, mere knowledge of the crime, or mere presence at the scene of it, is not sufficient evidence to convict a defendant of knowingly participating in a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">In United States v. Brown, 436 F.2d 702 (12/23/70), this Court recently said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-6\">\u201c * # * the government had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the * * * individuals who committed the Credit Union robbery, had been in the Volkswagen with the defendant just prior to that robbery and also that defendant was occupying the driver\u2019s seat of the Volkswagen as it was parked in the alley behind the Credit Union during the perpetration of the robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-8\">Thus defendant\u2019s presence at the scene and his association with the robbers were not questioned. The only point made by appellant * * * was that the evidence was insufficient to show that defendant had knowledge of any intent to commit a robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-10\">It was not necessary that the government exclude the possibility of reasonable doubt concerning appellant\u2019s knowledge of the intended robbery\u2014 only that it present facts upon which a reasonable man, drawing reasonable inferences, <em>could </em>so find beyond a reasonable doubt. Crawford v. United States, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 375 F.2d 332 (1967).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">Were we to change the plural \u201cindividuals\u201d to \u201cindividual\u201d, the \u201cCredit Union\u201d to \u201cbank\u201d, and \u201cVolkswagen\u201d to \u201cgreen Toyota,\u201d the facts in the <em>Brown </em>case would be precisely the facts in this case, and sufficient to have the issue of appellant\u2019s guilt go to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But there are additional facts in this case which were not present in <em>Brown, supra. </em>Here the defendant not only waited in the alley behind the bank, in the driver\u2019s seat of the green Toyota, parked in a peculiar manner, and parked with the motor running, but he drove the robber (who ran to the automobile with a pistol in his hand, and who had told the appellant he had just robbed the bank) away from the scene at a high rate of speed and through a stop sign to appellant\u2019s home, where he allowed the robber to hide his loot under appellant\u2019s bed, and partially to burn his disguise in appellant\u2019s presence in appellant\u2019s fireplace. <em>After the robbery </em>he lied to officers concerning his earlier whereabouts on the day of the robbery; and about the ownership of the partially burned disguise; and told his sister to \u201ctake care\u201d of the incriminating evidence in his bedroom. <em>Before the robbery </em>he aided the robber in attempting to disguise the planned \u201cget away\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d car (a red Toyota) (1) by furnishing a Certificate of Registration issued to the appellant, and license plates, issued to appellant\u2019s father, which were taken from a Ford truck, (2) by following the robber\u2019s \u201cswitch\u201d car to where it was parked, and (3) by then driving the robber to the bank and awaiting his return. Prior to the robbery, appellant even advised the robber, albeit \u201cjokingly\u201d, that to solve his (the robber\u2019s) financial problems, he (the robber) ought to rob a bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">Clearly a reasonable man, drawing reasonable inferences, <em>could </em>have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had knowledge of the intended robbery. Looking at the evidence, as we now must in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude the claim, of insufficiency of the evidence has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-15\">As to the trial court\u2019s alleged bias toward appellant, his counsel concedes that he \u201cdoes not urge the point to attack the verdict\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief, p. 14), but that he raises it only with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>spect to \u201cfurther proceedings.\u201d While some of the trial court\u2019s language during the trial may have been slightly inaccurate with strict respect to the record, no basis for \u201cbefore the fact\u201d disqualification of the trial judge exists for whatever actions he may or may not take <em>in futuro. </em>That problem can be met when, and if, it arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">With respect to appellant\u2019s position that counsel has a constitutional right to see all of the probation report made concerning his client, we cannot agree such a right exists. By rule of court, approved by the Supreme Court, such a matter lies within the discretion of the trial judge. Rule 32(c) (2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (penultimate sentence) specifically authorizes the court, in its discretion, to disclose to the defendant or his counsel \u201call or part of the material\u201d in the probation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Any judge with extensive trial experience knows there must exist a large discretion granted to the sentencing judge. Were such a provision not contained in the rules, the amount and the truth of the information given to the probation officer, in confidence from friends, family, neighbors, and employers, would dry up to a mere trickle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1300-16\">. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Simmons, 281 F.2d 354, 360 (2nd Cir. 1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
