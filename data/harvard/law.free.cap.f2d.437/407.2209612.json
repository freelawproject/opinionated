His principal complaint goes to the admission of testimony concerning incriminating statements which he, Kinney, made to Wilke Nash and McKinsey Smith, when they apprehended him the day after the burglary. At that time Kinney was wearing a pair of boots and carrying a jacket that were taken in the burglary; but, as Kinney points out, bare possession of recently stolen goods, while sufficient to support an inference of larceny, is ordinarily not prima facie proof of burglary \u2014 there must be some evidence of guilty conduct besides the bare possession of the stolen property before the presumption of burglary is super-added to that of the larceny. Kinney\u2019s argument is that testimony concerning the incriminating statements was not admissible because the statements were coerced and because neither Nash nor Smith gave him a warning, as required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) before the questioning; that since the incriminating statements, together with the evidence of possession, constituted the government\u2019s sole proof, the court\u2019s ruling, admitting the testimony, was prejudi-cially erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Granting Kinney\u2019s major premises,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his minor premise is not borne out by the record: The government\u2019s evidence was not limited to the incriminating statements. To the contrary, the government adduced proof that Kinney, after being accused of the burglary, broke from Smith\u2019s custody and fled. This fact in itself, and separate and apart from Kinney\u2019s possession of the recently stolen property, would constitute some evidence that Kinney was the burglar, .but when that fact is combined with his possession of the property, the evidence of guilt is beyond question.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The case, of course, was tried without the interposition of a jury (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5033); from the colloquy between court and counsel following submission it appears that the court relied upon the proof of flight as the factual predicate for its ultimate conclusion. Thus, even if the evidence of the statements should not have been admitted, we are satisfied that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Kinney\u2019s remaining points do not merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\">. We should perhaps note that the court conducted a hearing on the issue of whether or not the statements were voluntary and found, on substantial evidence, that they were not the product of coercion; and that with respect to the <em>Miranda </em>objection, Kinney\u2019s attorney took the position that the <em>Miranda </em>rule extends to private persons who make citizens arrests. But see the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Miranda </em>at page 444 of 384 U.S., at page 1612 of 86 S.Ct.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-20\">\u201cBy custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-21\">The Second Circuit recently in United States v. Antonelli, (2d Cir. 1970) interpreted literally this statement and held that no <em>Miranda </em>warning was required of private security guards. See also: State v. Lombardo, 104 Ariz. 598, 457 P.2d 275, in which the Arizona Supreme Court construed <em>Miranda </em>as not applicable to persons \u201cacting in a private capacity and not as law enforcement officers.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
