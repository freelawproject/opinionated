C. Dockery, a California State prisoner, appeals from an order dismissing his complaint pursuant to Rule 12, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court dismissed the complaint because of plaintiff\u2019s failure \u201cto elaborate the facts which underlie his claim\u201d in this civil rights action against plaintiff\u2019s brother and sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-17\">A dismissal of a complaint, without dismissal of the action, is not a \u201cfinal order\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because the complaint is still open to amendment. Since we find no \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d here which indicate that the court below determined that the complaint could not be saved by amendment, the order appealed from is not an ap-pealable order. Jackson v. Nelson, 405 F.2d 872, 873 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-19\">The appeal is accordingly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiff may move in the district court for leave to file an amended complaint. Thereafter, further proceedings should be governed by the procedure outlined in Potter v. McCall, 433 F.2d 1087 (9th Cir. 1970), and cases cited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
