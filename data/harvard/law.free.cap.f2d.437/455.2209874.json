Section 158(a) (1) &amp; (3). The sole issue presented on each violation is whether substantial evidence appears in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding, and an issue is raised as to the relief granted. The relief granted by the Board was broader than that granted by the trial examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-20\">After examination of the record and consideration of the briefs and arguments, the Court is satisfied that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings. We are also satisfied that the relief given was within the sound discretion of the board. N. L. R. B. v.
