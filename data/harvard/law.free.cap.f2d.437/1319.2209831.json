Maier, Jr., and located in Charleston and Clarks-burg, West Virginia, and Columbus, Ohio. The District Court found after an extensive hearing that the principal purpose for the formation of the fifteen corporations was tax avoidance, and consequently that under \u00a7 269 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 these taxpayers were not entitled to the benefit of the surtax exemption. The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous. After carefully reviewing the record and the thorough opinion of the District Court (reported at 306 F.Supp. 570), we conclude that the finding as to principal purpose is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-24\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
