The motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the successors or representatives of the deceased party and, together with the notice of hearing, shall be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and upon persons not parties in the manner provided in Rule 4 for the service of a summons, and may be served in any judicial district. Unless the motion for substitution is made not later than 90 days after the death is suggested upon the record by service of a statement of the fact of the death as provided herein for the service of the motion, the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">The decision of the court below entered on the denial of the executrix\u2019s motion to dismiss is reported at 46 F.R.D. 16 (S.D.Tex.1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">The plaintiff-appellee, a resident of Texas, brought this diversity ease for breach of contract, against William J. Brennan, a resident of Montgomery County, Alabama, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Service of process was effected through the Secretary of State of Texas. Brennan appeared through Ronald C. Kline, of the firm of Bracewell and Patterson, of Houston, Texas. During the pretrial stages Brennan\u2019s death was suggested on the record by Kline. Within 90 days, on March 20, 1968, plaintiff moved to substitute Brennan\u2019s executrix, who had been appointed by the Probate Court of Montgomery County, Alabama. Her residence and relationship to the decedent were not alleged, but it appeared later that she was decedent\u2019s widow and that she too resided in Montgomery County, Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">The motion was not served on the executrix, a person not a party within the meaning of Rule 25(a) (1), in the manner provided by Fed.R.Civ.P. 4. Instead, counsel for plaintiff, presumably intending to act under Rule 5, which relates to service of pleadings and other papers, mailed the motion to Kline. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel made the usual certificate of mailing, describing Kline therein as \u201cAttorney of Record herein for the Defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The motion to substitute was granted on April 9. Several months later the executrix, through Kline, moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. That motion was denied, 46 F.R.D. 16, and the case went to trial. After plaintiff won a $30,000 jury verdict, the executrix appealed, asserting <em>inter alia, </em>the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In considering whether it had jurisdiction over the executrix, the District Court appeared to consider as determinative the fact that William J. Brennan had been validly served with process. Since there had been jurisdiction over him, the court thought it unnecessary to \u201creacquire\u201d jurisdiction over the substituted party, who merely represented the decedent\u2019s interest, thus obviating the necessity for a \u201csecond\u201d service of process. 46 F.R.D. at 17. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Subject matter jurisdiction, once it validly exists among the original parties, remains intact after substitution. <em>See </em>Hardenbergh v. Ray, 151 U.S. 112, 14 S.Ct. 305, 38 L.Ed. 93 (1893); Clarke v. Mathewson, 12 Pet. 164, 9 L.Ed. 1041 (1838); Ford Bacon &amp; Davis v. Volentine, 64 F.2d 800 (5th Cir.1933); Cross v. Evans, 86 F. 1 (5th Cir.1898). A substituted party steps into the same position of the original party. Chief Justice Marshall first pronounced the rule in American jurisprudence: \u201cDefendant upon the scire facias can only plead what the intestate could have pleaded; and [that] it is not to be considered as a proceeding against the representative of the deceased, but a continuance of the original action.\u201d McKnight v. Craig Adm\u2019r, 6 Crunch 183, 187, 3 L.Ed. 193 (1810).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But descriptions of the consequences of substitution do not answer the inquiry of what the court, having subject matter jurisdiction, must do to obtain personal jurisdiction over the party sought to be substituted. The inquiry is especially pointed in this instance in which the federal court in Texas seeks to reach the nonresident representative of the estate of a nonresident defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">The certificate is unsigned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">This leads us to consider the nature of Rules 4 and 5. Rule 5 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is clerical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>administrative in nature. It is captioned \u201cService and Filing of Pleadings and Other Papers,\u201d and pertains only to papers \u201csubsequent to the original complaint.\u201d If the party is represented by an attorney these papers are served only on such attorney unless otherwise ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On the other hand, Rule 4 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is juris-dictionally rooted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is captioned \u201cProcess\u201d and indicates the manner in which original process is served in variegated situations. In most instances process will be served personally on defendant. However, Rule 4 does announce methods by which substituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>service may be effected \u2014 for example, service of process on a defendant by leaving a copy of the process papers at his usual abode with a suitable person, or service of process on an authorized agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The difference between Rules 4 and 5 is demonstrated when a counterclaim is filed by a defendant naming an additional party to the case over whom the court previously has not acquired jurisdiction. This pleading, although normally filed in the manner prescribed in Rule 5, must be served together with a summons on the new party pursuant to Rule 4. <em>Cf. </em>Republic of China v. American Express Co., 108 F.Supp. 169 (S.D.N.Y.1952). Also, when an amended complaint, normally served in conformity with Rule 5, asserts an additional claim against a party who has not appeared in the original suit, the pleading must be served in accordance with Rule 4 in order that the court obtain personal jurisdiction over the new party. <em>See </em>Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil, \u00a7 1146. We conclude, therefore, that Rule 4 service of the motion to substitute is for the purpose of acquiring personal jurisdiction over non-parties, and Rule 5 service of the motion is not sufficient to acquire such jurisdiction and cannot be employed in lieu of Rule 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The District Court relied upon the following language from Bertsch v. Canterbury, 18 F.R.D. 23 (S.D.Cal.1955):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">We conclude that Rule 25(a) (1), F. R.C.P. provides for substitution of a party and that the service of notice on parties is required only for the purpose of such substitution; that if <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction has been previously acquired of the original party, then the <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction continues over the substituted party; that if no <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction had been acquired over the original party, then the substitution of a new party under Rule 25(a) (1), F.R.C.P. does not supply <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction to proceed with the action but only places the substituted party in the same position as the original party, i.e., a party to the action, but one who must be still served with process to secure <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">18 F.R.D. at 27. The holding of <em>Bertsch </em>is in the third clause of the quoted language, that if no <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction had been acquired over the decedent there must be service on the substituted executor to get <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the instant case the court relied upon the second clause and concluded that since it had jurisdiction over the decedent it therefore had jurisdiction over the executrix. The dictum of the second clause is subject to the construction that it is a restatement of Justice Marshall\u2019s teaching in McKnight v. Craig Adm\u2019r, supra; that is, a description of the jurisdiction of the court over the substituted party once substitution has been effected. If this second clause is construed otherwise, as a statement that <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over the original party so continues over the party named as a potential substitute as to subject him to the power of the court without the necessity of service of process, then in our opinion it is wrong, and we decline to adopt any such principle.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">The record does not show that Kline was attorney for the executrix when the motion was served on him. And, even if he were, service of process is not effectual on an attorney solely by reason of his capacity as attorney. Rule 4(d) (1) allows service on an agent only if \u201cauthorized by appointment or by law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>to receive service of process.\u201d <em>See generally </em>4 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1097.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"> The appellee contends that under the circumstances the service requirements of Rule 25(a) (1) should be relaxed. He asserts that the executrix must have had actual notice of the motion, pointing to the service of the motion itself on Kline, who had been the decedent\u2019s attorney,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to Kline\u2019s subsequent appearance for the executrix and to the fact that the executrix filed no denial that Kline was attorney for her at the time he received the motion. Assuming the executrix had such actual notice, which plaintiff infers that she must have had, it would not operate as a substitute for process. \u201cIndeed, whenever a defendant comes into court to challenge the service of process he, of necessity, has received notice of the suit, but, clearly mere \u2018notice\u2019 is not a sufficient ground upon which a court can sustain the validity of service of process when Congress has established other definitive standards.\u201d Berner v. Farny, 11 F.R.D. 506, 509 (D.N.J.1951). Thus we conclude that the District Court had no jurisdiction over the executrix of Brennan.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The appellant seems to contend that, in any event, she could not be reached with process by the Texas federal court, even under Rule 4, because she is beyond the territorial limits of Texas and has no relationship with that state, and has carried on no transactions in that state such as would subject her to service of process by any court in that state. However, under Rule 25(a) (1) the motion and notice of hearing may be served \u201cin any judicial district.\u201d And it is now established that Rule 25(a) (1) service on the executor of a named defendant is valid although made beyond the territorial limits of the state in which the district court is held. Iovino v. Waterson, 274 F.2d 41 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, Carlin v. Iovino, 362 U.S. 949, 80 S.Ct. 860, 4 L.Ed.2d 867 (1960); Commercial Solvents Corp. v. Jasspon, 92 F.Supp. 20; 10 F.R.D. 356 (S.D.N.Y. 1950); 3B Moore, fl25.05, at 25-163. As to due process objections the <em>Iovino </em>court held: \u201c[I]n this limited area Congress may use its power to provide for service of process anywhere in the United States in such a manner that in all suits properly in the Federal courts by or against United States citizens, including diversity suits, substitution of their personal representatives may be had on their decease.\u201d 274 F.2d at 48. Professor Moore points out, this principle is strengthened by the 1963 amendment to Rule 4(f) which provides that service of process may be made beyond the territorial limits of the state in which the district court is held \u201cwhen authorized by these rules.\u201d 3B Moore, ff25.05, at 25-163.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">In her motion to dismiss, the executrix made a second, and unsuccessful, contention that the plaintiff did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. This was predicated on the theory that plaintiff\u2019s claim against the estate of the decedent had not been timely presented under the provisions of Alabama law. Tit. 61, \u00a7 215, Code of Ala. (1958 Recomp.), governs presentation of a claim where decedent has died with an action pending against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-13\"><em>When revival of suit a presentation. </em>\u2014The revival of any action pending against any person at the time of his death, which by law survives against his personal representative, by notice served on the executor or administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tor, within six months after the grant of letters, shall be considered as a presentation of the claim on which the action is founded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The District Court denied the motion considering the six month period of this section to be an Alabama statute of limitations which had been complied with since, in its view, the executrix had been \u201cserved\u201d under Rule 5; thus the court was not required to consider either extension or reduction of the period.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">But whether under Alabama law a claim has been, or can be, presented against the estate in Alabama is not determinative of whether this action pending in Texas can, after defendant\u2019s death, go forward against the executrix as a party substituted under Rule 25(a) (1). The point of entry for analysis is not the Alabama law of decedents\u2019 estates governing either method or time limit for presenting a claim \u2014 it is Rule 25(a). That rule is the procedural device which, for the federal district court, controls the manner in which substitution of parties may be effected following the death of a party in an action which survives under state law. 3B Moore 1125.04 [3], at 25.141. Under general principles of conflict of laws, whether a cause of action survives the death of the defendant is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the cause of action arose. 15A C.J.S. Conflict of Laws \u00a7 22(8), at p. 539; Annot., 42 A. L.R.2d 1170 (1953); <em>cf. </em>Gray v. Blight, 112 F.2d 696 (10th Cir.1940). We find no authority that the Texas conflict of laws rule is to the contrary. This cause of action arose in Texas, and under the law of that state a cause of action for breach of contract survives the death of the defendant. <em>See </em>Hutchings v. Bates, 393 S.W.2d 338 (Tex.Civ.App.1965), aff\u2019d, 406 S.W.2d 419 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">If the cause of action survives, the <em>method </em>employed by the federal court to substitute the executrix as a party is directed by the federal rules, though inconsistent with state law. Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">Since Rule 25 is a valid procedural rule, it therefore follows that the terms of Rule 25, and federal court decisions interpreting its meaning, control the manner of effecting substitution in the federal courts. And conflicting state law dealing with the manner of effecting substitution in state court should not prevail over the requirements of Rule 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">3B Moore IJ25.04 at 25-141. As we have pointed out above, the motion was timely <em>filed </em>but was not <em>served </em>by the method prescribed by Rule 25(a) (1). Rule 25(a) (1), however, does not prescribe the <em>time </em>within which the motion and notice of motion must be <em>served </em>\u201cupon persons not parties in the manner provided in Rule 4,\u201d nor does Rule 4 contain a time limitation for service. Such a limitation affects substantive rights and, thus, is controlled by state law. <em>See </em>Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945). The pertinent state law is that of Texas. We are led to this conclusion by two considerations. The law of revivability (subject, of course, in a diversity case to the procedural requirements of Rule 25(a) (1)) is that of the forum state. <em>See </em>3 Beale, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 498.1, p. 1527. And, the time limitation for bringing in the executrix as a party is parallel to a statute of limitations, which for the federal court in a diversity action is that of the forum. Restatement of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 603 (1934); <em>see </em>Guaranty Trust Co., of New York v. York, <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, we resort to the law of Texas to ascertain the time limitation within which the executrix must be brought into this suit by service upon her of the Rule 25(a) (1) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">In Texas jurisprudence there is no express period of time within which the decedent\u2019s representative or successor must be introduced into the suit. Texas case law, however, has filled the gap by providing that the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>stitution must be within a reasonable time after defendant\u2019s death. <em>See </em>Morris v. Drescher, 123 S.W.2d 958 (Tex.Civ.App.1939); Trahan v. Roberts, 48 S.W.2d 503 (Tex.Civ.App.1932); Wooton v. Jones, 286 S.W. 680 (Tex.Civ.App.1926); Hermann (Hermann Hospital Estate) v. Higgins Oil &amp; Fuel Co., 260 S.W. 1094, 1095 (Tex.Civ.App.1924). Most of the prolonged period since Brennan\u2019s death has been devoted to litigation of the difficult questions which this case raises, and from March, 1968 to the present, plaintiff has been, though erroneously, the beneficiary of an order granting his motion to substitute. Applying Texas standards, we conclude that in this particular instance the plaintiff should be allowed a reasonable time after remand to serve his Rule 25(a) (1) motion and notice on the executrix in the manner provided by Rule 4, if he wishes to do so. If plaintiff does comply with Rule 4 within a reasonable time, the District Court should enter an order permitting substitution, and the plaintiff then may proceed to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">A caveat is in order. In this opinion we have considered the Texas law concerning substitution of a decedent\u2019s representative or successor for the limited purpose of ascertaining an applicable time limitation for Rule 25(a) (1) service. We do not reach the effect on this case of the substantive decedents\u2019 estates law of Texas, of Alabama, or of any other state, governing presentation of claims against an estate. The time and the manner in which a claim against an estate must be proved is governed by the law of the state in which proof is sought to be made. Restatement of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 498-499, 555-556 (1934).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Failure to prove a claim in one state within the time there limited is immaterial to the proof of claim in another state, Restatement, \u00a7 498 comment a. Presentation of claim is a matter for the District Court to consider on remand, or to be considered in connection with the enforceability of a judgment, if obtained. It would be premature for us to attempt to decide the effect of Alabama\u2019s \u00a7 215, or the presentation of claims laws of any other states, on this Texas-based diversity action in which substitution of parties, if effected, will be under Rule 25(a) (1) rather than state revivor procedures.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If consideration becomes appropriate the matter must be resolved in the light of the federal-state interplay evidenced by Hanna v. Plumer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-12\">.

Texas is one of the few states which has no nonclaims statute barring claims not filed within a certain period. 17B Vernon\u2019s Ann.Tex.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 298, 327 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">In Alabama, a claim not in litigation at the time of decedent\u2019s death is barred unless presented by filing it in verified form in the office of the judge of probate of the county in which letters testamentary or of administration have been granted, within six months from the grant. Tit. 61, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 214, Code of Ala. (1958 Recomp.). If the claim is in litigation at the time of decedent\u2019s death, Alabama, by \u00a7 215, quoted <em>supra, </em>employs as a presentation the revival within six months of the action (if it survives). Sec. 215, however, is not a revival statute. It is a part of the state code of Wills and Administration, located in the chapter on Administration of Estates, and the article on Claims and Debts. Alabama\u2019s revival statutes are in Tit. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 153 and 154, while \u00a7 215 simply employs revival of the action as a means of presentation of a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b575-13\">.

However, -we do not imply, by using Moore\u2019s phrase of \u201cover and above,\u201d that we either reject or embrace the possibility that notice to a representative of the estate which would be effectual to satisfy the decedents\u2019 estate law of a particular state [i. e., the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>fer presenting a claim] might be <em>less </em>stringent than the notice required by Rule 25(a) (1) to substitute the personal representative as a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
