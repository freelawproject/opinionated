Because the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>tion was filed after the imposition of sentence, it should have been granted only if the appellant succeeded in establishing that withdrawal of the guilty plea was necessary \u201cto correct manifest injustice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Appellant\u2019s motion is premised on the claim that at the time the guilty plea was entered he had received improper advice from counsel and did not understand the nature of the charge, the effect of the plea, or his rights. <em>We </em>agree with the District Court that this claim is negated by the trial record which discloses a careful interrogation by the trial judge of both Jones and his lawyer at the time the plea was entered to insure that the plea was voluntary and that Jones understood its effect. In light of the court\u2019s detailed inquiry at the time the plea was entered, Jones' self-serving statements three years later that he really did not know what he was doing are scarcely sufficient to establish the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d necessary to require the District Court to set aside the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Accordingly, the motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted and the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
