Appeal to this Court resulted in an affirmance by an equally divided Court sitting en banc. Carter v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 325 F.2d 697, cert. den. 377 U.S. 946, 84 S.Ct. 1353, 12 L.Ed.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">The defendant has now served his sentence on the perjury conviction and acknowledges that \u201call Federal custody and jurisdiction over him ceased in mid-1965.\u201d On July 1, 1969, he filed in the district court a motion for writ of error eoram nobis to vacate his perjury conviction, alleging five separate grounds for such relief. The United States, in opposition to the appellant\u2019s motion, filed a motion to dismiss. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, and entered an order, accompanied by written opinion, denying appellant\u2019s motion without a hearing. United States v. Carter, M.D.Ga.1969, 319 F.Supp. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">In United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248, it was held by the Supreme Court that relief in the nature of eoram nobis was not abolished by 28 U.S.C.A. 2255, and was available under the all-writs statute, 28 U.S.C.A. 1651(a). The Morgan decision reaffirmed the earlier case of United States v. Mayer, 235 U.S. 55, 35 S.Ct. 16, 59 L.Ed. 129, where the Supreme Court restricted coram nobis relief to those cases where \u201cerrors * * * of the most fundamental character\u201d existed; \u201cthat is, such [errors] as [would render] the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">The district court\u2019s reasoning is sound and its conclusion is correct that there was no error of that fundamental character which permitted the issuance of a writ of coram nobis. This Court is in accord. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
