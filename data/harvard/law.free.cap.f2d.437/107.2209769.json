He contends that the court did not carry out a deal made between defense counsel, the Assistant United States Attorney, and the District Judge to impose a two year federal sentence to run concurrently with a two year state sentence but instead sentenced Barker to four years. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">At the time Barker entered his plea of guilty, he was closely questioned by the court to ensure that the plea was voluntarily made. His claim of coercion \u201cis squarely rebutted by appellant\u2019s repeated statements to the contrary made at the time the plea was entered and therefore need not be considered further. Putnam v. United States, 10th Cir. 1964, 337 F.2d 313, 315.\u201d United States v. Cooper, 5 Cir. 1969, 410 F.2d 1128, 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-16\">Moreover, the testimony of the sentencing judge, the Assistant United States Attorney, and counsel for Barker leaves no room for doubt that no deal was made, or was represented to Barker by his counsel as having been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-17\">Affirmed:</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
