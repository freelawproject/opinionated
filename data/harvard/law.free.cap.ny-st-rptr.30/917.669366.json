The action was brought against Whittier and resulted in a judgment for costs against plaintiff, and he was compelled to pay $150 for costs and sheriff\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">Defendant admitted the employment, but denied that he agreed to hold plaintiff harmless from all costs. Plaintiff recovered a verdict for $150, and from the judgment entered thereon, and from an order denying the motion for a new trial, defendant takes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-16\">There are but two exceptions in the case. The first is to the admission in evidence of a paper alleged by plaintiff to have been signed by the defendant, and containing the terms of the agreement as plaintiff claimed them to be. No grounds of objection were stated on the trial at the time the paper was offered. It is now contended that it did not appear that plaintiff knew defendant\u2019s handwriting, or that he had ever seen him write. It does, however, appear that plaintiff testified that defendant gave him the disputed paper, and we think that was sufficient to authorize its admission; but even if this were not so, on his cross-examination plaintiff testified that defendant signed the paper in his (plaintiff\u2019s) presence; that statement made the paper admissible beyond all question. If defendant had seen fit to formulate the grounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>his objection at the time the paper was offered, he might then have cross-examined the plaintiff on that point, but he failed to do so, or to state the ground \u00f3f his objection. Having brought out on his cross-examination of plaintiff his evidence of the genuineness of the signature, he should not now be heard to object to its admission</p>\n<p id=\"b980-2\">The second exception is to the admission of a letter written by defendant to plaintiff; no grounds of objection were stated when the letter was offered in evidence, but it is now claimed that there was a material alteration in the letter by the substitution of the word \u201c me \u201d for \u201cyou,\u201d of which no explanation was offered, and that therefore the paper was inadmissible. Plaintiff testified that the letter was in the same condition as when he received it We do not understand the rule to be as contended for by the appellant Grreenleaf lays down the rule as follows: \u201c But if any ground of suspicion is apparent upon the face of the instrument, the law presumes nothing, but leaves the question as to the time when it was done, as well as that of the person by whom and the intent with which the alteration was made, as matters of fact to be ultimately found by the jury upon proofs to be adduced by the party offering the instrument in evidence.\u201d 1 Grreenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7 564..</p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\">The evidence presented a direct issue between plaintiff and defendant, as to whether defendant agreed to hold plaintiff harmless from costs in the Whittier suit The jury have found in favor of the plaintiff, and we can see no reason for disturbing the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">1 Subsequent to the entry of the judgment, defendant moved, on the affidavits of himself and one Daniel B. Hawkins, for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, which motion was opposed by plaintiff's affidavit; the motion was denied, and from the order entered thereon defendant also appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">We think the learned trial judge was right in denying defendant\u2019s application. The proposed new evidence was to the effect that said Hawkins was present at an interview between plaintiff and defendant when the agreement was made, and would corroborate defendant\u2019s version of it The only reason given in the moving affidavit of defendant for not having Hawkins present as a witness on the trial was that defendant \u201c did not and could not anticipate that the plaintiff would give the testimony he gave at said trial, based on forgery and perjury, and deponent did not discover until too late to secure his attendance as a witness that Hawkins could testify in contradiction to the plaintiff that part of the testimony of plaintiff most damaging to this deponent, upon which said verdict must have been founded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">We think the reasons urged for a new trial are entirely insufficient, and in direct conflict with the well settled rules governing such applications, which\u2019 are addressed to the discretion of the court</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">It does not appear that this evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence on the first trial; it is cumulative in that it would only tend to support defendant\u2019s version of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Defendant knew of Hawkins\u2019 presence at the interview as alleged, and should have had him. present at the trial if he desired to avail himself of his testimony. His failure to recollect the incident of Hawkins\u2019 presence as alleged is not a sufficient reason for his failure to present his testimony. A defeated party is usually surprised when evidence is presented against him; that it is stronger than, or different from what he expected, affords no grounds for granting him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-3\">For the reasons above stated, the judgment and order denying motion for a new trial on the minutes should be affirmed, with costs, and the order denying motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence should also be affirmed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">Yan Wyck, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
