The defendant claims that the plaintiffs guaranteed that the goods should bring a certain stipulated amount and counterclaims and demands judgment against the plaintiff for $257. The justice appears not to have allowed the counterclaim, and found judgment foi the defendant without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">If the defendant\u2019s testimony is to be believed, he was entitled to the counterclaim.
