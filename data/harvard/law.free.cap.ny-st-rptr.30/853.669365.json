After paying $250 she refused to pay more, claiming to have discovered latent defects therein; an action for the balance was discontinued, \u2022and defendant wrote a letter offering to put the furniture in good \u2022order on the payment of $25, and promising to repair it immediately, and let plaintiff know when it was ready for delivery. It was accordingly delivered to defendant but never returned. The \u2022complaint alleged these facts, and a refusal by defendant to return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>the furniture, and demanded judgment for the amount paid, to wit, $250.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b916-3\">On the trial plaintiff was required to elect whether she would seek to recover for conversion or breach of contract, and elected to maintain the action for conversion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b916-4\">Plaintiff testified that she was never informed by defendant that the furniture was ready for delivery, and that she had demanded its delivery.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyFs\">Although on the claim of conversion there is much immaterial matter in the complaint, yet it contains sufficient to make out a case of trover; and it was upon the morion of appellant\u2019s counsel that plaintiff, under order of the court, elected to proceed upon such theory of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Absolute, unqualified ownership is not necessary in order to authorize a person entitled to the possession of property to sue for its conversion. A person entitled to the temporary possession of chattels for a particular purpose may maintain such an action. Addison on Torts, marginal page 524, and cases cited in note. In the case at bar there is probably enough evidence to support a finding that all title or interest of plaintiff\u2019s brother in the suite of furniture had been transferred to her before the commencement of this action. It certainly appears that, as between her and defendant, plaintiff was entitled to the exclusive possession and control thereof. Defendant acknowledges and ratifies plaintiff\u2019s right to the custody and disposal of the same by his letter of July 21, 1886, in pursuance of which he received the property. Whatever may have been the former ownership of the furniture, or the former relations of the parties, the present cause of action arises because defendant obtained the furniture from plaintiff under a promise to return it to her after making repairs, and that he now refuses so to return it, though demand has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">There is sufficient evidence of a demand, and the jury evidently believed plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and by their verdict established that the furniture was not put into good condition according to the contract. Therefore, after waiting a reasonable time for such repairs to be made, plaintiff was not bound, as a condition precedent to making a demand, to tender the money which would have been due if defendant had performed his agreement. Indeed, according to plaintiff\u2019s evidence, which the jury accepted as true, defendant positively refused to \u201cput it in any better order than it was then in,\u201d which she avers was anything but \u201c good order.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Nor was it error to admit plaintiff\u2019s own testimony as to the value of second-hand furniture. She alleged that she had attended many sales of such articles, and had herself bought' and sold furniture at second-hand sales. This was sufficient to qual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>ify her to express an opinion on this question, although she had never been regularly in the furniture business.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-3\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Daly and Bischoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
