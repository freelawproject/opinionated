In fact, the defendant, Blake, said that the complaints referred to were not of the March shipments, but of the same number, they were \u25a0 not complaints of that particular yarn in the custom house which was then intact and in bulk. Nor was the defense that the defendants sought to prove on the trial admissible under the general denial. It was an affirmative defense and related to something that had taken place after plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action had accrued, and should have been pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The evidence excluded did not tend to controvert the material affirmative allegation of the complaint, which was the allegation of sale and delivery. The ruling was in harmony with the decisions of the court of appeals in the cases cited by counsel for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In the case of <em>Hier </em>v. Grant, 47 N. Y., 278, which was also an action for goods sold and delivered, the defendants were allowed under a general denial to show that they had not purchased the goods by showing that the person who purchased the goods was not at the time of the purchase the agent of the defendants. In that action it was claimed by the plaintiff that the goods were purchased by a person who was acting as agent of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In the case of <em>Schwarz </em>v. <em>Oppold, </em>74 N. Y., 307, the defendants were allowed to show that they had not made the note in suit, by showing that the words \u201c with interest \u201d had been added to the note after it was signed by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">This is not an affirmative defense like the one which the defendants sought to prove on the trial of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Sedgwick, Oh.
