L. Whitney, who was a general agent of the defendant for the city of Brooklyn and its vicinity. Testimony was introduced on behalf of the plaintiff, which the jury evidently believed, to the effect that on or about the 9th day of August, 1887, plaintiff took the policy back to said agent and informed him that he was about to remove the property covered by the policy to another place of residence, and at the same time requested the agent to procure the consent of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>pany in due form to such removal or the waiver of any forfeiture that might be incurred thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-3\">It is further alleged on behalf of plaintiff that the agent thereafter returned the policy to plaintiff, informing him that all proper formalities had been complied with and that the policy would still cover the property in the new location. During August and September, 1887, the furniture and other goods were removed, according to the notice that plaintiff said he gave, to his new dwelling at Bay Side, Long Island, where they remained until the 31st of January, 1888, when they were destroyed by fire. The policy in question contains the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-4\">\u201c This policy is made and accepted subject to the foregoing stipuulations and conditions, together with such other provisions, agreements, or conditions as may be endorsed hereon or added hereto, and no officer, agent or other representative of this company shall have power to waive any provision or condition of this policy, except such as by the terms of this policy may be the subject of agreement endorsed hereon or added hereto, and as to such provisions and conditions no officer, agent or representative shall have such power, or be deemed or held to have waived such provisions or conditions, unless such waiver, if any, shall be written upon or attached hereto, nor shall any privilege or permission affecting the insurance under this policy exist or be claimed by the insured unless so written or attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">No endorsement upon the policy or other writing of any kind was ever made after the notice of removal of the goods, but plaintiff relies entirely for a waiver of any forfeiture that might have been occasioned thereby upon the oral transactions between him and defendant\u2019s said agent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-6\"><em>John Notman, </em>for app\u2019lt; <em>G. A. Clement, </em>for resp\u2019t.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b602-7\">Larremore, Oh. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abpv\">It is immaterial what our own views might have been upon the main question, if it had arisen here for the first time, because we think we must decide it on clear and unmistakable authority. We can discover no distinction in principle between the case at bar and <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Insurance Company, </em>73 N. Y., 5. In that case it was expressly provided in the policy that no officer, agent or representative of the company should be held to have waived any of the terms and conditions of the policy, unless such waiver was endorsed thereon in writing. The court of appeals held that this was a plain limitation upon the power of agents, and could mean \u201c nothing less than that agents shall not have this power to waive conditions except in one mode, viz.: by endorsement on the policy.\u201d The provision on that subject in the policy before us is, if anything, more explicit in its terms than the one under consideration in <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Harford Company, </em>and all the reasons therein given for holding the plaintiff bound by such condition apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The fact has not been overlooked that several later cases in the court of appeals have been distinguished from <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Hartford Company, supra; </em>but the reason for such distinction was, that in such later cases the power and authority of the agent was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>specially defined and limited, as they are in the case at bar. The ground taken is, that as the company itself could dispense with a condition by oral consent as well as by writing, the general agent could do the same unless specially restricted. <em>Steen </em>v. <em>Niagara Fire Ins. Co., </em>89 N. Y., 816. But obviously the reason for such distinction does not exist in the case before us. The agent\u2019s authority is restricted, if anything, more closely than in <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Hartford Company, </em>and we regard this case as controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\">We think the learned trial judge also erred in holding under this particular policy that a waiver could be inferred by the reference of the matter after the fire to the adjuster for investigation and appraisal. It is well settled that if after knowledge of any alleged forfeiture the company \u201c recognizes the continued validity of the policy, or does acts based thereon, or requires the insured by virtue thereof to do some act or incur some trouble or expense, the forfeiture is as matter of law waived.\u201d <em>Titus </em>v. <em>Glens Falls Insurance Co., </em>81 N. Y., 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">: But this doctrine of implied waiver cannot be invoked where, as in the policy under consideration here, there is an express provision that the company may cause investigation and appraisal to be made without being deemed to have waived any forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted, and the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Daly and Bischoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
