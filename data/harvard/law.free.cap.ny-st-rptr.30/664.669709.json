J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8b\">The only point urged on behalf of the appellants which we feel called upon to consider is based upon the testimony of the witness Ten Eyck. His evidence was so short that it may be quoted entire :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-14\">\u201cQ. What is your business? A. Carriage furnishing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-15\">\u201c Q. How long have you been in that business ? A. Eighteen years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-16\">\u201c Q. Do you know Mr. Burroughs ? A. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-17\">\u201c Q. Had business dealings with him ? A. I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-18\">\u201c Q. What is Mr. Burroughs\u2019 reputation for truth and veracity ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-19\">\u201c Objected to; objection sustained ; exception taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-20\">11Q. Would you believe Mr. Burroughs under oath ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-21\">\u201cObjected to; objection sustained; exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-22\">The general term of the city court held that there was no error in excluding the above questions because no proper foundation had been laid for their admission. The general American principles governing the impeachment of witnesses are well stated in a note to Chase\u2019s edition of Stephens\u2019 Digest of the Law of Evidence, article 133, page 232, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b726-23\">\u201c It is a well-settled rule in this country that a witness of the adverse party may be impeached by evidence from other persons of his bad general reputation in his own community. The impeaching witnesses must come from this community, and in examining any one of them the form of inquiry usually is to ask (1) 'whether he knows the general reputation in that community of the witness in question; then if he assents, (2) what that reputation is, and (3) whether from such knowledge he would believe such witness \u00f3n his oath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-24\">It has been held that it is discretionary with a trial court whether the first of such questions, as to whether the impeaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>witness knows the general reputation of the other, must be asked. <em>Wetherbee </em>v. Norris, 103 Mass., 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\">\u25a0 If it be discretionary whether such preliminary inquiry shall be put, it must also be discretionary with the judge, when the same has not been asked, to exclude the subsequent questions touching a person\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity and as to whether he is entitled to belief under oath. There is nothing to show that the trial judge did not exclude the evidence because in the exercise of his discretion he deemed the preliminary general inquiry essential. We will not presume error necessitating a reversal when a perfectly fair construction of the record discloses a theory upon which the judge may have acted with propriety and within his province.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The presumption that the judge\u2019s reason for excluding the evidence was that a proper foundation had not been laid is strengthened by analysis of what Ten Eyck actually had said. He averred that he had been in the carriage furnishing business for eighteen years; that he knew Mr. Burroughs and had had business dealings with him. These facts might have been true, though the two men resided in different communities widely remote from each other and conducted their business transactions by correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Nothing was drawn out which shows even by implication that Ten Eyck was acquainted with Burroughs\u2019 general moral character or his reputation for truth and veracity. We will not presume, for the sake of reversing this judgment, in the absence of any suggestions to such effect in the case, that Ten Eyck resided and did business in New York (even the residence of this witness was not asked in his examination,) and that if he had been allowed to testify as to Burroughs\u2019 reputation he would have done so from competent and sufficient knowledge. Our conclusion is that upon the record as it stood when the interrogatories were put to Ten Eyck, no error was committed in ruling them out</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Bischoff, J., concurs</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b727-8\">Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acj\">In concurring witn me chief justice that the judgment must be affirmed, I wish to say that I can find no error in the exclusion of evidence, (as claimed in appellants\u2019 first point,) of custom in regard to the storage of defendant\u2019s carriage after repairs upon it by plaintiffs were completed. The record does not show any ruling adverse to appellant upon this point The defendant\u2019s objection to the evidence was overruled. The appellants claim that this was a \u201c typographical error,\u201d and that the ruling was actually the other way, and that an exception was taken by them. Nothing of the kind appears in the papers before us, and an examination of the case would seem to show that it is correct as it stands. There is an answer to the question which was objected to, and this could not be so if the objection to it had been sustained. It also appears that the plaintiffs did not rely upon custom for their charge of storage, but upon special contract. .Mr. Healey says, \u201c There must have been a special contract.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>was also permitted, to testify what plaintiffs\u2019 custom was: that plaintiffs always charged storage. But I think the whole contention may be disposed of by the fact that, according to plaintiffs, storage was only to be charged after the customer was notified that the repairs were completed; and that was not done in this case. A notice was sent the day after the carriage was received for repairs, but none after the repairs were completed. No authority is cited by the appellant for the proposition that, as defendant had paid a previous bill for repairs, she could not counterclaim damages for unskillful or negligent work in making such repairs, nor for the proposition that the payment of such bill by the defendant and the recovery of a judgment for a subsequent bill by plaintiffs is conclusive as to all matters connected with the first bill, the same as if plaintiffs had recovered a judgment therefor; and there seems to be no foundation for either proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
