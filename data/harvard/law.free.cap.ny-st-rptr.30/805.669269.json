The court thereafter made a statement, whereupon witnesses were called for the plaintiff in rebuttal. Nothing appearing in the case to the contrary, it is fair to presume that the defendant had rested when the motion was made and that the motion was for such a verdict as the parties had provided for by their stipulation theretofore made. The exception is therefore available. It seems to have been well taken, for no evidence appears in the case from which the jury could infer that the endorsement upon the Thompson note was unauthorized. The evidence would sustain a finding that the endorsement was not shown to have been authorized, but this is not enough. The burden was upon the defendant, having assailed the validity of the assignment, to show the endorsement unauthorized. It is claimed by appellant that Buchman's evidence was sufficient to warrant an inference that he was unauthorized to make the endorsement, and particular reliance seems to be placed on the fact that Buchman stated to Nathan in response to the latter\u2019s request for the firm endorsement that \u201cit could easily be done; no doubt of it,\u201d and after this sent the note to Nathan without the firm endorsement, and only after pressure endorsed the note as appears in evidence. Whether this evidence would be sufficient to permit an inference that there was a lack of general authority it is unnecessary to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>termine. It would certainly not warrant an inference that Buchman had not obtained special authority to act as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-2\">Buchman\u2019s statement that he would not be sure that Rosenthal was present, but thought he was, on the occasion when he claims to have been specially authorized to endorse the note, falls short of evidence warranting an inference that Rosenthal was not present. The rule that the burden of proof is upon the attacking creditor to show the invalidity of the assignment, is applicable in this case as in <em>Bernheimer </em>v. <em>Rindskopf. </em>That in the one case the creditor is a plaintiff, and in the other a defendant, does not affect the applicability of the rule. The defense in this action is an affirmative one. The appellant\u2019s counsel makes a point as follows: \u201c The plaintiff, by not insisting, and standing thereon, that there was no evidence which would justify the submission of the case to the jury, is now estopped from claiming that there was no evidence to justify the finding,\u201d and refers to sev-' eral cases as authority. None of these support his proposition. No estoppel arises under such circumstances. After plaintiff\u2019s exception to the denial of his motion for a verdict he did not deprive himself of the benefit of his exception by endeavoring to have his case presented to the jury most favorably for his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Truax, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
