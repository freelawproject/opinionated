The endorsers claimed that they were discharged from liability on account of said alleged forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-16\">It is a well settled legal principle that an endorser impliedly warrants that the instrument is not forged; and if it is he is liable upon this warranty; he cannot question the signature of the maker, or previous endorser, or take advantage of the fact that the signatures of the maker or previous endorser were forged. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Keller, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>66 N.
