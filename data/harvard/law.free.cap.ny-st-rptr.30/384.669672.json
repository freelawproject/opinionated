The amended complaint properly rebuts the presumption arising from the form of the obligation, by alleging that the note was endorsed by Wilson to pay for property sold and delivered by the plaintiffs to Middlebrook, the maker, on the credit of such endorsement, and that Wilson endorsed the note for the purpose of securing such credit with the plaintiffs. Middlebrook, the maker, was called by the plaintiffs as a witness at the trial, and upon his cross-examination by the defendant\u2019s counsel the following questions were put and rulings made:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">At the time Mr. Wilson endorsed this note, was there anything at all said about his position on that note ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\">Objected to; objection sustained; exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-10\">Q.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHLO\">When Wilson endorsed the note, he had the right to assume from its form that Wyckoff &amp; Co., the payees (plaintiffs), were to become first endorsers and he (Wilson) the second endorser. He also had the right to suppose and act upon the belief that if Middlebrook did not pay the note, and he (Wilson) was obliged to pay it, that he would have a remedy over, not only against Middlebrook, the maker, but Wyckoff Bros., the payees (plaintiffs) and first endorsers. The form of the obligation is not conclusive, however, and the parties thereto are entitled to show their true relations to it. Upon this just principle the payee, as first endorser of a negotiable instrument, may recover from the second on proof that the latter endorsed to accommodate the maker for the benefit of the payee. Story on Prom. N., \u00a7 151; 15 Q. B., 589; 6 C. B., 486; 12 Wis., 639. The purpose of such proof is to negative the legal presumption arising from the form of the instrument that the truth may pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>vail and justice be done. To overcome the legal presumption, however, it is necessary to show that the defendant knew when he endorsed the note that it was to be used by the maker to obtain credit with the plaintiffs (the payees), and that although apparently the second endorser, he intended to become and was, in truth, the first, and as such liable thereon to the payees (plaintiffs) in case Middlebrook, the maker, failed to pay at maturity. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Tyng, </em>1 City Ct. R., 309 ; <em>MacTeague </em>v. James, 2 id., 52 <em>; Moore </em>v. <em>Cross, 19 </em>N. Y., 227; <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>37 id., 614; <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Vischer, </em>50 id., 69; <em>Coulter </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>59 id., 478; <em>Jaffray </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>74 id., 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\">In this view the questions put to Middlebrook were proper, and should not have been excluded by the trial judge. The answers might have shown that the defendant did not know he was . expected to become the first endorser on the note, and did not intend to assume that responsibility, but acted on the form of the obligation which authorized him to assume that he was to become what the form implied, to wit: the second endorser, with a remedy over against the plaintiffs as payees in case he was obliged to pay the note in default of payment by those primarily liable. For this error the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. Ehrlich, J., concurs._</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
