Turning to the section of the Code which regulates appeals from judgments rendered in the district court, it is found that this court has power to reverse, affirm or modify the judgment appealed from and where a judgment is reversed, to order a new trial. Code, \u00a7 3213.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">These sections read together seem to give us the power to order a new trial in the summary proceeding. Appeals in such proceedings are taken with the \u201c like effect \u201d as appeals from judgments. With like effect means with like result; and this includes any disposition in the one case which the appellate court could make in the other. In the case of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>1 Civ. Pro., 298, <em>note, </em>I held that the provisions of the Code that an appeal from the district courts should be taken \u201cin the manner\u201d prescribed. for appeals from justice of the peace authorized the same disposition of the former appeal which could be made of the latter; that the \u201c manner of taking \u201d includes the manner of disposing, when there is no other provision as to how the appeal shall be heard and determined, or as to the award of costs thereon. See \u00a7\u00a7 3213, 3060 and 3067 as they existed in May, 1881, the date of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">It is contended, however, by the appellant that \u00a7\u00a7 2260 and 3213 should not be read together, for the reason that \u00a7 3213 was amended in 1883 by the addition of the clause giving power to order new trials; that prior to that date this court could only reverse, modify or affirm the judgments of the district courts, and such effect and no other was intended by the legislature in enacting in 1879 \u00a7 2260 assimilating the practice on appeals from final orders in summary proceedings to appeals from judgments. This contention is, however, directly opposed to the well settled rule of interpretation that \u201c all acts on the same subject whenever passed are what is termed <em>in pari materia, </em>are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>construed as if constituting one act, and are to be so interpreted that all of them and all their clauses may be operative. 1 Edm. Stat. at L., 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-2\">It is also suggested that as the Code, \u00a7 2263, provides for restitution in case of reversals in summary proceedings, that this excludes the power to make any other disposition if the order be reversed. If this section contained an enactment respecting the powers of the appellate court over the appeal, we should probably be compelled to hold it to be exclusive and to negative the claim of any power not expressly conferred; but the section evidently refers to the power of ordering restitution only; a power which is merely collateral to the disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\">A new trial was ordered in this case, and that decision should not be disturbed. As to the application for restitution, I think it should be denied, under the circumstances of the case, with leave to renew in case the landlord fails to proceed with diligence in procuring the new trial to be had. There should be no costs of this reargument, as the question is a new one.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Larremore, Oh. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
