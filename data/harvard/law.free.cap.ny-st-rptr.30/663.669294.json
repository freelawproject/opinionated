J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABR\">These actions were brought to recover possession of certain personal property. Defendant\u2019s contention on the trial was that one Edward J. Tyler, who took possession of the property under a bill of sale, was not a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value; that a chattel mortgage previously given upon the property was a valid lien on the same. The mortgage was filed but not renewed, and therefore as against <em>bona fide </em>purchasers or creditors was clearly invalid. The question of the <em>bona fides </em>of the transaction was passed upon by the court below, and as there was some evidence to sustain such finding, I do not think the judgment should be disturbed, but should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"A4t\">Bischoff, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
