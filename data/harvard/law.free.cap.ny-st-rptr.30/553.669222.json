Y. Civ. Pro., 126; <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Comley, </em>11 Daly, 318; and the court of appeals will not entertain an appeal from an order of the last named courts granting or refusing a new trial. <em>Donley </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>48 N. Y., 658; <em>Smith, receiver, </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>96 id., 635, and cases cited.
