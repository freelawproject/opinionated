Mclntire was arrested, and thereafter such proceedings were had in the action that Mclntire recovered judgment against the plaintiff therein for $46.98 costs. The present action is on the undertaking to recover $250 damages. The defendant, Wiegand (one of the sureties), defends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>First. </em>By denying any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief whether he or the other surety executed the undertaking.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-3\"><em>Fourth. </em>By alleging that the undertaking was signed by him ignorantly, under a misrepresentation by Pauline Wilkins of its contents; that the affidavit appended to it was not sworn to and the undertaking never acknowledged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-4\"><em>Fifth. </em>By alleging that the judgment recovered was brought about by an amicable arrangement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">These three paragraphs present the questions requiring consideration.

These paragraphs can be construed in no other way. While inconsistent defenses are allowed to be pleaded, courts have never gone to the extent of holding that a defendant may plead: First, that he never executed the instrument sued upon; second, that he did execute it, but by means of fraud. No one could safely swear to such a plea, and no court could sanction a practice which encourages parties to take such a risk. We therefore regard the denial in the first paragraph of the answer as controlled by the admission in the fourth paragraph thereof. It would certainly be so regarded at the trial. The fourth paragraph fails to set forth any legal defense. No fraud is attributed to the plaintiff herein, and he is not chargeable with the acts of others not in privity with him. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Christal, </em>16 Hun, 242; <em>Coleman </em>v. Bean, 1 Abb. Ct. of App. Dec., 394; <em>Onderdonk </em>v. <em>Voorhis, </em>36 N. Y., 358; <em>George </em>v. <em>Bischoff, </em>68 Ill., 236; <em>Wayman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>1 Dana, 527; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Wilkin, </em>69 N. Y., 412. Whether the undertaking was acknowledged or jurat sworn to is of no consequence in this action, as the omission of both would have constituted but a mere irregularity in the original action that might have been waived by the parties thereto. The fifth paragraph pleads no defense. Whether the judgment recovered was the result of a trial, default or amicable arrangement is of no consequence. The judgment fixed the rights of the parties, and if there was any collusion the sureties should have applied for relief in the original action. The arbitrary use by the defendant of the term \u201c amicable,\u201d in reference to the judgment, does not detract from its force or impair its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">There is no merit in the appeal, and the order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">McAdam, Gh. J., Ehrlich and McGrows\", JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
