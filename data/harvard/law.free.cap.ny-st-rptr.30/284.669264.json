It was first tried in 1885, and plaintiff had a verdict of $500. A new trial was granted by the court of appeals It was-tried again before Judge Dugro and a jury, and plaintiff again had a verdict for $500. He entered judgment three days later for $499 damages against the defendant\u2019s protest, and without any application to, or authority from, the court. On the coming in of the verdict, defendant had moved for a new trial on the ground, among others, that the verdict was excessive, which motion was denied; and plaintiff had moved for and obtained an extra allowance of five per cent, on the verdict. Defendant moved the court-to vacate the judgment on the ground that it was unauthorized and not in accordance with the verdict. Plaintiff thereupon moved at special term for leave to remit one dollar, <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, as of the day before entry of judgment. Defendant\u2019s motion to vacate-was denied and plaintiff\u2019s motion to remit one dollar was granted-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-11\">Appellant contends that the Code distinctly provides that on the rendition of a general verdict judgment must be entered in-conformity thereto, unless a different direction is given by the court; that in any view of the case the application to remit should have been made to the judge who tried the case or to the court at trial term, and not at special term; that assuming that a judge sitting at special term has power, after judgment, to remit a portion of the verdict, <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, that discretion was wrongly exercised here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-12\"><em>H.

Glossom, </em>for pl\u2019ff; <em>Leslie W. </em>Russell, for def\u2019t.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b346-13\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AZy\">The court at special term had discretionary power to make the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">The court last referred to in \u00a7 1189 of the Code of Civil Procedure is the trial court and the court at special term.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">Mo such inference as is claimed by the appellant can fairly be-drawn from the fact of the appearance in the Code of \u00a7\u00a7 8016 and 8176. These provisions were incorporated in the Code in order to make it matter of <em>absolute right </em>for a prevailing party to remit part of a verdict and to render an application to the court unnecessary. In other proper cases the application is addressed to the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>It does not appear that there was an improper exercise of discretion in granting the order. It should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AVDk\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Dugro, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
