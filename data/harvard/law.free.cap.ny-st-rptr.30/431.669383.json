In such case, even if it had actual notice, it would be absolved from the imputation of negligence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-10\">Motion for reargument of appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-11\"><em>Louis J. </em>Grant, for resp\u2019t; <em>Kdw.

No other ground for reargument is assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">A careful examination of the opinion referred to must be convincing that the reversal was directed upon the grounds that a municipal corporation is not chargeable with neglect in permitting its streets to be in a dangerous condition in the absence of proof that there was reasonable time to render such streets safe; that the question whether or not there was such reasonable time is a question of law to be determined by the court; that the uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>tradicted facts in the present case, showing an interval of loss than forty-eight hours between the cessation of the snow-fall and the time of the accident, failed to show that defendant had a reasonable time within which to remove the accumulated ice and snow or otherwise to render the sidewalk in safe condition; that because of the want of such reasonable time the plaintiff had failed to establish negligence on the part of defendant and that it was error for the trial judge to submit the question of defendant\u2019s, negligence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\">This view renders the question of notice of no importance in this case, for if it be conceded that defendant had actual notice of the dangerous accumulation of ice and snow on the sidewalk in question, defendant must nevertheless be held absolved from the imputation of negligence if there was no reasonable opportunity to remove the danger between the time of its first appearance and the happening of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The motion for reargument must be denied, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Larremore, Oh.
