Thereafter, as plaintiff claims, the defendant conspiring with her brother, one Lappart, to cheat and defraud him out of his commission from Blumberg, concealed the fact that she became such purchaser through the efforts and instrumentality \u2018of the plaintiff, and falsely and fraudulently and with intent thereby to deceive him and to induce him to pay such commissions- to Lap-part. Plaintiff further alleges that relying upon such representations Blumberg was induced to pay, and did pay, the amount of such commissions to Lappart, and that thereby such commissions were lost to him, and he seeks in this action to recover the amount of his alleged damage from the defendant. In the court below plaintiff was allowed to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">It is difficult to conceive upon what principle of law the judgment can be sustained. Admitting every fact relied upon by the plaintiff he has utterly failed to show a cause of action, and the complaint should have been dismissed upon defendant\u2019s motion. Blumberg chose, at his own peril, to determine Lappart\u2019s claim to the commissions by payment thereof to him, and it has been re* peatedly held that if a debtor pay the amount of his indebtedness to one of two or more persons asserting opposing claims thereto, the person to whom payment was - made is not liable to the person subsequently proving himself entitled- to payment, for the - amount received. See <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>37 N. Y., 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In <em>Butterworth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>41 N. Y., 450, approving of and following <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>the court of appeals hold it to be a principle well established by authority that \u201c when a defendant has received money due to the plaintiff, but claiming it as his own under circumstances under which he has no authority from the plaintiff, and does not act under any pretense of such authority, and the payment is made in proposed recognition of his title thereto as his own, and does not operate to discharge the payor from his liability to the -plaintiff, then and in such case there is no trust, and no. implied promise to pay the money to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Applying the principle ref erred, to to the facts claimed by the plaintiff, it is apparent that he is not entitled to recovery against Lappart, the actual recipient of the commissions in question, and there is much less ground for holding the defendant. Ho fraud or misrepresentation was practiced, upon the plaintiff. He parted with nothing on the faith of any representations of the defendant, and his right to commissions from Blumberg, at whose request he rendered the services leading to the sale, remains in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>tact, ana is in no wise or manner abridged or affected by payment of-the commissions to Lappart. How then has plaintiff been damaged? If fraud and deceit were intended it was not upon plaintiff, but upon Blumberg, who paid the commissions to Lappart. Blumberg might complain, but clearly not the plaintiff, and fraud without damage does not confer, a right of action. <em>Taylor </em>v. Guest, 58 N. Y., 262, 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\">The judgment appealed from must be reversed, with costs, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Larremore, Ch.
