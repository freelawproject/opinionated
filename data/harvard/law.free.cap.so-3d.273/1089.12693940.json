The trial court denied the motion as successive upon finding that Pounds raised the same ground for relief - newly discovered evidence - in an August 23, 2018 postconviction motion that the lower court denied in a November 1, 2018 order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the State properly and commendably concedes, Pounds did not raise the issue of newly discovered evidence as a ground for relief in his August 23, 2018 postconviction motion. We therefore reverse the order on appeal and remand for further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, on remand, the trial court again determines to summarily deny Pounds's claim, the trial court shall attach record excerpts showing that Pounds is not entitled to relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. App. P. 9.141(b)(2)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We note that, in the order on review, the trial court also\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   (i) ordered Pounds to show cause why he should not be prohibited from filing any further\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings in lower tribunal case number F06-24000B,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (ii) prohibited Pounds from filing any further\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings. Because the trial court failed to follow the procedure required to impose such a prohibition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

If, on remand, the trial court still wishes to preclude Pounds from filing further\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings in the lower court case, the court shall first issue the appropriate notice and provide Pounds with an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    Chambers v.
