On the same date, the Court ordered McGlocklin to show cause why he should not be prohibited from filing further pro se appeals, petitions, motions, or other pleadings in this Court relating to lower tribunal case F00-19296.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon consideration of McGlocklin's response to the order to show cause and the successive, duplicative, pro se petitions and appeals brought by McGlocklin, we conclude that good cause has not been shown. McGlocklin has engaged in the filing of meritless, frivolous, and successive claims, continuing to seek relief from this Court notwithstanding prior adverse determinations on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In accordance with\n   <em>\n    State v. Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455565\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/751/47/\">\n    751 So.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1999), and\n   <em>\n    Concepcion v.

We direct the Clerk of the Third District Court of Appeal to refuse to accept any such papers relating to the circuit court case number unless they have been reviewed and signed by an attorney who is a duly licensed member of The Florida Bar in good standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whipple v.
