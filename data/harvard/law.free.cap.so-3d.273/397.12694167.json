MCKAY III, CHIEF JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff, Erika Mann (\"Ms. Mann\"), seeks review of the trial court's July 16, 2018 judgment, granting a motion for summary judgment in favor of defendant, Evanston\n   Insurance Company (\"Evanston\"), and denying Ms. Mann's cross-motion for partial summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Mann entered into a contract with Tim Clark Construction (\"TCC\") to elevate her home. Work began on the project in the latter part of 2011. Ms. Mann has acknowledged that she noticed damages to her home almost immediately thereafter. TCC obtained a certificate of occupancy and completion on March 12, 2012. However, elevation studies performed at that time allegedly showed that the house was not elevated to proper levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 28, 2012, Ms. Mann notified TCC that it had not completed the project as agreed, that the work was improperly performed, and that the home failed inspection. TCC subsequently performed additional work in an attempt to remedy the issues and repair the damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 22, 2014, Ms. Mann filed a petition for damages alleging that TCC caused physical damages to her home and property, which caused her mental anguish. Ms. Mann later amended her petition to name TCC's various insurers, including Evanston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   TCC had a series of insurers; Evanston insured TCC from March 3, 2014, to March 3, 2015. Evanston's policy contains the commonly-used commercial general liability (CGL) form that includes coverage for bodily injury and property damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Evanston policy is an \"occurrence policy\" requiring that the bodily injury and/or property damage occur during the policy period. In addition, the policy contains a pre-existing injury endorsement, excluding from coverage any damage or loss that occurred prior to the policy period. The policy provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION I - COVERAGES\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    COVERAGE A BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Insuring Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking damages for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any \"occurrence\" and settle any claim or \"suit\" which may result....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   b. This insurance applies to \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" only if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) The \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the \"coverage territory\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) The \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" occurs during the policy period;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The policy defines occurrence as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" The policy also contains the following endorsement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    PRE-EXISTING INJURY, LOSS OR DAMAGE EXCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The coverage under this policy does not apply to \"bodily injury,\" \"property damage,\" \"personal damage,\" \"personal and advertising injury,\" or any injury, loss or damage:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (A) which first occurred, began to occur, or is alleged to have occurred prior to, or is alleged to be in the process of occurring or occurring to any degree, as of the inception date of this policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (B) which is caused by or alleged to have been caused by incremental, continuous or progressive damage arising from an occurrence which first occurred, began to occur, or is alleged to have occurred prior to the inception date of this policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Evanston filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that its policy precluded coverage for Ms. Mann's damages because the alleged damages did not occur during the March 3, 2014 to March 3, 2015 policy period. In support of the motion, Evanston introduced Ms. Mann's deposition wherein she testified that she noticed damages to her home shortly after it was lifted in the fall of 2011. Additionally, Evanston relied on Ms. Mann's amended petition, alleging that TCC's collection efforts, including a lien on the property in 2012, caused her much mental anguish. In sum, Evanston submits that Ms. Mann's property damages and mental anguish began to occur prior to their policy period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Mann opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment against Evanston. The cross-motion asserts that Ms. Mann and her property were repeatedly exposed to harmful conditions created by TCC beginning in 2011 and continuing up through, at the earliest, October 2016, when TCC's expert inspected her home. The majority of Ms. Mann's claims set forth in the cross-motion concern the interpretation of the Evanston policy provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ms. Mann's cross-motion further asserts that Evanston was in bad faith because, in denying coverage, Evanston misrepresented the application of the policy to her damages in violation of La. R.S. 22:1973(B)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . It must be noted that Ms. Mann did not assert a cause of action for bad faith misrepresentation against Evanston in her petition for damages. Fraudulent misrepresentation was only pled against TCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial court initially rendered judgment on September 12, 2017, in favor of Evanston, finding that the pre-existing injury endorsement in the policy was unambiguous and enforceable, and that the policy precluded coverage. Evanston was dismissed with prejudice. With regard to Ms. Mann's cross-motion for partial summary judgment, the trial court granted some of the requests for relief, denied others, and deferred some, presumably until trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ms. Mann appealed the September 12, 2017 judgment, which this Court vacated and remanded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mann v. Tim Clark Constr. LLC,\n   </em>\n   2017-0983, (La.

In our opinion rendered on Ms. Mann's first appeal, we stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   As noted by Mann, the district court's judgment is patently inconsistent. While it dismissed\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   of Mann's claims against Evanston with prejudice, it granted certain items of relief in Mann's favor under the Evanston policy. Evanston cannot be dismissed with prejudice while some of Mann's claims against it are retained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   This court cannot determine if the district court intended to grant partial summary judgment in Evanston's favor with regard to the pre-existing endorsement alone or dismiss all of Mann's claims against it. That the district court intended to grant a partial summary judgment in Evanston's favor is the only way to reconcile the inconsistencies in the judgment before us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12673955\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/248/504/\">\n    248 So.3d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Considering the inconsistencies identified in the trial court's ruling, we vacated the September 12, 2017 judgment and remanded for clarification. On remand, the matter was brought before the court on June 29, 2018, pursuant to Evanston's motion to clarify and amend the September 12, 2017 judgment to dismiss all of Ms. Mann's cross-claims. Ms. Mann filed an opposition to Evanston's proposed amended judgment, arguing that she be allowed to litigate her bad faith claims against Evanston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Judgment was rendered on July 16, 2018, granting summary judgment in Evanston's favor and dismissing all of Ms. Mann's claims against Evanston with prejudice. It was further decreed that Ms. Mann's cross-motion for partial summary judgment filed against Evanston was denied in its entirety. Ms. Mann's appeal of the July 16, 2018 judgment is now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Appellate courts apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review in considering lower court rulings on summary judgment motions.\n   <em>\n    Arceneaux v.

Thus, we use the same criteria that govern the district court's consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate. \"[A] motion for summary judgment shall be granted if the motion, memorandum, and supporting documents show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" La.

Ms. Mann asserts that her property damage and mental anguish did not result solely from TCC's initial act of lifting her home. Rather, Ms. Mann submits that she sustained ongoing and progressive property damage and mental anguish as a result of both TCC's failure to perform the contract in good faith and the ongoing collections efforts. Thus, pursuant to the exposure theory, she argues that her damages continued to occur during the subsequent policy periods, including the Evanston policy. We find no merit in this assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Discussing the two prevailing theories relating to the occurrence of property damage under contractual language in insurance cases, the Supreme Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Cases interpreting whether an \"occurrence\" occurs during a policy period of insurance coverage have considered both the exposure theory and the manifestation theory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Under the exposure theory, damage would be considered to have occurred when the act which resulted in the damage took place, not when the damage was discovered. Thus, where damage develops over a period of time from continuous or repeated exposure to injurious conditions, courts have determined that the occurrence took place either at the inception of the exposure period or continuously during the entire course of exposure,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     as in asbestos cases\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Even where the damage or injury was not manifested until after an insurer's policy period, if the insurer's policy period fell either at the inception or during the course of exposure, the insurer would be liable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Under the manifestation theory, property damage would be considered to have occurred when it became manifest, regardless of when the act from which it resulted occurred.\n   <em>\n    Oxner v.

It provides no coverage for damages that first occurred or began to occur prior to the policy's inception date. We find no ambiguity in that language, nor do we find that the exclusion conflicts with any other provision of the policy. Ms. Mann argues that the policy is ambiguous because the exclusion is inconsistent with the policy's declaration page, which provides no retroactive date. Evanston counters, asserting that there is no retroactive date listed because the policy declarations make clear that the policy is an \"occurrence policy,\" providing coverage only for occurrences which happen during the policy period. We agree with Evanston's assertion and reiterate our finding that the policy is clear and unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, Ms. Mann asserts that the exclusion violates public policy by trying to circumvent\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   . However, Ms. Mann has provided no authority for her position that the Evanston policy is against public policy, nor do we find anything in the exclusion that violates the public policy of Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit in Ms. Mann's first two assignments of error. Pursuant to the manifestation theory, which we submit is proper here, the Evanston policy does not provide coverage for the property damage and emotional distress that manifested prior to the policy period. As stated above, Ms. Mann acknowledged that the property damages and mental anguish began to occur in 2011 and 2012, which pre-dated the March 3, 2014 inception date of the Evanston policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No. 3 : Failure to recognize that the Evanston policy provided coverage for Ms. Mann's malicious prosecution claim.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Ms. Mann submits that two acts of malicious prosecution occurred\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the Evanston policy period: 1) an April 17, 2014 collection letter from TCC, demanding amounts due under the contract; and 2) TCC's December 4, 2014 reconventional demand alleging amounts due by Ms. Mann under the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Ms. Mann asserts that these acts of malicious prosecution were covered under \"Coverage B\" of the Evanston policy and were separate and distinct insurable offenses, which should not have been excluded by the pre-existing injury exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Coverage B provides coverage for \"those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'personal and advertising injury' to which this insurance applies.\" The policy's definition of \"personal and advertising injury\" includes malicious prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Evanston counters, arguing that the 2014 collection letter and reconventional demand were simply a continuation of TCC's attempts to collect a debt allegedly owed by Ms. Mann. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The record confirms that TCC began its collection efforts prior to the Evanston policy period. Moreover, Ms. Mann acknowledged in her cross-claim that she suffered mental anguish from the 2012 collection letter and lien. As with the property damage claims discussed above, the pre-existing injury exclusion, which applies to the entire policy, also precludes coverage for the continuation of Ms. Mann's mental anguish that began to occur prior to the Evanston policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We also note from our review of the record that Ms. Mann never pled malicious prosecution in her petition for damages and never raised the claim in her cross-motion for partial summary judgment. For these reasons, we find that the trial court did not err in failing to recognize Ms. Mann's malicious prosecution claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No. 4: Failure to state whether Ms. Mann's bad faith claims were dismissed.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In her final assignment of error, Ms. Mann alleges that the trial court erred in failing to make clear that it was not dismissing her bad faith claims. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The July 16, 2018 judgment states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in Evanston's favor, dismissing all of Plaintiff's claims against Evanston, with prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff Erika Mann's Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In ruling from the bench, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   When considering Ms. Mann's bad faith claims, the Court agrees with Evanston that the Court could not consider any bad faith claims against Evanston because no such claims were pled by Ms. Mann in her petition. [citing La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(1) ]. Since Ms. Mann did not pray for bad faith against Evanston in her petitions, said claims, including the deferred ones, are not properly before the Court for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It is clear from a review of the pleadings that Ms. Mann failed to allege any bad faith claims against Evanston. Pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(1), \"[a] party may move for a summary judgment for all or part of the relief for which he has prayed.\" The trial court correctly denied summary judgment on Ms. Mann's bad faith claims, which were alleged for the first time in her cross-motion for partial summary judgment. Moreover, contrary to Ms. Mann's assertions, the record reflects that the trial court denied Ms. Mann's cross-motion for partial summary judgment in its entirety and declined to consider the bad faith\n   claims because they were never pled. The trial court's judgment is clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit in any of Ms. Mann's assignments of error. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment granting summary judgment in favor of Evanston and in denying Ms. Mann's cross-motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    La.
