Acevedo, appeals his conviction of possession of over 400 grams of cocaine in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(F). For the following reasons, we affirm defendant's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At trial, Detective Allan Doubleday of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office (\"JPSO\") testified that in June of 2017, he received information from an informant that a suspect driving a Nissan Titan truck was transporting drugs from Texas to Jefferson Parish and that the suspect was storing drugs at a storage unit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Doubleday used the automated license plate reader (\"ALPR\") system, which takes photographs of license plates as vehicles pass by cameras throughout the state, to track the suspect's vehicle. JPSO Sergeant Joshua Collins monitored the ALPR cameras and advised Detective Doubleday that they had captured the suspect's vehicle traveling to Texas on many occasions. After learning on June 19, 2017 that the suspect's vehicle was traveling towards Texas, Detective Doubleday and other officers went to the Texas/Louisiana border to wait for the suspect's vehicle to return to Louisiana. Detective Doubleday eventually spotted the vehicle and followed it. He and the other officers kept in contact with other detectives who were positioned on I-10 at various locations on the entire route from Texas to Jefferson Parish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Detective Doubleday testified that Sergeant Collins applied for and obtained a search warrant for the subject vehicle. Detective\n   Doubleday was present for the stop of the vehicle, but Deputy C. Marshall and Detective N. Obiol, who were in a marked unit, stopped the suspect's vehicle in order to execute the search warrant. Detective Doubleday observed two occupants in the vehicle who were later identified as defendant, the passenger, and Mr. Pedro Villareal, the driver. He separated them, advised them of their rights, and spoke to them. Detective Doubleday said that each of them gave a different explanation as to why they had been in Texas and were traveling back to Louisiana the same day. Defendant told him that they had been in Texas for several days attending vehicle auctions. However, Detective Doubleday knew from the surveillance that they had left Louisiana and returned that same day. He spoke to defendant and Mr. Villareal in English and said that defendant fully understood him in English. Detective Doubleday testified that he also speaks Spanish and could have communicated with defendant in Spanish if such had been necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Detective Doubleday testified that they brought the vehicle to Louisiana State Police Troop B at Loyola and Williams Boulevards in Kenner. Prior to the search of the vehicle, a K-9 dog walked around the vehicle. The dog alerted or sensed that there were narcotics throughout the vehicle and specifically underneath it. After searching that area, deputies retrieved a magnetic hideaway key box from underneath the truck. Inside the box they found a plastic bag containing a white powdered substance that tested positive for cocaine. Detective Doubleday advised defendant of his rights a second time. Defendant was later transported to the detective bureau where Detective Doubleday advised defendant of his rights a third time. While questioning defendant, he admitted that the cocaine belonged to him and that Mr. Villareal had no knowledge of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Detective Doubleday testified that they searched the interior of the vehicle and found a wallet in the center console. Inside that wallet were a Florida ID with the name of \"Marvin Santiago Acevedo\" on it, a CubeSmart storage key, a CubeSmart access card with a storage unit number (409) and a PIN on it, and a bag of cocaine. Detective Doubleday stated that he found four cell phones in the vehicle, three of which belonged to defendant and one of which belonged to Mr. Villareal. Detective Doubleday also recovered $ 3,359 in currency from the vehicle. Mr. Villareal was released because the evidence did not link him to the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Detective Doubleday testified that Sergeant Collins subsequently obtained a second search warrant for the vehicle. During the second search, they found another cell phone. On June 6, 2018, detectives applied for and obtained search warrants for the contents of the four cell phones belonging to defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Detective Doubleday testified that CubeSmart had two locations on Belle Chasse Highway. They went to both locations because they weren't sure which one pertained to defendant. At the first location, they tried to access the site, but because the PIN produced an error message, they went to the other CubeSmart located nearby. When they used the PIN to access the gate at the other CubeSmart location, they received a message to return during certain business hours, which told them that they were in the right location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Detective Doubleday testified that Sergeant Collins prepared a search warrant for the subject storage unit number 409;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   however, he mistakenly put the address of the first storage facility they visited (2321 Belle Chasse Highway) and not the correct one that they visited afterwards (2012 Belle Chasse Highway). They ultimately obtained a search warrant, after which they used the key from the wallet and entered storage unit number 409. Detective Doubleday testified that they found a cooler containing four compressed wrapped bricks. The bricks, each weighing one kilo, tested positive for cocaine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also found paperwork in the cooler, including documents from a BP oil spill lawsuit, an Entergy bill with the name \"Marvin Santiago\" on it, and a pay stub with the name \"Marvin Santiago Acevedo\" on it. A work shirt with defendant's name and his employer's name on it was also found in the unit. Nothing else in the storage unit, whether paperwork or other items, contained any other name on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Detective Doubleday testified that Sergeant Collins obtained a search warrant for leasing and access documents and surveillance video from the storage facility, after which Sergeant Collins met with Christina Collins, the manager of that storage facility, the next day. The leasing documents showed that defendant rented storage unit number 409 from February 27, 2017 until June 19, 2017. The records indicated that the storage unit was accessed sixteen times, but that he only saw defendant two times on the video.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Video surveillance showed defendant arriving in a Nissan Titan, exiting his vehicle, and entering the office of CubeSmart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wilmer Cerna was the registered owner of the Nissan Titan. Detective Doubleday testified that defendant and Mr. Cerna were associates, and that no other part of the investigation involved Mr. Cerna. Finally, Detective Doubleday maintained that he did not find a prior conviction for defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sergeant Collins also testified at trial, his testimony largely corroborating that of Detective Doubleday. Additionally, Sergeant Collins testified that in his experience of working many narcotics investigations, it was a common practice for individuals to store illegal drugs in storage facilities so that they did not have to keep contraband in their vehicles or houses. More likely than not, in his experience, those individuals would store their narcotics in a facility in the vicinity that was being used within their enterprise. Sergeant Collins maintained that they had prior knowledge from the informant that there was a storage facility close to defendant's residence. The residence associated with defendant was somewhere on the Westbank near \"Lafayette Boulevard\" or Belle Chasse Highway. Sergeant Collins explained that they started from the closest storage facility and worked their way in an outward perimeter\n   until they ultimately found the correct one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Regarding the four cell phones that were found, Sergeant Collins stated that it was common among drug dealers to obtain and change cell phones and numbers so that they cannot be tracked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court accepted Sandy Lee, forensic drug chemist at the JPSO Crime Lab, as an expert in the field of the analysis of controlled dangerous substances, who examined evidence in the instant case. Ms. Lee testified that her specimen 001 (State's Exhibit 2) was a sealed plastic bag containing a magnetic key box containing one clear plastic bag with a white powdered substance inside. Specimen 003 (State's Exhibit 6) was a sealed plastic bag containing one clear plastic bag with a white powdered substance inside. Specimen 013 was a sealed paper bag containing four individually wrapped packages each containing a compressed, white powdered substance. Ms. Lee testified that the material in all three specimens was found to contain cocaine. The gross weight of specimen 001 was twelve grams, the gross weight of specimen three was under one gram, and the net weight of specimen 013 was 3,962 grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kortnie Sinon, a latent print examiner at the JPSO Crime Lab, was accepted as an expert in the field of latent print processing and comparison. Ms. Sinon testified that she processed four individual blocks of compressed, white powder wrapped in tape and that she found three fingerprints. She was able to enter two of those fingerprints into her database, but she was not able to make any identification on either print. She compared the three fingerprints to defendant, but the results were inconclusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Marcela Zozaya, a forensic DNA analyst for the JPSO, was accepted as an expert in the field of forensic DNA analysis. Dr. Zozaya testified that she analyzed swabs taken from the kilos of cocaine in the instant case and that there was an insufficient amount of DNA for testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ms. Christine Collins testified that she was the general manager at the CubeSmart located at 2012 Belle Chasse Highway and that she handled leasing documents. She produced leasing documents pertaining to unit number 409 for defendant in response to the search warrant. She stated that the rental date was February 27, 2017. Ms. Collins produced videos in response to a subpoena for video surveillance. She met with the detective and reviewed those videos. Ms. Collins saw the truck on the video that the detective said belonged to defendant; however, she did not know defendant or what he looked like. She did not know if the detective was able to retrieve the video, but she asserted that the detective had difficulty downloading it. Ms. Collins testified that if an access code is used after 10:00 p.m., the machine will continue to beep, and the paperwork will say, \"[s]ee the manager.\" She believed that if the access code was entered at the other location on Belle Chasse Highway, it would say the same thing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Agent Bryan Huesman testified that he was employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") in the Homeland Security Department. In June of 2017, he was contacted by Detective Doubleday who told him that he had arrested a man named \"Marvin Acevedo\" and that this individual had identification cards, Entergy payments, and BP settlements in that name. He attempted to verify if defendant was the real \"Marvin Acevedo.\" Agent Huesman conducted computer checks and spoke with officials in Puerto Rico, where he learned that the real \"Marvin Acevedo\" was currently detained in jail and had been since 2014 for narcotics related charges in Puerto Rico. Agent Huesman\n   knew the man in Puerto Rico was the real \"Marvin Acevedo\" because the social security number that was given to him by Detective Doubleday was a Puerto-Rican issued social security number. He stated that he had not been able to develop defendant's actual birth name because defendant had refused to talk to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   JPSO Detective Solomon Burke, accepted as an expert in the field of mobile device forensics, testified that he was currently assigned to the digital forensics division where he examines electronic evidence. Detective Burke testified that he received and examined three Samsung phones and one iPhone in the instant case. He was able to extract data from the Samsung phones but not the iPhone. Detective Burke asserted that he found no activity going farther back than thirty days and that none of the phones' data went back to February 27, 2017, or even prior to May of 2017. He said that the Samsung phones were \"dump\" or \"burner\" phones, disposable phones that could be purchased and activated without identifying information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   JPSO Detective Edgardo Castro, who was fluent in Spanish, identified State's Exhibit 33 as text messages from the phones in Spanish that he translated into English. Detective Castro identified the following incoming text message: \"Need price on china, ounce\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and indicated that was in English and did not need translating. He also identified the following text messages: \"Look, bro, he wants a 2, 8, 4, 3 p.m. Can you?\"; and \"Look, Marvin, I'm not going to speak to frogs anymore. I'll call you directly. Good night.\" Detective Castro testified that \"frog\" was another word for middleman. He also identified other text messages: \"Bro, did you mix the one you gave me today?\"; \"Bro, I want another eight.\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Bro, give me an eight.\"; \"I'm the bald one.\" (an outgoing message); \"Friend, this is Marvin. Call me.\" (an outgoing message); and \"Marvin, I'm Pablo. I'm calling you so you can come to my house to see the champions. I have no work. I took off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following defendant's arrest, on August 31, 2017, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant with possession of over 400 grams of cocaine in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(F).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was arraigned on September 5, 2017, and pled not guilty. He filed a Motion to Quash Bill of Information that was denied after a hearing on November 30, 2017. Defendant subsequently filed a writ application challenging this ruling, which this Court denied.\n   <em>\n    State v. Acevedo\n   </em>\n   , 17-K-708 (La. App. 5 Cir. 3/19/18) (unpublished writ disposition). He filed a writ application with the Louisiana Supreme Court challenging this Court's ruling. The Supreme Court denied the writ.\n   <em>\n    State v. Acevedo\n   </em>\n   , 18-619 (La. 5/25/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12669121,12669122,12669123\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/243/569/\">\n    243 So.3d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant filed a Motion to Suppress Evidence and Statement that were denied after a hearing on March 15, 2018. He thereafter filed a writ application challenging these rulings, which this Court denied.\n   <em>\n    State v. Acevedo\n   </em>\n   , 18-K-196 (La. App. 5 Cir. 6/1/18) (unpublished writ disposition). Defendant filed a writ application with the Louisiana Supreme Court challenging this\n   Court's ruling, who denied the writ.\n   <em>\n    State v. Acevedo\n   </em>\n   , 18-922 (La. 6/25/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12672456,12672457,12672458,12672455\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/246/578/\">\n    246 So.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On July 2, 2018, the State filed a notice of intent to use evidence of other crimes, which was granted at a hearing. Following that hearing, on July 9 and 10, 2018, the case was tried before a twelve-person jury, who found defendant guilty as charged. On August 8, 2018, defendant filed a Motion for New Trial and a Motion for Judgment of Acquittal that were denied on August 9, 2018. Afterwards, on August 9, 2018, defendant waived sentencing delays, and the trial court sentenced him to imprisonment at hard labor for twenty years and ordered him to pay a $ 50,000 fine. The trial court also ordered that sentence to run consecutively to the sentence in case number 17-3961. Defendant subsequently made an oral motion to reconsider sentence that was denied and an oral motion for appeal that was granted. On August 10, 2018, defendant filed a timely written Motion for Appeal that was granted. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, defendant argues the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1. The trial court erred in failing to grant defendant's Motion to Quash the bill of information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2. The trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress the statement allegedly made to police and the evidence seized from the storage unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   3. The trial court erred in failing to grant the motion to disclose the identity of the confidential informant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   4. The trial court erred in allowing the introduction of other crimes evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   5. The evidence presented by the State was insufficient to support the conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   6. La. C.Cr.P. art. 782(A), allowing for a non-unanimous jury verdict, is unconstitutional and requires reversal of the jury verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER FIVE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In this assignment, defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. He also argues that the evidence presented by the State was inconsistent, misleading, and inconclusive. Defendant contends that the information from the confidential informant that defendant would be transporting a large quantity of cocaine was incorrect, because there was no large quantity of cocaine in the truck in which he was riding. Further, defendant asserts that there was no physical evidence to connect him to the cocaine found inside of the storage unit and that it was shown that other people had access\n   to the storage unit. As a result, defendant maintains that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly and intentionally possessed over 400 grams of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The State responds that the evidence was sufficient under the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   standard to support defendant's conviction. It points out that defendant admitted that the cocaine found in the vehicle belonged to him and not to his passenger. The State contends that the evidence showed that defendant was in constructive possession of the cocaine found in the CubeSmart storage unit. It asserts that the jury obviously found that the State's witnesses were credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In reviewing the sufficiency of evidence, an appellate court must determine that the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, or a mixture of both, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact that all of the elements of the crime have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

The defendant had contended on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to convict him because the unit at the storage facility in which the cocaine was found was rented to Ms. Mathew, that the Mercedes in which the keys to the storage unit were found was registered to Ms. Mathew, and that there was no evidence establishing he actually entered the subject unit at the storage facility. The Court noted that the officers' testimony established that the defendant had visited the storage unit alone and had entered the building that contained the particular unit. After leaving the storage facility, the officers observed a hand-to-hand transaction between the defendant and an unknown male in a motel parking lot. After he was arrested, the defendant admitted that he had stored approximately a quarter kilogram of cocaine at the storage facility and that the keys to the storage facility were located inside the console of the Mercedes. The appellate court found that although the storage unit was rented by Ms. Mathew and she was the registered owner of the Mercedes in which the keys to the storage unit were kept, the evidence established that the defendant exercised dominion and control of the cocaine found in the storage facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In the instant case, Detective Doubleday testified that defendant admitted that the cocaine found inside of the magnetic box underneath the truck belonged to him and that Mr. Villareal was unaware of it. Additionally, the wallet that the detectives found in the truck contained an ID with defendant's name on it, the CubeSmart storage key, the CubeSmart access card with a storage unit number and a PIN on it, and a bag of cocaine. As previously noted, the officers went to the two CubeSmart storage facilities in that area and located the one where the access code worked. They searched the subject unit and found four kilos of cocaine inside of a cooler. Detective Doubleday testified that they also found documents with defendant's name on them inside of the cooler and a work shirt with defendant's name and his employer's name on it inside the storage unit. Nothing else in the storage unit contained any other names. Additionally, the State established that unit number 409 was rented in defendant's name, Detective Doubleday viewed video surveillance which showed defendant arriving at the storage facility two times; the records indicated that the storage unit was accessed sixteen times. Also, $ 3,359 was recovered from the vehicle in which defendant was riding in, and text messages indicated that defendant was selling drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The jury heard the testimony from the witnesses at trial and obviously found them to be credible.

Further, we find that the evidence established that defendant constructively possessed the cocaine found in unit number 409 of the storage facility, underneath the truck, and in defendant's wallet.

He further argues that in the instant case, as in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State opposed the motion to quash, arguing that the motion should be denied because it was well established that in Louisiana, the law in effect at the time a defendant committed his crime governs and that the facts in\n   <em>\n    Mayeux\n   </em>\n   were distinguishable.

This Court has already provided a detailed analysis of this issue and held that the law in effect at the time of the commission of the crime determines the sentence that a defendant must serve and that the legislature failed to use language in the amendment of La.

Furthermore, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied writs, declining to review this Court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Accordingly, we decline to reconsider our prior ruling on this issue.

He points out that at the time the search warrant was obtained, the officers were already aware that the confidential informant's information was unreliable, namely, that there was a minimal amount of cocaine in the truck even though the informant said that defendant would be transporting a \"large\" quantity of cocaine from Texas to Jefferson Parish. Further, defendant notes that the affidavit for the search warrant contained false information in that the affidavit says that a wallet was found with a storage access card containing the address of the storage facility, when in fact, this card does not contain an address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The State responds that the claims regarding the denial of the Motion to Suppress the Statement are procedurally barred from appellate review. It contends that defendant abandoned his Motion to Suppress the Statement by proceeding to trial without having a hearing on that motion. It further contends that the record is clear that defendant never argued at the trial court level the reasons that he now argues on appeal with regard to the suppression of his statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to Suppress Statement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The record reveals that there was a ruling on the motion to suppress statement and that it was preserved for appellate review. Defendant filed omnibus motions, including a motion to suppress statement. In that motion, defendant argued that the statements he made should be suppressed because they were obtained unlawfully and illegally as they were not made to officers freely and voluntarily, because defendant was not advised of his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   or because defendant had invoked his right to remain silent or to have an attorney and this right had not been honored. Also, defense counsel said prior to the hearing that the motions to be heard that day were the motions to suppress evidence and statement and that the witnesses for both were the same. Further, Detective Doubleday testified regarding issues surrounding the motion to suppress statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although defense counsel did not orally argue at the hearing regarding the motion\n   to suppress statement, his arguments were contained in the written motion filed prior to the hearing. Also, the trial court denied the \"motion to suppress,\" which arguably meant both motions. The record reflects that the trial court was aware that both motions were being heard that day as she said before testimony was taken, \"[s]o we're going to proceed on the motion to suppress evidence and the motion to suppress statement at this time.\" After hearing arguments of counsel, the trial judge said that she agreed with the State, that the correct location was searched, and that she was denying the \"motion to suppress.\" She did not specify whether she was denying the motion to suppress evidence, the motion to suppress statement, or both. Defense counsel said that he was going to take a writ \"just on the suppression of evidence portion, not the suppression of statements or anything along that line.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The district court's decision to deny a motion to suppress is afforded great weight and will not be set aside unless the preponderance of the evidence clearly favors suppression.\n   <em>\n    State v.

He argues that the confidential informant's information that defendant would be transporting a large quantity of cocaine was incorrect, that his defense was that the cocaine found in the storage unit did not belong to him, and that the identity of the confidential informant would have assisted him in presenting his defense. Defendant contends that the denial of his motion impinged upon his constitutional right to present his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The State responds that it is well settled that it is permitted to withhold the identity of a confidential informant from an accused pursuant to La. C.E. art. 514. It further responds that defendant has not met his burden of showing that the confidential informant played a crucial role in the underlying criminal transaction. The State points out that the trial court denied the motion because it was concerned that the life of the confidential informant would be endangered if his identity were made known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On December 4, 2017, defendant filed a Motion to Disclose Identity of Confidential Informant. In that motion, defendant argued that the confidential informant should be produced at a hearing or a trial, that the failure to disclose his identity would infringe upon the constitutional rights of the accused, that disclosure of the confidential informant's identity would be relevant and of demonstrably material benefit to defendant in establishing defendant's case, that the confidential informant was an integral part of the transaction, and that failure to disclose his identity would substantially prejudice his right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   At the hearing on the motion, at a bench conference, the State said that it had obtained information from multiple sources that defendant was actively trying to \"put a hit out\" on the confidential informant. Defense counsel argued that he was entitled to proceed on the motion. The trial judge stated that she was denying the motion outright based on the representations of the district attorney and because she believed that the life of the confidential informant would be endangered if this was pursued.

He further argues that evidence that he resisted arrest by refusing to provide his true identity was not relevant and confused the jury. Defendant contends that whether or not \"Marvin Acevedo\" was his real name was not material to proving that he had the intent to possess the cocaine seized from the storage unit. He also contends that this evidence was used to portray him in the worst possible light, especially considering the fact that currently there are frequent news stories regarding illegal aliens committing crimes in this country. Defendant asserts that the improper admission of this evidence prevented him from receiving a fair trial and contributed to the guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The State responds that the trial court did not err in admitting the other crimes evidence. It further responds that the purpose of the other crimes evidence was to show defendant's intent to possess the cocaine. The State explains that evidence that defendant failed to provide the trial court and law enforcement with his true identity was highly probative to the issue of intent and guilty knowledge, as well as his opportunity to transport and possess the cocaine and an absence of mistake or accident. The State further explains that the other crimes evidence was admissible as\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   evidence as it constituted an integral part of the crime. The State notes that because defendant refused to provide his true identity, it was necessary for the State to charge and try defendant under his alias, \"Marvin Acevedo.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On July 2, 2018, the State filed State's Notice of Intent to Offer Evidence of the Defendant's Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts Pursuant to La. C.E. Article 404(B). In that notice, the State argued that evidence pertaining to these other crimes was admissible for its independent relevance to show motive, intent, guilty knowledge, and to negate a claim of accident or mistake. The State also argued that such evidence was admissible because it constituted\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   in that the other crime or bad act forms an integral part of the police investigation. Additionally, the State said that it intended to conduct the misdemeanor judge trial for defendant's charge of violating La. R.S. 14:108, resisting an officer by refusing to provide his true identification, simultaneously with his jury trial for the possession of cocaine charge. It asserted\n   that in the interest of judicial economy and efficiency, since the same witnesses would be called to testify to the same facts at both trials, and the fact that defendant still had not provided his true identity, it was both relevant and conserved time and judicial resources.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State noted that without defendant's real name, it could not properly run his criminal history and investigate associations to organized crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defense counsel responded that the evidence did not show intent, motive, or guilty knowledge. He said that the State was able to run a \"rap\" sheet on defendant and was able to find that he had a DWI conviction. Defense counsel noted that defendant's paperwork indicated that he has been \"around for a while,\" which was evidenced by wage information from 2009 and 2010. He pointed out that the State is using evidence that defendant has not provided his true identity to show that he came into this country illegally. The State responded that it did not intend to offer evidence that defendant was an illegal alien and asserted that many people used fake names for multiple reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   After hearing arguments of counsel, the trial judge stated that she was going to allow the State's 404(B) evidence as she thought that it tended to show motive, guilty knowledge, and intent. The trial judge also stated that whether defendant decided to offer as an excuse that he used the false name to come into the country was the defense's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   At trial, during the cross-examination of Detective Doubleday, defense counsel asked him if he was able to find any convictions on defendant, and the detective responded negatively. After the cross-examination, during a bench conference, the State said that it was not intending to offer any evidence about defendant's identity, but that defense counsel had opened the door by asking the detective if he was able to find any convictions on defendant. The trial court agreed and allowed the evidence to come in. Thereafter, Detective Doubleday testified during re-direct examination by the State that defendant had been using the name \"Marvin Acevedo\" for years and that was the name that was on his ID card, the BP paperwork, the Entergy bill, the pay stub, and the tax returns. Detective Doubleday further testified that he later learned that was not defendant's real name and that he did not know defendant's real name. He stated that he could not run a complete \"rap\" sheet on defendant because he could not determine what defendant's real name was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Also, Agent Bryan Huesman of ICE testified at trial that he attempted to verify if defendant was the real \"Marvin Acevedo,\" discovering instead (as previously noted) that the real \"Marvin Acevedo\" had been detained since 2014 for narcotics related charges in Puerto Rico. He stated that he had not been able to develop defendant's actual birth name as defendant had refused to talk to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Generally, evidence of other crimes or bad acts committed by a criminal defendant is not admissible at trial.

Clearly, evidence of other crimes or bad acts is prejudicial since all evidence that tends to make it more probable than not that an individual committed a criminal offense is necessarily prejudicial.

The appellate court found that the introduction of the defendant's own exculpatory statements as to why he fled and gave a false name, combined with the cumulative effect of his testimony at trial, resulted in a showing that there was no substantial prejudice to his rights in the admission of this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In the instant case, defendant provided a false name to police when he was arrested, and he never provided his real name. Upon review, we find that the trial court did not err by admitting this evidence because it was part of one continuous transaction of the criminal act of possession of cocaine and the attempt to conceal his identity after being caught. Further, defense counsel \"opened the door\" to the testimony when he asked Detective Doubleday on cross-examination whether he was able to find any convictions for defendant. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the other crimes evidence in this case.

C.Cr.P. art. 782(A) and La. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 17 (A) generally provided that cases in which punishment is necessarily confinement at hard labor shall be tried by a jury composed of twelve jurors, ten of whom must concur to render a verdict. He notes that effective August 1, 2018, La. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 17 (A) and La. C.Cr.P. art. 782(A) were amended to generally provide that the verdict in such cases must be unanimous. This amendment also provided that it would apply prospectively. Defendant points out that on March 18, 2019, the United States Supreme Court granted the application for a writ of certiorari in \"\n   <em>\n    Ramos v.

Defendant contends that regardless of the prospective only effect of the amended legislation, and in light of the fact that the United States Supreme Court will consider this argument in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , the non-unanimous verdict rendered against him is a violation of due process and equal protection such that this verdict cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In the instant case, the date of the offense was on or between February 27, 2017 and June 20, 2017.

It is my opinion that Defendant's refusal to provide his real name did not prove a material issue or have independent relevance to the possession of cocaine over 400 grams trial, and the refusal was not an integral part of the act or transaction whereby the State could not present its case in the possession trial without reference to Defendant's refusal. I find that the admission of Defendant's refusal to provide his real name had the prejudicial effect of portraying him as an illegal immigrant, and that prejudicial effect outweighed any probative value the evidence may have had. Additionally, the State should not have been allowed to benefit from using the name \"Marvin Acevedo\" in linking Defendant to the CubeSmart storage unit for purposes of convicting him of possession of cocaine, then disregard that same evidence and argue \"Marvin Acevedo\" is not Defendant's true identity. However, I find that the error by the trial court was harmless because there was sufficient evidence presented to prove Defendant's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Therefore, I find the trial court erred in allowing the State to present evidence during the trial for possession of cocaine over 400 grams that Defendant resisted arrest by refusing to provide his true identity.
