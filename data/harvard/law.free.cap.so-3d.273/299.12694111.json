These documents are relevant to the issue of whether defendants properly filed the required notice with the Coast Guard following plaintiff's accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Accordingly, the writ is granted. The judgment of the district court is reversed,\n   and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Weimer, Guidry &amp; Clark, JJ., would deny.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
