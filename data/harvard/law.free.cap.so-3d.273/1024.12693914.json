Owens' petition for a writ of mandamus to the trial court in case number F98-43488. Our opinion included an order directing Owens to show cause why he should not be prohibited from further pro se filings related to Eleventh Judicial Circuit court case number F98-43488.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 26, 2018,\n   Owens filed his response to the order to show cause. We've considered Owens' response and conclude that he has failed to show sufficient good cause supporting his request to continue to file pro se appeals, petitions, motions or other pleadings in case number F98-43488.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
