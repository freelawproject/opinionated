The relevant portion of the order reads, in its entirety, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court reserves ruling on Plaintiffs' motion for rule to show cause and hereby enters an order freezing all of the assets of Esther Porto, as of the date of this order; an agreement and/or further orders shall be made as to an exception for living expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.610(c) requires, in relevant part, that \"[e]very injunction shall specify the reasons for entry\" and \"shall describe in reasonable detail the act or acts restrained without reference to a pleading or another document.\" Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.610(c). Additionally, rule 1.610(b) contains a bond requirement for all temporary injunctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We reverse the subject injunction order because it fails to meet the requisites of rule 1.610.\n   <em>\n    Indus. Waste Servs. Inc. v. Faircloth Sanitation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7457575\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/643/688/#p688\">\n    643 So.2d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688 (Fla. 3d DCA 1994) (concluding that \"[t]he injunction is defective because the order fails to specify the reasons for its entry\"). Because of our holding, we need not, and therefore do not, address the other alleged infirmities in the challenged injunction order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Reversed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
